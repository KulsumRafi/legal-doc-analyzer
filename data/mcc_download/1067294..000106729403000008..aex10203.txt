     Section 2.2 Revolving Loans.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein,  each Lender  severally  agrees to make Revolving Loans to the Borrower,
from time to time during the  Availability  Period,  in an  aggregate  principal

Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding such Lender's Revolving Commitment or (b)the
sum of the aggregate  Revolving  Credit  Exposures of all Lenders  exceeding the
Aggregate Revolving  Commitments.  During the Availability  Period, the Borrower
shall be entitled to borrow,  prepay and reborrow  Revolving Loans in accordance

Administrative  Agent written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in
writing) of each Revolving Borrowing substantially in the form of
<PAGE>

     Exhibit 2.3 attached  hereto (a "Notice of Revolving  Borrowing") (x) prior
to 11:00 a.m. one (1) Business Day prior to the requested date of each Base Rate
Borrowing  and  (y)prior  to 11:00  a.m.  three (3)  Business  Days prior to the
requested date of each Eurodollar Borrowing.  Each Notice of Revolving Borrowing
shall be irrevocable and shall specify:  (i) the aggregate  principal  amount of
such Borrowing, (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day),
(iii) the Type of such Revolving Loan  comprising such Borrowing and (iv) in the
case of a  Eurodollar  Borrowing,  the duration of the initial  Interest  Period
applicable  thereto  (subject to the  provisions  of the  definition of Interest
Period).  Each Revolving  Borrowing shall consist entirely of Base Rate Loans or
Eurodollar Loans, as the Borrower may request. The aggregate principal amount of
each  Eurodollar  Borrowing  shall be a minimum  of  $5,000,000  or an  integral
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof,  and the aggregate principal amount of
each Base  Rate  Borrowing  shall be a  minimum  of  $1,000,000  or an  integral
multiple  of  $100,000 in excess  thereof;  provided,  that Base Rate Loans made
pursuant  to Section  2.5 or Section  2.22(c)  may be made in lesser  amounts as

outstanding at any time exceed six.  Promptly  following the receipt of a Notice

Revolving Loan to be made as part of the requested Revolving Borrowing.

          Section 2.4 Swingline Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions

principal amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the lesser of (i) the
Swingline Commitment then in effect and (ii) the difference between the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposures of
all Lenders; provided, that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a
Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. The Borrower shall be
entitled to borrow, repay and reborrow Swingline Loans in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

         Section 2.5 Procedure for Swingline Borrowing; Etc

               (a)  The Borrower shall give the  Administrative  Agent written
         notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of each
         Swingline Borrowing ("Notice of Swingline  Borrowing") prior to 11:00
         a.m. on the requested date of each Swingline  Borrowing.  Each Notice
         of Swingline  Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify:
         (i) the principal amount of such Swingline Loan,  (ii) the date of such
         Swingline  Loan  (which  shall be a Business Day) and (iii) the account
         of the Borrower to which the proceeds of such Swingline Loan should be
         credited.  The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline
         Lender of each Notice of Swingline Borrowing. Each Swingline Loan shall
         accrue interest at the Swingline Rate and shall have an Interest Period
         (subject to the definition thereof) as agreed upon between the Borrower
         and the Swingline Lender.  The aggregate principal amount of each
         Swingline Loan shall be a minimum of $100,000 or an integral multiple
         of $100,000 in excess  thereof.  The Swingline Lender will make the
         proceeds of each Swingline Loan available to the Borrower in Dollars in
         immediately available funds at the account specified by the Borrower in
         the applicable Notice of Swingline Borrowing not later than 1:00 p.m.
         on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.
<PAGE>

               (b)  The Swingline Lender, at any time and from time to time in
         its sole discretion, may, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby
         irrevocably authorizes and directs the Swingline Lender to act on its
         behalf), give a Notice of Revolving Borrowing to the Administrative
         Agent requesting the Lenders (including the Swingline Lender) to make
         Base Rate Loans in an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of
         any Swingline Loan. Each Lender will make the proceeds of its Base Rate
         Loan included in such Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent
         for the account of the Swingline Lender in accordance with Section 2.6,
         which will be used solely for the repayment of such Swingline Loan.

               (c)  If for any reason a Base Rate Borrowing may not be (as
         determined in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent), or is
         not, made in accordance with the foregoing provisions, then each Lender
         (other than the Swingline  Lender) shall purchase an undivided
         participating  interest in such  Swingline Loan in an amount equal to
         its Pro Rata Share thereof on the date that such Base Rate Borrowing
         should have occurred.  On the date of such required  purchase, each
         Lender shall promptly transfer, in immediately available funds, the
         amount of its participating  interest to the Administrative  Agent for
         the account of the Swingline  Lender.  If such Swingline Loan bears
         interest at a rate other than the Base Rate, such Swingline Loan shall
         automatically become a Base Rate Loan on the effective date of any such
         participation and interest shall become payable on demand.

               (d)  Each Lender's obligation to make a Base Rate Loan pursuant
         to Section 2.5(b)or to purchase the participating interests pursuant to
         Section 2.5(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be
         affected by any circumstance, including without limitation (i) any
         setoff, counterclaim,  recoupment,  defense or other right that such
         Lender or any other Person may have or claim against the Swingline
         Lender,  the Borrower or any other Person for any reason  whatsoever,
         (ii) the existence of a Default or an Event of Default or the
         termination of any Lender's Revolving  Commitment,  (iii) the existence
         (or alleged existence) of any event or condition which has had or could
         reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,  (iv) any
         breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower,
         the Administrative Agent or any Lender or (v) any other circumstance,
         happening or event whatsoever,  whether or not similar to any of the
         foregoing.  If such amount is not in fact made available to the
         Swingline Lender by any Lender,  the Swingline Lender shall be entitled
         to recover such amount on demand from such Lender, together with
         accrued interest thereon for each day from the date of demand thereof
         at the Federal Funds Rate.  Until such time as such Lender makes its
         required payment, the Swingline Lender shall be deemed to continue to
         have outstanding Swingline Loans in the amount of the unpaid
         participation for all purposes of the Loan Documents.  In addition,
         such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments made
         of principal and interest on its Loans and any other amounts due to it
         hereunder,  to the Swingline Lender to fund the amount of such Lender's
         participation interest in such Swingline Loans that such Lender failed
         to fund pursuant to this Section, until such amount has been purchased
         in full.
<PAGE>

         Section 2.6 Funding of Borrowings

               (a) Each Lender will make available each Loan to be made by it
         hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer in immediately
         available funds by 1:00 p.m. to the Administrative Agent at the Payment
         Office; provided, that the Swingline Loans will be made as set forth in
         Section 2.5. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to
         the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts that it receives, in
         like funds by the close of business on such proposed date, to an
         account maintained by the Borrower with the Administrative Agent or at
         the Borrower's option, by effecting a wire transfer of such amounts to
         an account designated by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent.

               (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by
         any Lender prior to 5 p.m. one (1)  Business Day prior to the date of a
         Borrowing in which such Lender is participating that such Lender will
         not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of
         such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender
         has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such
         date, and the Administrative Agent, in reliance on such assumption,
         may make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.
         If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the
         Administrative Agent by such Lender on the date of such Borrowing,
         the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such
         corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with interest
         at the Federal Funds Rate for up to two (2) days and thereafter at the
         rate specified for such Borrowing.  If such Lender does not pay such
         corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand
         therefor,  the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower,
         and the Borrower  shall  immediately  pay such  corresponding amount to
         the Administrative Agent together with interest at the rate specified
         for such Borrowing.  Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to
         relieve any Lender from its obligation to fund its Pro Rata Share of
         any Borrowing hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the Borrower
         may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender
         hereunder.

               (c)  All Revolving Borrowings shall be made by the Lenders on the
         basis of their respective Pro Rata Shares. No Lender shall be
         responsible for any default by any other Lender in its obligations
         hereunder, and each Lender shall be obligated to make its Loans
         provided to be made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any
         other Lender to make its Loans hereunder.
<PAGE>

         Section 2.7  Interest Elections.

               (a)  Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in
         the applicable Notice of Borrowing, and in the case of a Eurodollar
         Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
         Notice of Borrowing.  Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert
         such Borrowing into a different Type or to continue such Borrowing, and
         in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods
         therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect
         different options with respect to different portions of the affected
         Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably
         among the Lenders holding Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the
         Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate
         Borrowing.  This Section shall NOT apply to Swingline Borrowings, which
         may not be converted or continued.

               (b)  To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower
         shall give the Administrative Agent prior written notice (or telephonic
         notice promptly confirmed in writing) of each Borrowing (a "Notice of
         Conversion/Continuation")  that is to be converted or continued, as the
         case may be, (x) prior to 11:00 a.m. one (1) Business Day prior to the
         requested date of a conversion into a Base Rate Borrowing and (y) prior
         to 11:00 a.m.  three (3) Business  Days prior to a  continuation  of or
         conversion into a Eurodollar Borrowing.  Each such Notice of
         Conversion/Continuation shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) the
         Borrowing to which such Notice of Continuation/Conversion applies and
         if different options are being elected with respect to different
         portions  thereof,  the portions thereof that are to be allocated to
         each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified
         pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) shall be specified for each
         resulting  Borrowing);  (ii) the effective date of the election made
         pursuant to such Notice of Continuation/Conversion, which shall be a
         Business Day,  (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be a Base
         Rate Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;  and (iv) if the resulting
         Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar Borrowing,  the Interest Period
         applicable thereto after giving effect to such election,  which shall
         be a period contemplated by the definition of "Interest  Period."  If
         any such Notice of Continuation/Conversion requests a Eurodollar
         Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, the Borrower shall
         be deemed to have selected an Interest  Period of one month.  The
         principal amount of any resulting Borrowing shall satisfy the minimum
         borrowing amount for Eurodollar Borrowings and Base Rate Borrowings set
         forth in Section 2.3.

               (c)  If, on the expiration of any Interest Period in respect of
         any Eurodollar Borrowing, the Borrower shall have failed to deliver a
         Notice of Conversion/ Continuation, then, unless such Borrowing is
         repaid as provided herein, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected
         to convert such Borrowing to a Base Rate Borrowing. No Borrowing may be
         converted into, or continued as, a Eurodollar Borrowing if a Default or
         an Event of Default exists, unless the Administrative Agent and each of
         the Lenders shall have otherwise consented in writing. No conversion of
         any Eurodollar Loans shall be permitted except on the last day of the
         Interest Period in respect thereof.

               (d)  Upon receipt of any Notice of Conversion/Continuation, the
         Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the details
         thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

         Section 2.8  Optional Reduction and Termination of Commitments.

               (a)  Unless previously terminated, all Revolving Commitments
         shall terminate on the Commitment Termination Date.

               (b)  Upon at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice
         (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the
         Administrative Agent (which notice shall be irrevocable), the Borrower
         may reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments in part or terminate the
         Aggregate Revolving Commitments in whole; provided, that (i)any partial
         reduction shall apply to reduce proportionately and permanently the
         Revolving Commitment of each Lender (but shall not reduce the Swingline
         Commitment),  (ii) the amount of any partial reduction pursuant to this
         Section 2.8 shall be a minimum amount of $5,000,000 or an integral
         multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (iii) no such reduction
         shall be permitted which would reduce the Aggregate Revolving
         Commitments to an amount less than the then outstanding Revolving
         Credit Exposures of all Lenders.  Any such reduction in the Aggregate
         Revolving Commitments shall result in a proportionate reduction
         (rounded to the next lowest integral multiple of $100,000) in the LC
         Commitment.

         Section 2.9  Repayment of Loans.

               (a) The outstanding principal amount of all Revolving Loans shall
         be due and payable (together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon)
         on the Commitment Termination Date.

               (b) The principal amount of each Swingline Borrowing shall be due
         and payable (together with accrued interest thereon) on the earlier of
         (i) the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing
         and (ii) the Commitment Termination Date.

         Section 2.10  Evidence of Indebtedness.

               (a)  Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
         practice appropriate records evidencing the indebtedness of the
         Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender
         from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest
         payable thereon and paid to such Lender from time to time under this
         Agreement.  The Administrative Agent shall maintain appropriate records
         in which shall be recorded (i) the Revolving Commitment of each Lender,
         (ii) the amount of each Loan made hereunder by each Lender, the Class
         and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable  thereto, (iii) the
         date of each  continuation thereof pursuant to Section 2.7, (iv) the
         date of each conversion of all or a portion thereof to another Type
         pursuant to Section  2.7,  (v) the date and amount of any  principal or
         interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower
         to each Lender hereunder in respect of such Loans and (vi) both the
         date and amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent
         hereunder from the Borrower in respect of the Loans and each Lender's
         Pro Rata Share thereof.  The entries made in such records shall be
         prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of
         the Borrower therein recorded;  provided,  that the failure or delay of
         any Lender or the Administrative Agent in maintaining or making entries
         into any such record or any error therein shall not in any manner
         affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans (both
         principal and unpaid accrued interest) of such Lender in accordance
         with the terms of this Agreement.
<PAGE>

               (b)  The Borrower agrees that it will execute and deliver to each
         Lender a Revolving Credit Note, and, in the case of the Swingline
         Lender only, a Swingline Note, payable to the order of such Lender.

     Section 2.11 Optional Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right at any
time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing, in whole or in part, without
premium or penalty,  by giving irrevocable  written notice (or telephonic notice
promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative  Agent no later than (i) in
the case of  prepayment  of any  Eurodollar  Borrowing,  11:00  a.m.  three  (3)
Business Days prior to any such  prepayment;  (ii) in the case of any prepayment
of any  Base  Rate  Borrowing,  one  Business  Day  prior  to the  date  of such
prepayment;  and (iii) in the case of  Swingline  Borrowings,  11:00 a.m. on the
date of such prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify
the proposed date of such prepayment and the principal  amount of each Borrowing
or  portion  thereof  to be  prepaid.  Upon  receipt  of any  such  notice,  the
Administrative  Agent shall promptly notify each affected Lender of the contents
thereof  and of such  Lender's  Pro Rata Share of any such  prepayment.  If such
notice is given,  the aggregate amount specified in such notice shall be due and
payable on the date designated in such notice, together with accrued interest to
such date on the amount so prepaid in accordance with Section 2.12(e); provided,
that if a  Eurodollar  Borrowing is prepaid on a date other than the last day of
an Interest Period applicable  thereto,  the Borrower shall also pay all amounts
required pursuant to Section 2.18. Each partial  prepayment of any Eurodollar or
Base  Rate Loan  shall be in a minimum  amount  of  $5,000,000  and in  integral
multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall
be applied ratably to the Loans comprising such Borrowing.

         Section 2.12  Interest on Loans.

               (a)  The Borrower shall pay interest on each Base Rate Loan at
         the Base Rate in effect from time to time and on each Eurodollar Loan
         at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the applicable Interest Period in effect
         for such Eurodollar Loan, plus, the Applicable Margin in effect from
         time to time. Interest on the principal amount of all Loans shall
         accrue from and including the date such Loans are made to but excluding
         the date of any repayment thereof.

               (b) The Borrower shall pay interest on each Swingline Loan at the
         Swingline Rate in effect from time to time.

               (c) While an Event of Default exists or after acceleration, at
         the option of the Required Lenders, the Borrower shall pay interest
         ("Default Interest") with respect to all Eurodollar Loans at the rate
         otherwise applicable for the then-current Interest Period plus an
         additional 2% per annum until the last day of such Interest Period, and
         thereafter, and with respect to all Base Rate Loans (including all
         Swingline Loans) and all other Obligations hereunder (other than
         Loans), at an all-in rate in effect for Base Rate Loans, plus an
         additional 2% per annum.
<PAGE>

               (d)  (i) Interest on all outstanding Base Rate Loans shall be
         payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March,
         June, September and December and on the Commitment Termination Date.
         (ii) Interest on all outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be payable on
         the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto, and, in the
         case of any Eurodollar Loans having an Interest Period in excess of
         three months or 90 days, respectively, on each day which occurs every
         three months or 90 days, as the case may be, after the initial date of
         such Interest Period,  and on the Commitment Termination  Date. (iii)
         Interest on each Swingline Loan shall be payable on the maturity date
         of such Loan, which shall be the last day of the Interest Period
         applicable thereto,  and on the Commitment Termination Date.
         (iv) Interest on any Loan which is converted into a Loan of another
         Type or which is repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such
         conversion or on the date of any such repayment or prepayment (on the
         amount repaid or prepaid) thereof. All Default Interest shall be
         payable on demand.

               (e)  The Administrative Agent shall determine each interest rate
         applicable to the Loans hereunder and shall promptly notify the
         Borrower and the Lenders of such rate in writing (or by telephone,
         promptly confirmed in writing). Any such determination shall be
         conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         Section 2.13  Fees.

               (a)  Administrative Agent. The Borrower shall pay to the
         Administrative Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and at the
         times previously agreed upon by the Borrower and the Administrative
         Agent.

               (b)  Commitment Fee.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee,
         which shall accrue at the Applicable Percentage (determined  daily in
         accordance with Schedule I) on the daily amount of the unused Revolving
         Commitment of such Lender during the Availability Period, provided,
         that if such Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure
         after the Commitment Termination Date, then the commitment fee shall
         continue to accrue on the amount of such Lender's unused Revolving
         Commitment from and after the Commitment Termination Date to the date
         that all of such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure has been paid in
         full.  Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the
         last  Business  Day of each  March,  June, September and December of
         each year and on the Commitment Termination  Date, commencing on the
         first such date after the Closing Date, provided further, that any
         commitment fees accruing after the Commitment Termination Date shall be
         payable on demand.  For purposes of calculating the commitment fee, LC
         Exposure will be deemed usage of the Revolving Commitment, but
         outstanding Swingline Exposure will not.

               (c)  Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the
         Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, a letter of
         credit fee with respect to its  participation in each Letter of Credit,
         which shall accrue at the Applicable Percentage then in effect on the
         average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any
         portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements)
         attributable to such Letter of Credit during the period from and
         including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to but
         excluding the date on which such Letter expires or is drawn in full and


<PAGE>

         (ii) to the Issuing  Bank for its own  account a fronting fee,  which
         shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the average daily
         amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable
         to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the Availability Period (or
         until the date that such Letter of Credit is irrevocably  canceled,
         whichever is later),  as well as the Issuing  Bank's  standard fees
         with  respect to issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any
         Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Accrued letter
         of credit fees shall be payable in arrears on the last Business Day of
         each March,  June,  September and December of each year and on the
         Commitment Termination Date, commencing on the first such date after
         the Closing Date.

     Section 2.14 Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest
and fees  hereunder  shall be made on the basis of a year of 360  days,  in each
case for the actual  number of days  (including  the first day but excluding the
last day)  occurring  in the period for which such  interest or fees are payable
(to the extent computed on the basis of days elapsed). Each determination by the
Administrative  Agent of an interest  amount or fee  hereunder  shall be made in
good faith and,  except  for  manifest  error,  shall be final,  conclusive  and
binding for all purposes.

     Section  2.15  Inability  to  Determine  Interest  Rates.  If  prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Borrowing,

               (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
                   determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the
                   Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the
                   relevant interbank market, adequate means do not exist for
                   ascertaining LIBOR for such Interest Period, or

               (ii)the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
                   Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate does not
                   adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or
                   Lender, as the case may be) of making, funding or maintaining
                   their (or its, as the case may be) Eurodollar Loans for such
                   Interest Period,

the Administrative Agent shall give written notice (or telephonic notice,
promptly confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and to the Lenders as soon as
practicable thereafter. In the case of Eurodollar Loans, until the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) the obligations of
the Lenders to make Eurodollar Revolving Loans or to continue or convert
outstanding Loans as or into Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended and (ii) all
such affected Loans shall be converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day of
the then current Interest Period applicable thereto unless the Borrower prepays
such Loans in accordance with this Agreement. Unless the Borrower notifies the
Administrative Agent at least one Business Day before the date of any Eurodollar
Revolving Borrowing for which a Notice of Revolving Borrowing has previously
been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, then such Revolving
Borrowing shall be made as a Base Rate Borrowing.
<PAGE>

     Section  2.16  Illegality.  If any Change in Law shall make in  unlawful or
impossible for any Lender to make, maintain or fund any Eurodollar Loan and such
Lender shall so notify the Administrative  Agent, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly give notice  thereof to the Borrower and the other  Lenders,  whereupon
until such Lender  notifies the  Administrative  Agent and the Borrower that the
circumstances  giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of
such  Lender to make  Eurodollar  Revolving  Loans,  or to  continue  or convert
outstanding Loans as or into Eurodollar Loans,  shall be suspended.  In the case
of the making of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing,  such Lender's Revolving Loan
shall be made as a Base Rate Loan as part of the same  Revolving  Borrowing  for
the  same  Interest  Period  and  if  the  affected   Eurodollar  Loan  is  then
outstanding,  such Loan shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan either (i) on the
last day of the then current Interest Period  applicable to such Eurodollar Loan
if such Lender may lawfully  continue to maintain such Loan to such date or (ii)
immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully  continue to
maintain such Eurodollar Loan to such date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the
affected Lender shall, prior to giving such notice to the Administrative  Agent,
designate a different  Applicable Lending Office if such designation would avoid
the need for giving such notice and if such  designation  would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender in the good faith exercise of its discretion.

         Section 2.17  Increased Costs.

           (a) If any Change in Law shall:

              (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit
            or similar requirement that is not otherwise included in the
            determination of the Adjusted LIBO Rate hereunder against
            assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
            extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement
            reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

             (ii) impose on any Lender or on the Issuing Bank or the eurodollar
            interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement
            or any Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of
            Credit or any participation therein;

     and the result of the  foregoing  is to increase the cost to such Lender of
making,  converting  into,  continuing or  maintaining  a Eurodollar  Loan or to
increase  the cost to such Lender or the  Issuing  Bank of  participating  in or
issuing any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount  received or  receivable by
such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any
other amount),  then the Borrower  (subject to the applicable  Lender taking the
measures  required by Section 2.21) shall promptly pay, upon written notice from
and demand by such Lender on the Borrower (with a copy of such notice and demand
to the  Administrative  Agent), to the  Administrative  Agent for the account of
such Lender, within five Business Days after the date of such notice and demand,
an additional  amount or amounts  sufficient  to  compensate  such Lender or the
Issuing  Bank,  as the  case may be,  for  such  additional  costs  incurred  or
reduction suffered, provided, however, that upon receipt of notice from a Lender
claiming  compensation  pursuant to this Section 2.17(a) and so long as no Event
of Default shall have occurred and be  continuing,  the Borrower  shall have the
right,  on or before the 30th day after receipt of such notice,  to convert each
Eurodollar  Borrowing  under which such Lender has a Commitment into a Base Rate
Borrowing, subject to payment in full of (i) all amounts necessary to compensate
such  Lender for such  increased  costs and (ii) any amounts  owing  pursuant to
Section 2.18 as a result of such conversion.
<PAGE>

           (b)  If any Lender or the Issuing Bank shall have determined that on
         or after the date of this Agreement any Change in Law regarding capital
         requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
         return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital (or on the
         capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's parent corporation) as a
         consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any
         Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing
         Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing  Bank's parent corporation could
         have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration
         such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies or the policies of such
         Lender's or the Issuing Bank's parent corporation with respect to
         capital adequacy) then, from time to time, within five (5) Business
         Days after receipt by the Borrower of written demand by such Lender
         (with a copy thereof to the Administrative Agent),  the Borrower shall
         pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such
         Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
         parent corporation for any such reduction suffered.

           (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the
         amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing
         Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's parent corporation, as the
         case may be, specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be
         delivered to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and
         shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay any
         such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such amount or
         amounts within 10 days after receipt thereof.

           (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to
         demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a
         waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such
         compensation.

     Section  2.18  Funding  Indemnity.  In the event of (a) the  payment of any
principal of a Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable  thereto  (including  as a result  of an Event of  Default),  (b) the
conversion or  continuation  of a Eurodollar  Loan other than on the last day of
the Interest Period  applicable  thereto,  or (c) the failure by the Borrower to
borrow, prepay, convert or continue any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in
any  applicable  notice  (regardless  of whether  such  notice is  withdrawn  or
revoked),  then, in any such event,  the Borrower shall  compensate each Lender,
within five (5) Business  Days after  written  demand from such Lender,  for any
loss,  cost or expense  attributable  to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar
Loan, such loss, cost or expense shall be deemed to include an amount determined
by such  Lender to be the excess,  if any,  of (A) the amount of  interest  that
would have accrued on the principal amount of such Eurodollar Loan if such event
had not occurred at the Adjusted LIBO Rate  applicable to such  Eurodollar  Loan
for the period  from the date of such event to the last day of the then  current
Interest  Period  therefor  (or in the case of a failure to  borrow,  convert or
continue,  for the  period  that would  have been the  Interest  Period for such
Eurodollar  Loan)  over (B) the  amount of  interest  that  would  accrue on the
principal  amount of such  Eurodollar  Loan for the same period if the  Adjusted
LIBO Rate were set on the date such  Eurodollar Loan was prepaid or converted or
the date on which the  Borrower  failed to  borrow,  convert  or  continue  such
Eurodollar  Loan. A certificate as to any  additional  amount payable under this
Section 2.18 submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive, absent
manifest error.
<PAGE>

         Section 2.19  Taxes.

           (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the
         Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without
         deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided, that if
         the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other
         Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased
         as necessary so that after making all required deductions
         (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
         Section) the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank
         (as the case may be) shall receive an amount equal to the sum it would
         have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall
         make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount
         deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
         applicable law.

           (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
         relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

           (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each
         Lender and the Issuing Bank, within thirty (30) days after written
         demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other
         Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing
         Bank,  as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on
         account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including
         Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable
         to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties,  interest and
         reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether
         or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
         imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A
         certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to
         the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank,  or by the Administrative
         Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing  Bank,
         shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

           (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
         Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower
         shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, or for the account of such
         Lender, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a
         receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment,
         a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such
         payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

           (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
         reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which
         the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a
         party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to
         the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or
         times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and
         executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably
         requested by the  Borrower as will  permit such  payments  to be made
         without withholding or at a reduced  rate.  Without limiting the
         generality of the foregoing,  each Foreign Lender agrees that it will
         deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (or in the case of
         a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall
         have been purchased) two (2) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue
         Service Form 1001 or 4224,  or any successor form thereto, as the case
         may be, certifying in each case that such Foreign Lender is entitled to
         receive payments made by the Borrower hereunder and under the Notes
         payable to it, without deduction or withholding of any United States
<PAGE>

         federal income taxes and (ii) a duly completed Internal Revenue Service
         Forms W-8 or W-9, or any successor form thereto, as the case may be, to
         establish an exemption from United State backup withholding tax.  Each
         such Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent such forms on or before the date that it becomes a
         party to this Agreement (or in the case of a Participant, on or before
         the date such Participant purchases the related participation).  In
         addition, each such Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the
         obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such
         Lender.  Each such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent at any time that it determines that it is no
         longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate
         to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S.
         taxing authorities for such purpose).

           (f) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to
         provide the Borrower or the Administrative Agent with the appropriate
         form, certificate or other document described in subsection (e) above
         (other than if such failure is due to a Change in Law),  such Lender
         shall not be entitled to indemnification under subsection (a) or (c) of
         this Section 2.19 with respect to Taxes  imposed by the United States
         by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a Lender
         become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form,
         certificate or other document required hereunder,  the Borrower shall
         take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such
         Lender to recover such Taxes.  For purposes of this Section 2.19, the
         entry into force of the final U.S. Department of Treasury  regulations
         promulgated under Sections 1441 and  1442 of the Internal Revenue Code,
         published but not yet effective as of the date of this Agreement,  will
         not be considered a Change in Law.
<PAGE>

         Section 2.20 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs


           (a) The  Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
         hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC
         Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.17, 2.18 or 2.19,
         or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., on the date when due, in immediately
         available funds, without setoff or counterclaim.  Any amounts received
         after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
         Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next
         succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.
         All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the
         Payment Office,  except payments to be made directly to the Issuing
         Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that
         payments pursuant to Sections 2.17, 2.18 and 2.19 and 10.3 shall be
         made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative
         Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account
         of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following
         receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that
         is not a Business  Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the
         next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing
         interest, interest thereon shall be made payable for the period of such
         extension.  All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars.

           (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available
         to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
         unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder,
         such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and
         fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
         accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such
         parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed
         LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled
         thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC
         Disbursements then due to such parties.

           (c)  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or
         counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal
         of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC
         Disbursements or Swingline Loans that would result in such Lender
         receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of
         its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and
         Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion
         received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater
         proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)  participations  in
         the Revolving Loans and  participations  in LC  Disbursements  and
         Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the
         benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
         accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued
         interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC
         Disbursements and Swingline Loans;  provided,  that (i) if any such
         participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment
         giving rise thereto is recovered,  such participations shall be
         rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such
         recovery,  without interest,  and (ii) the  provisions  of this
         paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the
         Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
         Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
         assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or
         participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to any assignee
         or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
<PAGE>

         Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall
         apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the
         extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender
         acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may
         exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with
         respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct
         creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

           (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
         the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank
         hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the
         Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment
         on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such
         assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case
         may be, the amount or amounts due. In such event, if the Borrower has
         not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing
         Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the
         Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to
         such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from
         and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but
         excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the
         greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by
         the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
         interbank compensation.

           (e)  If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made
         by it pursuant to Section 2.5(b), 2.22(c) or (d), 2.20(d) or 10.3(d),
         then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding
         any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received
         by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy
         such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such
         unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

         Section 2.21  Mitigation of Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

           (a)  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.17, or if
         the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or
         any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
         Section 2.19, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to
         designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans
         hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another
         of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment
         of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or
         reduce amounts payable under Section 2.17 or Section 2.19, as the case
         may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any
         unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous
         to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all costs and
         expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with such designation or
         assignment.

           (b) If any Lender (a "Subject  Lender") makes demand upon the
         Borrower for (or if the Borrower is otherwise required to pay) amounts
         pursuant to Section 2.17(a) or (b) or Section 2.19 or gives notice
         pursuant to Section  2.15(ii) or 2.16 requiring a conversion of such
<PAGE>

         Subject Lender's Eurodollar Borrowings to Base Rate Borrowings or
         suspending such Lender's obligation to make Loans as, or to convert or
         continue Loans into or as, Eurodollar Borrowings,  the Borrower, may,
         within 90 days of receipt by the Borrower of such demand or notice (or
         the occurrence of such other event causing the Borrower to be required
         to pay such compensation),  as the case may be, give notice (a
         "Replacement Notice") in writing to the Administrative Agent and such
         Subject Lender of its intention  to replace such Subject Lender with a
         financial institution (a "Replacement Lender")  designated in such
         Replacement Notice.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall, in the
         exercise of its reasonable discretion and within 30 days of its receipt
         of such Replacement Notice, notify the Borrower and such Subject Lender
         in writing that the designated financial institution is unsatisfactory
         to the Administrative Agent (such denial not being available to the
         Administrative Agent where the Replacement Lender is already a Lender),
         then such Subject Lender shall, subject to the payment of any amounts
         due pursuant to Section 2.17(a) and (b) and Section 2.19 assign, in
         accordance with Section 10.4, all of its Commitments,  Loans,  Notes
         and other rights and obligations under this Agreement and all other
         Loan Documents to the Replacement Lender;  provided,  however,  that
         (i) such assignment shall be without recourse, representation or
         warranty and (ii) the purchase price paid by such designated financial
         institution shall be in at least the amount of such Subject Lender's
         Loans, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and fees in
         respect thereof, plus all other amounts (including the amounts demanded
         and unreimbursed under Sections 2.17(a) and (b) and Section 2.19) owing
         to such Subject Lender  hereunder.  Upon the effective date of an
         assignment described above, the Borrower shall issue a replacement
         Note or Notes,  as the case may be, to such  Replacement Lender, which
         shall become a "Lender" for all purposes under this Agreement and the
         other Loan Documents.
<PAGE>

         Section 2.22  Letters of Credit.

           (a) During the Availability Period, the Issuing Bank, in reliance
         upon the agreements of the other Lenders pursuant to Section 2.22(d),
         agrees to issue, at the request of the Borrower, Letters of Credit for
         the account of the Borrower on the terms and conditions hereinafter set
         forth;  provided, that (i) each Letter of Credit shall expire on the
         earlier of (A) the date one year after the date of issuance of such
         Letter of Credit (or in the case of any renewal or extension  thereof,
         one year after such renewal or extension) and (B) the date that is five
         (5) Business Days prior to the Commitment Termination Date;  (ii) each
         Letter of Credit shall be in a stated amount of at least $50,000; (iii)
         the Borrower may not request any Letter of Credit, if, after giving
         effect to such issuance (A) the aggregate LC Exposure would exceed the
         LC Commitment or (B) the aggregate LC Exposure, plus the aggregate
         outstanding Revolving Loans of all Lenders would exceed the Aggregate
         Revolving Commitments;  and (iv) there is no continuing Event of
         Default hereunder.  Upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit each
         Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
         agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Bank without recourse a
         participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Pro Rata
         Share of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter
         of Credit.  Each issuance of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to
         utilize the Revolving Commitment of each Lender by an amount equal to
         the amount of such participation.
<PAGE>

           (b) To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or any  amendment,
         renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower
         shall give the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent irrevocable
         written notice at least two (2) Business Days prior to the requested
         date of such issuance specifying the date (which shall be a Business
         Day) such Letter of Credit is to be issued (or amended, extended or
         renewed, as the case may be), the expiration date of such Letter of
         Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of
         the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be
         necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. In
         addition to the satisfaction of the conditions in Article III,  the
         issuance of such Letter of Credit (or any amendment which increases the
         amount of such Letter of Credit) will be subject to the further
         conditions that such Letter of Credit shall be in such form and contain
         such terms as the Issuing Bank shall approve and that the Borrower
         shall have executed and delivered any additional applications,
         agreements and instruments relating to such Letter of Credit as the
         Issuing Bank shall reasonably require;  provided,  that in the event
         of any conflict between such applications, agreements or instruments
         and this Agreement,  the terms of this Agreement shall control.

           (c) Upon receipt of Borrower's notice under Section 2.22(b), the
         Issuing Bank will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone
         or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received such notice
         and if not, the Issuing Bank will provide the Administrative Agent with
         a copy thereof.  Unless the Issuing Bank has received notice from the
         Administrative Agent on or before the Business Day immediately
         preceding the date the Issuing Bank is to issue the requested Letter of
         Credit (1) directing the Issuing Bank not to issue the Letter of Credit
         because such issuance is not then permitted hereunder because of the
         limitations set forth in Section 2.22(a) or that one or more conditions
         specified in Article III are not then satisfied, then, subject to the
         terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Bank shall, on the requested
         date, issue such Letter of Credit in accordance with the Issuing Bank's
         usual and customary business practices.

           (d)  The Issuing Bank shall examine all documents purporting to
         represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit  promptly
         following  its receipt  thereof.  The Issuing Bank shall notify the
         Borrower and the  Administrative  Agent of such demand for payment and
         whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make a LC Disbursement
         thereunder;  provided,  that any failure to give or delay in giving
         such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
         reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to such LC
         Disbursement.  The Borrower shall be irrevocably and unconditionally
         obligated to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursements paid
         by the Issuing Bank in respect of such drawing,  without presentment,
         demand or other formalities of any kind.  Unless the Borrower shall
         have notified the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent prior to
         11:00 a.m. on the Business Day immediately prior to the date on which
         such drawing is honored that the Borrower intends to reimburse the
         Issuing Bank for the amount of such drawing in funds other than from
         the proceeds of Revolving Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have
         timely given a Notice of Revolving Borrowing to the Administrative
         Agent requesting the Lenders to make a Base Rate Borrowing on the date
         on which such drawing is honored in an exact amount due to the Issuing
         Bank; provided, that for purposes solely of such Borrowing, the
         conditions precedents set forth in Section 3.2 hereof shall not be
         applicable.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of such
         Borrowing in accordance with Section  2.3,  and each Lender shall make
         the proceeds of its Base Rate Loan included in such Borrowing available
         to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank in
         accordance with Section 2.6.  The proceeds of such Borrowing shall be
         applied directly by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing
         Bank for such LC Disbursement.
<PAGE>

           (e)  If for any reason a Base Rate Borrowing may not be (as
         determined in the sole discretion of the Administrative  Agent), or is
         not, made in accordance  with the foregoing  provisions,  then each
         Lender (other than the Issuing Bank) shall be obligated to fund the
         participation that such Lender purchased pursuant to subsection (a) in
         an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of such LC Disbursement on and as
         of the date which such Base Rate Borrowing should have occurred.  Each
         Lender's obligation to fund its participation shall be absolute and
         unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including
         without limitation (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or
         other right that such Lender or any other Person may have against the
         Issuing Bank or any other Person for any reason  whatsoever, (ii) the
         existence of a Default or an Event of Default or the termination of the
         Aggregate Revolving Commitments, (iii) any adverse change in the
         condition  (financial or otherwise) of the  Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries, (iv) any breach of this Agreement by the  Borrower or any
         other Lender, (v) any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of
         Credit or (vi) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever,
         whether or not similar to any of the  foregoing.  On the date that such
         participation is required to be funded, each Lender shall promptly
         transfer, in immediately available funds, the amount of its
         participation to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
         Issuing Bank.  Whenever, at any time after the Issuing Bank has
         received from any such Lender the funds for its participation in a LC
         Disbursement,  the Issuing Bank (or the Administrative Agent on its
         behalf) receives any payment on account thereof, the Administrative
         Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, will  distribute to such
         Lender its Pro Rata Share of such  payment;  provided,  that if such
         payment is required to be returned for any reason to the Borrower or to
         a trustee, receiver,  liquidator,  custodian or similar official in any
         bankruptcy proceeding, such Lender will return to the Administrative
         Agent or the Issuing Bank any portion thereof previously distributed by
         the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank to it.

           (f)  To the extent that any Lender shall fail to pay any amount
         required to be paid pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section 2.22 on
         the due date therefor, such Lender shall pay interest to the Issuing
         Bank (through the Administrative Agent) on such amount from such due
         date to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the
         Federal Funds Rate; provided, that if such Lender shall fail to make
         such payment to the Issuing Bank within three (3) Business Days of such
         due date, then, retroactively to the due date, such Lender shall be
         obligated to pay interest on such amount at the Default Rate.

           (g) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the
         Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative
         Agent or the Required Lenders demanding the deposit of cash  collateral
         pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account
         with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent
<PAGE>

         and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC
         Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
         provided, that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall
         become effective immediately,  and such deposit shall become
         immediately due and payable, without demand or notice of any kind, upon
         the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower
         described in clause (g) or (h) of Section 8.1. Such deposit shall be
         held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and
         performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement.
         The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control,
         including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.  Other
         than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which
         investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the
         Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk and expense, such
         deposits shall not bear interest.  Interest and profits, if any, on
         such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Moneys in such
         account shall applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the
         Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it had not been reimbursed
         and to the extent so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the
         reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such
         time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, with the
         consent of the Required Lenders, be applied to satisfy other
         obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement.  If the Borrower is
         required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result
         of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent
         not so applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower with
         three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or
         waived.

           (h)  Promptly following the end of each calendar quarter, the Issuing
         Bank shall deliver (through the Administrative Agent) to each Lender
         and the Borrower a report describing the aggregate Letters of Credit
         outstanding at the end of such calendar quarter. Upon the request of
         any Lender from time to time, the Issuing Bank shall deliver to such
         Lender any other information reasonably requested by such Lender with
         respect to each Letter of Credit then outstanding.

           (i)  The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements
         hereunder shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be
         performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under
         all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of any of the following
         circumstances:

               (i)Any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit
                  or this Agreement;

              (ii)The existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right
                  which the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the
                  Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary or any
                  transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons or entities
                  for whom any such beneficiary or transferee may be acting),
                  any Lender (including the Issuing Bank) or any other Person,
                  whether in connection with this Agreement or the Letter of
                  Credit or any document related hereto or thereto or any
                  unrelated transaction;
<PAGE>

             (iii)Any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit
                  proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or
                  any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
                  respect;

              (iv)Payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against
                  presentation of a draft or other document to the Issuing Bank
                  that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;

               (v)Any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not
                  similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the
                  provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable
                  discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the
                  Borrower's obligations hereunder; or

              (vi)The existence of a Default or an Event of Default.

         Neither the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Lenders nor any
         Related Party of any of the foregoing shall have any liability or
         responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or
         transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any
         payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred
         to above), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in
         transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication
         under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document
         required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
         technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the
         control of the Issuing Bank; provided, that the foregoing shall not be
         construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to
         the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages,
         claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the
         extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are
         caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining
         whether drafts or other documents presented under a Letter of Credit
         comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree, that
         in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
         the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent
         jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care
         in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without
         limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect
         to documents presented that appear on their face to be in substantial
         compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may,
         in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such
         documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless
         of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and
         make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict
         compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

           (j) Each Letter of Credit shall be subject to the Uniform Customs and
         Practices for Documentary Credits (1993 Revision), International
         Chamber of Commerce Publication No.500, as the same may be amended from
         time to time, and, to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the
         governing law of this Agreement set forth in Section 10.5.

                                 ARTICLE IV

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and
each Lender as follows:

     Section 4.1 Existence; Power. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries (i)
is duly organized,  validly  existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization,  (ii) has all requisite power and authority to
carry on its  business  as now  conducted,  and  (iii) is duly  qualified  to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where such qualification
is required,  except where a failure to be so qualified  would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 4.2 Organizational Power;  Authorization.  The execution,  delivery
and  performance by each Loan Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party
are within such Loan Party's organizational powers and have been duly authorized
by all necessary  organizational  action.  This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Borrower, and constitutes,  and each other Loan Document to
which any Loan Party is a party, when executed and delivered by such Loan Party,
will  constitute,  valid and binding  obligations  of the  Borrower or such Loan
Party (as the case may be),  enforceable  against  it in  accordance  with their
respective terms, except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization,  moratorium,  or  similar  laws  affecting  the  enforcement  of
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.

     Section 4.3 Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts.  The execution,  delivery
and performance by the Borrower of this Agreement, and by each Loan Party of the
other Loan  Documents  to which it is a party (a) do not  require any consent or
approval of,  registration  or filing with,  or any action by, any  Governmental
Authority,  except those as have been obtained or made and are in full force and
effect or where the failure to do so,  individually  or in the aggregate,  would
not  reasonably  be expected  to have a Material  Adverse  Effect,  (b) will not
violate  any  applicable  law or  regulation  or the  charter,  by-laws or other
organizational documents of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any order
of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default under
any indenture,  material  agreement or other material  instrument binding on the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its assets or give rise to a right
thereunder  to  require  any  payment to be made by the  Borrower  or any of its
Subsidiaries  (except for  violations  that would not  reasonably be expected to
have a  Material  Adverse  Effect)  and (d) will not result in the  creation  or
imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries,
except Liens (if any) created under the Loan Documents.

     Section 4.4 Financial Statements. The Borrower has furnished to each Lender
(i) the audited  consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
as of its  fiscal  year  ending  August  2,  2002 and the  related  consolidated
statements  of income,  shareholders'  equity and cash flows for the fiscal year
then ended audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP and (ii) the unaudited  consolidated
balance sheet of the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  as of November 1, 2002, and
the related unaudited  consolidated  statements of income and cash flows for the
fiscal quarter and year-to-date  period then ending,  certified by a Responsible
Officer.  Such financial  statements  fairly present the consolidated  financial
condition  of the  Borrower  and  its  Subsidiaries  as of  such  dates  and the
consolidated  results of  operations  for such periods in  conformity  with GAAP
consistently  applied,  subject to year end audit adjustments and the absence of
footnotes in the case of the statements referred to in clause (ii). Since August
2, 2002,  there  have been no  changes  with  respect  to the  Borrower  and its
Subsidiaries  which have had or would reasonably be expected to have,  singly or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
<PAGE>

set forth on Schedule 4.5:

(a)      no litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrators
         or Governmental Authorities is pending against or, to the knowledge of
         the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of
         its Subsidiaries (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of
         an adverse determination that would reasonably be expected to have,
         either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or
         (ii) which in any manner draws into question the validity or
         enforceability of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

(b)      neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has failed to
         comply with any Environmental Law, or to obtain, maintain or comply
         with any permit, license or other approval required under any
         Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental
         Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect to any
         Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any
         Environmental Liability, the result of any of which would reasonably be
         expected to result in, either individually or in the aggregate, a
         Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.6 Compliance with Laws and Agreements. The Borrower and each
Subsidiary is in compliance with (a) all applicable laws, rules, regulations and
orders of any Governmental Authority, and (b) all indentures, agreements or
other instruments binding upon it or its properties, except such non-compliance
that, either singly or in the aggregate, would be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

its  Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment  company",  as defined in, or subject to
regulation  under,  the  Investment  Company Act of 1940,  as amended,  or (b) a
"holding  company" as defined  in, or subject to  regulation  under,  the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

     Section 4.8 Taxes. The Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  have timely filed or
caused to be filed all federal  income tax returns  and all other  material  tax
returns that are required to be filed by them,  and have paid all taxes shown to
be due and payable on such returns or on any assessments  made against it or its
property and all other taxes,  fees or other charges imposed on it or any of its
property by any Governmental Authority,  except (i) to the extent the failure to
do so would  not have a  Material  Adverse  Effect  or (ii)  where  the same are
currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which
the Borrower or such Subsidiary,  as the case may be, has set aside on its books
adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP.
<PAGE>

     Section 4.9 Margin Regulations. None of the proceeds of any of the Loans or
Letters of Credit will be used for "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock"
with the respective meanings of each of such terms under Regulation U as now and
from time to time  hereafter  in effect or for any  purpose  that  violates  the
provisions of the applicable Margin Regulations.

     Section 4.10 ERISA.  No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably  expected
to occur with respect to any Plan that,  when taken together with all other such
ERISA Events with respect to any Plan for which liability is reasonably expected
to occur,  would  reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
The present value of all accumulated  benefit obligations under each Plan (based
on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Standards No. 87)
did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements  reflecting such
amounts,  exceed by more than  $5,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of
such Plan, and the present value of all accumulated  benefit  obligations of all
underfunded  Plans (based on the  assumptions  used for purposes of Statement of
Financial Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial
statements  reflecting  such amounts,  exceed by more than  $5,000,000  the fair
market value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans.

     Section 4.11 Ownership of Property.

(a)      The Borrower and its Subsidiaries as a whole have good title to, or
         valid leasehold interests in, all of their real and personal property
         material to the operation of their business.

(b)      Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed, or
         otherwise has the right, to use, all patents, trademarks, service
         marks, tradenames, copyrights and other intellectual property material
         to its business, and the use thereof by the Borrower and its
         Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of any other Person,
         except for any such failures that, individually or in the aggregate,
         would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
         Effect.

     Section 4.12  Disclosure.  The  Borrower  has  disclosed to the Lenders all
agreements,  instruments,  and  corporate  or other  restrictions  to which  the
Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries is subject,  and all other matters known to
any of  them,  that,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  could  reasonably  be
expected  to  result in a  Material  Adverse  Effect.  Neither  the  Information
Memorandum nor any of the reports (including without limitation all reports that
the Borrower is required to file with the Securities  and Exchange  Commission),
financial  statements,  certificates  or other  information  furnished  by or on
behalf of the Borrower to the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender in connection
with the negotiation or syndication of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
or delivered  hereunder or thereunder (as modified or  supplemented by any other
information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to
state any material fact  necessary to make the  statements  therein,  taken as a
whole, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

     Section 4.13 Labor Relations.  Except for the matters set forth in Schedule
4.5,  there  are no  strikes,  lockouts  or other  material  labor  disputes  or
grievances  against  the  Borrower  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries,  or,  to the
Borrower's knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries,  and no significant  unfair labor practice,  charges or grievances
are  pending  against  the  Borrower  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries,  or to the
Borrower's  knowledge,  threatened  against any of them before any  Governmental
Authority  any of which  individually  or in the  aggregate  would be reasonably
expected  to result in a Material  Adverse  Effect.  All  payments  due from the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the provisions of any collective
bargaining  agreement  have been paid or accrued as a liability  on the books of
the Borrower or any such Subsidiary, except where the failure to do so could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

of its  Subsidiaries  to, pay and  discharge at or before  maturity,  all of its
obligations and liabilities  (including  without  limitation all tax liabilities

the term "Administrative  Agent" as used in this Article IX included the Issuing
Bank with respect to such acts or omissions and (ii) as additionally provided in
this Agreement with respect to the Issuing Bank.

     Section 9.2 Nature of Duties of  Administrative  Agent. The  Administrative
Agent shall not have any duties or obligations  except those expressly set forth
in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality
of the  foregoing,  (a) the  Administrative  Agent  shall not be  subject to any
fiduciary or other implied  duties,  regardless of whether a Default or an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing,  (b) the  Administrative  Agent shall
not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
powers,  except those discretionary rights and powers expressly  contemplated by
the Loan  Documents  that the  Administrative  Agent is  required to exercise in

writing by the  Required  Lenders  (or such other  number or  percentage  of the
Lenders as shall be  necessary  under the  circumstances  as provided in Section
10.2),  and (c)  except  as  expressly  set  forth  in the Loan  Documents,  the
Administrative  Agent  shall  not have any duty to  disclose,  and  shall not be
liable for the failure to disclose,  any information relating to the Borrower or
any  of  its   Subsidiaries   that  is   communicated  to  or  obtained  by  the
Administrative   Agent  or  any  of  its   Affiliates  in  any   capacity.   The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary  under the  circumstances  as
provided  in  Section  10.2) or in the  absence of its own gross  negligence  or
willful  misconduct.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall  not be  deemed  to have
knowledge  of any Default or Event of Default  unless and until  written  notice
thereof is given to the Administrative  Agent by the Borrower or any Lender, and
the  Administrative  Agent  shall  not be  responsible  for or have  any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement,  warranty or representation made in
or in connection with any Loan Document,  (ii) the contents of any  certificate,
report or other  document  delivered  hereunder or  thereunder  or in connection
herewith  or  therewith,  (iii)  the  performance  or  observance  of any of the
covenants,  agreements,  or other  terms  and  conditions  set forth in any Loan
Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any
Loan  Document  or any  other  agreement,  instrument  or  document,  or (v) the
satisfaction  of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere in any Loan
Document,  other  than to  confirm  receipt of items  expressly  required  to be
delivered to the Administrative Agent.

     Section  9.3 Lack of  Reliance  on the  Administrative  Agent.  Each of the
Lenders,  the Swingline  Lender and the Issuing Bank  acknowledges  that it has,
independently  and without reliance upon the  Administrative  Agent or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each of
the Lenders, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it
will,  independently and without reliance upon the  Administrative  Agent or any
other  Lender  and based on such  documents  and  information  as it has  deemed
appropriate,  continue to make its own  decisions in taking or not taking of any
action under or based on this Agreement,  any related  agreement or any document
furnished hereunder or thereunder.

     Section  9.4  Certain   Rights  of  the   Administrative   Agent.   If  the
Administrative  Agent shall request  instructions from the Required Lenders with
respect to any action or actions  (including  the failure to act) in  connection
with this Agreement,  the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from
such  act  or  taking  such  act,  unless  and  until  it  shall  have  received
instructions  from such Lenders;  and the  Administrative  Agent shall not incur
liability  to any  Person by  reason  of so  refraining.  Without  limiting  the
foregoing,  no Lender  shall  have any right of action  whatsoever  against  the
Administrative  Agent  as  a  result  of  the  Administrative  Agent  acting  or
refraining  from acting  hereunder in accordance  with the  instructions  of the
Required Lenders where required by the terms of this Agreement.

     Section 9.5 Reliance by  Administrative  Agent.  The  Administrative  Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon,  and shall not incur any  liability  for relying
upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document
or other writing  believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed,  sent or
made by the  proper  Person.  The  Administrative  Agent  may also rely upon any
statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the
proper  Person  and shall  not incur any  liability  for  relying  thereon.  The
Administrative  Agent may consult with legal counsel  (including counsel for the
Borrower),  independent  public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in  accordance  with
the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

     Section 9.6 The Administrative Agent in its Individual  Capacity.  The bank
serving as the Administrative  Agent shall have the same rights and powers under
this  Agreement  and any other Loan  Document in its capacity as a Lender as any
other Lender and may exercise or refrain from  exercising  the same as though it
were not the Administrative Agent; and the terms "Lenders",  "Required Lenders",
"holders  of Notes",  or any similar  terms  shall,  unless the context  clearly
otherwise  indicates,   include  the  Administrative  Agent  in  its  individual
capacity.  The bank acting as the  Administrative  Agent and its  Affiliates may
accept  deposits  from,  lend  money  to,  and  generally  engage in any kind of
business with the Borrower or any  Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Borrower as if
it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

     Section 9.7 Successor Administrative Agent.

     (a) The  Administrative  Agent may  resign  at any time by giving  ten (10)
days' notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation,
the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor  Administrative
Agent, subject to the approval by the Borrower provided that no Default or Event
of Default shall exist at such time. If no successor  Administrative Agent shall
have been so appointed,  and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days
after the retiring  Administrative  Agent gives notice of resignation,  then the
retiring  Administrative  Agent may,  on behalf of the  Lenders  and the Issuing
Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial bank
organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof or
a bank which maintains an office in the United States, having a combined capital
and surplus of at least $500,000,000.

     (b) Upon the  acceptance of its  appointment  as the  Administrative  Agent
hereunder by a successor,  such successor  Administrative  Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,  privileges and duties
of the retiring  Administrative  Agent,  and the retiring  Administrative  Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the
other Loan  Documents.  If within 45 days after  written  notice is given of the
retiring  Administrative Agent's resignation under this Section 9.7 no successor
Administrative  Agent shall have been  appointed  and shall have  accepted  such
appointment,  then on such  45th  day (i) the  retiring  Administrative  Agent's
resignation shall become effective, (ii) the retiring Administrative Agent shall
thereupon be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents
and (iii) the  Required  Lenders  shall  thereafter  perform  all  duties of the
retiring  Administrative  Agent under the Loan Documents  until such time as the
Required  Lenders  appoint a successor  Administrative  Agent as provided above.
After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder,  the provisions
of this  Article IX shall  continue in effect for the  benefit of such  retiring
Administrative  Agent  and its  representatives  and  agents in  respect  of any
actions  taken  or not  taken  by any  of  them  while  it  was  serving  as the
Administrative Agent.

<PAGE>

     Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy  number for notices and
other  communications  hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All such
notices and other communications  shall, when transmitted by overnight delivery,
or faxed,  be effective when  delivered for overnight  (next-day)  delivery,  or
transmitted in legible form by facsimile  machine,  respectively,  or if mailed,
upon the  third  Business  Day  after  the date  deposited  into the mails or if
delivered, upon delivery; provided, that notices delivered to the Administrative
Agent,  the Issuing  Bank or the  Swingline  Bank shall not be  effective  until
actually received by such Person at its address specified in this Section 10.1.

     (b) Any  agreement of the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders  herein to
receive  certain notices by telephone or facsimile is solely for the convenience
and at the request of the  Borrower.  The  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders
shall be  entitled to rely on the  authority  of any Person  purporting  to be a
Person  authorized  by the  Borrower to give such notice and the  Administrative
Agent and Lenders  shall not have any  liability to the Borrower or other Person
on account of any action taken or not taken by the  Administrative  Agent or the
Lenders in reliance upon such telephonic or facsimile notice.  The obligation of
the Borrower to repay the Loans and all other Obligations hereunder shall not be
affected in any way or to any extent by any failure of the Administrative  Agent
and the Lenders to receive  written  confirmation of any telephonic or facsimile
notice  or  the  receipt  by the  Administrative  Agent  and  the  Lenders  of a
confirmation   which  is  at  variance   with  the  terms   understood   by  the
Administrative  Agent and the Lenders to be contained in any such  telephonic or
facsimile notice.

     Section 10.2 Waiver; Amendments.

     (a) No failure or delay by the  Administrative  Agent,  the Issuing Bank or
any  Lender  in  exercising  any  right or power  hereunder  or any  other  Loan
Document,  and no course of dealing between the Borrower and the  Administrative
Agent or any Lender,  shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power or any abandonment or discontinuance
of steps to enforce such right or power,  preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power hereunder or thereunder. The
rights and  remedies  of the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Issuing  Bank and the
Lenders  hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies  provided by law. No waiver of any provision
of this  Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the
Borrower  therefrom  shall in any event be  effective  unless  the same shall be
permitted  by  paragraph  (b) of this  Section,  and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective  only in the specific  instance and for the purpose for which
given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
the  issuance of a Letter of Credit  shall not be  construed  as a waiver of any
Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any
Lender or the Issuing  Bank may have had notice or  knowledge of such Default or
Event of Default at the time.

     (b) No amendment or waiver of any provision of this  Agreement or the other
Loan Documents, nor consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall in
any event be  effective  unless the same  shall be in writing  and signed by the
Borrower and the Required Lenders or the Borrower and the  Administrative  Agent
<PAGE>

with the consent of the Required  Lenders and then such waiver or consent  shall
be  effective  only in the specific  instance  and for the specific  purpose for
which  given;  provided,  that no amendment  or waiver  shall:  (i) increase the
Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce
the  principal  amount  of any Loan or LC  Disbursement  or  reduce  the rate of
interest  thereon,  or reduce any fees  payable  hereunder,  without the written
consent of each Lender affected  thereby,  (iii) postpone the date fixed for any
payment of any  principal  of, or interest  on, any Loan or LC  Disbursement  or
interest  thereon or any fees hereunder or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse
any  such  payment,  or  postpone  the  scheduled  date for the  termination  or
reduction of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected
thereby, (iv) change Section 2.19(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro
rata sharing of payments required  thereby,  without the written consent of each
Lender,  (v) change any of the  provisions of this Section or the  definition of
"Required  Lenders"  or any other  provision  hereof  specifying  the  number or
percentage  of Lenders  which are required to waive,  amend or modify any rights
hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder,  without the
consent of each Lender; (vi) release any guarantor or limit the liability of any
such  guarantor  under  any  guaranty   agreement;   or  (vii)  release  all  or
substantially all collateral (if any) securing any of the Obligations;  provided
further,  that no such  agreement  shall amend,  modify or otherwise  affect the
rights, duties or obligations of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline  Bank
or the Issuing  Bank without the prior  written  consent of such Person.

     Section 10.3 Expenses; Indemnification.

     (a) The  Borrower  shall pay (i) all  reasonable,  out-of-pocket  costs and
expenses  of  the  Administrative  Agent  and  its  Affiliates,   including  the
reasonable fees,  charges and  disbursements  of counsel for the  Administrative
Agent and its  Affiliates,  in  connection  with the  syndication  of the credit
facilities  provided for herein,  the preparation and administration of the Loan
Documents and any amendments,  modifications  or waivers thereof (whether or not
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
be  consummated),  (ii) all reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by the
Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of
any  Letter  of  Credit  or any  demand  for  payment  thereunder  and (iii) all
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including,  without limitation, the reasonable
fees,  charges and  disbursements  of outside  counsel and the allocated cost of
inside counsel)  incurred by the  Administrative  Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
Lender  in  connection  with the  enforcement  or  protection  of its  rights in
connection with this Agreement,  including its rights under this Section,  or in
connection  with the  Loans  made or any  Letters  of Credit  issued  hereunder,
including  all  such   out-of-pocket   expenses  incurred  during  any  workout,
restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

     (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank
and each  Lender,  and each  Related  Party of any of the  foregoing  (each,  an
"Indemnitee")  against,  and hold each of them harmless from, any and all costs,
losses, liabilities,  claims, damages and related expenses,  including the fees,
charges  and  disbursements  of any  counsel  for any  Indemnitee,  which may be
incurred by or asserted  against any  Indemnitee  arising out of, in  connection
with or as a result of (i) the  execution  or delivery of this  Agreement or any
<PAGE>

other  agreement or  instrument  contemplated  hereby,  the  performance  by the
parties hereto of their respective  obligations hereunder or the consummation of
any of the transactions  contemplated  hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit
or any actual or proposed use of the proceeds  therefrom  (including any refusal
by the Issuing  Bank to honor a demand for  payment  under a Letter of Credit if
the documents  presented in connection  with such demand do not strictly  comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit),  (iii) any actual or alleged  presence
or release of Hazardous  Materials on or from any property owned by the Borrower
or any  Subsidiary  or any  Environmental  Liability  related  in any way to the
Borrower or any Subsidiary or (iv) any actual or prospective claim,  litigation,
investigation or proceeding  relating to any of the foregoing,  whether based on
contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a
party thereto;  provided,  that the Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify
any Indemnitee for any of the foregoing arising out of such  Indemnitee's  gross
negligence  or  willful  misconduct  as  determined  by  a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment.

     (c) The Borrower shall pay, and hold the  Administrative  Agent and each of
the Lenders  harmless  from and against,  any and all present and future  stamp,
documentary,  and other  similar  taxes with respect to this  Agreement  and any
other Loan  Documents,  any collateral  described  therein,  or any payments due
thereunder,  and save the Administrative Agent and each Lender harmless from and
against any and all  liabilities  with respect to or resulting from any delay or
omission to pay such taxes.

     (d) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount  required to be
paid to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under
clauses  (a),  (b) or (c)  hereof,  each Lender  severally  agrees to pay to the
Administrative  Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may
be,  such  Lender's  Pro  Rata  Share  (determined  as  of  the  time  that  the
unreimbursed  expense or  indemnity  payment is sought) of such  unpaid  amount;
provided,  that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified payment,  claim, damage,
liability  or related  expense,  as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the  Administrative  Agent,  the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in
its capacity as such.

     (e) To the extent  permitted by  applicable  law,  the  Borrower  shall not
assert,  and hereby waives,  any claim against any Indemnitee,  on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect,  consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to actual or direct  damages)  arising out of, in connection with or as a result
of, this  Agreement or any  agreement or  instrument  contemplated  hereby,  the
transactions  contemplated  therein, any Loan or any Letter of Credit or the use
of proceeds thereof.

     (f) All  amounts due under this  Section  shall be payable  promptly  after
written demand therefor.

     Section 10.4 Successors and Assigns.

     (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the  parties  hereto and their  respective  successors  and  assigns,
except that the Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights  hereunder
without the prior written  consent of each Lender (and any attempted  assignment
or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void).

     (b) Any Lender  may at any time  assign to one or more  assignees  all or a
portion of its rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement and the other Loan
Documents  (including  all or a portion of its  Commitment  and the Loans and LC
Exposure at the time owing to it);  provided,  that (i) except in the case of an
assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, each of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (and, in the case of an assignment of all or a portion of a
Commitment  or any  Lender's  obligations  in  respect  of its  LC  Exposure  or
Swingline  Exposure,  the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender) must give their
prior  written  consent  (which  consent shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or
delayed),  and provided that no consent of the Borrower  shall be required while
an Event of Default has occurred and is  continuing,  (ii) except in the case of
an  assignment  to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an  assignment of the
entire amount of the assigning  Lender's  Commitment  hereunder or an assignment
while an Event of Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing,  the amount of the
Commitment of the assigning  Lender subject to each such assignment  (determined
as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance  with respect to such assignment is
delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000 (unless
the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent shall otherwise consent),  (iii) each
partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all
the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other
Loan  Documents,  (iv) the assigning  Lender and the assignee  shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance,  together with
a processing and recordation fee payable by the assigning Lender or the assignee
(as  determined  between such Persons) in an amount equal to $1,000 and (v) such
assignee,  if it is not a Lender, shall deliver a duly completed  Administrative
Questionnaire to the  Administrative  Agent;  provided,  that any consent of the
Borrower  otherwise  required  hereunder  shall not be  required  if an Event of
Default has occurred and is  continuing.  Upon the execution and delivery of the
Assignment and  Acceptance and payment by such assignee to the assigning  Lender
of an amount equal to the  purchase  price agreed  between  such  Persons,  such
assignee  shall become a party to this Agreement and any other Loan Documents to
which  such  assigning  Lender is a party and,  to the  extent of such  interest
assigned  by  such  Assignment  and  Acceptance,   shall  have  the  rights  and
obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,  and the assigning Lender shall be
released from its obligations  hereunder to a corresponding  extent (and, in the
case of an Assignment  and  Acceptance  covering all of the  assigning  Lender's
rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement,  such Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.16,
2.17 and 2.18 and 10.3. Upon the consummation of any such assignment  hereunder,
the  assigning  Lender,  the  Administrative  Agent and the Borrower  shall make
appropriate  arrangements  to have new Notes issued if so requested by either or
both the assigning Lender or the assignee. Any assignment or other transfer by a
Lender  that does not fully  comply  with the terms of this  clause (b) shall be
treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale of a participation  pursuant to
clause (c) below.
<PAGE>

     (c) Any Lender may at any time,  without the consent of the  Borrower,  the
Administrative   Agent,  the  Issuing  Bank  or  the  Swingline   Lender,   sell
participations  to one or more banks or other entities (a  "Participant") in all
or a portion of such  Lender's  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment,  the Loans owing to it and its LC
Exposure);  provided,  that (i) such Lender's  obligations  under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged,  (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and (iii)
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Bank, the Issuing Bank and
the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's  rights and  obligations  under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents.  Any agreement between such Lender and the Participant
with respect to such  participation  shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right and  responsibility  to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of this
Agreement  and the other  Loan  Documents;  provided,  that  such  participation
agreement  may provide  that such  Lender  will not,  without the consent of the
Participant,  agree to any amendment,  modification  or waiver of this Agreement
described in the first proviso of Section 10.2(b) that affects the  Participant.
The Borrower agrees that each  Participant  shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.16, 2.17 and 2.18 to the same extent as if it were a Lender hereunder
and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b); provided,
that no  Participant  shall be entitled to receive  any  greater  payment  under
Section  2.16 or 2.18 than the  applicable  Lender  would have been  entitled to
receive with respect to the  participation  sold to such Participant  unless the
sale of such participation is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. To
the extent permitted by law, the Borrower agrees that each Participant  shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section  2.19 as though it were a Lender,  provided,
that such  Participant  agrees to share with the Lenders the proceeds thereof in
accordance  with  Section  2.19 as  fully as if it were a  Lender  hereunder.  A
Participant  that  would be a Foreign  Lender  if it were a Lender  shall not be
entitled to the benefits of Section 2.18 unless the Borrower is notified of such
participation  sold to such  Participant and such  Participant  agrees,  for the
benefit of the  Borrower,  to comply  with  Section  2.18(e) as though it were a
Lender hereunder.

     (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security  interest in all
or any  portion of its rights  under  this  Agreement  and its Notes (if any) to
secure its  obligations  to a Federal  Reserve Bank without  complying with this
Section; provided, that no such pledge or assignment shall release a Lender from
any of its obligations  hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
such Lender as a party hereto.

     (e)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender
(a  "Granting  Lender")  may grant to a variable  interest  entity  (an  "VIE"),
identified  as such in writing from time to time by the  Granting  Lender to the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all
or any part of any Loan that such Granting  Lender would  otherwise be obligated
to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement;  provided,  that (i) nothing
herein shall  constitute a commitment by any VIE to make any Loan and (ii) if an
VIE elects not to exercise such option or otherwise  fails to provide all or any
<PAGE>

part of any Loan,  the  Granting  Lender  shall be  obligated  to make such Loan
pursuant to the terms  hereof.  The making of a Loan by an VIE  hereunder  shall
utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if such
Loan were made by such Granting Lender.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that no
VIE shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment  obligation  under this
Agreement  (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting  Lender).  In
furtherance of the foregoing,  each party hereto hereby agrees (which  agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is
one year and one day after the  payment  in full of all  outstanding  commercial
paper or other senior indebtedness of any VIE, it will not institute against, or
join  any  other  person  in  instituting  against,  such  VIE  any  bankruptcy,
reorganization,  arrangement,  insolvency or liquidation  proceedings  under the
laws of the United States or any State  contrary to this Section  10.4,  any VIE
may (i) with notice to, but without the prior  written  consent of, the Borrower
and the  Administrative  Agent and without  paying any  processing fee therefor,
assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting  Lender or
to  any   financial   institutions   (consented  to  by  the  Borrower  and  the
Administrative  Agent)  providing  liquidity and/or credit support to or for the
account of such VIE to support  the  funding  or  maintenance  of Loans and (ii)
disclose on a  confidential  basis any  non-public  information  relating to its
Loans to any rating agency,  commercial  paper dealer or provider of any surety,
guarantee  or credit or  liquidity  enhancement  to such  VIE.  As this  Section
10.4(e)  applies to any particular  VIE, this Section may not be amended without
the written consent of such VIE.

     Section 10.5 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.


     (a) This  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents  shall be  construed  in
accordance  with  and be  governed  by the law  (without  giving  effect  to the
conflict of law principles thereof) of the State of Tennessee.

     (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself
and  its  property,  to the  non-exclusive  jurisdiction  of the  United  States
District  Court of the Middle  District  of  Tennessee,  and of any state  court
within Davidson County,  Tennessee and any appellate court from any thereof,  in
any action or  proceeding  arising out of or relating to this  Agreement  or any
other Loan Document or the transactions  contemplated  hereby or thereby, or for
recognition  or  enforcement  of any  judgment,  and each of the parties  hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally  agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and  determined in such  Tennessee  state
court or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, such Federal court. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive  and may be enforced in other  jurisdictions  by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner  provided by law.  Nothing in this  Agreement or
any other Loan Document  shall affect any right that the  Administrative  Agent,
the  Issuing  Bank or any  Lender  may  otherwise  have to bring  any  action or
proceeding  relating to this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document  against the
Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

     (c) The Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit,  action or
proceeding  described in paragraph  (b) of this Section and brought in any court
referred  to in  paragraph  (b) of  this  Section.  Each of the  parties  hereto
irrevocably  waives,  to the fullest  extent  permitted by  applicable  law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding
in any such court.
<PAGE>

     (d) Each party to this  Agreement  irrevocably  consents  to the service of
process in the manner  provided  for  notices in Section  10.1.  Nothing in this
Agreement  or in any other  Loan  Document  will  affect  the right of any party
hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

     Section 10.6 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL  PROCEEDING  DIRECTLY  OR  INDIRECTLY  ARISING  OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO
(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO  REPRESENTATIVE,  AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED,  EXPRESSLY  OR  OTHERWISE,  THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION,  SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER  PARTIES  HERETO  HAVE  BEEN  INDUCED  TO ENTER  INTO THIS
AGREEMENT  AND THE OTHER LOAN  DOCUMENTS  BY,  AMONG  OTHER  THINGS,  THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

     Section  10.7 Right of Setoff.  In addition to any rights now or  hereafter
granted  under  applicable  law and not by way of limitation of any such rights,
each Lender and the Issuing Bank shall have the right,  at any time or from time
to time upon the occurrence  and during the  continuance of an Event of Default,
without prior notice to the Borrower,  any such notice being expressly waived by
the  Borrower to the extent  permitted  by  applicable  law, to setoff and apply
against all deposits (general or special, time or demand,  provisional or final)
of the Borrower at any time held or other  obligations at any time owing by such
Lender and the Issuing  Bank to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower
against any and all Obligations  held by such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be,  irrespective of whether such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall have
made demand  hereunder and although  such  Obligations  may be  unmatured.  Each
Lender and the Issuing Bank agree  promptly to notify the  Administrative  Agent
and the Borrower after any such setoff and any  application  made by such Lender
and the Issuing  Bank,  as the case may be;  provided,  that the failure to give
such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

     Section 10.8 Counterparts;  Integration.  This Agreement may be executed by
one or  more  of the  parties  to  this  Agreement  on any  number  of  separate
counterparts  (including  by  telecopy),  and  all of  said  counterparts  taken
together  shall  be  deemed  to  constitute  one and the same  instrument.  This
Agreement,  the other  Loan  Documents,  and any  separate  letter  agreement(s)
relating to any fees payable to the  Administrative  Agent constitute the entire
agreement  among the parties  hereto and thereto  regarding the subject  matters
hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and  understandings,  oral
or written, regarding such subject matters.
<PAGE>

     Section 10.9  Survival.  All  covenants,  agreements,  representations  and
warranties  made  by  the  Borrower  herein  and in the  certificates  or  other
instruments  delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
considered  to have been  relied  upon by the  other  parties  hereto  and shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans
and issuance of any Letters of Credit,  regardless of any investigation  made by
any  such  other   party  or  on  its  behalf  and   notwithstanding   that  the
Administrative  Agent,  the  Issuing  Bank or any  Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any
credit is  extended  hereunder,  and shall  continue in full force and effect as
long as the  principal of or any accrued  interest on any Loan or any fee or any
other  amount  payable  under this  Agreement is  outstanding  and unpaid or any
Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments  have not expired
or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.17, 2.18, 2.19, and 10.3 and Article
IX  shall  survive  and  remain  in full  force  and  effect  regardless  of the
consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  the  repayment of the
Loans,  the  expiration  or  termination  of  the  Letters  of  Credit  and  the
Commitments or the  termination of this Agreement or any provision  hereof.  All
representations  and  warranties  made  herein,  in the  certificates,  reports,
notices,  and other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents,  and
the making of the Loans and the issuance of the Letters of Credit.

     Section 10.10  Severability.  Any provision of this  Agreement or any other
Loan Document held to be illegal,  invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such illegality,
invalidity or  unenforceability  without  affecting  the  legality,  validity or
enforceability  of  the  remaining   provisions  hereof  or  thereof;   and  the
illegality,  invalidity  or  unenforceability  of a  particular  provision  in a
particular  jurisdiction  shall  not  invalidate  or render  unenforceable  such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

     Section  10.11  Confidentiality.  Each  of the  Administrative  Agent,  the
Issuing Bank and each Lender agrees to take normal and reasonable precautions to
maintain  the  confidentiality  of any  information  designated  in  writing  as
confidential  and provided to it by the Borrower or any Subsidiary,  except that
such information may be disclosed (i) to any Related Party of the Administrative
Agent,  the  Issuing  Bank or any  such  Lender,  including  without  limitation
accountants,  legal counsel and other  advisors,  (ii) to the extent required by
applicable  laws or  regulations  or by any subpoena or similar  legal  process,
(iii) to the extent requested by any regulatory agency or authority, (iv) to the
extent that such information  becomes publicly  available other than as a result
of a breach of this Section,  or which becomes  available to the  Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank, any Lender or any Related Party of any of the foregoing
on a  nonconfidential  basis  from a  source  other  than the  Borrower,  (v) in
connection  with the  exercise of any remedy  hereunder  or any suit,  action or
proceeding  relating to this Agreement or the  enforcement of rights  hereunder,
and (vi) subject to provisions  substantially  similar to this Section 10.11, to
any actual or prospective assignee or Participant,  or (vii) with the consent of
the  Borrower.  Any Person  required  to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of any
information as provided for in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its  obligation  to do so if such Person has  exercised  the same degree of
care to maintain the  confidentiality  of such  information as such Person would
accord its own confidential information.

     Section 10.12 Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary,  if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together
with all fees,  charges  and other  amounts  which may be treated as interest on
such Loan under applicable law (collectively,  the "Charges"),  shall exceed the
<PAGE>

maximum  lawful rate of interest  (the  "Maximum  Rate") which may be contracted
for,  charged,  taken,  received or reserved  by a Lender  holding  such Loan in
accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest  payable in respect of such
Loan hereunder,  together with all Charges payable in respect thereof,  shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful,  the interest and Charges
that would have been  payable in respect of such Loan but were not  payable as a
result of the  operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and
Charges  payable to such  Lender in respect of other  Loans or periods  shall be
increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount,
together  with  interest  thereon  at the  Federal  Funds  Rate  to the  date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.
