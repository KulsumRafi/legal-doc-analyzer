                  whole but not part of the Facilities (including any Direct
                  Obligations) provided that GMAC has received from the Borrower
                  not less than 90 days' prior written notice of the proposed
                  date of prepayment. Such written notice when given shall be
                  irrevocable. Any such amount once it has been prepaid may not
                  be re-drawn.

                  (i)      the relevant Supplier Finance Beneficiary or
                           Beneficiaries give not less than 90 days prior
                           written notice to GMAC; and

                  (ii)     a prepayment fee equal to the Supplier Finance Annual
                           Fee (or instalments thereof) which would, but for the
                           prepayment being made, be payable up to the
                           anniversary of the Commencement Date if the
                           prepayment is made in the first year or up to
                           subsequent applicable anniversaries depending on
                           which year the prepayment is made, being paid in
                           full.

                  Monitoring Fee and the Supplier Finance Annual Fee will cease
                  to be payable. For the avoidance of doubt, termination of the
                  Supplier Finance Facility pursuant to this Clause 12.2 shall
                  not result in a requirement for the Borrower to terminate any
                  of the other Facilities.

                  Such written notice when given shall be irrevocable. Any such
                  amount once it has been prepaid may not be re-drawn.

         12.3     Subject to the Early Termination Fee Exceptions, upon
                  termination of any of the Facilities other than the Supplier

                  or prior to any subsequent annual renewal thereafter, GMAC
                  will be entitled to an early termination fee equal to 1% of
                  the Total Line Size, but less any sum paid by

                                                                              14

                  an Obligor under similar provisions in any of the other
                  Finance Documents and less the amount of any prepayment fee
                  payable under Clause 12.2.

         12.4     For the avoidance of doubt, should the Hewlett Packard Invoice
                  Purchase Agreement be terminated for whatever reason, such
                  termination shall trigger a requirement that the whole (not
                  part) of the Supplier Finance Facility be immediately repaid
                  and the appropriate prepayment fee as set out in part (ii) of
                  Clause 12.2 shall become immediately payable to GMAC.

13.      MANDATORY PRE-PAYMENT

         13.1     If at any time during the availability of the Term Loan
                  Facility any of the events described in Clause 19.1 and 19.2
                  of the Invoice Discounting Agreements (or their equivalent in
                  the Overseas Invoice Discounting Agreements) occur
                  (irrespective of whether GMAC subsequently terminates the
                  relevant agreement as a result) the Borrower shall prepay all
                  the Facilities on demand by GMAC together with interest and
                  other amounts payable thereunder.

14.      DEFAULT INTEREST ON TERM LOAN FACILITY

         14.1     If the Borrower fails to pay any amount due on the Term Loan
                  Facility under this Agreement on its due date, the Borrower
                  shall be liable (if GMAC so requires) for interest on such
                  amount from the date of such default until the date of actual
                  payment (as well after as before judgement or demand) at the
                  Default Rate. The Borrower's liability under this clause shall
                  be in substitution for the liability for interest on such
                  defaulted amount at the otherwise applicable rate of interest
                  under this Agreement. Such interest shall be payable on demand
                  and, to the extent not actually paid, shall be compounded
                  monthly in arrears and debited to any of the Accounts as GMAC
                  shall at its option nominate.

         14.2     For so long as any Event of Default has occurred and is
                  continuing, (if GMAC so requires) the rate specified for the
                  purpose of the definition of "Interest Rate" shall be
                  increased so that such rate is equal to the Default Rate. The
                  other provisions of this Agreement relating to the calculation
                  and payment of interest shall continue to apply. This clause
                  14.2 shall not apply to any amount on which the Borrower is
                  liable to pay interest under clause 14.1.

         14.3     GMAC and the Borrower agree that the Default Rate and any
                  increase to the Interest Rate which takes effect pursuant to
                  clause 14.2 represents a genuine pre-estimate of the GMAC's
                  administrative, funding and other costs, loss and increased
                  risk and is not a penalty.

15.      PAYMENTS

         15.1     The Borrower and relevant Obligors will make all payments due
                  under this Agreement:

                  15.1.1   in cleared funds for value on the relevant date; and

                  15.1.2   without set-off or counterclaim and, except when
                           required by law, without any deduction for taxes or
                           for any other reason. If the Borrower or any Obligor
                           is compelled by law to make any deductions, the
                           Borrower or any Obligor shall pay such additional
                           amounts ("ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS") as are necessary to
                           ensure receipt by GMAC of the full amount which GMAC






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              15
<PAGE>

                           would have received but for such deduction. Without
                           prejudice to the foregoing, in the event of any such
                           deduction for tax, the Borrower or any Obligor will
                           within seven days of effecting any such deduction
                           provide GMAC with any appropriate certificate (R185
                           or similar certificate) in favour of GMAC in relation
                           to such tax deduction and shall provide GMAC with
                           evidence satisfactory to GMAC of payment to the
                           Inland Revenue of the tax deducted within seven days
                           of the due date for payment of the same to the Inland
                           Revenue. On receipt by GMAC of such appropriate
                           certificate, GMAC shall repay to the Borrower or the
                           relevant Obligor an amount equal to the relevant
                           Additional Amounts.

         15.2     For the purposes of this clause, GMAC confirms that it is the
                  person beneficially entitled to interest under this Agreement
                  and is a company resident, for United Kingdom tax purposes, in
                  the United Kingdom.

         15.3     GMAC shall be entitled (and is hereby authorised by the
                  Borrower who will procure that each Obligor which is a party
                  to any of the Facility Agreements shall consent thereto) to
                  debit all payments (including, without limitation, principal
                  and interest and other amounts due under the Facilities) due
                  under this Agreement or any of the Security Documents either
                  to the Accounts or any other Accounts(s) of the Borrower or of
                  any such Obligor held with GMAC.

         15.4     The Borrower and relevant Obligors shall repay the amounts
                  owing under the Facilities in the Approved Currency in which
                  that Borrower or relevant Obligor borrowed or utilised the
                  relevant portion of that Facility.

         15.5     Notwithstanding Clause 8.1 and 8.5, the Supplier Finance
                  Annual Fees in respect of each annual sum (payable in
                  accordance with clause 8.5) may be payable to GMAC by way of
                  equal instalments in advance, the first such instalment being
                  payable on the Commencement Date with successive instalments
                  being payable thereafter at successive three monthly
                  intervals.

         15.6     Sterling is the currency of account and payment for each and
                  every sum at any time due from the Borrower under the Term
                  Loan Facility.

         15.7     If any sum due from the Borrower under the Term Loan Facility
                  or any order or judgment given or made in relation thereto is
                  in a currency other than sterling, GMAC shall convert such
                  currency into sterling at its spot rate for such other
                  currency and the Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless
                  GMAC from and against any loss suffered as a result of any
                  such conversion.

16.      CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES AND INCREASED COSTS

         16.1     If at any time it becomes unlawful or impossible for GMAC to
                  advance, maintain or fund the whole or any part of the Term
                  Loan Facility or the Accounts Balance, GMAC may at any time by
                  written notice to the Borrower require the Borrower to repay
                  the whole or any part of the Term Loan Facility, and/or the
                  Accounts Balance (in addition to its obligations under the
                  Invoice Discounting Agreements and the Supplier Finance
                  Agreements) immediately, together with any outstanding
                  interest and all other sums due under this Agreement and the
                  Security Documents.

         16.2     The Borrower shall pay to GMAC on demand such amount as GMAC
                  may from time to time certify as being necessary to compensate
                  it for any increase in the cost of funding the Term Loan
                  Facility or the Accounts Balance or for any reduction in the




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              16

                  rate of return under this Agreement, incurred by GMAC as a
                  result of compliance with any official directives,
                  requirements or requests of any regulatory authority (whether
                  or not having the force of law) or any law or regulation
                  (including any changes to, or change in the interpretation of,
                  the 1988 Capital Accord as a result of any proposals made by
                  the Bank Committee on Basel Regulation and Supervisory
                  Practice for Reform of the 1988 Capital Accord, published in
                  June 1999 as revised or amended, including any further
                  proposals of the Basel Committee (including, without
                  limitation, those relating to reserve assets, special
                  deposits, taxes (other than tax on its overall net income),
                  capital adequacy and/or asset ratios).

17.      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Borrower hereby represents and warrants in relation to itself and
         each other Obligor that:

         17.1     it is a limited liability company incorporated under the laws
                  of England and Wales (or relevant overseas jurisdiction) and
                  has the power to own its property and assets and carry on its
                  business as it is now being and will be conducted;

         17.2     it has the power to enter into and perform its obligations
                  under each of the Finance Documents to which it is a party and
                  all necessary action (corporate or otherwise) has been taken
                  to authorise its unconditional entry into and performance of
                  its obligations under each of the Finance Documents to which
                  it is a party and the borrowing or utilising of the Facilities
                  upon the terms and conditions contained herein;

         17.3     all authorisations, approvals, consents, licences, exemptions,
                  filings, registrations, notarisations and other matters
                  required in connection with the entry into, performance and
                  validity of the Finance Documents, the borrowing or
                  utilisation of the Facilities and the granting of the Security
                  Documents have been obtained and are in full force and effect,
                  and any requirements thereof have been or will be at the
                  appropriate time complied with or fulfilled;

         17.4     the Finance Documents to which it is a party constitute its
                  legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations or will,
                  following appropriate registration, constitute legal valid and
                  enforceable obligations and subject in each case to the
                  principle that specific performance and other equitable
                  remedies (where relevant) are discretionary remedies of the
                  court and subject to insolvency laws affecting the rights of
                  creditors generally;

         17.5     the entry into and performance of the Finance Documents to
                  which it is party and the transactions contemplated hereby and
                  thereby do not and will not conflict with (a) any law or
                  regulation or any official or judicial order, or (b) its
                  memorandum or articles of association (or overseas
                  equivalent); or (c) any agreement or document to which it is a
                  party or which is binding upon it or its assets;

         17.6     no member of the Group is in default under any agreement to
                  which it is a party which would have a Material Adverse Effect
                  and no litigation, arbitration or administrative proceedings
                  are current or pending or (to the knowledge of the Borrower)
                  threatened which would have a Material Adverse Effect;

         17.7     it is not aware of any material fact or circumstances that has
                  not been disclosed to GMAC which, if disclosed, would be
                  likely at the date of this Agreement to be relevant in
                  relation to (a) any material liability of GMAC under the
                  Finance Documents, or (b) in respect of Environmental Laws;

                                                                              17

         17.8     there has been no material adverse change to the nature of
                  business of the Group Companies since the decision was taken
                  by GMAC to provide the Facilities to the relevant Group
                  Companies;

         17.9     it is in all material respects in full compliance with all
                  Environmental Laws as presently applied and enforced which are
                  currently applicable to its operations and all Environmental
                  Approvals required in respect thereof have been obtained from
                  the appropriate authorities and are in full force and effect;

         17.10    the latest Audited Accounts delivered to GMAC under clause
                  18.1 hereof have been prepared in accordance with generally
                  accepted Accounting principles which have been consistently
                  applied (or if not consistently applied, such inconsistency
                  has been notified to GMAC) and such audited Accounts represent
                  a true and fair view of the financial position of the
                  companies in the Group for the relevant period for which such
                  Accounts were prepared;

         17.11    the Monthly Management Accounts delivered to GMAC under clause
                  18.2 hereof:

                  17.11.1  fairly represent the financial condition and
                           operations of the Group as at the date up to which
                           they have been prepared and for the period for which
                           such management Accounts relate; and

                  17.11.2  were or will when the same are produced be prepared
                           on a basis substantially in accordance with the
                           Accounting principles used in the latest audited
                           Accounts (other than in the event of any change
                           notified to GMAC),

                  in each case within the reasonable parameters which may be
                  expected of management Accounts not the subject of audit
                  procedures;

         17.12    none of its assets, property and undertaking are subject to
                  any Security Interest (other than as constituted by Permitted
                  Security Interests) and it is not a party to, nor are its
                  assets bound by any order, agreement or instrument under which
                  it is, or in certain events may be, required to create, assume
                  or permit to arise any Security Interest;

         17.13    no Event of Default has occurred or is outstanding and no
                  event has occurred which with the giving of notice or the
                  lapse of time or both would constitute an Event of Default;
                  and

         17.14    it has good valid and marketable freehold or leasehold title
                  to each or valid leases or licences of the properties over
                  which it purports to create security under the Security
                  Documents;

         17.15    all of the assets, property and undertaking which are not
                  subject to any lease or lease agreement are legally and
                  beneficially owned by it and all filings necessary for the
                  registration of title have been obtained or made;

         17.16    the Intellectual Property Rights owned by, or licensed to, an
                  Obligor:

                  17.16.1  are all of the Intellectual Property Rights required
                           by it in order for it to carry on its business as
                           currently conducted, and the relevant Obligor, in
                           carrying on its business, does not infringe any
                           Intellectual Property Rights of any third party;

                                    shall be measured at successive monthly

                                    unless the Audited Accounts required to be

                                    for the relevant period are available on the
                                    relevant testing date, in which case such
                                    Audited Accounts shall be used instead
                                    together with any available relevant monthly

                                    when the covenant is tested but when such
                                    Audited Accounts become available they
                                    demonstrate that the figures in any relevant
                                    Monthly Management Accounts or financial
                                    statements used for any calculation of the
                                    financial covenant cannot have been
                                    substantially accurate, then GMAC shall
                                    require such adjustment to the calculations
                                    made or to be made as it, in its sole
                                    discretion, considers appropriate to rectify
                                    such inaccuracy and compliance with the
                                    financial covenants will be determined by
                                    references to such adjusted figures;

                           (e)      the components of the relevant financial
                                    covenants shall be calculated in accordance
                                    with accounting principles, standards and
                                    practices of the Borrower from time to time
                                    provided always that they are consistent
                                    with those generally accepted from time to
                                    time in the United Kingdom and approved by
                                    the Accounting Standards Board ("UK GAAP").
                                    In the case of any component calculated by
                                    reference to management accounts or
                                    unaudited financial statements, UK GAAP will
                                    be applied within the reasonable parameters
                                    which may be expected of such accounts or
                                    financial statements not the subject of
                                    audit procedures.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              26

                  26.1.1   any stamp documentary registration and other similar
                           duties or taxes in connection with the Finance
                           Documents; and

                  26.1.2   all costs and expenses (provided that any such costs
                           or expenses have been agreed by the Borrower in
                           advance) incurred in connection with the preparation,
                           negotiation or enforcement of the Finance Documents
                           (including legal fees, charges, disbursements, survey
                           and valuation fees, and value added tax and
                           disbursements, incidental to the administering of the
                           Term Loan Facility and/or the Accounts incurred by
                           GMAC).

         26.2     The Borrower shall also indemnify GMAC against any loss or
                  expense incurred by it as a consequence of the occurrence of
                  any non-payment.

         26.3     As soon as any of the above amounts become due from the
                  Borrower GMAC shall be entitled to debit such amounts either
                  to the Accounts or any other Accounts(s) of the Borrower.

27.      CONVERSION OF CURRENCIES/TRANSFER FEES

         27.1     In the event that GMAC makes any Prepayment in a currency (the
                  "PAYMENT CURRENCY") other than the currency of the relevant
                  Debt (the "DEBT CURRENCY"), GMAC shall be entitled (but not
                  obliged) on a daily basis whilst the relevant Debt is
                  Outstanding, to calculate the amount (the "CONVERTED AMOUNT")
                  of the Payment Currency which could be purchased with the
                  original amount of the Prepayment expressed in the Debt
                  Currency.

         27.2     If the above calculation reveals that the Converted Amount is
                  less than the amount of the Prepayment, GMAC shall be entitled
                  to deduct the amount of such deficit from the amount which
                  would otherwise be available to be drawn down by the Borrower
                  and the respective Overseas ISA Invoice Discounters.

         27.3     Furthermore GMAC shall be entitled to deduct the amount of
                  such deficit from the amount which would otherwise be
                  available to be drawn down by the Borrower and the respective
                  Overseas ISA Invoice Discounters for any Costs of Conversion
                  which GMAC incurs as a result of converting repayments in
                  currencies other than the Payment Currency, whether received
                  through enforcing security or otherwise.

         27.4     In the event that the Borrower or any of the other Obligors
                  becomes Insolvent, GMAC shall be entitled to claim the
                  equivalent in any of the Approved Currencies of any Costs of
                  Conversion which have been incurred by GMAC and remain unpaid.
