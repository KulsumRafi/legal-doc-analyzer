established  the 2000 Deferred  Compensation Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) for
the benefit
of eligible employees;</font></p>

<p align=justify><font size=2><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS</b>, the
 Plan provides that the Company has the
right to amend the Plan at any time and from time to time;</font></p>

<p align=justify><font size=2><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,</B>
the Board of Directors, at their August 1, 2002 meeting, authorized the
amendment of the Plan to provide Participants a one-time election to defer
receipt of their Plan Accounts. </FONT></P>

<p align=justify><font size=2><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE</b>,
the Plan is
hereby amended as follows:</FONT></P>

<p align=justify><font size=2><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Section 7.01 of the Plan is hereby amended to read as follows:</b></FONT></P>


<p align=justify><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;7.01 <U>Account Distribution</U>. Except as
otherwise provided below, each Participant&#146;s Accounts will be distributed
in full within thirty (30) days after becoming vested. The Company may,
however, permit a Participant to defer receipt of his or her Accounts for an
additional period of time established by the Company, provided that such
election is made at least twelve (12) months before the Participant is
scheduled to become vested in his or her Account, barring an accelerated vesting
event described in Sections 6.01(1) or (2). In the event a Participant elects to
defer receipt of his or her Accounts in accordance with the preceding sentence,
the Accounts will be distributed within thirty (30) days of the end of the
deferral period, except as may otherwise be required by Section 12.01 of this
Plan. Any Death Benefit under the Plan shall be payable to the beneficiary or
beneficiaries most recently designated by a Participant in accordance with
Section 11.02 below.&#148; </FONT></p>

<p align=justify><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;12.01
<U>Termination Benefit</U>. In the event a Participant voluntarily terminates
his or her employment, or is Terminated For-Cause by an Employer, at any time
prior to the date he or she becomes vested in his Accounts, no benefits will be
paid to the Participant or any Beneficiary under this Plan. Upon the termination
of employment of a Participant for any reason at any time following the date the
Participant became vested in his or her Accounts, the Participant shall be
entitled to a distribution of his or her Accounts in full within thirty (30)
days of the termination date.&#148; </FONT></p>


<p align=justify><font size=2><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN
