Annexes B, C and D hereto; and (h) the Pledgor has complied with the respective
procedure set forth in Section 3.2(a) hereof with respect to each item of
Collateral described in Annexes B, C and D hereto.

          4.        APPOINTMENT OF SUB-AGENTS; ENDORSEMENTS, ETC. The Pledgee
shall have the right to appoint one or more sub-agents for the purpose of
retaining physical possession of the Pledged Securities, which may be held (in
the discretion of the Pledgee) in the name of the relevant Pledgor, endorsed or
assigned in blank or in favor of the Pledgee or any nominee or nominees of the
Pledgee or a sub-agent appointed by the Pledgee.

          5.        VOTING, ETC., WHILE NO EVENT OF DEFAULT. Unless and until
there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default, each Pledgor
shall be entitled to exercise all voting rights attaching to any and all Pledged
Securities owned by it, and to give consents, waivers or ratifications in
respect thereof, PROVIDED that no vote shall be cast or any consent, waiver or
ratification given or any action taken which would violate, result in breach of
any covenant contained in, or be inconsistent with, any of the terms of this
Agreement, the Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document or any Secured
Interest Rate Agreement (collectively, the "SECURED DEBT AGREEMENTS"), or which
would have the effect of impairing the value of the Collateral or any part
thereof or the position or interests of the Pledgee or any other Secured
Creditor therein. All such rights of a Pledgor to vote and to give consents,
waivers and ratifications shall cease in case an Event of Default shall occur
and be continuing and Section 7 hereof shall become applicable.

          6.        DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS. Unless and until an Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, all cash dividends,
distributions or other amounts payable in respect of the Pledged Securities
shall be paid to the respective Pledgor, PROVIDED that all dividends,
distributions or other amounts payable in respect of the Pledged Securities
which are determined by the Pledgee, in its absolute discretion, to represent in
whole or in part an extraordinary, liquidating or other distribution in return
of capital not permitted by the Credit Agreement shall be paid, to the extent so
determined to represent an extraordinary, liquidating or other distribution in
return of capital not permitted by the Credit Agreement, to the

                                       -9-
<Page>

Pledgee and retained by it as part of the Collateral (unless such cash dividends
or distributions are applied to repay the Obligations pursuant to Section 9 of
this Agreement). The Pledgee shall also be entitled to receive directly, and to
retain as part of the Collateral:

          (i)       all other or additional stock, notes, membership interests,
     partnership interests or other securities or property (other than cash)
     paid or distributed by way of dividend or otherwise in respect of the
     Collateral;

          (ii)      all other or additional stock, notes, membership interests,
     partnership interests or other securities or property (including cash) paid
     or distributed in respect of the Collateral by way of stock-split,
     spin-off, split-up, reclassification, combination of shares or similar
     rearrangement; and

          (iii)     all other or additional stock, notes, membership interests,
     partnership interests or other securities or property (including cash)
     which may be paid in respect of the Collateral by reason of any
     consolidation, merger, exchange of stock, conveyance of assets, liquidation
     or similar corporate reorganization (other than the Net Cash Proceeds from
     any Asset Sale applied to repay Loans and/or reinvested in accordance with
     the relevant provisions of the Credit Agreement).

Nothing contained in this Section 6 shall limit or restrict in any way the
Pledgee's right to receive the proceeds of the Collateral in any form in
accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement. All dividends, distributions or
other payments which are received by the respective Pledgor contrary to the
provisions of this Section 6 or Section 7 shall be received in trust for the
benefit of the Pledgee, shall be segregated from other property or funds of such
Pledgor and shall be forthwith paid over to the Pledgee as Collateral in the
same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).

          7.        REMEDIES IN CASE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT. (a) In case an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Pledgee shall be
entitled to exercise all of the rights, powers and remedies (whether vested in
it by this Agreement or any other Secured Debt Agreement or by law) for the
protection and enforcement of its rights in respect of the Collateral,
including, without limitation, all the rights and remedies of a secured party
upon default under the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York, and the
Pledgee shall be entitled, without limitation, to exercise any or all of the
following rights, which each Pledgor hereby agrees to be commercially
reasonable:

          (i)       to receive all amounts payable in respect of the Collateral
     otherwise payable under Section 6 to such Pledgor;

          (ii)      to transfer all or any part of the Collateral into the
     Pledgee' s name or the name of its nominee or nominees;

          (iii)     to accelerate any Pledged Note which may be accelerated in
     accordance with its terms, and take any other lawful action to collect upon
     any Pledged Note (including, without limitation, to make any demand for
     payment thereon);

                                      -10-
<Page>

          (iv)      to vote all or any part of the Collateral (whether or not
     transferred into the name of the Pledgee) and give all consents, waivers
     and ratifications in respect of the Collateral and otherwise act with
     respect thereto as though it were the outright owner thereof (each Pledgor
     hereby irrevocably constituting and appointing the Pledgee the proxy and
     attorney-in-fact of such Pledgor, with full power of substitution to do
     so);

          (v)       to set off any and all Collateral against any and all
     Obligations, and to withdraw any and all cash or other Collateral from any
     and all Collateral Accounts and to apply such cash and other Collateral to
     the payment of any and all Obligations; and

          (vi)      at any time or from time to time to sell, assign and
     deliver, or grant options to purchase, all or any part of the Collateral,
     or any interest therein, at any public or private sale, without demand of
     performance, advertisement or notice of intention to sell or of the time or
     place of sale or adjournment thereof or to redeem or otherwise (all of
     which are hereby waived by each Pledgor), for cash, on credit or for other
     property, for immediate or future delivery without any assumption of credit
     risk, and for such price or prices and on such terms as the Pledgee in its
     absolute discretion may determine, PROVIDED that at least 10 days' notice
     of the time and place of any such sale shall be given to such Pledgor. The
     Pledgee shall not be obligated to make such sale of Collateral regardless
     of whether any such notice of sale has theretofore been given. Each
     purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property so sold absolutely free
     from any claim or right on the part of any Pledgor, and each Pledgor hereby
     waives and releases to the fullest extent permitted by law any right or
     equity of redemption with respect to the Collateral, whether before or
     after sale hereunder, all rights, if any, of marshalling the Collateral and
     any other security for the Obligations or otherwise, and all rights, if
     any, of stay and/or appraisal which it now has or may at any time in the
     future have under rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
     At any such sale, unless prohibited by applicable law, the Pledgee on
     behalf of all Secured Creditors (or certain of them) may bid for and
     purchase (by bidding in Obligations or otherwise) all or any part of the
     Collateral so sold free from any such right or equity of redemption.
     Neither the Pledgee nor any Secured Creditor shall be liable for failure to
     collect or realize upon any or all of the Collateral or for any delay in so
     doing nor shall it be under any obligation to take any action whatsoever
     with regard thereto.

          8.        REMEDIES, ETC., CUMULATIVE. Each right, power and remedy of
the Pledgee provided for in this Agreement or any other Secured Debt Agreement,
or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute shall be
cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other such right,
power or remedy. The exercise or beginning of the exercise by the Pledgee or any
other Secured Creditor of any one or more of the rights, powers or remedies
provided for in this Agreement or any other Secured Debt Agreement or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall not
preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by the Pledgee or any other Secured
Creditor of all such other rights, powers or remedies, and no failure or delay
on the part of the Pledgee or any other Secured Creditor to exercise any such
right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof. Unless otherwise
required by the Credit Documents, no notice to or demand on any Pledgor in any
case shall entitle it to any other or further notice or demand in similar other
circumstances or constitute a waiver of any of the rights of the Pledgee or any
other Secured Creditor to any other

                                      -11-
<Page>

further action in any circumstances without demand or notice. The Secured
Creditors agree that this Agreement may be enforced only by the action of the
Administrative Agent or the Pledgee, in each case acting upon the instructions
of the Required Lenders (or, after the date on which all Credit Document
Obligations have been paid in full, the holders of at least the majority of the
outstanding Interest Rate Obligations) and that no other Secured Creditor shall
have any right individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Agreement or
to realize upon the security to be granted hereby, it being understood and
agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the Administrative
Agent or the Pledgee or the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding
Interest Rate Obligations, as the case may be, for the benefit of the Secured
Creditors upon the terms of this Agreement.

          9.        APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. (a) All moneys collected by the
Pledgee or the Collateral Agent upon any sale or other disposition of the
Collateral, together with all other moneys received by the Pledgee or the
Collateral Agent hereunder, shall be applied as follows:

          (i)       FIRST, to the payment of all Obligations owing to the
     Pledgee or the Collateral Agent of the type described in clauses (iii) and
     (iv) of the definition of "Obligations" contained in Section 1 hereof;

          (ii)      SECOND, to the extent proceeds remain after the application
     pursuant to preceding clause (1), an amount equal to the outstanding
     Obligations to the Secured Creditors shall be paid to the Secured Creditors
     as provided in Section 9(c) with each Secured Creditor receiving an amount
     equal to its Outstanding Obligations or, if the proceeds are insufficient
     to pay in full all such Obligations, its PRO RATA Share of the amount
     remaining to be distributed to be applied, with respect to the Credit
     Document Obligations, firstly to the payment of interest in respect of the
     unpaid principal amount of Loans outstanding, secondly to the payment of
     principal of Loans outstanding, then to the other Credit Document
     Obligations; and

          (iii)     THIRD, to the extent proceeds remain after the application
     pursuant to the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) and following the
     termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 18 hereof, to the
     relevant Pledgor or, to the extent directed by such Pledgor or a court of
     competent jurisdiction, to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive
     such surplus.

          (b)       For purposes of this Agreement, "PRO RATA SHARE" shall mean,
when calculating a Secured Creditor's portion of any distribution or amount, the
amount (expressed as a percentage) equal to a fraction the numerator of which is
the then outstanding amount of the relevant Obligations owed such Secured
Creditor and the denominator of which is the then outstanding amount of all
Obligations.

          (c)       All payments required to be made to the (i) Lender Creditors
hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
respective Lender Creditors and (ii) Interest Rate Creditors hereunder shall be
made to the paying agent under the applicable Secured Interest Rate Agreement
or, in the case of Secured Interest Rate Agreements without a paying agent,
directly to the applicable Interest Rate Creditor.

                                      -12-
<Page>

          (d)       For purposes of applying payments received in accordance
with this Section 9, the Pledgee and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon (i) the Administrative Agent for a determination (which the
Administrative Agent agrees to provide upon request to the Pledgee and the
Collateral Agent) of the outstanding Credit Document Obligations and (ii) any
Interest Rate Creditor for a determination (which each Interest Rate Creditor
agrees to provide upon request to the Pledgee and the Collateral Agent) of the
outstanding Interest Rate Obligations owed to such Interest Rate Creditor.
Unless it has actual knowledge (including by way of written notice from a
Secured Creditor) to the contrary, the Administrative Agent under the Credit
Agreement, in furnishing information pursuant to the preceding sentence, and the
Pledgee and the Collateral Agent, in acting hereunder, shall be entitled to
assume that (x) no Credit Document Obligations other than principal, interest
and regularly accruing fees are owing to any Lender Creditor and (y) no Secured
Interest Rate Agreements or Interest Rate Obligations with respect thereto are
in existence.

          (e)       It is understood that the Pledgors shall remain jointly and
severally liable to the extent of any deficiency between (x) the amount of the
Obligations for which it is liable directly or as a Guarantor that are satisfied
with proceeds of the Collateral and (y) the aggregate outstanding amount of the
Obligations.

          10.       PURCHASERS OF COLLATERAL. Upon any sale of the Collateral by
the Pledgee hereunder (whether by virtue of the power of sale herein granted,
pursuant to judicial process or otherwise), the receipt of the Pledgee or the
officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or
purchasers of the Collateral so sold, and such purchaser or purchasers shall not
be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid
over to the Pledgee or such officer or be answerable in any way for the
misapplication or nonapplication thereof.

          11.       INDEMNITY. Each Pledgor jointly and severally agrees (i) to
indemnify and hold harmless the Pledgee and the other Secured Creditors from and
against any and all claims, demands, losses, judgments and liabilities
(including liabilities for penalties) of whatsoever kind or nature, and (ii) to
reimburse the Pledgee for all reasonable costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, arising in connection with any amendment, waiver or
modification to this Agreement and the Pledgee and the other Secured Creditors
for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees)
growing out of or resulting from the exercise by the Pledgee of any right or
remedy granted to it hereunder or under any other Secured Debt Agreement except,
with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, for those arising from the Pledgee's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. In no event shall the Pledgee be liable,
in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, for any
matter or thing in connection with this Agreement other than to account for
moneys or other property actually received by it in accordance with the terms
hereof. If and to the extent that the obligations of any Pledgor under this
Section 11 are unenforceable for any reason, such Pledgor hereby agrees to make
the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such obligations
which is permissible under applicable law.

          12.       FURTHER ASSURANCES; POWER OF ATTORNEY. (a) Each Pledgor
agrees that it will join with the Pledgee in executing and, at such Pledgor's
own expense, file and refile under the Uniform Commercial Code such financing
statements, continuation statements

                                      -13-
<Page>

and other documents in such offices as the Pledgee may deem necessary or
appropriate and wherever required or permitted by law in order to perfect and
preserve the Pledgee's security interest in the Collateral hereunder and hereby
authorizes the Pledgee to file financing statements and amendments thereto
relative to all or any part of the Collateral without the signature of such
Pledgor where permitted by law, and agrees to do such further acts and things
and to execute and deliver to the Pledgee such additional conveyances,
assignments, agreements and instruments as the Pledgee may reasonably require or
deem advisable to carry into effect the purposes of this Agreement or to further
assure and confirm unto the Pledgee its rights, powers and remedies hereunder or
thereunder.

          (b)       Each Pledgor hereby appoints the Pledgee, such Pledgor's
attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Pledgor and
in the name of such Pledgor or otherwise, from time to time after the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, in the Pledgee's reasonable
discretion to take any action and to execute any instrument which the Pledgee
may reasonably deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this
Agreement.

          13.       THE PLEDGEE AS COLLATERAL AGENT. The Pledgee will hold in
accordance with this Agreement all items of the Collateral at any time received
under this Agreement. It is expressly understood and agreed that the obligations
of the Pledgee as holder of the Collateral and interests therein and with
respect to the disposition thereof, and otherwise under this Agreement, are only
those expressly set forth in this Agreement. The Pledgee shall act hereunder on
the terms and conditions set forth herein and in Section 10 of the Credit
Agreement.

          14.       TRANSFER BY THE PLEDGORS. No Pledgor will sell or otherwise
dispose of, grant any option with respect to, or mortgage, pledge or otherwise
encumber any of the Collateral or any interest therein (except in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the other Secured Debt Agreements).

          15.       REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE PLEDGORS.
(a) Each Pledgor represents, warrants and covenants that:

          (i)       it is, or at the time when pledged hereunder will be, the
     legal, beneficial and record owner of, and has (or will have) good and
     marketable title to, all Securities pledged by it hereunder, subject to no
     pledge, lien, mortgage, hypothecation, security interest, charge, option or
     other encumbrance whatsoever, except (x) the liens and security interests
     created by this Agreement and (y) liens permitted by Section 7.03(a) of the
     Credit Agreement;

     the Collateral pledged by it pursuant to this Agreement;

          (iii)     this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
     delivered by such Pledgor and constitutes a legal, valid and binding
     obligation of such Pledgor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except
     to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable
     bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar

                                      -14-
<Page>

     laws generally affecting creditors' rights and by equitable principles
     (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law);

          (iv)      except to the extent already obtained or made, no consent of
     any other party (including, without limitation, any stockholder, limited or
     general partner, member or creditor of such Pledgor or any of its
     Subsidiaries) and no consent, license, permit, approval or authorization
     of, exemption by, notice or report to, or registration, filing or
     declaration with, any governmental authority is required to be obtained by
     such Pledgor in connection with (a) the execution, delivery or performance
     of this Agreement, (b) the validity or enforceability of this Agreement,
     (c) the perfection or enforceability of the Pledgee's security interest in
     the Collateral or (d) except for compliance with or as may be required by
     applicable securities laws, the exercise by the Pledgee of any of its
     rights or remedies provided herein;

          (v)       the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
     such Pledgor will not violate any provision of any applicable law or
     regulation or of any order, judgment, writ, award or decree of any court,
     arbitrator or governmental authority, domestic or foreign, applicable to
     such Pledgor, or of the certificate of incorporation, certificate of
     formation, by-laws, certificate of limited partnership, partnership
     agreement or limited liability company agreement, as the case may be, of
     such Pledgor or of any securities issued by such Pledgor or any of its
     Subsidiaries, or of any mortgage, indenture, lease, loan agreement, credit
     agreement or other material contract, agreement or instrument or
     undertaking to which such Pledgor or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
     which purports to be binding upon such Pledgor or any of its Subsidiaries
     or upon any of their respective assets and will not result in the creation
     or imposition of (or the obligation to create or impose) any lien or
     encumbrance on any of the assets of such Pledgor or any of its Subsidiaries
     except as contemplated by this Agreement;

          (vi)      all the shares of the Stock have been duly and validly
     issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are subject to no options to
     purchase or similar rights;

          (vii)     each of the Pledged Notes constitutes, or when executed by
     the obligor thereof will constitute, the legal, valid and binding
     obligation of such obligor, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
     except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by
     applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
     similar laws generally affecting creditors' rights and by equitable
     principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at
     law);

          (viii)    the pledge, assignment and delivery to the Pledgee of the
     Securities (other than those constituting Uncertificated Securities)
     pursuant to this Agreement creates a valid and, assuming such Securities
     are held in the continued possession of the Collateral Agent in the State
     of New York, perfected first priority Lien in the Securities and the
     proceeds thereof; subject to no other Lien or to any agreement purporting
     to grant to any third party a Lien on the property or assets of such
     Pledgor which would include the Securities (other than Liens permitted by
     Section 7.03(a) of the Credit Agreement);

                                      -15-
<Page>

          (ix)      it has the unqualified right to pledge and grant a security
     interest in the Partnership Interests and Membership Interests as herein
     provided without the consent of any other Person, firm, association or
     entity which has not been obtained;

          (x)       the Partnership Interests and the Membership Interests
     pledged by it pursuant to this Agreement have been validly acquired and are
     fully paid for and are duly and validly pledged hereunder;

          (xi)      it is not in default in the payment of any portion of any
     mandatory capital contribution, if any, required to be made under any
     partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement to which such
     Pledgor is a party, and such Pledgor is not in violation of any other
     material provisions of any partnership agreement or limited liability
     company agreement to which such Pledgor is a party, or otherwise in default
     or violation thereunder, no Partnership Interest or Membership Interest is
     subject to any defense, offset or counterclaim, nor have any of the
     foregoing been asserted or alleged against such Pledgor by any Person with
     respect thereto and as of the Closing Date, there are no certificates,
     instruments, documents or other writings (other than the partnership
     agreements and certificates, if any, delivered to the Collateral Agent)
     which evidence any Partnership Interest or Membership Interest of such
     Pledgor;

          (xii)     the pledge and assignment of the Partnership Interests and
     the Membership Interests pursuant to this Agreement, together with the
     relevant filings, consents or recordings (which filings, consents and
     recordings have been made or obtained), creates a valid, perfected and
     continuing first security interest in such Partnership Interests and
     Membership Interest and the proceeds thereof; subject to no prior lien or
     encumbrance or to any agreement purporting to grant to any third party a
     lien or encumbrance on the property or assets of such Pledgor which would
     include the Collateral;

          (xiii)    there are no currently effective financing statements under
     the UCC covering any property which is now or hereafter may be included in
     the Collateral and such Pledgor will not, without the prior written consent
     of the Pledgee, execute and, until the Termination Date (as hereinafter
     defined), there will not ever be on file in any public office, any
     enforceable financing statement or statements covering any or all of the
     Collateral, except financing statements filed or to be filed in favor of
     the Pledgee as secured party;

          (xiv)     it shall give the Pledgee prompt notice of any written claim
     relating to the Collateral and shall deliver to the Pledgee a copy of each
     other demand, notice or document received by it which may adversely affect
     the Pledgee's interest in the Collateral promptly upon, but in any event
     within 10 days after, such Pledgor's receipt thereof;

          (xv)      it shall not withdraw as a partner of any Pledged
     Partnership or member of any Pledged LLC, or file or pursue or take any
     action which may, directly or indirectly, cause a dissolution or
     liquidation of or with respect to any Pledged Partnership or

                                      -16-
<Page>

     Pledged LLC or seek a partition of any property of any Pledged Partnership
     or Pledged LLC, except as permitted by the Credit Agreement;

          (xvi)     as of the date hereof; all of its Partnership Interests and
     Membership Interests are uncertificated and each Pledgor covenants and
     agrees that it will not approve of any action by any Pledged Partnership or
     Pledged LLC to convert such uncertificated interests into certificated
     interests;

          (xvii)    it will take no action which would violate or be
     inconsistent with any of the terms of any Secured Debt Agreement, or which
     would have the effect of impairing the position or interests of the Pledgee
     or any other Secured Creditor under any Secured Debt Agreement except as
     permitted by the Credit Agreement; and

          (xviii)   "control" (as defined in Section 8-106 of the UCC) has been
     obtained by the Pledgee over all of such Pledgor's Collateral consisting of
     Securities (including, without limitation, Notes which are Securities) with
     respect to which such "control" may be obtained pursuant to Section 8-106
     of the UCC, except to the extent that the obligation of the applicable
     Pledgor to provide the Pledgee with "control" of such Collateral has not
     yet arisen under this Agreement; PROVIDED that in the case of the Pledgee
     obtaining "control" over Collateral consisting of a Security Entitlement,
     such Pledgor shall have taken all steps in its control so that the Pledgee
     obtains "control" over such Security Entitlement.

          16.       PLEDGORS' OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE, ETC. The obligations of each
Pledgor under this Agreement shall be absolute and unconditional and shall
remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released,
suspended, discharged, terminated or otherwise affected by, any circumstance or
occurrence whatsoever, including, without limitation:

          (i)       any renewal, extension, amendment or modification of, or
     addition or supplement to or deletion from any of the Secured Debt
     Agreements, or any other instrument or agreement referred to therein, or
     any assignment or transfer of any thereof;

          (ii)      any waiver, consent, extension, indulgence or other action
     or inaction under or in respect of any such agreement or instrument or this
     Agreement;

          (iii)     any furnishing of any additional security to the Pledgee or
     its assignee or any acceptance thereof or any release of any security by
     the Pledgee or its assignee;

          (iv)      any limitation on any party's liability or obligations under
     any such instrument or agreement or any invalidity or unenforceability, in
     whole or in part, of any such instrument or agreement or any term thereof;
     or

          (v)       any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, composition,
     adjustment, dissolution, liquidation or other like proceeding relating to
     such Pledgor or any Subsidiary of such Pledgor, or any action taken with
     respect to this Agreement by any trustee or receiver, or by any court, in
     any such proceeding, whether or not such Pledgor shall have notice or
     knowledge of any of the foregoing.

                                      -17-

          17.       REGISTRATION, ETC. (a) If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing and any Pledgor shall have received from the Pledgee
a written request or requests that such Pledgor cause any registration,
qualification or compliance under any Federal or state securities law or laws to
be effected with respect to all or any part of the Pledged Stock, such Pledgor
as soon as practicable and at its expense will use its best efforts to cause
such registration to be effected (and be kept effective) and will use its best
efforts to cause such qualification and compliance to be effected (and be kept
effective) as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and
distribution of such Pledged Stock, including, without limitation, registration
under the Securities Act of 1933, as then in effect (or any similar statute then
in effect), appropriate qualifications under applicable blue sky or other state
securities laws and appropriate compliance with any other governmental
requirements, PROVIDED that the Pledgee shall furnish to such Pledgor such
information regarding the Pledgee as such Pledgor may request in writing and as
shall be required in connection with any such registration, qualification or
compliance. Each Pledgor will cause the Pledgee to be kept reasonably advised in
writing as to the progress of each such registration, qualification or
compliance and as to the completion thereof; will furnish to the Pledgee such
number of prospectuses, offering circulars and other documents incident thereto
as the Pledgee from time to time may reasonably request, and will indemnify, to
the extent permitted by law, the Pledgee, each other Secured Creditor and all
others participating in the distribution of such Pledged Stock against all
claims, losses, damages or liabilities caused by any untrue statement (or
alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained therein (or in any
related registration statement, notification or the like) or by any omission (or
alleged omission) to state therein (or in any related registration statement,
notification or the like) a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the
same may have been caused by an untrue statement or omission based upon
information furnished in writing to such Pledgor by the Pledgee or such other
Secured Creditor expressly for use therein.

          (b)       If at any time when the Pledgee shall determine to exercise
its right to sell all or any part of the Pledged Securities pursuant to Section
7, and such Pledged Securities or the part thereof to be sold shall not, for any
reason whatsoever, be effectively registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
as then in effect, the Pledgee may, in its sole and absolute discretion, sell
such Pledged Securities or part thereof by private sale in such manner and under
such circumstances as the Pledgee may deem necessary or advisable in order that
such sale may legally be effected without such registration. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, in any such event the Pledgee, in its sole and
absolute discretion, (i) may proceed to make such private sale notwithstanding
that a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Pledged
Securities or part thereof shall have been filed under such Securities Act, (ii)
may approach and negotiate with a single possible purchaser to effect such sale
and (iii) may restrict such sale to a purchaser who will represent and agree
that such purchaser is purchasing for its own account, for investment, and not
with a view to the distribution or sale of such Pledged Securities or part
thereof. In the event of any such sale, the Pledgee shall incur no
responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the Pledged
Securities at a price which the Pledgee, in its sole and absolute discretion,
may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the
possibility that a substantially higher price might be realized if the sale were
deferred until the registration as aforesaid.

          18.       TERMINATION; RELEASE. (a) After the Termination Date (as
defined below), this Agreement shall terminate (PROVIDED that all indemnities
set forth herein including, without limitation, in Section 11 hereof shall
survive any such termination) and the Pledgee, at the request and expense of the
respective Pledgor, will execute and deliver to such Pledgor a proper instrument
or instruments acknowledging the satisfaction and termination of this Agreement
as provided above, and will duly assign, transfer and deliver to such Pledgor
(without recourse and without any representation or warranty) such of the
Collateral as may be in the possession of the Pledgee and as has not theretofore
been sold or otherwise applied or released pursuant to this Agreement, together
with any moneys at the time held by the Pledgee hereunder and, with respect to
any Collateral consisting of an Uncertificated Security, a Partnership Interest
or a Membership Interest (other than an Uncertificated Security, Partnership
Interest or Membership Interest credited on the books of a Clearing Corporation
or Securities Intermediary), a termination of the agreement relating thereto
executed and delivered by the issuer of such Uncertificated Security pursuant to
Section 3.2(a)(ii) or by the respective partnership or limited liability company
pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(iv)(2). As used in this Agreement, "TERMINATION DATE"
shall mean the date upon which the Total Commitment and all Secured Interest
Rate Agreements have been terminated, no Note under the Credit Agreement is
outstanding (and all Loans have been paid in full) and all other Obligations
have been paid in full (other than arising from indemnities for which no request
has been made).

          (b)       In the event that any part of the Collateral is sold or
otherwise disposed of in connection with a sale or other disposition permitted
by Section 7.02 of the Credit Agreement or is otherwise released at the
direction of the Required Lenders (or all the Lenders if required by Section
11.12 of the Credit Agreement), and the proceeds of such sale or other
disposition or from such release are applied in accordance with the terms of the
Credit Agreement to the extent required to be so applied, the Pledgee, at the
request and expense of the respective Pledgor, will release such Collateral from
this Agreement, duly assign, transfer and deliver to such Pledgor (without
recourse and without any representation or warranty) such of the Collateral as
is then being (or has been) so sold, disposed of or released and as may be in
possession of the Pledgee and has not theretofore been released pursuant to this
Agreement.

          (c)       At any time that any Pledgor desires that Collateral be
released as provided in the foregoing Section 18(a) or (b), it shall deliver to
the Pledgee a certificate signed by a principal executive officer stating that
the release of the respective Collateral is permitted pursuant to Section 18(a)
or (b). The Pledgee shall have no liability whatsoever to any Secured Creditor
as the result of any release of Collateral by it in accordance with (or which
the Pledgee in the absence of gross negligence and willful misconduct believes
to be in accordance with) this Section 18.

          19.       NOTICES, ETC. All notices and other communications hereunder
shall be in writing (including telegraphic, telex, telecopier, facsimile or
cable communication) and shall be delivered, telegraphed, telexed, telecopied,

     Creditor shall have specified in the Credit Agreement;

          (iv)      if to any Interest Rate Creditor, at such address as such
     Interest Rate Creditor shall have specified in writing to the Pledgors and
     the Pledgee;

or at such other address as shall have been furnished in writing by any Person
described above to the party required to give notice hereunder.

          20.       WAIVER; AMENDMENT. None of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement may be changed, waived, modified or varied in any manner whatsoever
unless in writing duly signed by the Pledgee (with the consent of the Required
Lenders or, to the extent required by Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement, all
of the Lenders) and each Pledgor affected thereby, PROVIDED that (i) no such
change, waiver, modification or variance shall be made to Section 9 hereof or
this Section 20 without the consent of each Secured Creditor adversely affected
thereby and (ii) any change, waiver, modification or variance affecting the
rights and benefits of a single Class (as defined below) of Secured Creditors
(and not all Secured Creditors in a like or similar manner) shall require the
written consent of the Requisite Creditors (as defined below) of such Class of
Secured Creditors. For the purpose of this Agreement, the term "CLASS" shall
mean each class of Secured Creditors, i.e whether (x) the Lender Creditors as
holders of the Credit Document Obligations or (y) the Interest Rate Creditors as
holders of the Interest Rate Obligations. For the purpose of this Agreement, the
term "REQUISITE CREDITORS" of any Class shall mean each of (x) with respect to
each of the Credit Document Obligations, the Required Lenders and (y) with
respect to the Interest Rate Obligations, the holders of at least a majority of
all obligations outstanding from time to time under the Secured Interest Rate
Agreements.

          21.       PLEDGEE NOT BOUND. (a) Nothing herein shall be construed to
make the Pledgee or any other Secured Creditor liable as a general partner or
limited partner of any Pledged Partnership or a member of any Pledged LLC or a
shareholder of any corporation, and neither the Pledgee nor any Secured Creditor
by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise (except as referred to in the following
sentence) shall have any of the duties, obligations or liabilities of a general
partner or limited partner of any Pledged Partnership or a member of any Pledged
LLC or a stockholder of any corporation. The parties hereto expressly agree
that, unless the Pledgee shall become the absolute owner of a Partnership
Interest, a Membership Interest or Stock

                                      -20-
<Page>

pursuant hereto, this Agreement shall not be construed as creating a partnership
or joint venture or membership agreement among the Pledgee, any other Secured
Creditor and/or a Pledgor.

          (b)       Except as provided in the last sentence of paragraph (a) of
this Section 21, the Pledgee, by accepting this Agreement, did not intend to
become a general partner or limited partner of any Pledged Partnership or a
member of any Pledged LLC or a shareholder of any corporation or otherwise be
deemed to be a co-venturer with respect to any Pledgor or any Pledged
Partnership or a member of any Pledged LLC or a shareholder of any corporation
either before or after an Event of Default shall have occurred. The Pledgee
shall have only those powers set forth herein and shall assume none of the
duties, obligations or liabilities of a general partner or limited partner of
any Pledged Partnership or of a member of any Pledged LLC or of a Pledgor.

          (c)       The Pledgee shall not be obligated to perform or discharge
any obligation of a Pledgor as a result of the collateral assignment hereby
effected.

          (d)       The acceptance by the Pledgee of this Agreement, with all
the rights, powers, privileges and authority so created, shall not at any time
or in any event obligate the Pledgee to appear in or defend any action or
proceeding relating to the Collateral to which it is not a party, or to take any
action hereunder or thereunder, or to expend any money or incur any expenses or
perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability under the Collateral.

          22.       MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement shall create a continuing
security interest in the Collateral and shall (i) remain in full force and
effect, subject to release and/or termination as set forth in Section 18, (ii)
be binding upon each Pledgor, its successors and assigns; PROVIDED that no
Pledgor shall assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of the Pledgee (with the prior written consent of the
Required Lenders or to the extent required by Section 11.12 of the Credit
Agreement, all of the Lenders), and (iii) inure, together with the rights and
remedies of the Pledgee hereunder, to the benefit of the Pledgee, the other
Secured Creditors and their respective successors, transferees and assigns. The
headings of the several sections and subsections in this Agreement are for
purposes of reference only and shall not limit or define the meaning hereof.
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one instrument.
In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall prove to be invalid or
unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed to be severable from the other
provisions of this Agreement which shall remain binding on all parties hereto.

          23.       GOVERNING LAW, ETC. (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE SECURED CREDITORS AND OF THE UNDERSIGNED HEREUNDER SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS. Any legal action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement or any other Credit Document may be brought in
the courts of the State of New York or of the United States of America for the
Southern District of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement,
each NSG Pledgor hereby irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect of its
property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts. Each NSG Pledgor further irrevocably consents to the service of process
out of

                                      -21-
<Page>

any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the
mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to
each NSG Pledgor at its address set forth opposite its signature below, such
service to become effective 30 days after such mailing. Nothing herein shall
affect the right of any of the Secured Creditors to serve process in any other
manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed
against any Pledgor in any other jurisdiction.

          (b)       Each NSG Pledgor hereby irrevocably waives any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the
aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Credit Document brought in the courts referred to in
clause (a) above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead
or claim in any such court that such action or proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

          (c)       Each Pledgor and the Pledgee hereby irrevocably waive all
right to a trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, the other Credit Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

          24.       ADDITIONAL PLEDGORS. It is understood and agreed that any
Subsidiary of the Borrower that is required to execute a counterpart of this
Agreement pursuant to the Credit Agreement shall become a Pledgor hereunder by
executing a counterpart hereof and delivering the same to the Pledgee and
Annexes A, B, C and D will be modified at such time in a manner acceptable to
the Pledgee to give effect to such additional Pledgor.

          25.       COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of
which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A set of
counterparts executed by all the parties hereto shall be lodged with each
Pledgor and the Pledgee.

          26.       CONTRIBUTION. At any time a payment is made by any Pledgor
(other than the Borrower) (each, a "SUBSIDIARY PLEDGOR") in respect of the
Obligations from the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of Collateral
owned by such Subsidiary Pledgor (each, a "RELEVANT PAYMENT"), the right of
contribution of each Subsidiary Pledgor hereunder against each other such
Subsidiary Pledgor shall be determined as provided in the immediately following
sentence, with the right of contribution of each Subsidiary Pledgor to be
revised and restated as of each date on which a Relevant Payment is made. At any
time that a Relevant Payment is made by a Subsidiary Pledgor that results in the
aggregate payments made by such Subsidiary Pledgor hereunder in respect of the
Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment exceeding such
Subsidiary Pledgor's Contribution Percentage (as defined below) of the aggregate
payments made by all Subsidiary Pledgors hereunder in respect of the Obligations
from the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of Collateral owned by the
Subsidiary Pledgors to and including the date of the Relevant Payment (such
excess, the "AGGREGATE EXCESS AMOUNT"), each such Subsidiary Pledgor shall have
a right of contribution against each other Subsidiary Pledgor who has made (or
whose Collateral has been used to make) payments hereunder in respect of the
Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment in an aggregate
amount less than such other Subsidiary Pledgor's Contribution Percentage of the

                                      -22-
<Page>

aggregate payments made to and including the date of the Relevant Payment by all
Subsidiary Pledgors hereunder in respect of the Obligations from the proceeds of
any sale or other disposition of Collateral owned by the Subsidiary Pledgors
(the aggregate amount of such deficit, the "AGGREGATE DEFICIT AMOUNT") in an
amount equal to (x) a fraction the numerator of which is the Aggregate Excess
Amount of such Subsidiary Pledgor and the denominator of which is the Aggregate
Excess Amount of all Subsidiary Pledgors multiplied by (y) the Aggregate Deficit
Amount of such other Subsidiary Pledgor. A Subsidiary Pledgor's right of
contribution pursuant to the preceding sentences shall arise at the time of each
computation, subject to adjustment to the time of any subsequent computation;
PROVIDED, that no Subsidiary Pledgor may take any action to enforce such right
until the Obligations have been paid in full and the Total Commitment has been
terminated, it being expressly recognized and agreed by all parties hereto that
any Subsidiary Pledgor's right of contribution arising pursuant to this
Agreement against any other Subsidiary Pledgor shall be expressly junior and
subordinate to such other Subsidiary Pledgor's obligations and liabilities in
respect of the Obligations and any other obligations owing under this Agreement.
As used in this Section 26: (i) each Subsidiary Pledgor's "CONTRIBUTION
PERCENTAGE" shall mean the percentage obtained by dividing (x) the Adjusted Net
Worth (as defined below) of such Subsidiary Pledgor by (y) the aggregate
Adjusted Net Worth of all Subsidiary Pledgors; (ii) the "ADJUSTED NET WORTH" of
each Subsidiary Pledgor shall mean the greater of (x) the Net Worth (as defined
below) of such Subsidiary Pledgor and (y) zero; and (iii) the "NET WORTH" of
each Subsidiary Pledgor shall mean the amount by which the fair salable value of
such Subsidiary Pledgor's assets on the date of any Relevant Payment exceeds its
existing debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities, but
without giving effect to any obligations arising under this Agreement) on such
date. All parties hereto recognize and agree that, except for any right of
contribution arising pursuant to this Section 26, each Subsidiary Pledgor who
makes (or whose Collateral has been used to make) any payment in respect of the
Obligations shall have no right of contribution or subrogation against any other
Subsidiary Pledgor in respect of such payment. Each of the Subsidiary Pledgors
recognizes and acknowledges that the rights to contribution arising hereunder
shall constitute an asset in favor of the party entitled to such contribution.
In this connection, each Subsidiary Pledgor has the right to waive its
contribution right against any Subsidiary Pledgor to the extent that after
giving effect to such waiver such Subsidiary Pledgor would remain solvent, in
the determination of the Required Lenders.

          27.       LEGAL NAMES; TYPE OF ORGANIZATION (AND WHETHER A REGISTERED
ORGANIZATION AND/OR A TRANSMITTING UTILITY); JURISDICTION OF ORGANIZATION;
LOCATION; ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS; CHANGES THERETO; ETC. No
Pledgor shall change its legal name, its type of organization, its status as a
Registered Organization (in the case of a Registered Organization), its status
as a Transmitting Utility or as a Person which is not a Transmitting Utility, as
the case may be, its jurisdiction of organization, its Location, or its
organizational identification number (if any), except that any such changes
shall be permitted (so long as not in violation of the applicable requirements
of the Secured Debt Agreements and so long as same do not involve (x) a
Registered Organization ceasing to constitute same or (y) any Pledgor changing
its jurisdiction of organization or Location from the United States or a State
thereof to a jurisdiction of organization or Location, as the case may be,
outside the United States or a State thereof) if (i) it shall have given to the
Collateral Agent not less than 10 days' prior written notice of each change to
its legal name, its type of organization, whether or not it is a Registered
Organization,

                                      -23-
<Page>

its jurisdiction of organization, its Location, its organizational
identification number (if any), and whether or not it is a Transmitting Utility,
and (ii) in connection with the respective such change or changes, it shall have
taken all action reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent to maintain the
security interests of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral intended to be
granted hereby at all times fully perfected and in full force and effect. In
addition, to the extent that any Pledgor does not have an organizational
identification number on the date hereof and later obtains one, such Pledgor
shall promptly thereafter deliver a notification of the Collateral Agent of such
organizational identification number and shall take all actions reasonably
satisfactory to the Collateral Agent to the extent necessary to maintain the
security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral intended to be
granted hereby fully perfected and in full force and effect.

          28.       CHANGE OF CONTROL. The Pledgee acknowledges that, under
existing law, a change of control of a Subsidiary whose equity interests are
pledged hereunder as a result of a proposed exercise of remedies hereunder may
require the prior approval of the FCC and a PUC.

          29.       SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

          30.       HEADINGS DESCRIPTIVE. The headings of the several Sections
of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in any way
affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each Pledgor and the Pledgee have caused this
Agreement to be executed and delivered by their duly authorized officers as of
the date first above written.

regarding any or all of the Issuer Pledged Interests originated by any person or
entity other than the Pledgee (and its successors and assigns) or a court of
