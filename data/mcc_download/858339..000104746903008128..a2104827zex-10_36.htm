<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dear
Mr.&nbsp;Loveman: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harrah's
Entertainment,&nbsp;Inc. (the "Company") considers it essential to the best interest of its stockholders to foster the continuous employment of key management personnel. In
this connection, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a change in control may exist and that
such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its
stockholders. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company's management, including
yourself, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of the Company, although no such change
is now contemplated. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company or its subsidiaries and in consideration of your agreements set forth in Subsection 2(b) hereof, the Company agrees that you
shall receive the severance benefits set forth in this letter agreement ("this Agreement") in the event your employment with the Company or its subsidiaries terminates subsequent to a "Change in
Control of the Company" (as defined in Section&nbsp;2 hereof) or within six months prior to a Change in Control under the circumstances described below. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Term of Agreement.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall commence on January&nbsp;1, 2003 and shall continue in effect
through December&nbsp;31, 2003; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that commencing on January&nbsp;1, 2004 and each January&nbsp;1 thereafter, the term of this
Agreement shall automatically be extended for one additional year unless the Company shall have given you written notice that it does not wish to extend this Agreement not later than January&nbsp;1
of the preceding year in the event a Potential Change in Control has occurred or the failure to extend is done in contemplation of a Change in Control or a Potential Change in Control, or
June&nbsp;30 of the preceding year in all other events; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, further</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, if a Change in Control of the Company shall have occurred during the
original or extended term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall automatically continue in effect for a period of twenty-four months beyond the month in which such Change in Control
occurred. This Agreement will terminate on the last day of the sixth full month following the date your active employment terminates for any reason prior to a Change in Control. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
lieu of any further salary payments to you for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination, the Company shall pay as severance pay to you a lump sum severance

meaning of Section&nbsp;1504 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Annual Compensation is defined to consist of two components: (a)&nbsp;Your annual salary in effect
immediately prior to the Change in Control or in effect as of the Date of Termination, whichever annual salary is higher. Your annual salary for this purpose will be determined without any reduction
for deferrals of such salary under any deferred compensation plan (qualified or unqualified) and without any reduction for any salary reductions used for making contributions to any group insurance
plan of the Company or its affiliates and also without reduction for any other deductions from salary for any reason; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>plus</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (b)&nbsp;The average of
your annual bonuses under the Company's Annual Management Bonus Plan, or any substitute or successor plan including the Senior Executive Incentive Plan, for the three highest calendar years, in terms
of annual bonus paid to you in such years, during the five calendar years preceding the calendar year in which the Change in Control occurred. Your annual bonuses for this purpose will be determined
without any reduction for deferrals under any deferred compensation plan (qualified or unqualified) and without any reduction for salary reductions used for making contributions to any group insurance
plan of the Company or its affiliates and also without reduction for any other deductions from bonus for any reason. If you were not employed by the Company or its affiliates for a sufficient period
of time to receive annual bonuses during each of the five calendar years before the Change in Control occurred, then the average bonus will be measured using the three highest calendar years, in terms
of annual bonus paid to you, in all the consecutive calendar years immediately preceding the date the Change in Control occurred. If you were not eligible for three years of bonuses paid during the
calendar years immediately preceding the date the Change in Control occurred, then the average bonus will be the average of the annual bonuses that were paid to you during such time under such Plan.
If you were not eligible for any bonus during such time because of not being employed by the Company for a sufficient period of time to qualify for a previous bonus payment, then Annual Compensation
will only consist of the salary component as provided above and will not include a bonus component. </FONT></P>

contains the day immediately prior to the Change in Control (which target bonus will be the one that applies to your grade level at that time) regardless of whether or not any bonus was payable for
such year. The pro-rata amount will be based on the percentage of days of your employment in the calendar year of
the Date of Termination. For example, if the Date of Termination is October&nbsp;1 in a year with 365&nbsp;days, with October&nbsp;1 counted as the last day of employment for a total of
274&nbsp;days of employment that year, then the pro-rata amount will be 75.06849% of target bonus (274&nbsp;days&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;365&nbsp;days). It is understood this
target bonus will be based on the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Annual Management Bonus Plan</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> target and not the target for the Senior Executive Incentive Plan even if such Plan
applies to you. In addition, the Company shall pay to you the amounts of any approved compensation or awards payable to you or due to you under any incentive compensation plan of the Company
including, without limitation, the Company's Restricted Stock Plan, Stock Option Plan and Executive Stock Incentive Plan (the "Option Plans") and Annual Management Bonus Plan (or any substitute or
successor plan including the Senior Executive Incentive Plan) and under any agreements with you in connection therewith, and shall make any other payments and take any other actions and honor such
rights you may have accrued under such plans and agreements including any rights you may have to payments after the Date of Termination, which will include the payment to you of any bonus earned
during the bonus year fully completed prior to the Date of Termination if such Date of Termination occurs prior to the payment date for such bonus, it being understood, however, that the
pro-rata payment provided for in the first sentence of this paragraph&nbsp;4(c)(iii)&nbsp;is in lieu of any bonus earned for the bonus plan year during which occurred the Date of
Termination. </FONT></P>

Company will have no obligation to exercise the Company Cash Out Election. The Company Cash Out Election will not apply to Options you exercised before your termination or that were already cashed out
in connection with the Change in Control. To the extent the Company Cash Out Election is not exercised as to any of your Options that are outstanding at the time of a termination which entitles you to
