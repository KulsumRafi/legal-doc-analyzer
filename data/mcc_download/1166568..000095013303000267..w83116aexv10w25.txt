by and between ALION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
(the "COMPANY"), and ALION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION EMPLOYEE

forms a part of the ALION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP,
SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN (the "PLAN"). The Purchaser and the Plan are
hereinafter collectively referred to as the "ESOP." STATE STREET BANK & TRUST
COMPANY, a state chartered trust company organized under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, has executed this Agreement not in its individual
or corporate capacity, but solely on behalf of the Purchaser as trustee (the
"TRUSTEE") of the employee stock ownership plan component of the Purchaser.
Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings
assigned to them in the Asset Purchase Agreement (as defined below).

                                    RECITALS

        WHEREAS, the Company is simultaneously purchasing substantially all of
the assets related to IIT Research Institute's ("IITRI") business (as more fully
described in the Asset Purchase Agreement referred to below, the "BUSINESS") of
providing advanced technological and scientific services in the fields of
research and development, engineering, and ordnance and explosive waste
remediation, for governmental and private sponsors pursuant to the Fourth
Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement, dated November 18, 2002 between
IITRI and the Company (the "ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT"); and

        WHEREAS, the Company desires to issue and sell to the Purchaser, and the
Purchaser desires to purchase from the Company up to Three Million (3,000,000)
shares of common stock of the Company, $0.01 par value per share ("COMMON
STOCK"), that once issued will (together with 100 shares of Common Stock
referred to in Section 1.4 below) be all of the outstanding Company Stock of the
Company (together, the "SHARES"), subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual
agreements, covenants, representations and warranties hereinafter contained, the
parties hereby agree as follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

<PAGE>

        Section 1. Purchase and Sale of Shares.

        1.1 Shares to be Sold. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing (as defined in Section 2.1), the Company shall issue
and sell to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase from the Company,
the Shares.

        1.2 Purchase Price. The purchase price for each Share shall be Ten
Dollars ($10.00) and the aggregate purchase price (the "PURCHASE PRICE") shall
be an amount equal to the product of the number of Shares invested in by
employees of the Company and the Business Subsidiary (as defined below) pursuant
to the offering described in the S-1 (as defined below) multiplied by Ten
Dollars ($10.00); provided, that in no event shall the Purchase Price be less
than Twenty Four Million Dollars ($24,000,000) or greater than Thirty Million
Dollars ($30,000,000). The Purchase Price shall be payable by the Purchaser to
the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Company.

        1.3 Use of Proceeds. The Company shall use all of the proceeds of the
Purchase Price that it receives hereunder to pay a portion of the Cash Purchase
Price (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) pursuant to the Asset
Purchase Agreement.

        1.4 Special Contribution to the Initial ESOP Trust. After the Closing
Date, but no later than five Business Days thereafter, the Company shall make a
special contribution to the Beagle Holdings, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership and
401(k) Trust, established December 19, 2001 (the "INITIAL TRUST") of which Stacy
Mendler is presently the trustee (the "INITIAL TRUSTEE") as a special
contribution for the Plan's fiscal year beginning October 1, 2002. Such special
contribution shall be in an amount sufficient to enable the Initial Trustee to
repay in full all amounts borrowed by the Initial Trust to purchase the 100
shares of Common Stock held by it. It is contemplated that the Initial Trustee
will use the special contribution to immediately repay such loan. Upon such
repayment, the 100 shares of Common Stock held by the Initial Trust shall
thereupon become available for allocation to Plan participants as part of the
contributions for the Plan's fiscal year beginning October 1, 2002, and the
Company shall take whatever actions are required to cause such 100 shares of
Common Stock to be transferred to the Purchaser following the above described
repayment, and the Purchaser shall hold on behalf of the Plan such 100 shares of
Common Stock for allocation to Plan participants. Immediately thereafter the
Initial Trust shall be dissolved.

represents and warrants to the Purchaser as follows:

        3.1 Organization, Corporate Standing and Investments. Each of the
Company and the Business Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing, and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation. As of the date hereof, the Company is authorized to issue
15,000,000 shares of Common Stock, and 100 shares of Common Stock are issued or
outstanding, all of which are held by the Initial Trust, and Human Factors
Applications, Inc. (the "BUSINESS SUBSIDIARY") is authorized to issue 1,000
shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "SUBSIDIARY COMMON
STOCK"), and 750 shares of common stock are issued and outstanding, all of which

all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock will be held by the Purchaser and
will be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The
Company shall convey to the Purchaser, at the Closing, good and valid title to
the Shares, free and clear of any liens, security interests, claims and
encumbrances. No other class of capital stock or other ownership interests of
the Company or the Business Subsidiary is authorized or outstanding. Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.1, there is no, and after giving effect to the
Transactions (as defined below) there will not be any, outstanding right,
subscription, warrant, call, unsatisfied preemptive right, option or other
agreement of any kind to purchase or otherwise to receive from the Company or
the Business Subsidiary any of the outstanding, authorized but unissued,
unauthorized or treasury shares of Common Stock or Subsidiary Common Stock and
there is no outstanding security of any kind of the Company convertible into any
such Common Stock or Subsidiary Common Stock. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.1, the Company has, and after giving effect to the Transactions will have, no
direct or indirect equity interest in or loans to any partnership, corporation,
joint venture, business association or other entity, other than the Business
Subsidiary. Each of the Company and the Business Subsidiary has full corporate
authority to own, lease and operate its business, and is in good standing and is
qualified to transact business as a foreign corporation in all states in which
the nature of the Business or the properties owned by it, in each case after
giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements (the "TRANSACTIONS") require it to qualify to transact
business, except for such failures to qualify as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined). The
Company has been organized solely for the purposes contemplated by the
Transactions, and has no liabilities and no assets and has not conducted any
business, other than as contemplated by the Transactions.

        As used in this Agreement, the term "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" used in
connection with a party hereof means any event, change or effect that (i) is
materially adverse to the condition (financial or otherwise), assets,
liabilities, businesses, operations, results of operations or prospects of such
party taken as a whole, including, in the case of the Company, after giving
effect to the Transactions or (ii) adversely affects the ability of such party
to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

and authority to enter into, deliver and perform this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein
and therein. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein and therein have been duly authorized by all necessary
action on the part of the Company. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, when executed and delivered by the Company, shall each constitute
its valid and legally binding obligation, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as the same may be limited by (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and (ii) general equitable principles regardless of whether the
issue of enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity.

        3.3 Conflict; Change of Control. Subject to satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7, and except as shown in Schedule 3.3,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any other Transaction
Agreements nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby will (i) conflict with or violate, (ii) result in any breach or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, (iii) give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss
of a material benefit under, or (iv) result in the creation of security
interest, claim, lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the Transferred Assets
or the Shares pursuant to:

            3.3.1 any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws
of the Company or the Business Subsidiary;

            3.3.2 any law, rule, regulation, ordinance, order, writ, injunction,

bound or affected;

the Company or the Business Subsidiary, any of the Company's or Business
Subsidiary's assets, employees or consultants or the Shares may be bound or
affected (specifically including, but not limited to, any of the foregoing
relating to the United States Federal Government or any agency or
instrumentality thereof);

            in each case except where such conflict, violation, breach, default,
termination, cancellation, acceleration, creation or encumbrance would not be
material to either the Company and the Business Subsidiary, taken as a whole, or
the Business, whether before or after giving effect to the Transactions.

set forth in Sections 6 and 7, and except as shown in Schedule 3.4 attached

order or authorization of, any Governmental Body (as hereinafter defined) in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this

statements of IITRI (collectively, the "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"). The Financial
Statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") consistently applied (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto), and fairly present in all material respects the
financial position of the Business as at the dates thereof and the results of
operations and changes in financial position for the periods then ended. The
reserves and management accruals, including, without limitation, with respect to
excess billings and contract losses related to audits being performed by the
DCAA (as defined below), reflected in the Financial Statements are adequate in
all material respects.

        3.6 S-1. Each of the Form S-1 filed by the Company on October 4, 2002
registering the Shares (the "S-1") and any supplement or post-effective
amendment filed with respect thereto (each, a "SUPPLEMENT") with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") complies in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT")
and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to the S-1. Each
of the S-1 and each Supplement at the time it was filed did not, as of the date
hereof does not, and as of the effective date of such filing did not, contain
any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial
statements of IITRI that are included in the S-1 comply as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present the
financial position of IITRI as at the dates thereof and the results of its
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended. The forecasted financial
information included in the S-1 is reasonable, represents the Company's
management's best estimate of its financial results through the Company's fiscal
year

(with respect to the Business) are in compliance in all material respects, and
the Business has been conducted so as to comply in all material respects, with
all laws, rules and regulations, judgments, decrees or orders of any

other organizational or charter document). Except as set forth in Schedule 3.8,
none of the Company, the Business Subsidiary or IITRI has received written
notice or otherwise has knowledge that it is or would be with the passage of
time, in default or violation of any term, condition or provision of (a) any

incorporated) which is or ever has been treated as a single employer with the
Company under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code. Schedule 3.13
contains an accurate and complete list of each Company Plan. To the extent
applicable, each Company Plan complies in all material respects with the terms
of such Company Plan, the requirements of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, (the "CODE") and all applicable regulations thereunder, and
any Company Plan and any trust related to each such Company Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) or Section 409 of the Code has either obtained a
favorable determination letter as to its qualified status from the Internal
Revenue Service or still has a remaining period of time under applicable
Treasury Regulations or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements in which to
apply for such determination letter and to make any amendments necessary to
obtain a favorable determination and, in any event, has been maintained in
compliance with the terms of each such Company Plan. To the extent any Company
Plan with an existing determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
must be amended to comply with the applicable requirements of any legislation
not covered by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the time period for effecting such
amendments will not expire prior to the Closing Date. The Company has furnished
or will furnish within twenty-one (21) days of the date hereof, Purchaser with

Purchaser with copies of all insurance and annuity policies and contracts and
other funding arrangements and documents relevant to any Company Plan. None of
the Company Plans is a "multiemployer plan" as that term is defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA. The Company has not been required to contribute to, or withdraw
from, and does not have any direct or indirect liability whether contingent or
otherwise with respect to any multiemployer plan. No Company Plan is and no
Plans previously sponsored or maintained by the Company or IITRI are covered by
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Except as set forth in Schedule
3.13, neither the Company nor any officer or director of the Company has
incurred any liability or penalty under Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code
or Title I of ERISA, and each Company Plan has been maintained and administered
in all material respects in compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including but
not limited to ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such Company Plans.
With respect to any of the Company Plans subject to Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 406 of ERISA, no "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section
4975(c)(1) of the Code and Section 406(a) and (b) of ERISA has occurred (at any
time since the effective date of each such Company Plan) or will occur as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which is not exempt
or which will impose any tax or penalty on the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.
Other than with respect to the ESOP, neither the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements nor the execution of the
Transaction Agreements will accelerate or materially increase any liability
under any Company Plan. No suit, action or other litigation (excluding claims
for benefits incurred in the ordinary course of Company Plan activities) has
been brought, or to the knowledge of the Company is threatened, against or with
respect to any such Company Plan. All material contributions, reserves or
premium

hereof to the Plans have been made or accrued and there is no material action,
suit or claim pending with respect to any Company Plan as of the date hereof,
other than routine claims for benefits. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.13, no

directors or consultants after termination of employment other than as required

commitment to the Company.

        3.33 Disclosure. No representation or warranty made by the Company in
this Agreement, nor any document, written information, statement, financial
statement, certificate, Schedule or Exhibit prepared and furnished or to be
prepared and furnished by the Company or its representatives pursuant hereto or
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, contains or will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omits or will omit to state
a material fact necessary to make the statements or facts contained herein or
therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were
furnished. There are no events, facts or conditions that, individually or in the
aggregate, have resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company that have not been set forth in this
Agreement or in the Schedules hereunder (and appropriately identified as such).

        3.34 Disclaimer. The representations and warranties set forth in this
Article III are the only representations and warranties made by the Company to
the Purchaser with respect to the Company, the Business Subsidiary, IITRI and
the Business. The Trustee and the Purchaser have the right to rely on such
representations and warranties notwithstanding any facts or circumstances
related to the Company, IITRI or the Business that the Trustee or the Purchaser
has knowledge of whether obtained from their due diligence review of the
Company, IITRI and the Business or otherwise.

        Section 4. Representations and Warranties of the Purchaser. The Trustee,
on behalf of the Purchaser, represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

        4.1 Necessary Authority. Subject to the accuracy of the representations
made by the Company in Section 3.28, the Trustee, on behalf of the Purchaser,
has full power and authority under the Plan and the Trust Agreement to enter
into, deliver and perform this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements
and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein and therein. The
execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and
therein have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the
Purchaser. This Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which the
Purchaser is a party, when executed by the Trustee on behalf of Purchaser, each
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable
against the Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except as the same may be
limited by (i) ERISA, bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally now or hereafter
in effect, and subject to the availability of equitable remedies and (ii)
general equitable principles regardless of whether the issue of enforceability
is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity.

<PAGE>

        4.2 No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which the Purchaser is a party
by the Trustee on behalf of the Purchaser and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not and will not (i) require the
consent or approval of, or filing with, any Person, except for the filings with
the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of Labor which may from time to
time be required by ERISA or the Code and the regulations thereunder, (ii)
constitute or result in the breach of any provision of, or constitute a default
under, the ESOP or any agreement, indenture or other instrument known to the
Trustee to which the Purchaser is a party or by which it or its assets may be
bound, or (iii) violate any law, regulation, judgment or order binding upon the
Purchaser or give rise to any liability to the Purchaser under Title I of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code.

        4.3 Investment Intent.

            4.3.1 The Shares to be acquired by the Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement are being or will be acquired for the account of the ESOP, for
investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof within the meaning of
the Securities Act, and the Purchaser has no intention of distributing or
reselling such securities or any part thereof, without prejudice, however, to
the rights of Purchaser at all times to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any
part of the Shares under an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act, or under an exemption from such registration available under the
Securities Act, and subject, nevertheless, to the disposition of the Purchaser
property being at all times within its control. If the Purchaser should in the
future decide to dispose of any of the Shares, the Purchaser understands and
agrees that it may do so only in compliance with the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws, as then in effect.

            4.3.2 The Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been
registered under the Securities Act, by reason of their issuance by the Company
in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have not been reviewed
by, passed on or submitted to any Federal or state agency where an exemption is
being relied upon, and that the Company's reliance thereon is based in part upon
the representations made by the Purchaser in this Agreement.

            4.3.3 The Purchaser understands that until such time as the Shares
are registered pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act, any certificate
or certificates representing the Shares delivered pursuant to Section 1.1, or
thereafter upon transfer, exchange or substitution, will bear a legend in
substantially the following form, in addition to any legend required by the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company:

        THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
        UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAW OF
        ANY STATE AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT PURSUANT
        TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT

<PAGE>

        UNDER SUCH ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR PURSUANT TO AN
        APPLICABLE EXEMPTION TO THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH ACT AND
        SUCH LAWS.

        Section 5. Covenants of the Company.

        5.1 Honoring Put Options. To the extent required by the ESOP, the Trust
Agreement and applicable law, the Company shall honor the Put Options and shall
fully perform its obligations with respect to the Put Options in accordance with
their terms, unless such performance would contravene any applicable law. The
Company shall not at any time permit its ability to honor the Put Options to be
restricted in any way by the provisions of any loan, financing instrument or
other agreement to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is or
may be bound. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to maintain sufficient
capital and/or surplus and shall comply with all other requirements of state and
federal law in order to be legally permitted to honor the Put Options. If the
provisions of any applicable state or federal law shall prevent the Company from
honoring the Put Options, the Company shall, as soon as practicable, use
reasonable efforts to take all such actions as shall be required to enable the
Company to honor the Put Options, including, but not limited to, adjustments to
its capital and/or surplus.

        5.2 ESOP Submission. The Company will submit the ESOP and the Trust
Agreement to the IRS within the "remedial amendment period" (within the meaning
of Section 401(b) of the Code) for a determination (a "DETERMINATION") that the
Plan and the Purchaser are qualified and tax-exempt under Sections 401(a) and
501(a) of the Code, respectively, and that the ESOP is an "employee stock
ownership plan," within the meaning of 4975(e)(7) of the Code, and the Company
will timely make any amendments required by the IRS as a condition to the
issuance of such Determination. The Company shall promptly after availability,
upon request of the Trustee, provide to the Trustee copies of the application to
the IRS for such Determination and any amendments thereto, and shall provide to
the Trustee, promptly after availability and without request of the Trustee, a
copy of the Determination letter.

        5.3 Plan Qualification. The Company shall use its best efforts to cause
the Plan and the Purchaser at all times to be operated and administered so as to
be in compliance with the qualification and tax exemption requirements under
Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code, respectively, and to cause the Plan to
qualify as an "employee stock ownership plan," within the meaning of 4975(e)(7)
of the Code, and to be operated and administered in substantial compliance with
all applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code. The Company shall amend the
ESOP and the Trust Agreement in a timely manner as required in order to ensure
that such qualification is maintained from and after the effective date of the
ESOP and, following any such amendment of a material nature, to submit the ESOP
and the Trust Agreement to the IRS for a Determination. The Company shall
promptly provide the Trustee with copies of any amendments to the ESOP or the
Purchaser and, upon request of the Trustee, with copies of any application for a
Determination.

        5.4 S Corporation. The Company has executed the applicable election
forms or other filings required to be made for purposes of the Company's
election to be taxed as an "S corporation" as such term is defined in Section
1361 of the Code. The Company shall not, without prior authorization from the
Purchaser, take or omit to take any action, and shall use its best efforts to
cause any Person not to take or omit to take any action, that would reasonably
be expected to cause the Company not to be qualified as an "S corporation" as
defined in Section 1361 of the Code.

        5.5 Affiliate Transactions. The Company will not, nor will it permit the
Business Subsidiary to, without the written consent of the Purchaser, enter into
any transaction with an officer or director of the Company (an "AFFILIATE
TRANSACTION") or increase any amount payable pursuant to any Affiliate
Transaction, except as required by the written terms of such transaction as in
effect as of the date hereof as disclosed in Schedule 3.16 or as duly approved
by the Board of Directors of the Company or the compensation committee thereof.

Section 7.05 of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

        5.7 Rights Under Certain Agreements. The Company shall enforce all of
its rights under the Asset Purchase Agreement, including without limitation its
rights under Article XIV thereof, and the other Transaction Agreements against
the Seller and IIT, unless it would not be commercially reasonable to enforce
such rights.

        5.8 Shareholders' Rights. Without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, from and after the Closing Date, the Company shall not, and shall not
permit any subsidiary or controlled affiliate of the Company to effect the first
public offering of Voting Securities which would be listed on any securities
exchange pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the
Securities Act. In addition, the Company shall take all appropriate and
necessary action under Section 203 of the DGCL and under any similar
"anti-takeover," "interested shareholder", "fair price", "moratorium", "control
share acquisition" or other state or federal anti-takeover statute or
regulation, to ensure that neither the Purchaser nor its transferees or their
successors or assigns will become an "interested shareholder" or other
restricted person as a result of any of the Transactions or any future
transaction involving the Company or its securities or assets, and shall refrain
from taking any action that would cause any such statute or regulation to be
inapplicable to any other transaction, person or entity without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser. The Company shall also refrain from taking any
action inconsistent with, and shall use its best efforts to ensure that the
Purchaser fully enjoys, Purchaser's right to elect a majority of the Company's
board of Directors and to otherwise control the Company, including its rights
under the Rights Agreement.

right of the indemnified party unless and only to the extent that the
indemnifying party is actually prejudiced thereby, and the indemnifying party
shall have the right to undertake the defense thereof by representatives chosen
by it by giving written notice to that effect within twenty (20) business days
of receiving notice of the third-party claim.

                (b) The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in
the defense or other disposition of any third-party claim, but the indemnifying
party shall not be liable for any legal fees or expenses subsequently incurred
by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the
indemnifying party agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) the indemnifying
party shall have failed to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party in a timely manner, or (iii) the indemnified party shall have
been advised by counsel (either that was employed by the indemnifying party or
one of its own choosing) that


<PAGE>

representation of the indemnified party by counsel provided by the indemnifying
party pursuant to the foregoing would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential conflicting interests between the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party, including situations in which there are one or more legal
defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from or
additional to those available to the indemnifying party. Neither the indemnified
party nor the indemnifying party may settle any claim without the prior written
consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

                (c) Anything in this Section 8 to the contrary notwithstanding,
(i) if there is a reasonable probability that a claim may materially and
adversely affect the indemnified party other than as a result of money damages
or other money payments, the indemnified party shall have the right, at its own
cost and expense, to defend, compromise or settle such claim upon prior
notification to the indemnifying party of its intent to do so; provided,
however, that if such claim is settled without the indemnifying party's consent,
the indemnified party shall be deemed to have waived all rights hereunder
against the indemnifying party for money damages arising out of such claim, and
(ii) the indemnifying party shall not, without the written consent of the
indemnified party, settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claimant or the plaintiff to the indemnified party a release from all
liability in respect to such claim.

                (d) In connection with any indemnification claim, the
indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party reasonable access to the
books, records and assets of the indemnified party which relate to the act,
omission or occurrence giving rise to such Damages and the right, upon prior
notice during normal business hours, to interview any appropriate personnel of
the indemnified party with respect thereto and the indemnified party otherwise
shall cooperate with the indemnifying party (and its insurance company, if
applicable) in defending any third-party claim.

        8.6 Trustee Indemnification. The indemnification described in this
Section 8 shall be in addition to, and shall not affect in way, the
Indemnification Agreement between the Trustee and the Company, dated February 7,
2002, attached to the Trustee Engagement Letter, or any other indemnification
provided to the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

        8.7 Other Rights. The indemnification described in this Section 8 shall
be in addition to, and shall not affect in any way, the rights of the parties
hereto under any of the other Transaction Agreements.

        Section 9. General.

        9.1 Execution of Counterparts. For the convenience of the parties, this
Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
document.
