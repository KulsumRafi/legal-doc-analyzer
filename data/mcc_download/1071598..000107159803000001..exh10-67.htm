("Pac-West"), a California corporation, and SBC Telecommunications, Inc. on behalf of and as agent for Pacific Bell Telephone Company ("Pacific"). Pac-West and Pacific are referred to individually herein as a "Party" and collectively herein as the "Parties." Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the applicable Interconnection Agreement. </P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">PREAMBLE</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, the Parties entered into a Local Interconnection Agreement dated March 15, 1996, and effective June 29, 1996 (the "1996 Agreement"); </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, the Parties entered into a Local Interconnection Agreement dated June 24, 1999, and effective June 29, 1999 (the "1999 Agreement"); </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, Pacific has disputed the amounts owed by Pacific to Pac-West (including, without limitation, amounts for tandem switching and transport described below) for any and all traffic including, without limitation, Local, Internet Service Provider ("ISP"), and intrastate IntraLATA Toll traffic (excluding interstate, InterLATA, operator services and Feature Group A traffic) (collectively the "Traffic") transported to and/or terminated by Pac-West for the entire period prior to September I, 2002 ("Pacific Volume of Minute Dispute"); </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, the Parties disagree as to whether Pac-West is entitled to receive any compensation from Pacific for tandem switching and transport on any and all Traffic transported to and/or terminated by Pac-West for the entire period prior to September 1, 2002 ("Pacific Tandem Rate Dispute"); </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, Pac-West acknowledges and agrees that all amounts invoiced by Pacific as of the effective date of this Settlement Agreement to Pac-West for any and all Traffic transported to and/or terminated by Pacific for the entire period prior to September 1, 2002, are due and owing, but Pac-West disputes it owes Pacific any additional unbilled amounts for such Traffic for the entire period prior to September 1, 2002 ("Pac-West Compensation Dispute"); </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, the Parties disagree as to whether Pac-West is entitled to recover certain Network Interconnection Charges ("NIC") on Traffic for the entire period prior to September 1, 2002, including, but not limited to, the charges described in Pac-West Telecomm Inc. v. Pacific Bell Telephone Company, Case No. 02-01-016 ("NIC Dispute"); </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, Pac-West (i) purchased certain DS-3 facilities from Pacific and subsequently purchased a SONET facility from Pacific, (ii) Pacific would not allow Pac- West to move certain local interconnection traffic on to the SONET facility without an amendment to its 1996 Agreement, and (iii) Pac-West, therefore, claimed Pacific inappropriately charged Pac-West for both the SONET facility and the DS-3 facilities carrying local interconnection traffic for the entire period prior to September 1, 2002 ("SONET Dispute"); </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, Parties disagree whether Pacific is required to provide all facilities for the transport of the local interconnection trunks to Pac- West's point of interconnection ("POI") and whether Pacific should credit Pac-West for the associated charges for certain SONET facilities ordered by Pac-West used to carry local interconnection trunks to its POI for the entire period prior to September 1,2002 ("Interconnection Dispute"); </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, the above mentioned disputes shall be referred to herein collectively as the "Disputes;" and </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS, the Parties have resolved amicably differences between them concerning the Disputes and corresponding charges. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by each Party to the other, Pac-West and Pacific, each intending to be legally bound hereby, covenant and agree as follows: </P>
