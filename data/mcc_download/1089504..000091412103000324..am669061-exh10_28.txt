definition of "Eurodollar Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof are not being provided in
the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining
rates of interest for Loans as provided herein; or

            (b) the Lender determines, which determination shall be conclusive,
that the relevant rate of interest referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar
Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof upon the basis of which the rate of interest for
Loans is to be determined is not likely adequately to cover the cost to the
Lender of making or maintaining Loans; or

            (c) it becomes unlawful for the Lender to honor its obligation to
make or maintain Loans hereunder using a Eurodollar Rate;

then the Lender shall give the Borrowers prompt notice thereof and, so long as
such condition remains in effect, the Lender shall be under no obligation to
make additional Loans, and the Borrowers shall, either prepay all such Loans as
may be outstanding or pay interest on such Loans at a rate per annum equal to

full on the Termination Date the then aggregate outstanding principal amount of

Applicable Margin. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrowers hereby promise,
jointly and severally, to pay to the Lender interest at the applicable
Post-Default Rate on any principal of any Loan and on any other amount payable
by the Borrowers hereunder or under the Note that shall not be paid in full when
due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or by mandatory prepayment or
otherwise) for the period from and including the due date thereof to but
excluding the date the same is paid in full. Accrued interest on each Loan shall
be payable monthly on the first Business Day of each month and for the last
month of the Loan Agreement on the first Business Day of such last month and on
the Termination Date; provided, that, the Lender may, in its sole discretion,
require accrued interest to be paid simultaneously with any prepayment of
principal made by the Borrowers on account of any of the Loans outstanding.
Interest payable at the Post-Default Rate shall accrue daily and shall be
payable upon such accrual.

            (c) It is understood and agreed that, unless and until a Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrowers shall be entitled to the
proceeds of the Mortgage Loans pledged to the Lender hereunder.

            2.06 Mandatory Prepayments or Pledge.

            (a) If at any time the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
Loans exceeds the Borrowing Base (a "Borrowing Base Deficiency"), as determined
by the Lender and notice is given to the Borrowers on any Business Day, the
Borrowers shall no later than one (1) Business Day after receipt of such notice,
either prepay the Loans in part or in whole or pledge additional Eligible
Mortgage Loans (which Collateral shall be in all respects acceptable to the
Lender) to the Lender, such that after giving effect to such prepayment or
pledge the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans does not exceed
the Borrowing Base.

            (b) The Borrowers shall instruct each Takeout Investor to remit all
Takeout Proceeds directly to the Lender at the account designated in Section

Borrowers shall deliver via facsimile or electronic mail to the Lender a
purchase advice (the "Purchase Advice") and shall indicate on such Purchase
Advice the Mortgage Loan identification number which identified such Mortgage
Loan when the Lender previously financed the Mortgage Loan. A portion of the
Takeout Proceeds in an amount equal to the Collateral Value of the applicable
Mortgage Loans shall be applied by the Lender to the prepayment of principal
outstanding on the Loans. On the Settlement Date, the Lender shall release and
remit to the Borrower the amount of Takeout Proceeds in excess of the Collateral
Value of the applicable Mortgage Loans (the "Remittance Amount"); provided that
on the Settlement Date (i) there is no Default or Event of Default under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) there is no Borrowing Base Deficiency
and (iii) the release to the Borrower of the Remittance Amount will not cause a
Borrowing Base Deficiency. If a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists or would be
created by the release of the Remittance Amount or an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, Lender shall be entitled to retain the Remittance
Amount, and the Borrower thereupon shall have no further rights, title, or
interest in and to the Remittance Amount. In the event that the Purchase Advice
indicates that some of the proceeds forwarded to the Lender do not belong to the
Lender (such amount, the "Excess Proceeds") then (i) the Borrower shall provide
the Lender with a takeout proceeds identification letter in the form of Exhibit
J hereto, and (ii) upon confirmation by the Lender that the information set
forth in the Purchase Advice matches the information that the Lender has in its
possession with respect to the Mortgage Loans, the Lender shall promptly remit
by wire transfer the Excess Proceeds in accordance with the Borrowers'
instructions. If funds are received before 3:00 p.m., New York City time on a
Business Day, but either (A) no Purchase Advice is received or (B) such funds
are not properly identified on the related Purchase Advice (a "Purchase Advice
Deficiency"), then such funds shall be retained by the Lender in a non-interest
bearing account until such Purchase Advice Deficiency is remedied, and the
Mortgage Loan Subject to such Purchase Advice shall not be released until such
Purchase Advice Deficiency is remedied. In no event shall such Purchase Advice
be back-dated to the date of its issuance.

            2.07 Extension of Termination Date.

            At the request of the Borrowers made at least thirty (30) days, but
in no event earlier than ninety (90) days, prior to the then current Termination
Date, the Lender may in its sole discretion extend the Termination Date for a
period to be determined by Lender in its sole discretion by giving written
notice of such extension to the Borrowers no later than twenty (20) days, but in
no event earlier than thirty (30) days, prior to the then current Termination
Date. Any failure by the Lender to deliver such notice of extension shall be
deemed to be the Lender's determination not to extend the then current
Termination Date.

            Section 3. Payments; Computations; Etc.

            3.01 Payments.

            (a) Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all payments of

Operations, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date on which
such payment shall become due (and each such payment made after such time on
such due date shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business
Day). Each Borrower acknowledges that it has no rights of withdrawal from the
foregoing account.

            (b) Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided herein, if the
due date of any payment under this Loan Agreement or the Note would otherwise
fall on a day that is not a Business Day, such date shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day, and interest shall be payable for any principal so
extended for the period of such extension.

            3.02 Computations. Interest on the Loans shall be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which payable.

            (a) If the introduction or adoption of or any change (other than any
change by way of the imposition of or increase in reserve requirements included
in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage) in any Requirement of Law (other than
with respect to any amendment made to the Lender's certificate of incorporation
and by-laws or other organizational or governing documents) or any change in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by the Lender with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central
bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:

            (i) shall subject the Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with
      respect to this Loan Agreement, the Note or any Loan made by it (excluding
      net income or franchise taxes) or change the basis of taxation of payments
      to the Lender in respect thereof;

            (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special
      deposit, compulsory Loan or similar requirement against assets held by,
      deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, Loans or
      other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any
      office of the Lender which is not otherwise included in the determination
      of the Eurodollar Rate hereunder;

            (iii) shall impose on the Lender any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the Lender, by
an amount which the Lender deems to be material, of making, participating in,
continuing or maintaining any Loan or to reduce any amount due or owing
hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrowers, jointly and
severally, shall promptly pay the Lender such additional amount or amounts as
will compensate the Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable.

            (b) If the Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any
change in any Requirement of Law (other than with respect to any amendment made
to the Lender's certificate of incorporation and by-laws or other organizational
or governing documents) regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or
application thereof or compliance by the Lender or any corporation controlling
the Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or
not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to
the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the
Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations
hereunder to a level below that which the Lender or such corporation could have
achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
the Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by
an amount deemed by the Lender to be material, then from time to time, the
Borrowers, jointly and severally, shall promptly pay to the Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Lender for such reduction.

            (c) If the Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts
pursuant to this Section, it shall promptly notify the Borrowers of the event by
reason of which it has become so entitled. A certificate as to any additional
amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by the Lender to the
Borrowers shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

            3.04 Facility Fee.

            The Borrowers agree, jointly and severally, to pay to the Lender on
or prior to the Effective Date a facility fee equal to 20 basis points (.20%)

counterclaim, to the Lender at the account set forth in Section 3.01(a) hereof.

            3.05 Minimum Usage Fee.

            If , as tested on the first Business Day of any month, the average
principal balance of the Loans outstanding hereunder ("Average Usage") during
the immediately preceding calendar month shall be an amount less than
$37,500,000, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay to the Lender a minimum usage fee
("Minimum Usage Fee"), computed at the rate of 15 basis points (.15%) per annum
on the amount equal to the difference between the Maximum Credit and the Average
Usage, in each case payable monthly in arrears on the first Business Day of the
following month and on the Termination Date, commencing on _____ ___, 2002, such

to the Lender hereunder, under the Note and under the other Loan Documents

hereunder.

            4.02 Further Documentation. At any time and from time to time, upon
the written request of the Lender, and at the sole expense of the Borrowers, the
Borrowers will promptly and duly execute and deliver, or will promptly cause to

or preserving the full benefits of this Loan Agreement and of the rights and

deemed necessary by the Lender to continue its perfected status in the
Collateral with the same or better priority.

            4.04 Lender's Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact.

            (a) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the
Lender and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its
true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in
the place and stead of such Borrower and in the name of such Borrower or in its
own name, from time to time in the Lender's discretion, for the purpose of
carrying out the terms of this Loan Agreement, to take any and all appropriate
action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be
necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Loan Agreement, and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Borrower hereby gives the
Lender the power and right, on behalf of such Borrower, without assent by, but
with notice to, such Borrower, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, to do the following:

            (i) in the name of each Borrower or its own name, or otherwise, to
      take possession of and endorse and collect any checks, drafts, notes,
      acceptances or other instruments for the payment of moneys due under any
      mortgage insurance or with respect to any other Collateral and to file any
      claim or to take any other action or proceeding in any court of law or
      equity or otherwise deemed appropriate by the Lender for the purpose of
      collecting any and all such moneys due under any such mortgage insurance
      or with respect to any other Collateral whenever payable;

            (ii) to pay or discharge taxes and Liens levied or placed on or
      threatened against the Collateral; and

            (iii) (A) to direct any party liable for any payment under any
      Collateral to make payment of any and all moneys due or to become due
      thereunder directly to the Lender or as the Lender shall direct; (B) to
      ask or demand for, collect, receive payment of and receipt for, any and
      all moneys, claims and other amounts due or to become due at any time in
      respect of or arising out of any Collateral; (C) to sign and endorse any
      invoices, assignments, verifications, notices and other documents in
      connection with any of the Collateral; (D) to commence and prosecute any
      suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of
      competent jurisdiction to collect the Collateral or any portion thereof
      and to enforce any other right in respect of any Collateral; (E) to defend
      any suit, action or proceeding brought against any Borrower with respect
      to any Collateral; (F) to settle, compromise or adjust any suit, action or
      proceeding described in clause (E) above and, in connection therewith, to
      give such discharges or releases as the Lender may deem appropriate; and
      (G) generally, to sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with
      respect to or otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and
      completely as though the Lender were the absolute owner thereof for all
      purposes, and to do, at the Lender's option and the Borrowers' expense, at
      any time, and from time to time, all acts and things which the Lender
      deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and
      the Lender's Liens thereon and to effect the intent of this Loan
      Agreement, all as fully and effectively as the Borrowers might do.

Each Borrower hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or cause
to be done by virtue hereof. This power of attorney is a power coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable.

            (b) Each Borrower also authorizes the Lender, at any time and from
time to time, to execute, in connection with any sale provided for in Section
4.07 hereof, any endorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or
transfer with respect to the Collateral and to file any initial financing
statements, amendments thereto and continuation statements with or without the
signature of any Borrower as authorized by applicable law, as applicable to all
or any part of the Collateral.

            (c) The powers conferred on the Lender are solely to protect the
Lender's interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the
Lender to exercise any such powers. The Lender shall be accountable only for
amounts that it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers,
and neither the Lender nor any of its officers, directors, or employees shall be
responsible to the Borrowers for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for
its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

            4.05 Performance by Lender of Borrowers' Obligations. If any
Borrower fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained in the
Loan Documents and the Lender may itself perform or comply, or otherwise cause
performance or compliance, with such agreement, the expenses of the Lender
incurred in connection with such performance or compliance, together with
interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the Post-Default Rate, shall be
payable by the Borrowers to the Lender on demand and shall constitute Secured
Obligations.

            4.06 Proceeds. If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing,
(a) all proceeds of Collateral received by the Borrowers consisting of cash,
checks and other near-cash items shall be held by the Borrowers in trust for the
Lender, segregated from other funds of the Borrowers, and shall forthwith upon
receipt by any Borrower be turned over to the Lender in the exact form received
by such Borrower (duly endorsed by such Borrower to the Lender, if required) and
(b) any and all such proceeds received by the Lender (whether from a Borrower or
otherwise) may, in the sole discretion of the Lender, be held by the Lender as
collateral security for, and/or then or at any time thereafter may be applied by
the Lender against, the Secured Obligations (whether matured or unmatured), such
application to be in such order as the Lender shall elect. Any balance of such
proceeds remaining after the Secured Obligations shall have been paid in full
and this Loan Agreement shall have been terminated shall be paid over to the
Borrowers or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same. For
purposes hereof, proceeds shall include, but not be limited to, all principal
and interest payments, all prepayments and payoffs, insurance claims,
condemnation awards, sale proceeds, real estate owned rents and any other income
and all other amounts received with respect to the Collateral.

            4.07 Remedies. If a Default shall occur and be continuing, the
Lender may, at its option, enter into one or more Interest Rate Protection
Agreements covering all or a portion of the Mortgage Loans pledged to the Lender
hereunder, and the Borrowers shall be responsible for all damages, judgments,
costs and expenses of any kind which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Lender relating to or arising out of such Interest Rate Protection
Agreements; including without limitation any losses resulting from such Interest
Rate Protection Agreements. If an Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, the Lender may exercise, in addition to all other rights and
remedies granted to it in this Loan Agreement and in any other instrument or
agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the Secured Obligations, all
rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lender without demand of
performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of
any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) to or upon the
Borrower or any other Person (each and all of which demands, presentments,
protests, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such
circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the
Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give
option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the
Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one
or more parcels or as an entirety at public or private sale or sales, at any
exchange, broker's board or office of the Lender or elsewhere upon such terms
and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best,
for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit
risk. The Lender shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and,
to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase
the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of
redemption in the Borrower, which right or equity is hereby waived or released.
The Borrowers further agree, at the Lender's request, to assemble the Collateral
and make it available to the Lender at places which the Lender shall reasonably
select, whether at the Borrower's premises or elsewhere. The Lender shall apply
the net proceeds of any such collection, recovery, receipt, appropriation,
realization or sale, after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every
kind incurred therein or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the
Collateral or in any way relating to the Collateral or the rights of the Lender
hereunder, including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements, to the payment in whole or in part of the Secured Obligations, in
such order as the Lender may elect, and only after such application and after
the payment by the Lender of any other amount required or permitted by any
provision of law, including without limitation Section 9-615(a)(3) of the
Uniform Commercial Code, need the Lender account for the surplus, if any, to the
Borrowers. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Borrower waives all
claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the Lender arising out of the
exercise by the Lender of any of its rights hereunder, other than those claims,
damages and demands arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Lender. If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of Collateral
shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if
given at least ten (10) days before such sale or other disposition. The
Borrowers shall remain liable for any deficiency (plus accrued interest thereon
as contemplated pursuant to Section 2.05(b) hereof) if the proceeds of any sale
or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay the Secured
Obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by the
Lender to collect such deficiency.

            4.08 Limitation on Duties Regarding Preservation of Collateral. The
Lender's duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation
of the Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the Uniform
Commercial Code or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the
Lender deals with similar property for its own account. Neither the Lender nor
any of its directors, officers or employees shall be liable for failure to
demand, collect or realize upon all or any part of the Collateral or for any
delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose
of any Collateral upon the request of the Borrowers or otherwise.

            4.09 Powers Coupled with an Interest. All authorizations and
agencies herein contained with respect to the Collateral are irrevocable and
powers coupled with an interest.

            4.10 Release of Security Interest. Upon termination of this Loan
Agreement and repayment to the Lender of all Secured Obligations and the
performance of all obligations under the Loan Documents the Lender shall release
its security interest in any remaining Collateral.

            Section 6. Representations and Warranties. Each Borrower represents
and warrants to the Lender that throughout the term of this Loan Agreement:

            6.01 Legal Name. On the Effective Date, the exact legal name of the
Borrower is, and during the four months immediately preceding July 31, 2001,
such name has been, respectively, American Home Mortgage Corp. and the Borrower
has used any previous names, assumed names or trade names except as set forth on
Schedule 4 attached hereto.

            6.02 Existence. The Borrower (a) is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, (b) has all requisite corporate or other power, and has all
governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals necessary to own
its assets and carry on its business as now being or as proposed to be
conducted, except where the lack of such licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; and
(c) is qualified to do business and is in good standing in all other
jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except where failure so to qualify would not be
reasonably likely (either individually or in the aggregate) to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

            6.03 Financial Condition. The Borrower has heretofore furnished to
the Lender a copy of (a) the consolidated balance sheet of the Guarantor and its
consolidated Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 and the

balance sheet and the consolidated balance sheets of its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the quarterly fiscal period ended March 31, 2002 and the
related consolidated statements of income and retained earnings and of cash
flows for the Guarantor and its consolidated Subsidiaries for such quarterly
fiscal period, setting forth in each case in comparative form the figures for
the previous year. All such financial statements are complete and correct and
fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial condition
of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries and the consolidated results of their
operations as at such dates and for such fiscal periods, all in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis. Since December 31, 2001, there has been no
material adverse change in the consolidated business, operations or financial
condition of the Guarantor and its consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole
from that set forth in said financial statements.

            6.04 Litigation. There are no actions, suits, arbitrations,
investigations (including, without limitation, any of the foregoing which are
pending or threatened) or other legal or arbitrable proceedings affecting any
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or affecting any of the Property of any of
them before any Governmental Authority that (i) questions or challenges the
validity or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents or any action to be
taken in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) makes a
claim or claims in an aggregate amount greater than $1,000,000, (iii) which,
individually or in the aggregate, if adversely determined, could reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) requires filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with the 1934 Act or any rules
thereunder.

            6.05 No Breach. Neither (a) the execution and delivery of the Loan
Documents nor (b) the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated in
compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will conflict with or result in
a breach of the charter or by-laws of any Borrower, or any applicable law, rule
or regulation, or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any Governmental
Authority, or any Servicing Agreement or other material agreement or instrument
to which any Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them or any of their Property is bound or to which any of them is subject, or
constitute a default under any such material agreement or instrument or result
in the creation or imposition of any Lien (except for the Liens created pursuant
to this Loan Agreement) upon any Property of any Borrower or any of their
Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any such agreement or instrument.

            6.06 Action. Each Borrower has all necessary corporate or other
power, authority and legal right to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under each of the Loan Documents; the execution, delivery and performance by
Borrower of each of the Loan Documents have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate or other action on its part; and each Loan Document has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Borrower and constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Borrower, enforceable against Borrower in
accordance with its terms.

            6.07 Approvals.

            (a) No authorizations, approvals or consents of, and no filings or
registrations with, any Governmental Authority or any securities exchange are
necessary for the execution, delivery or performance by each Borrower of the
Loan Documents or for the legality, validity or enforceability thereof, except
for filings and recordings in respect of the Liens created pursuant to this Loan
Agreement.

            (b) Each Borrower is approved by Fannie Mae as an approved lender
and each Borrower and each Servicer is approved by Freddie Mac as an approved
seller/servicer, in each case in good standing (such collective approvals and
conditions, "Agency Approvals"), with no event having occurred or any Borrower
having any reason whatsoever to believe or suspect will occur (including,
without limitation, a change in insurance coverage) which would either make any
Borrower (or any Servicer) unable to comply with the eligibility requirements
for maintaining all such applicable Agency Approvals or require notification to
the relevant Agency. Each Borrower (and any Servicer) has adequate financial
standing, servicing facilities, procedures and experienced personnel necessary
for the sound servicing of mortgage loans of the same types as may from time to
time constitute Mortgage Loans and in accordance with Accepted Servicing
Practices.

            6.08 Margin Regulations. Neither the making of any Loan hereunder,
nor the use of the proceeds thereof, will violate or be inconsistent with the
provisions of Regulations T, U or X.

all Federal income tax returns and all other material tax returns that are
required to be filed by them and have paid all taxes due pursuant to such
returns or pursuant to any assessment received by any of them, except for any
such taxes as are being appropriately contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings diligently conducted and with respect to which adequate reserves
have been provided. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of each
Borrower and each of their Subsidiaries in respect of taxes and other
governmental charges are, in the opinion of each Borrower, adequate.

            6.10 Investment Company Act. No Borrower nor any of their

"investment company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,

            (a) No Borrower has assigned, pledged, or otherwise conveyed or
encumbered any Mortgage Loan or other Collateral to any other Person, and
immediately prior to the pledge of such Mortgage Loan or any other Collateral to
the Lender, the Borrowers were the sole owner of such Mortgage Loan or such
other Collateral and had good and marketable title thereto, free and clear of
all Liens, in each case except for Liens to be released simultaneously with the
Liens granted in favor of the Lender hereunder. No Mortgage Loan or other
Collateral pledged to the Lender hereunder was acquired (by purchase or
otherwise) by any Borrower from an Affiliate of any Borrower.

            (b) The provisions of this Loan Agreement are effective to create in
favor of the Lender a valid security interest in all right, title and interest
of the Borrowers in, to and under the Collateral.

endorsed in blank by a duly authorized officer of the relevant Borrower and (ii)

Lender as "Secured Party" and the Borrowers as "Debtors", and describing the
Collateral, in the jurisdictions and recording offices listed on Schedule 2
attached hereto, the security interests granted hereunder in the Collateral will
constitute fully perfected first priority security interests under the Uniform
Commercial Code in all right, title and interest of the Borrowers in, to and
under such Collateral which can be perfected by filing under the Uniform
Commercial Code.

            6.12 Chief Executive Office/Jurisdiction of Organization. On the

            6.14 Hedging. Each Borrower has entered into Interest Rate
Protection Agreements in accordance with its respective hedging policy
guidelines, having terms with respect to protection against fluctuations in
interest rates reasonably acceptable to the Lender.

financial statements, exhibits and schedules furnished in writing by or on
behalf of the Credit Parties to the Lender in connection with the negotiation,
preparation or delivery of this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents or

other Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will
be true, complete and accurate in every material respect, or (in the case of
projections) based on reasonable estimates, on the date as of which such

disclosure letter or other writing furnished to the Lender for use in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

            6.16 Tangible Net Worth. On the Effective Date, the Tangible Net

hereof.

            6.18 Takeout Commitments; Takeout Assignments. Each Takeout
Commitment (if any) has been delivered by the Borrowers and constitutes a valid,
binding and existing obligation of a Takeout Investor, enforceable against the
Borrowers and the Takeout Investor, respectively, in accordance with its terms
(subject to bankruptcy laws and other similar laws of general application
affecting rights of creditors and subject to the application of the rules of
equity, including those relating to specific performance). Each Takeout

and of such Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will, as of such

federal and state laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors,
(ii) the present fair saleable value of the assets of each Borrower and of such
Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will, as of such date, be

respective debts as such debts become absolute and matured, (iii) no Borrower,
nor any Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will have, as of such
date, an unreasonably small amount of capital with which to conduct their
respective businesses, and (iv) each Borrower and such Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be able to pay their respective debts as
they mature. For purposes of this Section 6.19, "debt" means "liability on a

Borrowers provide for mortgage loans which it owns. In the event that the
preceding language is interpreted as constituting one or more servicing
contracts, each such servicing contract shall terminate automatically upon the
earliest of (i) an Event of Default, (ii) the date on which all the Secured
Obligations have been paid in full or (iii) the transfer of servicing approved
by the Borrowers.

            (b) If the Mortgage Loans are serviced by a Borrower, (i) such
Borrower agrees that the Lender is the collateral assignee of all servicing
records, including but not limited to any and all servicing agreements, files,
documents, records, data bases, computer tapes, copies of computer tapes, proof
of insurance coverage, insurance policies, appraisals, other closing
documentation, payment history records, and any other records relating to or
evidencing the servicing of Mortgage Loans (the "Servicing Records"), and (ii)
such Borrower grants the Lender a security interest in all servicing fees and
rights relating to the Mortgage Loans and all Servicing Records to secure the
obligation of each Borrower or its designee to service in conformity with this
Section and any other obligation of the Borrowers to the Lender. The Borrowers
covenant to safeguard such Servicing Records and to deliver them promptly to the
Lender or its designee (including the Custodian) at the Lender's request.

            (c) If the Mortgage Loans are serviced by a third party servicer
(such third party servicer, the "Servicer"), the Borrowers (i) shall provide a
copy of the servicing agreement to the Lender, which shall be in form and
substance acceptable to the Lender (the "Servicing Agreement"), and (ii) shall
provide a Servicer Notice to the Servicer substantially in the form of Exhibit H
hereto (a "Servicer Notice") and shall cause the Servicer to acknowledge and
agree to the same. Any successor or assignee of a Servicer shall be approved in
writing by the Lender and shall acknowledge and agree to a Servicer Notice prior
to such successor's assumption of servicing obligations with respect to the
Mortgage Loans.

            (d) If the servicer of the Mortgage Loans is a Borrower or the
Servicer is an Affiliate of a Borrower, such Borrower shall provide to the
Lender a letter from the Borrower or the Servicer, as the case may be, to the
effect that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Lender may terminate
any Servicing Agreement and in any event transfer servicing to the Lender's
designee, at no cost or expense to the Lender, it being agreed that the
Borrowers will pay any and all fees required to terminate the Servicing
Agreement and to effectuate the transfer of servicing to the designee of the
Lender.

            (e) After the Funding Date, until the pledge of any Mortgage Loan is
relinquished by the Custodian, the Borrowers will have no right to modify or
alter the terms of such Mortgage Loan and the Borrowers will have no obligation
or right to repossess such Mortgage Loan or substitute another Mortgage Loan,
except as provided in the Custodial Agreement.

            (f) In the event a Borrower or its Affiliate is servicing the
Mortgage Loans, such Borrower shall permit the Lender from time to time to
inspect such Borrower's or its Affiliate's servicing facilities, as the case may
be, for the purpose of satisfying the Lender that such Borrower or its
Affiliate, as the case may be, has the ability to service the Mortgage Loans as
provided in this Loan Agreement.

            11.16 Periodic Due Diligence Review. Each Borrower acknowledges that
the Lender has the right to perform continuing due diligence reviews with
respect to the Mortgage Loans and the manner in which they were originated, for
purposes of verifying compliance with the representations, warranties and
specifications made hereunder, or otherwise, each Borrower agrees that, unless a
Default has occurred (in which case no notice is required) upon reasonable (but
no less than one (1) Business Day's) prior notice to the Borrowers, the Lender
or its authorized representatives will be permitted during normal business hours
to examine, inspect, and make copies and extracts of, the Mortgage Files and any
and all documents, records, agreements, instruments or information relating to
such Mortgage Loans in the possession or under the control of each Borrower
and/or the Custodian. The Borrowers also shall make available to the Lender a
knowledgeable financial or accounting officer for the purpose of answering
questions respecting the Mortgage Files and the Mortgage Loans. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each Borrower acknowledges that the Lender may
make Loans to the Borrowers based solely upon the information provided by the
Borrowers to the Lender in the Mortgage Loan Tape and the representations,
warranties and covenants contained herein, and that the Lender, at its option,
has the right at any time to conduct a partial or complete due diligence review
on some or all of the Mortgage Loans securing such Loan, including without
limitation ordering new credit reports and new appraisals on the related
Mortgaged Properties and otherwise re-generating the information used to
originate such Mortgage Loan. The Lender may underwrite such Mortgage Loans
itself or engage a mutually agreed upon third party underwriter to perform such
underwriting. Each Borrower agrees to cooperate with the Lender and any third
party underwriter in connection with such underwriting, including, but not
limited to, providing the Lender and any third party underwriter with access to
any and all documents, records, agreements, instruments or information relating
to such Mortgage Loans in the possession, or under the control, of the
Borrowers. Each Borrower further agrees that the Borrowers shall reimburse the
Lender for any and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Lender
in connection with the Lender's activities pursuant to this Section 11.15,
subject to the proviso of Section 11.03(b).

            11.17 Set-Off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lender
provided by this Loan Agreement and by law, the Lender shall have the right,
without prior notice to the Borrowers, any such notice being expressly waived by
the Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount
becoming due and payable by the Borrowers hereunder (whether at the stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set-off and appropriate and apply
against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or
claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or
contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by the Lender or any
Affiliate thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrowers. The
Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrowers after any such set-off and
application made by the Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

            11.18 Joint and Several Liability. Each Borrower hereby acknowledges
and agrees that such Borrower shall be jointly and severally liable to the
Lender to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law for all
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations and indemnities of the
Borrowers hereunder.

            11.19 Intent. The parties recognize (i) that each Loan is a
"securities contract" as that term is defined in Section 741 of Title 11 of the
United States Code, as amended, and (ii) each payment is a "margin payment"
and/or a "settlement payment", as such terms are defined herein.

            11.20 Replacement by Repurchase Agreement. The Borrowers hereby
acknowledge and agree that this Loan Agreement may at any time and without any
further cost to the Borrowers, in the sole discretion of the Lender, be replaced
by a repurchase facility with substantially similar terms as those contained in
this Loan Agreement. The Borrowers hereby agree to take such action and execute
such documents and instruments as is necessary to effectuate such conversion.

            11.21 Effect of Merger. The parties hereto acknowledge that Marina
Mortgage Company, Inc. was merged with and into American Home Mortgage Corp.,
effective December 31, 2001, and no longer exists as a corporate entity.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan
Document, each reference to "Borrowers" herein and in any of the other Loan
Documents shall be deemed to be a reference to AHM.

                                   Schedule 1

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES RE: MORTGAGE LOANS

                  Part I. Eligible Residential Mortgage Loans

            As to each residential Mortgage Loan included in the Borrowing Base
on a Funding Date (and the related Mortgage, Mortgage Note, Assignment of
Mortgage and Mortgaged Property), each Borrower shall be deemed to make the
following representations and warranties to the Lender as of such date and as of
each date Collateral Value is determined (certain defined terms used herein and
not otherwise defined in the Loan Agreement appearing in Part II to this
Schedule 1):

            (a) Mortgage Loans as Described. The information set forth in the
Mortgage Loan Schedule with respect to the Mortgage Loan is complete, true and
correct in all material respects.

            (b) Payments Current. All payments required to be made up to the
Funding Date for the Mortgage Loan under the terms of the Mortgage Note have
been made and credited. No payment required under the Mortgage Loan is
delinquent nor has any payment under the Mortgage Loan been delinquent at any
time since the origination of the Mortgage Loan. The first Monthly Payment shall
be made, or shall have been made, with respect to the Mortgage Loan on its Due
Date or within the grace period, all in accordance with the terms of the related
Mortgage Note.

            (c) No Outstanding Charges. There are no defaults in complying with
the terms of the Mortgage securing the Mortgage Loan, and all taxes,
governmental assessments, insurance premiums, water, sewer and municipal
charges, leasehold payments or ground rents which previously became due and
owing have been paid, or an escrow of funds has been established in an amount
sufficient to pay for every such item which remains unpaid and which has been
assessed but is not yet due and payable. Neither any Borrower nor the Qualified
Originator from which any Borrower acquired the Mortgage Loan has advanced
funds, or induced, solicited or knowingly received any advance of funds by a
party other than the Mortgagor, directly or indirectly, for the payment of any
amount required under the Mortgage Loan, except for interest accruing from the
date of the Mortgage Note or date of disbursement of the proceeds of the
Mortgage Loan, whichever is earlier, to the day which precedes by one month the
Due Date of the first installment of principal and interest thereunder.

            (d) Original Terms Unmodified. The terms of the Mortgage Note and
Mortgage have not been impaired, waived, altered or modified in any respect,
from the date of origination; except by a written instrument which has been
recorded, if necessary to protect the interests of the Lender, and which has
been delivered to the Custodian and the terms of which are reflected in the
Mortgage Loan Schedule. The substance of any such waiver, alteration or
modification has been approved by the title insurer, to the extent required, and
its terms are reflected on the Mortgage Loan Schedule. No Mortgagor in respect
of the Mortgage Loan has been released, in whole or in part, except in
connection with an assumption agreement approved by the title insurer, to the
extent required by such policy, and which assumption agreement is part of the
Mortgage File delivered to the Custodian and the terms of which are reflected in
the Mortgage Loan Schedule.

            (e) No Defenses. The Mortgage Loan is not subject to any right of
rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including without limitation the
defense of usury, nor will the operation of any of the terms of the Mortgage
Note or the Mortgage, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render either the
Mortgage Note or the Mortgage unenforceable, in whole or in part and no such
right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with
respect thereto, and no Mortgagor in respect of the Mortgage Loan was a debtor
in any state or Federal bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding at the time the
Mortgage Loan was originated. No Borrower has knowledge nor has it received any
notice that any Mortgagor in respect of the Mortgage Loan is a debtor in any
state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.

            (f) Hazard Insurance. The Mortgaged Property is insured by a fire
and extended perils insurance policy, issued by a Qualified Insurer, and such
other hazards as are customary in the area where the Mortgaged Property is
located, and to the extent required by the Borrowers as of the date of
origination consistent with the Underwriting Guidelines, against earthquake and
other risks insured against by Persons operating like properties in the locality
of the Mortgaged Property, in an amount not less than the greatest of (i) 100%
of the replacement cost of all improvements to the Mortgaged Property, (ii) the
outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, or (iii) the amount
necessary to avoid the operation of any co-insurance provisions with respect to
the Mortgaged Property, and consistent with the amount that would have been
required as of the date of origination in accordance with the Underwriting
Guidelines. If any portion of the Mortgaged Property is in an area identified by
any federal Governmental Authority as having special flood hazards, and flood
insurance is available, a flood insurance policy meeting the current guidelines
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is in effect with a generally
acceptable insurance carrier, in an amount representing coverage not less than
the least of (1) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, (2) the
full insurable value of the Mortgaged Property, and (3) the maximum amount of
insurance available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended
by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1974. All such insurance policies
(collectively, the "hazard insurance policy") contain a standard mortgagee
clause naming the relevant Borrower, its successors and assigns (including
without limitation, subsequent owners of the Mortgage Loan), as mortgagee, and
may not be reduced, terminated or canceled without thirty (30) days' prior
written notice to the mortgagee. No such notice has been received by any
Borrower. All premiums on such insurance policy have been paid. The related
Mortgage obligates the Mortgagor to maintain all such insurance and, at such
Mortgagor's failure to do so, authorizes the mortgagee to maintain such
insurance at the Mortgagor's cost and expense and to seek reimbursement therefor
from such Mortgagor. Where required by state law or regulation, the Mortgagor
has been given an opportunity to choose the carrier of the required hazard
insurance, provided the policy is not a "master" or "blanket" hazard insurance
policy covering a condominium, or any hazard insurance policy covering the
common facilities of a planned unit development. The hazard insurance policy is
the valid and binding obligation of the insurer and is in full force and effect.
No Borrower has engaged in, and has no knowledge of the Mortgagor's having
engaged in, any act or omission which would impair the coverage of any such
policy, the benefits of the endorsement provided for herein, or the validity and
binding effect of either including, without limitation, no unlawful fee,
commission, kickback or other unlawful compensation or value of any kind has
been or will be received, retained or realized by any attorney, firm or other
Person, and no such unlawful items have been received, retained or realized by
any Borrower.

            (g) Compliance with Applicable Laws. Any and all requirements of any
federal, state or local law including, without limitation, usury,
truth-in-lending, real estate settlement procedures, consumer credit protection,
equal credit opportunity or disclosure laws applicable to the Mortgage Loan have
been complied with, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will not involve the violation of any such laws or regulations, and each
Borrower shall maintain or shall cause its agent to maintain in its possession,
available for the inspection of the Lender, and shall deliver to the Lender,
upon demand, evidence of compliance with all such requirements.

            (h) No Satisfaction of Mortgage. The Mortgage has not been
satisfied, canceled, subordinated or rescinded, in whole or in part, and the
Mortgaged Property has not been released from the lien of the Mortgage, in whole
or in part, nor has any instrument been executed that would effect any such
release, cancellation, subordination or rescission. No Borrower has waived the
performance by the Mortgagor of any action, if the Mortgagor's failure to
perform such action would cause the Mortgage Loan to be in default, nor has any
Borrower waived any default resulting from any action or inaction by the
Mortgagor.

            (i) Location and Type of Mortgaged Property. The Mortgaged Property
is located in an Acceptable State as identified in the Mortgage Loan Schedule
and consists of a single parcel of real property with a detached single family
residence erected thereon, a Cooperative Unit in a Cooperative Project, or a
two- to four-family dwelling, or an individual condominium unit in a low-rise or
high-rise condominium project, or an individual unit in a planned unit
development or a de minimis planned unit development, provided, however, that
any condominium unit or planned unit development shall conform with the
applicable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac requirements regarding such dwellings and
that no residence or dwelling is a mobile home or a manufactured dwelling. No
portion of the Mortgaged Property is used for commercial purposes.

            (j) Valid First Lien. The Mortgage is a valid, subsisting,
enforceable and perfected first lien on the real property included in the
Mortgaged Property, including all buildings on the Mortgaged Property and all
installations and mechanical, electrical, plumbing, heating and air conditioning
systems located in or annexed to such buildings, and all additions, alterations
and replacements made at any time with respect to the foregoing. The lien of the
Mortgage is subject only to:

            (1) the lien of current real property taxes and assessments not yet
      due and payable;

            (2) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements
      and other matters of the public record as of the date of recording
      acceptable to prudent mortgage lending institutions generally and
      specifically referred to in the lender's title insurance policy delivered
      to the originator of the Mortgage Loan and (a) referred to or otherwise
      considered in the appraisal made for the originator of the Mortgage Loan
      or (b) which do not adversely affect the Appraised Value of the Mortgaged
      Property set forth in such appraisal; and

            (3) other matters to which like properties are commonly subject
      which do not materially interfere with the benefits of the security
      intended to be provided by the Mortgage or the use, enjoyment, value or
      marketability of the related Mortgaged Property.

Any security agreement, chattel mortgage or equivalent document related to and
delivered in connection with the Mortgage Loan establishes and creates a valid,
subsisting and enforceable first lien and first priority security interest on
the property described therein and the relevant Borrower has full right to
pledge and assign the same to the Lender. The Mortgaged Property was not, as of
the date of origination of the Mortgage Loan, subject to a mortgage, deed of
trust, deed to secure debt or other security instrument creating a lien
subordinate to the lien of the Mortgage.

            (k) Validity of Mortgage Documents. The Mortgage Note and the
Mortgage and any other agreement executed and delivered by a Mortgagor or
guarantor, if applicable, in connection with a Mortgage Loan are genuine, and
each is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the maker thereof enforceable
in accordance with its terms. All parties to the Mortgage Note, the Mortgage and
any other such related agreement had legal capacity to enter into the Mortgage
Loan and to execute and deliver the Mortgage Note, the Mortgage and any such
agreement, and the Mortgage Note, the Mortgage and any other such related
agreement have been duly and properly executed by such related parties. No
fraud, error, omission, misrepresentation, negligence or similar occurrence with
respect to a Mortgage Loan has taken place on the part of any Person, including,
without limitation, the Mortgagor, any appraiser, any builder or developer, or
any other party involved in the origination of the Mortgage Loan. Each Borrower
has reviewed all of the documents constituting the Servicing File and has made
such inquiries as it deems necessary to make and confirm the accuracy of the
representations set forth herein.

            (l) Full Disbursement of Proceeds. The Mortgage Loan has been closed
and the proceeds of the Mortgage Loan have been fully disbursed and there is no
further requirement for future advances thereunder, and any and all requirements
as to completion of any on-site or off-site improvement and as to disbursements
of any escrow funds therefor have been complied with. All costs, fees and
expenses incurred in making or closing the Mortgage Loan and the recording of
the Mortgage were paid, and the Mortgagor is not entitled to any refund of any
amounts paid or due under the Mortgage Note or Mortgage.

            (m) Ownership. The relevant Borrower is the sole owner and holder of
the Mortgage Loan. The Mortgage Loan is not assigned or pledged, and the
relevant Borrower has good, indefeasible and marketable title thereto, and has
full right to transfer, pledge and assign the Mortgage Loan to the Lender free
and clear of any encumbrance, equity, participation interest, lien, pledge,
charge, claim or security interest, and has full right and authority subject to
no interest or participation of, or agreement with, any other party, to assign,
transfer and pledge each Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Loan Agreement and
following the pledge of each Mortgage Loan, the Lender will hold such Mortgage
Loan free and clear of any encumbrance, equity, participation interest, lien,
pledge, charge, claim or security interest except any such security interest
created pursuant to the terms of this Loan Agreement.

            (n) Doing Business. All parties which have had any interest in the
Mortgage Loan, whether as mortgagee, assignee, pledgee or otherwise, are (or,
during the period in which they held and disposed of such interest, were) (i) in
compliance with any and all applicable licensing requirements of the laws of the
state wherein the Mortgaged Property is located, and (ii) either (A) organized
under the laws of such state, (B) qualified to do business in such state, (C) a
federal savings and loan association, a savings bank or a national bank having a
principal office in such state, or (D) not doing business in such state.

            (o) LTV. No Mortgage loan (other than an Alternate `A' Mortgage
Loan, Agency Eligible Mortgage Loan, California Program Mortgage Loan, Conduit
Eligible Mortgage Loan or Jumbo Mortgage Loan) has an LTV greater than 80%. No
Alternate 'A' Mortgage Loan has an LTV greater than 90%. No Agency Eligible
Mortgage Loan (other than California Program Mortgage Loans) has an LTV greater
than 97%, no California Program Mortgage Loan has an LTV greater than 100% and
no Conduit Eligible Mortgage Loan has an LTV greater than 90%; provided, that
with respect to each Agency Eligible Mortgage Loan and each California Program
Mortgage Loan with an LTV greater than 80% the excess over 80% is and will be
insured as to payment defaults by a PMI Policy until the LTV of such Mortgage
Loan is reduced to 80%. With respect to each Jumbo Mortgage Loan with an LTV
greater than 80%, the excess over 80% is and will be insured as to payment
defaults by a PMI Policy until the LTV of such Mortgage Loan is reduced to 80%.

            (p) Title Insurance. Other than each Cooperative Loan, the Mortgage
Loan is covered by either (i) an attorney's opinion of title and abstract of
title, the form and substance of which is acceptable to prudent mortgage lending
institutions making mortgage loans in the area wherein the Mortgaged Property is
located or (ii) an ALTA lender's title insurance policy or other generally
acceptable form of policy or insurance acceptable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac
and each such title insurance policy is issued by a title insurer acceptable to
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and qualified to do business in the jurisdiction where
the Mortgaged Property is located, insuring the relevant Borrower, its
successors and assigns, as to the first priority lien of the Mortgage in the
original principal amount of the Mortgage Loan (or to the extent a Mortgage Note
provides for negative amortization, the maximum amount of negative amortization
in accordance with the Mortgage), subject only to the exceptions contained in
clauses (1), (2) and (3) of paragraph (j) of this Part I of Schedule 1, and in
the case of adjustable rate Mortgage Loans, against any loss by reason of the
invalidity or unenforceability of the lien resulting from the provisions of the
Mortgage providing for adjustment to the Mortgage Interest Rate and Monthly
Payment. Where required by state law or regulation, the Mortgagor has been given
the opportunity to choose the carrier of the required mortgage title insurance.
Additionally, such lender's title insurance policy affirmatively insures ingress
and egress and against encroachments by or upon the Mortgaged Property or any
interest therein. The title policy does not contain any special exceptions
(other than the standard exclusions) for zoning and uses and has been marked to
delete the standard survey exception or to replace the standard survey exception
with a specific survey reading. The relevant Borrower, its successors and
assigns, are the sole insureds of such lender's title insurance policy, and such
lender's title insurance policy is valid and remains in full force and effect
and will be in force and effect upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Loan Agreement. No claims have been made under such
lender's title insurance policy, and no prior holder or servicer of the related
Mortgage, including any Borrower, has done, by act or omission, anything which
would impair the coverage of such lender's title insurance policy, including,
without limitation, no unlawful fee, commission, kickback or other unlawful
compensation or value of any kind has been or will be received, retained or
realized by any attorney, firm or other Person, and no such unlawful items have
been received, retained or realized by any Borrower.

            (q) No Defaults. There is no default, breach, violation or event of
acceleration existing under the Mortgage or the Mortgage Note and no event has
occurred which, with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration of
any grace or cure period, would constitute a default, breach, violation or event
of acceleration, and neither any Borrower nor its predecessors have waived any
default, breach, violation or event of acceleration.

            (r) No Mechanics' Liens. There are no mechanics' or similar liens or
claims which have been filed for work, labor or material (and no rights are
outstanding that under the law could give rise to such liens) affecting the
Mortgaged Property which are or may be liens prior to, or equal or coordinate
with, the lien of the Mortgage.

            (s) Location of Improvements; No Encroachments. With respect to each
Mortgage Loan other than a Cooperative Loan, all improvements which were
considered in determining the Appraised Value of the Mortgaged Property lie
wholly within the boundaries and building restriction lines of the Mortgaged
Property, and no improvements on adjoining properties encroach upon the
Mortgaged Property. No improvement located on or being part of the Mortgaged
Property is in violation of any applicable zoning and building law, ordinance or
regulation.

            (t) Origination; Payment Terms. The Mortgage Loan was originated by
or in conjunction with a mortgagee approved by the Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development pursuant to Sections 203 and 211 of the National Housing Act,
a savings and loan association, a savings bank, a commercial bank, credit union,
insurance company or similar banking institution which is supervised and
examined by a federal or state authority. Principal payments on the Mortgage
Loan commenced no more than sixty (60) days after funds were disbursed in
connection with the Mortgage Loan. The Mortgage Interest Rate is adjusted, with
respect to adjustable rate Mortgage Loans, on each Interest Rate Adjustment Date
to equal the Index plus the Gross Margin (rounded up or down to the nearest
.125%), subject to the Mortgage Interest Rate Cap. The Mortgage Note is payable
on the first day of each month in equal monthly installments of principal and
interest, which installments of interest, with respect to adjustable rate
Mortgage Loans, are subject to change due to the adjustments to the Mortgage
Interest Rate on each Interest Rate Adjustment Date, with interest calculated
and payable in arrears, sufficient to amortize the Mortgage Loan fully by the
stated maturity date, over an original term of not more than 30 years from
commencement of amortization. The due date of the first payment under the
Mortgage Note is no more than sixty (60) days from the date of the Mortgage
Note.

            (u) Customary Provisions. The Mortgage Note has a stated maturity.
Other than a Cooperative Loan, the Mortgage contains customary and enforceable
provisions such as to render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof
adequate for the realization against the Mortgaged Property of the benefits of
the security provided thereby, including, (i) in the case of a Mortgage
designated as a deed of trust, by trustee's sale, and (ii) otherwise by judicial
foreclosure. Upon default by a Mortgagor on a Mortgage Loan and foreclosure on,
or trustee's sale of, the Mortgaged Property pursuant to the proper procedures,
the holder of the Mortgage Loan will be able to deliver good and merchantable
title to the Mortgaged Property. There is no homestead or other exemption
available to a Mortgagor which would interfere with the right to sell the
Mortgaged Property at a trustee's sale or the right to foreclose the Mortgage.

            (v) Conformance with Underwriting Guidelines and Agency Standards.
The Mortgage Loan was underwritten in accordance with the Underwriting
Guidelines. The Mortgage Note and Mortgage are on forms similar to those used by
Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae and no Borrower has made any representations to a
Mortgagor that are inconsistent with the mortgage instruments used (other than
exceptions acceptable to the Lender, in its sole discretion, in the case of
Jumbo Mortgage Loans).

            (w) Occupancy of the Mortgaged Property or Cooperative Unit. As of
the Funding Date the Mortgaged Property or Cooperative Unit is lawfully occupied
under applicable law. All inspections, licenses and certificates required to be
made or issued with respect to all occupied portions of the Mortgaged Property
and, with respect to the use and occupancy of the same, including but not
limited to certificates of occupancy and fire underwriting certificates, have
been made or obtained from the appropriate authorities. No Borrower has received
notification from any Governmental Authority that the Mortgaged Property or
Cooperative Unit is in material non-compliance with such laws or regulations, is
being used, operated or occupied unlawfully or has failed to have or obtain such
inspection, licenses or certificates, as the case may be. No Borrower has
received notice of any violation or failure to conform with any such law,
ordinance, regulation, standard, license or certificate. The Mortgagor
represented at the time of origination of the Mortgage Loan that the Mortgagor
would occupy the Mortgaged Property as the Mortgagor's primary residence.

            (x) No Additional Collateral. The Mortgage Note is not and has not
been secured by any collateral except the lien of the corresponding Mortgage and
the security interest of any applicable security agreement or chattel mortgage
referred to in clause (j) above.

            (y) Deeds of Trust. In the event the Mortgage constitutes a deed of
trust, a trustee, authorized and duly qualified under applicable law to serve as
such, has been properly designated and currently so serves and is named in the
Mortgage, and no fees or expenses are or will become payable by the Custodian or
the Lender to the trustee under the deed of trust, except in connection with a
trustee's sale after default by the Mortgagor.

            (z) Delivery of Mortgage Documents. The Mortgage Note, the Mortgage,
the Assignment of Mortgage and any other documents required to be delivered
under the Custodial Agreement for each Mortgage Loan have been delivered to the
Custodian. A Borrower or its agent is in possession of a complete, true and
accurate Mortgage File in compliance with the Custodial Agreement, except for
such documents the originals of which have been delivered to the Custodian.

            (aa) Transfer of Mortgage Loans. With respect to each Mortgage Loan
other than a Cooperative Loan, the Assignment of Mortgage is in recordable form
and is acceptable for recording under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
Mortgaged Property is located. With respect to each Cooperative Loan, the UCC-3
assignment is in a form suitable for filing in the jurisdiction in which the
Mortgaged Property is located.

            (bb) Due-On-Sale. The Mortgage contains an enforceable provision for
the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage
Loan in the event that the Mortgaged Property or Cooperative Unit, as
applicable, is sold or transferred without the prior written consent of the
mortgagee thereunder.

            (cc) No Buydown Provisions; No Graduated Payments or Contingent
Interests. The Mortgage Loan does not contain provisions pursuant to which
Monthly Payments are paid or partially paid with funds deposited in any separate
account established by the Borrowers, the Mortgagor, or anyone on behalf of the
Mortgagor, or paid by any source other than the Mortgagor nor does it contain
any other similar provisions which may constitute a "buydown" provision. The
Mortgage Loan is not a graduated payment mortgage loan and the Mortgage Loan
does not have a shared appreciation or other contingent interest feature.

            (dd) Consolidation of Future Advances. Any future advances made to
the Mortgagor prior to the Funding Date have been consolidated with the
outstanding principal amount secured by the Mortgage, and the secured principal
amount, as consolidated, bears a single interest rate and single repayment term.
With respect to each Mortgage Loan other than a Cooperative Loan, the lien of
the Mortgage securing the consolidated principal amount is expressly insured as
having first lien priority by a title insurance policy, an endorsement to the
policy insuring the mortgagee's consolidated interest or by other title evidence
acceptable to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The consolidated principal amount does
not exceed the original principal amount of the Mortgage Loan.

            (ee) Mortgaged Property Undamaged. The Mortgaged Property or
Cooperative Unit is undamaged by waste, fire, earthquake or earth movement,
windstorm, flood, tornado or other casualty so as to affect adversely the value
of the Mortgaged Property or Cooperative Unit as security for the Mortgage Loan
or the use for which the premises were intended and each Mortgaged Property is
in good repair. There have not been any condemnation proceedings with respect to
the Mortgaged Property and no Borrower has knowledge of any such proceedings.

            (ff) Collection Practices; Escrow Deposits; Interest Rate
Adjustments. The origination and collection practices used by the originator,
each servicer of the Mortgage Loan and each Borrower with respect to the
Mortgage Loan have been in all respects in compliance with Accepted Servicing
Practices, applicable laws and regulations, and have been in all respects legal
and proper. With respect to escrow deposits and Escrow Payments, all such
payments are in the possession of, or under the control of, the relevant
Borrower and there exist no deficiencies in connection therewith for which
customary arrangements for repayment thereof have not been made. All Escrow
Payments have been collected in full compliance with state and federal law. An
escrow of funds is not prohibited by applicable law and (for Mortgage Loans
other than Cooperative Loans) has been established in an amount sufficient to
pay for every item that remains unpaid and has been assessed but is not yet due
and payable. No escrow deposits or Escrow Payments or other charges or payments
due the relevant Borrower have been capitalized under the Mortgage or the
Mortgage Note. All Mortgage Interest Rate adjustments have been made in strict
compliance with state and federal law and the terms of the related Mortgage
Note. Any interest required to be paid pursuant to state, federal and local law
has been properly paid and credited.

            (gg) Conversion to Fixed Interest Rate. With respect to adjustable
rate Mortgage Loans, the Mortgage Loan is not convertible to a fixed interest
rate Mortgage Loan.

            (hh) Other Insurance Policies. No action, inaction or event has
occurred and no state of facts exists or has existed that has resulted or will
result in the exclusion from, denial of, or defense to coverage under any
applicable special hazard insurance policy, PMI Policy or bankruptcy bond,
irrespective of the cause of such failure of coverage. In connection with the
placement of any such insurance, no commission, fee, or other compensation has
been or will be received by any Borrower or by any officer, director, or
employee of any Borrower or any designee of any Borrower or any corporation in
which any Borrower or any officer, director, or employee had a financial
interest at the time of placement of such insurance.

            (ii) Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act. The Mortgagor has not
notified any Borrower, and no Borrower has knowledge, of any relief requested or
allowed to the Mortgagor under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of
1940.

            (jj) Appraisal. The Mortgage File contains an appraisal of the
related Mortgaged Property or Cooperative Unit, as applicable, signed prior to
the approval of the Mortgage Loan application by a qualified appraiser, duly
appointed by the Borrowers, who had no interest, direct or indirect in the
Mortgaged Property or Cooperative Unit, as applicable, or in any loan made on
the security thereof, and whose compensation is not affected by the approval or
disapproval of the Mortgage Loan, and the appraisal and appraiser both satisfy
the requirements of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and Title XI of the Federal
Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 as amended and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, all as in effect on the date the Mortgage
Loan was originated.

(kk) Disclosure Materials. The Mortgagor has executed a statement to the effect
that the Mortgagor has received all disclosure materials required by applicable
law with respect to the making of adjustable rate mortgage loans, and the
relevant Borrower maintains such statement in the Mortgage File.

            (ll) Construction or Rehabilitation of Mortgaged Property. No
Mortgage Loan was made in connection with the construction or rehabilitation of
a Mortgaged Property or facilitating the trade-in or exchange of a Mortgaged
Property.

            (mm) No Defense to Insurance Coverage. No action has been taken or
failed to be taken, no event has occurred and no state of facts exists or has
existed on or prior to the Funding Date (whether or not known to any Borrower on
or prior to such date) which has resulted or will result in an exclusion from,
denial of, or defense to coverage under any private mortgage insurance
(including, without limitation, any exclusions, denials or defenses which would
limit or reduce the availability of the timely payment of the full amount of the
loss otherwise due thereunder to the insured) whether arising out of actions,
representations, errors, omissions, negligence, or fraud of any Borrower, the
related Mortgagor or any party involved in the application for such coverage,
including the appraisal, plans and specifications and other exhibits or
documents submitted therewith to the insurer under such insurance policy, or for
any other reason under such coverage, but not including the failure of such
insurer to pay by reason of such insurer's breach of such insurance policy or
such insurer's financial inability to pay.

            (nn) Capitalization of Interest. The Mortgage Note does not by its
terms provide for the capitalization or forbearance of interest.

            (oo) No Equity Participation. No document relating to the Mortgage
Loan provides for any contingent or additional interest in the form of
participation in the cash flow of the Mortgaged Property or a sharing in the
appreciation of the value of the Mortgaged Property. The indebtedness evidenced
by the Mortgage Note is not convertible to an ownership interest in the
Mortgaged Property or the Mortgagor and no Borrower has financed nor does it own
directly or indirectly, any equity of any form in the Mortgaged Property or the
Mortgagor.

            (pp) Proceeds of Mortgage Loan. The proceeds of the Mortgage Loan
have not been and shall not be used to satisfy, in whole or in part, any debt
owed or owing by the Mortgagor to any Borrower or any Affiliate or correspondent
of any Borrower.

            (qq) Withdrawn Mortgage Loans. If the Mortgage Loan has been
released to any Borrower pursuant to a Request for Release as permitted under
Section 5 of the Custodial Agreement, then the promissory note relating to the
Mortgage Loan was returned to the Custodian within eighteen (18) days (or if
such eighteenth day was not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day).

            (rr) Origination Date. The Origination Date is no earlier than nine
months prior to the date the Mortgage Loan is first included in the Borrowing
Base.

            (ss) No Exception. The Custodian has not noted any material
exceptions on an Exception Report (as defined in the Custodial Agreement) with
respect to the Mortgage Loan which would materially adversely affect the
Mortgage Loan or the Lender's security interest, granted by the Borrowers, in
the Mortgage Loan.

            (tt) Qualified Originator. The Mortgage Loan has been originated by,
and, if applicable, purchased by a Borrower from, a Qualified Originator.

            (uu) Mortgage Submitted for Recordation. The Mortgage either has
been or will promptly be submitted for recordation in the appropriate
governmental recording office of the jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Property
is located.

            (vv) Riegle Act. None of the Mortgage Loans are classified as "high
cost" loans under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994.

            (ww) Cooperative Loans. With respect to each Cooperative Loan, the
Seller represents and warrants:

            (1) the Cooperative Loan is secured by a valid, subsisting,
      enforceable and perfected first lien on the Cooperative Shares issued to
      the related Mortgagor with respect to such Cooperative Loan. The lien of
      the Security Agreement is subject only to the Cooperative Corporation's
      lien against such corporation stock, shares or membership certificate for
      unpaid assessments of the Cooperative Corporation to the extent required
      by applicable law. Any Security Agreement, chattel mortgage or equivalent
      document related to and delivered in connection with the Cooperative Loan
      establishes and creates a valid, subsisting and enforceable first lien and
      first priority security interest on the property described therein and the
      Borrowers has full right to sell and assign the same to the Lender. The
      Cooperative Unit was not, as of the date of origination of the Cooperative
      Loan, subject to a mortgage, deed of trust, deed to secure debt or other
      security instrument creating a lien subordinate to the lien of the
      Security Agreement.

            (2) There is no proceeding pending or threatened for the total or
      partial condemnation of the building owned by the applicable Cooperative
      Corporation (the "Underlying Mortgaged Property"). The Underlying
      Mortgaged Property is undamaged by waste, fire, earthquake or earth
      movement, windstorm, flood, tornado or other casualty so as to affect
      adversely the value of the Underlying Mortgaged Property as security for
      the mortgage loan on such Underlying Mortgaged Property (the "Cooperative
      Mortgage") or the use for which the premises were intended.

            (3) There is no default, breach, violation or event of acceleration
      existing under the Cooperative Mortgage or the mortgage note related
      thereto and no event which, with the passage of time or with notice and
      the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a default,
      breach, violation or event of acceleration.

            (4) The Cooperative Corporation has been duly organized and is
      validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction
      of its formation. The Cooperative Corporation has requisite power and
      authority to (i) own its properties, and (ii) transact the business in
      which it is now engaged. The Cooperative Corporation possesses all rights,
      licenses, permits and authorizations, governmental or otherwise, necessary
      to entitle it to own its properties and to transact the businesses in
      which is now engaged.

            (5) The Cooperative Corporation complies in all material respects
      with all applicable legal requirements. The Cooperative Corporation is not
      in default or violation of any order, writ, injunction, decree or demand
      of any governmental authority, the violation of which might materially
      adversely affect the condition (financial or otherwise) or business of the
      Cooperative Corporation.

            (6) The Borrowers has delivered to the Lender or its designee each
      of the following documents (collectively, the "Cooperative Loan
      Documents"): (i) the Cooperative Loan Note, duly endorsed in accordance
      with the endorsement requirements for Mortgage Notes set forth in this
      Agreement, (ii) the Security Agreement, (iii) the Cooperative Shares
      accompanied by a stock power which authorizes the Lender to transfer the
      Cooperative Shares in the event of a default under the Cooperative Loan
      Documents, (iv) the proprietary lease or occupancy agreement, accompanied
      by an assignment in blank of such proprietary lease, (v) a recognition
      agreement executed by the Cooperative Corporation, which requires the
      Cooperative Corporation to recognize the rights of the lender and its
      successors in interest and assigns, under the Cooperative Loan,
      accompanied by an assignment of such recognition agreement in blank, (vi)
      UCC-1 financing statements with recording information thereon from the
      appropriate state and county recording offices if necessary to perfect the
      security interest of the Cooperative Loan under the Uniform Commercial
      Code in the state in which the Cooperative Project is located, accompanied
      by UCC-3 financing statements executed in blank for recordation of the
      change in the secured party thereunder, and (vii) any guarantees, if
      applicable. The Cooperative Loan Documents are assignable to the Lender
      and its successors and assigns and have been duly assigned to the Lender
      in accordance with this sub-section (f ).

            (7) The Security Agreement contains customary and enforceable
      provisions such as to render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof
      adequate for the realization against the Cooperative Shares of the
      benefits of the security provided thereby.

            (8) As of the date of origination the related Cooperative Project is
      insured by a generally acceptable insurer against loss by fire, hazards of
      extended coverage and such other hazards as are customary in the area
      where the Cooperative Project is located.
