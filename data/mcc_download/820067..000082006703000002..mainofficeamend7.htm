<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">W I T N E S S E T H</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS</B>, Baker Dennard Co., Landlord's predecessor in interest, and Tenant entered into that certain Lease Agreement dated December 3, 1993 (the "Lease"), as amended by that certain Amendment #1 dated May 18, 1994 (the "First Amendment"), as further amended by that certain Amendment #2 dated February 19, 1997 (the "Second Amendment"), as further amended by that certain Amendment #3 dated September 26, 1997 (the "Third Amendment"), as further amended by that certain Fourth Amendment to Lease Agreement dated December 31, 1998 (the "Fourth Amendment"), as further amended by that certain Fifth Amendment to Lease dated March 13, 2000 (the "Fifth Amendment") and as further amended by that certain Sixth Amendment to Lease dated January 4, 2001 (the "Sixth Amendment") (the Lease, the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Third Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment shall be known collectively herein as the "Lease") pursuant to which Tenant leased that certain premises on the first and third floors of the building located at Plaza Square North, 4360 Chamblee-Dunwoody Road, Atlanta, Georgia (the "Building") and known as Suites 109, 300, 301 and 315, said premises containing, in the aggregate, Twenty-Three Thousand Four Hundred Seventy-Five (23,475) rentable square feet of office space, which consists of Eight Thousand Nine Hundred Forty One (8,941) rentable square feet of office space on the first floor ("First Floor Premises") and Fourteen Thousand Five Hundred Thirty-Four (14,534) rentable square feet of office space on the third floor ("Third Floor Premises") (collectively the "Original Premises");</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHEREAS</B>, Landlord and Tenant desire to amend the Lease to (i) increase the square footage of the Premises and (ii) amend and modify certain terms and conditions of the Lease as hereinafter provided. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOW, THEREFORE</B>, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants and agreements herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Landlord and Tenant hereby agree to the following: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.&#9;<B><U>Recitals</B></U>. The recitals set forth above are incorporated herein by this reference with the same force and effect as if fully set forth hereinafter.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&#9;<B><U>Capitalized Terms</B></U>. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Lease. The Lease, the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Third Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment and this Seventh Amendment shall be known collectively as the "Lease." </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;<B><U>Premises</B></U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">a.&#9;The rentable square footage of the "Original Premises" and the rentable square footage of the "Premises" set forth in the Sixth Amendment are incorrect. Therefore, (i) all references in the Sixth Amendment to the "Original Premises" containing Twenty-One Thousand Seven Hundred Twenty-Nine (21,729) rentable square feet are hereby deleted and "Nineteen Thousand Four Hundred Three (19,403) rentable square feet" shall be substituted in lieu thereof, and (ii) all references in the Sixth Amendment to the entire "Premises" containing Twenty-Five Thousand Eight Hundred One (25,801) rentable square feet are hereby deleted and "Twenty-Three Thousand Four Hundred Seventy-Five (23,475) rentable square feet" shall be substituted in lieu thereof. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Sixth Amendment or elsewhere, prior to the "Second Additional Premises Commencement Date" (defined hereinafter), the "Premises" consists of Suite 109 (containing 8,941 rentable square feet), Suite 300 (containing 9,943 rentable square feet which such square footage includes the 388 rentable square feet of space formerly known as Suite 302), Suite 301 (containing 519 rentable square feet) and Suite 315 (containing 4,072 rentable square feet). The corrections set forth in this subparagraph (a) shall have no effect on the calculation of Fixed Minimum Rent with respect to the "Additional Premises" (defined in Paragraph 3(a) of the Sixth Amendment) set forth in Paragraph 5 of the Sixth Amendment nor the calculation of Tenant's Share with respect to the Additional Premises set forth in Paragraph 6 of the Sixth Amendment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">b.&#9;Effective on the date that the "Improvements" described in Paragraph 7 hereinbelow are substantially complete (the "Second Additional Premises Commencement Date"), the Original Premises shall be increased by Six Hundred Ninety-Six (696) rentable square feet of space on the third (3rd) floor of the Building as shown on Exhibit A-4 attached hereto and made a part hereof (the "Second Additional Premises") to Twenty-Four Thousand One Hundred Seventy- One (24,171) rentable square feet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">c.&#9;After the Second Additional Premises Commencement Date has occurred, Tenant shall, within five (5) days after Landlord's request, complete and execute the letter attached hereto as Exhibit "B-4" and deliver it to Landlord.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">d.&#9;As of the Second Additional Premises Commencement Date, Section 1 of the Lease, as amended by Paragraph 2 of the First Amendment, Paragraph 1 of the Second Amendment, Paragraph 2 of the Third Amendment, Paragraph 3 of the Sixth Amendment and Paragraph 3(a) of this Seventh Amendment, shall be further amended to reflect the rentable square footage of the Premises as Twenty-Four Thousand One Hundred Seventy-One (24,171) which shall consist of Twenty-Three Thousand Four Hundred Seventy-Five (23,475) rentable square feet with respect to the Original Premises and Six Hundred Ninety-Six (696) rentable square feet with respect to the Second Additional Premises.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">e.&#9;From and after the Second Additional Premises Commencement Date, except as otherwise provided herein, all references in the Lease to "Premises" shall refer collectively to the Original Premises and the Second Additional Premises.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.&#9;<B><U>Term</B></U>. The Term of the Lease with respect to the Second Additional Premises shall be coterminous with the Term of the Lease with respect to the Third Floor Premises and accordingly shall commence on the Second Additional Premises Commencement Date and expire on December 31, 2007 (inclusively, the "Second Additional Premises Term") unless terminated sooner pursuant to the provisions of the Lease or hereof.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&#9;<B><U>Fixed Minimum Rent</B></U>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Lease, during the Second Additional Premises Term Tenant shall pay to Landlord Fixed Minimum Rent with respect to the Second Additional Premises in the manner and at the times set forth in the first paragraph of Section 3 of the Lease according to the following schedule: </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">WORK LETTER AGREEMENT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.&#9;<B>Base Building Work</B>.  Landlord and Tenant understand and acknowledge that this Agreement relates only to "non-base building" work in the Second Additional Premises. The "base building work" has been or will be performed by Landlord at Landlord's sole cost and expense.  The term "base building work" means and refers to the following elements of the Second Additional Premises: concrete floors (without floor covering); unfinished perimeter walls; unfinished ceilings (without acoustical ceilings, ceiling tiles, suspension system, insulation or light fixtures); closets for telephone and electrical systems (but not the systems themselves); building systems within the building core only as follows: mechanical (including heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems), electrical and plumbing systems; and primary fire sprinkler distribution loop connected to core (secondary branch distribution to the Second Additional Premises to accommodate Tenant's specific tenant improvements shall not be considered base building work).  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&#9;<B>Plans and Specifications</B>.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1.&#9;<B>Space Plan</B>. Within five (5) business days after the execution of the Seventh Amendment by Landlord and Tenant, whichever signs later, Landlord shall submit to Tenant for approval a detailed space plan ("Space Plan") for the Second Additional Premises prepared by Landlord's architects and consultants, which shall include without limitation, the location of doors, partitions, electrical and telephone outlets, plumbing fixtures, heavy floor loads and other special requirements. If applicable, Landlord reserves the right to approve Tenant's architect and/or space planner. Tenant agrees to cooperate with Landlord and its design representatives in connection with the preparation of the Space Plan. Within five (5) business days after receipt by Tenant of the Space Plan, Tenant (i) shall give its written approval with respect thereto, or (ii) shall notify Landlord in writing of its disapproval and state with specificity the grounds for such disapproval and the revisions or modifications necessary in order for Tenant to give its approval. Within three (3) business days following Landlord's receipt of Tenant's disapproval, Landlord shall submit to Tenant for approval the requested revisions or modifications. Within three (3) business days following receipt by Tenant of such revisions or modifications, Tenant shall give its written approval with respect thereto or shall request other revisions or modifications therein, and any time delay incurred in the approval of the Space Plan from the date of this second notice of disapproval shall constitute Tenant Delay (as that term is defined in Section 7 hereof).  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.2.&#9;<B>Plans</B>. Based on the approved Space Plan, Landlord shall cause its architects and engineers to prepare and submit to Tenant for approval detailed plans, specifications and working drawings ("Plans") for the construction of Tenant's leasehold improvements to the Second Additional Premises ("Improvements"). Landlord reserves the right to approve any space planner, architect or engineer if employed by Tenant. As used herein, the term "Improvements" shall include all non-base building work to be done in the Second Additional Premises pursuant to the Plans, including, but not limited to: demolition work, partitioning, doors, ceiling, floor coverings, wall finishes (including paint and wall coverings), window coverings, electrical (including lighting, switching, telephones, outlets, computer and special electrical equipment, etc.), plumbing, heating, ventilating and air conditioning, fire protection, cabinets and other millwork. If Tenant has leased an entire floor, the Improvements shall include finished toilet rooms, corridors and elevator vestibules. Landlord shall submit the Plans to Tenant for approval within ten (10) business days following Tenant's approval of the Space Plan. Within three (3) business days after receipt by Tenant of the Plans, Tenant (i) shall give its written approval with respect thereto, or (ii) shall notify Landlord in writing of its disapproval and state with specificity the grounds for such disapproval and the revisions or modifications necessary in order for Tenant to give its approval. Within five (5) business days following Landlord's receipt of Tenant's disapproval, Landlord shall submit to Tenant for approval the requested revisions or modifications. Within three (3) business days following receipt by Tenant of such revisions or modifications, Tenant shall give its written approval with respect thereto or shall request other revisions or modifications therein. After approval of the Plans by Tenant, no further changes to the Plans shall be made without the prior written approval of Landlord and only after Tenant agrees that any delays in design and/or construction resulting from such change shall constitute a Tenant Delay. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;<B>Specifications for Building Standard Improvements</B>. Specifications and details for building standard improvements ("Standards") are available in the office of the Building. Except as specified in Section 4 below, the Space Plan and Plans shall be consistent with the Standards, and no deviations shall be permitted from the Standards without Landlord's consent as set forth in Section 4 below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.&#9;<B>Grounds for Disapproval</B>. Tenant may request deviations from the Standards for Improvements provided that the deviations ("Non-Standards") shall not be of lesser quality than the Standards. Landlord shall not be required to approve any item of the Space Plan, the Plans or the Non-Standards that (a) does not conform to applicable governmental regulations or is disapproved by any governmental agency; (b) requires building service (including electrical power) beyond the level normally provided to other tenants in the Building; or (c) overloads the floors. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&#9;<B>Improvement Cost and Allowance</B>.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.1.&#9;<B>Cost Breakdown</B>. Within a reasonable period following approval of the Plans, Landlord shall provide Tenant with a breakdown of the estimated total cost of the Improvements ("Cost Breakdown"), including, without limitation: construction cost of the Improvements; architectural and engineering fees relating to the preparation and review of the Space Plan and the Plans (inclusive of the initial Space Plan and all design work above and below the ceiling); governmental agency plan check, permit and other fees; sales and use taxes; testing and inspection costs; and construction fees (including general contractor's overhead and supervision fees and the construction supervisory fee referred to in Section 6.3 hereof). Within five (5) business days after receipt by Tenant of the Cost Breakdown, Tenant shall either approve the same in writing or shall provide Landlord with a detailed list of revisions to the approved Plans, and any time delay incurred in the approval of the Cost Breakdown from the date of Landlord's receipt of Tenant's list of revisions to the approved Plans shall constitute Tenant Delay.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.2.&#9;<B>Improvement Allowance</B>. Landlord hereby grants to Tenant an "Improvement Allowance" of up to Thirteen and 00/100 Dollars ($13.00) per square foot of space in the Second Additional Premises (i.e., 696 rentable square feet multiplied by $13.00 = $9,048.00), which Improvement Allowance shall be used only for the items specified in the Cost Breakdown. In the event that the Cost Breakdown exceeds the Improvement Allowance, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the sum in excess of the Improvement Allowance by cashier's check, which payment shall be made within five (5) business days of Landlord's notice to Tenant that Landlord is prepared to commence construction. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.3.&#9;<B>Cost Increases</B>. In the event that the cost of the Improvements increases subsequent to Tenant's approval of the Cost Breakdown due to the requirements of any governmental agency imposed with respect to the construction of the Improvements or due to any other unforeseeable circumstances, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount of such increase within ten (10) business days of Landlord's written notice; provided, however, that Landlord shall first apply toward such increase any remaining balance in the Improvement Allowance. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.4.&#9;<B>Change in Plans</B>.
