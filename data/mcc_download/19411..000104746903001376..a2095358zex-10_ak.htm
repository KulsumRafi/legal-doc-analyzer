<DL compact>
<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>1.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2><B>Employment.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Employer agrees to employ Dr.&nbsp;Harbin, and Dr.&nbsp;Harbin accepts such employment in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, commencing as of October&nbsp;1, 2002 and ending, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, on March&nbsp;17, 2004.

provisions and conditions herein. The parties agree that as Executive Chairman, Dr.&nbsp;Harbin will perform and be responsible for the usual and customary duties of a Chairman of the Board. In
addition, Dr.&nbsp;Harbin's full-time responsibilities will include a broad coordination role in order to assist the Board and senior management in the company's restructuring activities
as well as to provide support to the ongoing operations of the company. Dr.&nbsp;Harbin also will be responsible for working with senior management to handle customer issues and concerns, as well as
other key strategic issues that may arise during the restructuring efforts. However, if at any time during the term of this Agreement, Dr.&nbsp;Harbin or Employer may determine in writing that
Dr.&nbsp;Harbin will relinquish the position of Executive Chairman. In that case, Dr.&nbsp;Harbin will thereafter hold only the position of Chairman of the Board, an executive position, and such
change shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement by either party and shall not be deemed an alteration of Dr.&nbsp;Harbin's status under Section&nbsp;6(d)(i). If the shareholders do not elect
Dr.&nbsp;Harbin as a director at the next annual meeting at which Dr.&nbsp;Harbin will be considered for reelection to the Board, Dr.&nbsp;Harbin's resulting inability to serve as Executive
Chairman or Chairman of the Board shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement by either party and shall not be deemed an alteration of Dr.&nbsp;Harbin's status under Section&nbsp;6(d)(i).

Executive Chairman, Dr.&nbsp;Harbin will be required to devote only such time as is appropriate to his role as Chairman of the Board or as his part-time employment dictates.

to the provisions of Section&nbsp;7(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section&nbsp;7, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is
required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by Employer's regular independent accounting firm or,
at the election of Dr.&nbsp;Harbin, another nationally recognized independent accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting
calculations both to Employer and Dr.&nbsp;Harbin within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from Dr.&nbsp;Harbin that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by
Employer. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by Employer. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon Employer and Dr.&nbsp;Harbin. As a result of
the uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm under this Section, it is possible that Gross-Up
Payments which will not have been made by Employer should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made under this Section. If Employer exhausts its remedies
pursuant to Section&nbsp;7(c) and Dr.&nbsp;Harbin thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount, of the Underpayment that has occurred
and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by Employer to or for the benefit of Dr.&nbsp;Harbin, together with interest, from the time of payment by Dr.&nbsp;Harbin of such Excise Tax, at
the applicable federal rate provided for in Section&nbsp;7872(f)(2) of the Code.
