                            GENUINE PARTNERSHIP PLAN
                (Amended and Restated Effective January 1, 2001)

                                    ARTICLE 1

                                  INTRODUCTION

1.01     Establishment of Plan; Background.

         (a)      Effective July 1, 1988, Genuine Parts Company adopted and
                  established the Genuine Partnership Plan. Effective January 1,
                  1994, the plan was amended and restated (the "Prior Plan").
                  The Prior Plan was at all times maintained as a plan meeting
                  the requirements of Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal
                  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and of the Employee
                  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

         (b)      The Prior Plan was amended and restated effective January 1,
                  2001, and is continued in an amended and restated form as set
                  forth in its entirety in this document (the "Plan").

1.02     Effective Date.

         This Plan shall be effective as of January 1, 2001. Notwithstanding
         this general effective date, certain provisions of this Plan (as set
         forth in this document) shall have effective dates different than
         January 1, 2001.

1.03     Purpose.

         This Plan is intended to provide a cash or deferred arrangement under
         Code Sections 401(a) and 401(k). Under the Plan, Participants can
         direct that a specified percentage of the amount that otherwise would
         have been paid to them as Compensation be contributed by the Employer
         to the Plan. The benefits described in the Plan are provided for the
         exclusive benefit of the Participants and their Beneficiaries.

1.04     Plan Governs Distribution of Benefits.

         The distribution of benefits for all Participants (whether employed by
         the Employer before or after the Effective Date) shall be governed by
         the provisions of this Plan. Nevertheless, early retirement benefits,
         retirement-type subsidies, or optional forms of benefit protected under
         Code Section 411(d)(6) ("Protected Benefits") shall not be reduced or
         eliminated with respect to benefits accrued under such Protected
         Benefits unless such reduction or elimination is permitted

                                       -1-

         under the Code, Treasury Regulations, authority issued by the Internal

                                   DEFINITIONS

Certain terms of this Plan have defined meanings which are set forth in this
Article and which shall govern unless the context in which they are used clearly
indicates that some other meaning is intended.

Account shall mean the Account established and maintained by the Committee or
Trustee for each Participant or his or her Beneficiaries to which shall be
allocated each Participant's interest in the Fund. Each Account shall be
comprised of the sub-accounts described in Section 6.01.

Act or ERISA shall mean Public Law No. 93-406, the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as the same may be amended from time to time.

Adjustment shall mean, for any Valuation Date, the aggregate earnings, realized
or unrealized appreciation, losses, expenses, and realized or unrealized
depreciation of the Fund since the immediately preceding Valuation Date. The
determination of the Adjustment shall be made by the Trustee and shall be final
and binding.

Affiliate shall mean the Company and any corporation which is a member of a
controlled group of corporations (as defined in Code Section 414(b)) which
includes the Company; any trade or business which is under common control (as
defined in Code Section 414(c)) with the Company; any organization which is a
member of an affiliated service group (as defined in Code Section 414(m)) which
includes the Company; and any other entity required to be aggregated with the
Company pursuant to regulations under Code Section 414(o).

Affiliated Sponsor shall mean any corporation and any other entity that is
designated by the Committee as an Affiliated Sponsor under the Plan. See Section
16.11 for provisions relating to an Affiliated Sponsor's adoption of the Plan.
All Affiliated Sponsors, groups of employees designated as participating in the
Plan by such Affiliated Sponsors (if not all employees), and the effective date
of each company's designation as an Affiliated Sponsor shall be specified in
Schedule A or Schedule B.

Authorized Absence shall mean any temporary layoff or any absence authorized by
the Employer under the Employer's standard personnel practices, provided that
all persons under similar circumstances must be treated alike in the granting of
such Authorized Absence and provided further that the Participant returns within
the period of Authorized Absence. An absence due to service in the Armed Forces
of the United States shall be considered an Authorized Absence to the extent
required by federal law.

                                       -3-

Beneficiary shall mean, for unmarried Participants, any individual(s), trust(s),
estate(s), partnership(s), corporation(s) or other entity or entities designated
by the Participant in accordance with procedures established by the Committee to
receive any distribution to which the Participant is entitled under the Plan in
the event of the Participant's death. The Committee may require certification by
a Participant in any form it deems appropriate of the Participant's marital
status prior to accepting or honoring any Beneficiary designation. Any
Beneficiary designation shall be void if the Participant revokes the designation
or marries. Any Beneficiary designation shall be void to the extent it conflicts
with the terms of a qualified domestic relations order.

If an unmarried Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary or if the
designated Beneficiary fails to survive the Participant and the Participant has
not designated a contingent Beneficiary, the Beneficiary shall be the surviving
descendants of the Participant (who shall take per stirpes) and if there are no
surviving descendants, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant's estate. For
the purposes of the foregoing sentence, the term "descendants" shall include any
persons adopted by a Participant or by any of his descendants.

A married Participant's Beneficiary shall be his Spouse unless the Participant
has designated a non-Spouse Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) with the written
consent of his Spouse given in the presence of a notary public on a form
provided by the Committee, or unless the terms of a qualified domestic relations
order require payment to a non-Spouse Beneficiary. A married Participant's
designation of a non-Spouse Beneficiary in accordance with the preceding
sentence shall remain valid until revoked by the Participant or until the
Participant marries a Spouse who has not consented to a designation in
accordance with the preceding sentence.

For the purposes of this Section, revocation of prior Beneficiary designations
will occur when a Participant (i) files a valid designation with the Committee;
or (ii) files a signed statement with the Committee evidencing his intent to
revoke any prior designations.

Board shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.

Break in Service shall occur if the Employee ceases to be employed by the
Employer and does not resume Employment for seven or more consecutive years.

Code shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. A reference to a
specific provision of the Code shall include such provision and any applicable
Treasury Regulation pertaining thereto.

Committee shall mean the Pension and Benefits Committee appointed by the Board

                  the computation period or period to which the award or

                  week (or 10 Hours of Service for each day) in which such
                  Employee would be credited with Hours of Service in hourly
                  pay. However, this method of computing Hours of Service may
                  not be used for any Employee whose Hours of Service is
                  required to be counted and recorded by any Federal law, such

                  or (ii) the date the Employee becomes a member of the class of
                  Eligible Employees.

         (d)      Acquisitions. See Section 3.04 below for special rules that
                  apply to new Employees following an acquisition.

3.02     Year of Eligibility Service.

         (a)      1,000 Hour Rule. A Year of Eligibility Service is determined
                  under the 1,000 Hours of Service method. Accordingly, an
                  Employee shall receive one Year of Eligibility Service upon
                  completing a twelve consecutive month period of Employment
                  during which the Employee earns at least 1,000 Hours of
                  Service. The initial twelve month period shall be the twelve
                  consecutive month period commencing on the Employee's date of
                  hire or rehire. If the Employee fails to complete 1,000 Hours
                  of Service during this 12 month period, the Employee shall
                  receive a Year of Eligibility Service upon completing at least
                  1,000 Hours of Service during a Plan Year (commencing with the
                  Plan Year during which the Employee's first anniversary of his
                  date of hire occurs).

         (b)      Break in Service. For purposes of determining whether an
                  Eligible Employee has satisfied the requirements of Section
                  3.01(b)(2), an Employee shall not receive credit for any Hours
                  of Service for purposes of Section 3.01(b)(2) during any
                  period of Employment which precedes a Break in Service if, at
                  the time of such Break in Service, the Employee had not
                  satisfied the requirements of Section 3.01(b)(2). This rule
                  shall also apply for purposes of determining eligibility under
                  Section 3.01(b)(1) if, at the time of such Break in Service,
                  the Employee had not satisfied the requirements of Section
                  3.01(b)(1).

         (c)      Authorized Absence. A period during which an Employee is on
                  Authorized Absence shall not count towards the Employee's
                  Break in Service if such Employee resumes Employment
                  immediately after the end of such Authorized Absence.

3.03     Participation and Rehire.

         (a)      Status as a Participant. A Participant's participation in the
                  Plan shall continue until the Participant's Termination Date.
                  On or after his Termination Date, the Employee shall be known
                  as a "Former Participant" and his benefits shall thereafter be
                  governed by the provisions of Article 8. The individual's
                  status as a Former Participant shall cease as of the date the
                  individual ceases to have any balance in his Account. If a
                  Participant ceases to be an Eligible Employee but does not
                  have a Termination Date, then such person shall continue to be
                  known as a "Participant," but shall not be eligible to make
                  Pre-Tax Contributions and shall not be eligible to receive
                  Employer Contributions.

         (b)      Rehire of Person who was a Participant in this Plan. An
                  Eligible Employee who was a Participant in this Plan at the
                  time of his Termination Date and who is subsequently rehired
                  by an Employer, shall be

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

                  eligible to immediately participate in the portion(s) of the
                  Plan for which the Participant was previously eligible
                  effective on the date of his rehire or, if later, on the date
                  he becomes an Eligible Employee.

3.04     Acquisitions.

         If a group of persons becomes employed by an Employer (or any of its
         subsidiaries or divisions) as a result of an acquisition of another
         employer, the Committee shall determine whether and to what extent
         employment with such prior employer shall be treated as Years of
         Eligibility Service, the applicable Entry Date (or special entry date)
         for such acquired employees, and any other terms and conditions which
         apply to eligibility to participate in this Plan. Such terms and
         conditions shall be set forth in Schedule A or Schedule B to this Plan
         by action of the Committee. Except to the extent required by law,
         employees of an acquired business which is not identified in Schedule A
         or Schedule B shall not receive credit under this Plan for their prior
         employment with the acquired business.

3.05     Not Contract for Employment.

         Participation in the Plan shall not give any Employee the right to be
         retained in the Employer's employ, nor shall any Employee, upon
         dismissal from or voluntary termination of his employment, have any
         right or interest in the Fund, except as herein provided.

                              PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS

4.01     Pre-Tax Contributions.

         Effective on the Participant's initial Entry Date, a Participant may
         elect to make Pre-Tax Contributions to the Plan. If a Participant fails
         to elect to make Pre-Tax Contributions at that time, a Participant may
         elect to make Pre-Tax Contributions to the Plan effective as of the
         first day of any subsequent month (except during periods of suspension
         see Section 4.03). A Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions to the Plan
         shall be made by means of payroll deduction. A Participant may
         contribute as a Pre-Tax Contribution any whole percentage from 1% to
         16% of his Compensation during any Plan Year, and effective January 1,
         2002, from 1% to 25% of his Compensation during any Plan Year.

4.02     Elections Regarding Pre-Tax Contributions.

         (a)      Procedure for Making Elections. Elections by a Participant to
                  make Pre-Tax Contributions to the Plan shall be made in
                  writing on a form prescribed by the Committee and by
                  designating on such form the percentage of Compensation that
                  will be contributed as a Pre-Tax Contribution during each pay
                  period. The election to make Pre-Tax Contributions shall be
                  effective no earlier than the first day of the Participant's
                  normal pay period beginning at least 30 days after the
                  Employer receives such election form (or such smaller number
                  of days as determined by the Committee on a nondiscriminatory
                  basis).

         (b)      Treatment as 401(k) Contributions. It is expressly intended
                  that, to the extent allowable by law, Pre-Tax Contributions
                  shall not be included in the gross income of the Participant
                  for income tax purposes and shall be deemed contributions
                  under a cash or deferred arrangement pursuant to Code
                  Section 401(k).

         (c)      Additional Limitations of Pre-Tax Contributions. Pre-Tax
                  Contributions shall be subject to the limitations described in
                  Section 12.02 (maximum dollar contribution limit), Section
                  12.03 (ADP non-discrimination test) and Article 14 (Code
                  Section 415 limit).

4.03     Change in Employee Contribution Percentage or Suspension of
         Contributions.

         (a)      Change of Contribution Percentage. A Participant may increase
                  or decrease the percentage of his Compensation contributed as
                  a Pre-Tax Contribution only on January 1, April 1, July 1, or
                  October 1 of each

                                      -16-

                  Plan Year (or the first pay period that begins on or after
                  such dates) by delivery of written notice to the Committee or
                  by other means as approved by the Committee. In order to be
                  effective, the Participant must notify the Committee at least
                  30 days prior to the date that the increase or decrease will
                  become effective (or such lesser number of days as permitted
                  by the Committee on a nondiscriminatory basis). This paragraph
                  (a) is effective January 1, 1999.

         (b)      Suspension of Contributions. A Participant may suspend his
                  Pre-Tax Contributions at any time by properly completing a
                  form prescribed by the Committee. The suspension of Pre-Tax
                  Contributions will be effective on the first day of the
                  Participant's normal payroll period that begins 30 days after
                  the Participant delivers the completed form to the Committee.
                  A Participant may resume making Pre-Tax Contributions on the
                  first day of any month which is at least six months after the
                  effective date of such suspension of contributions and only
                  after informing the Committee in writing at least 30 days
                  prior to the date on which the Pre-Tax Contributions are to
                  resume. The Committee, on a nondiscriminatory basis, may
                  prescribe a lesser number of days on which the suspension or
                  resumption of Pre-Tax Contributions is to be effective. A
                  Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions shall automatically be
                  suspended beginning on the first payroll period that commences
                  after the Participant is not in receipt of Compensation, the
                  Participant's layoff or the Participant's Authorized Absence
                  without pay.

         (c)      Other Rules.

                  (1)      See Section 9.03 for circumstances under which a
                           Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions could be
                           suspended for a period of at least 12 months (6
                           months after January 1, 2002) after such Participant
                           receives a hardship distribution.

                  (2)      In order to satisfy the provisions of Article 12 and
                           Article 14, the Committee may from time to time
                           either temporarily suspend the Pre-Tax Contributions
                           of Highly Compensated Employees or reduce the maximum
                           permissible Pre-Tax Contribution that may be made to
                           the Plan by Highly Compensated Employees.

                   (3)     Any reduction, increase, or suspension of Pre-Tax
                           Contributions described in this Article 4.03 shall be
                           made in such manner as the Committee may prescribe
                           from time to time consistent with the provisions of
                           this Article.

4.04     Deadline for Contributions and Allocation of Pre-Tax Contributions.

         Pre-Tax Contributions shall be deducted by the Employer from the
         Participant's Compensation and paid to the Trustee as promptly as
         possible, but no later than fifteen days after the end of the calendar
         month in which the Employer retains the Pre-Tax Contributions (or such
         longer period of time granted by the Department of Labor or other
         government entity, agency or by an employee of such governmental entity
         or agency).

4.05     Rollover Contribution.

         (a)      Without regard to any limitation on contributions set forth in
                  this Article, an Eligible Employee shall be permitted, if the
                  Committee consents (based on non-discriminatory criteria), to
                  transfer to the Trustee during any Plan Year additional
                  property acceptable to the Trustee, provided such property:

                  (1)      was received by the Eligible Employee from a
                           Qualified Plan maintained by a previous employer of
                           the Eligible Employee and qualifies as a rollover
                           contribution within the meaning of Code Section
                           402(a)(5) or

                  (2)      was received by the Eligible Employee from an
                           individual retirement account or individual
                           retirement annuity and qualifies as a rollover
                           contribution within the meaning of Code Section
                           408(d)(3)(A)(ii).

         (b)      Such property shall be held by the Trustee in the Employee's
                  Rollover Account. All such amounts so held shall at all times
                  be fully vested and nonforfeitable. Such amounts shall be
                  distributed to the Employee upon Termination Date in the
                  manner provided in Article 8.

         (c)      See Section 8.07 regarding the right of a Participant to
                  request a trustee to trustee transfer of the Participant's
                  Account in lieu of a distribution of such Account.

         (d)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Eligible Employee who
                  elects to make a Rollover Contribution to the Plan pursuant to
                  this Section 4.05 shall not be considered a Participant for
                  any other purpose under this Plan until such Eligible Employee
                  has satisfied the applicable eligibility requirements of
                  Section 3.01.

         (e)      This Section 4.05 is effective January 1, 1999.

5.01     Employer Matching Contribution.

         (a)      Eligibility to Receive Matching Contribution. For each payroll
                  period, the Employer shall contribute to the Employer Matching
                  Contribution Account of each Participant who made a Pre-Tax
                  Contribution during such payroll period. See Section
                  3.01(b)(2) and Section 5.05 for additional eligibility
                  requirements.

         (b)      Amount of Employer Matching Contribution. The Employer
                  Matching Contribution shall equal the lesser of 20% of the
                  Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions made during the calendar
                  month or 20% of the Participant's first 6% of Compensation for
                  such month (1.2% of Compensation).

         (c)      Qualifying Employer Securities. The Employer Matching
                  Contributions are intended to be comprised primarily of
                  Qualifying Employer Securities (i.e., Company Stock). It is
                  hereby expressly provided that the Plan may acquire and hold
                  Qualifying Employer Securities.

5.02     Qualified Nonelective Contributions.

         In the sole discretion of the Employer, an additional Employer
         Contribution may be made to the Plan which shall be known as a
         "Qualified Nonelective Contribution." Such contribution shall be made
         in order to satisfy the requirements of Article 12, and shall be
         allocated to the Qualified Nonelective Contribution Accounts of those
         Non-highly Compensated Employees selected by the Committee at the time
         such Qualified Nonelective Contribution is made, or as soon thereafter
         as possible. See Section 3.01(b)(2) and Section 5.05 for additional
         eligibility requirements.

5.03     Form and Timing of Contributions.

         (a)      Employer Contributions shall be made in cash or in Qualifying
                  Employer Securities. Employer Matching Contributions shall be
                  delivered to the Trustee as soon as administratively feasible
                  but no later than the date prescribed by the Code for filing
                  the Employer's federal income tax return, including authorized
                  extensions. Qualified Nonelective Contributions shall be
                  delivered to the Trustee on or before the last day of the
                  twelfth month following the close of the Plan Year to which
                  the contribution relates. This paragraph (a) is effective
                  January 1, 1999.

         (b)      Except as provided in this Section 5.03, all Employer
                  Contributions shall be irrevocable, shall never inure to the
                  benefit of any Employer, shall be held for the exclusive
                  purpose of providing benefits to Participants and their
                  Beneficiaries (and contingently for defraying reasonable
                  expenses of administering the Plan), and shall be held and
                  distributed by the Trustees only in accordance with this Plan.

         (c)      Upon an Employer's request and to the extent permitted by the
                  Code and other applicable laws and regulations thereunder, a
                  contribution which was made by a mistake in fact, or
                  conditioned upon the initial qualification of the Plan under
                  Code Section 401(a) or upon the deductibility of the
                  contribution under Section 404 of the Code, shall be returned
                  to the Employer within one year after the payment of the
                  contribution, the denial of the Plan's initial qualification,
                  or the disallowance of the deduction (to the extent
                  disallowed), whichever is applicable. All contributions to
                  this Plan are expressly conditioned on the deductibility of
                  such contributions under Code Section 404.

5.04     Forfeitures.

         Forfeitures shall first be applied to restore amounts previously
         forfeited pursuant to Section 7.05(c). Next, forfeitures shall be used
         to pay expenses of the Plan which may be paid by the Plan in accordance
         with the provisions of ERISA. Thereafter any remaining forfeitures
         shall be allocated on the last day of the Plan Year (unless the
         Committee directs an earlier allocation) equally on a per capita basis
         among the Employer Matching Contribution Accounts of all Participants
         who made an Elective Deferral during the Plan Year in which the
         forfeitures are allocated. See Section 7.05 to determine when a
         forfeiture of a Participant's Account occurs. See Section 3.01(b)(2)
         and Section 5.05 for additional eligibility requirements. This Section
         5.04 shall be effective January 1, 1999.

         3.01(b)(1) (eligibility to make Pre-Tax Contributions) but not Section
         3.01(b)(2) may make Pre-Tax Contributions (subject to the terms of the

         Contribution or allocation of forfeitures.

                            ACCOUNTS AND ALLOCATIONS

6.01     Participant Accounts.

         (a)      Individual Account Plan. This Plan is an "individual account
                  plan," as that term is used in ERISA. A separate Account shall
                  be maintained for each Participant, Former Participant or
                  Beneficiary, so long as he has an interest in the Trust Fund.

         (b)      Sub-Accounts. Each Account shall be divided (as appropriate)
                  into the following parts and sub-parts:

                  (1)      The Pre-Tax Contribution Account, which shall reflect
                           Pre-Tax Contributions contributed to this Plan and
                           any Adjustments thereto.

                  (2)      The Employer Matching Contribution Account, which
                           shall reflect Employer Matching Contributions
                           contributed to this Plan and any Adjustments thereto.

                  (3)      The Prior Employer Account, which shall reflect
                           assets transferred to this Plan directly from a
                           trustee of another Qualified Plan to the Trustee of
                           this Plan (and Adjustments thereto). The Prior
                           Employer Account shall be further divided into such
                           additional sub-portions as the Committee deems
                           necessary or appropriate to maintain, including
                           assets contributed to the Qualified Plan as pre-tax
                           contributions, after-tax contributions, employer
                           matching contributions, rollover contributions, etc.
                           To the extent deemed appropriate, portions or
                           sub-portions of this Account may be allocated to and
                           held in other Accounts. For example, pre-tax
                           contributions transferred to this Plan from another
                           Qualified Plan, may be allocated to and held as part
                           of the Pre-Tax Contribution Account.

                  (4)      The Rollover Account, which shall reflect the value
                           of all investments derived from the Participant's
                           Rollover Contributions under this Plan and any
                           Adjustments thereto.

                  (5)      The Qualified Nonelective Contribution Account, which
                           shall reflect Qualified Nonelective Contributions
                           contributed to this Plan and any Adjustments thereto.

                           In addition, the Committee may divide such
                           sub-accounts into such additional sub-portions as the
                           Committee deems to be necessary or advisable under
                           the circumstances or to establish other accounts or
                           sub-accounts as needed.

         (c)      Value of Account as of Valuation Date. As of each Valuation
                  Date, each Participant's Account shall equal:

                  (1)      his total Account as determined on the immediately
                           preceding Valuation Date, plus

                  (2)      his Pre-Tax Contributions added to his Account since
                           the immediately preceding Valuation Date, plus

                  (3)      his Employer Contributions added to his Account since
                           the immediately preceding Valuation Date, plus

                  (4)      his Rollover Contributions or amounts transferred to
                           this Plan from the trustee of another Qualified plan
                           and which were added to his Account since the
                           immediately preceding Valuation Date, minus

                  (5)      his Distributions, if any, since the immediately
                           preceding Valuation Date, plus or minus

                  (6)      his allocable share of Adjustments.

6.02     Allocation of Adjustments.

         The Adjustment for each Investment Fund shall be calculated as of each
         Valuation Date. The Adjustment for a given Investment Fund shall be
         allocated to each Account invested in such Investment Fund in the
         proportion that each such Account bears to the total of all such
         Accounts. Such Valuation shall occur prior to the allocation of
         Employer Contributions, Pre-Tax Contributions, Rollover Contributions
         and transfers to this Plan from the trustee of another Qualified plan
         but after taking into account all Distributions since the prior
         Valuation Date.

6.03     Allocation of Dividends.

         Any cash or stock dividend received on shares of Company Stock
         allocated to a Participant's Company Stock Fund shall be allocated to
         such Participant's Company Stock Fund.

                                      -23-

<PAGE>

6.04     Adjustment Attributable to Plan Loans.

         The Adjustment that is allocable to the Participant's directed
         investment of his loan shall be the interest payments made by the
         Participant with respect to such loan since the immediately preceding
         Valuation Date.

6.05     Plan Expenses.

         The Committee may direct that expenses attributable to general Plan
         administration be allocated among the Accounts of all Participants
         (other than the Company Stock Fund) in proportion to their Account
         balances.

6.06     Investment Funds and Elections.

         (a)      Election of Investment Funds. Each Participant shall direct,
                  following such procedures as may be specified by the
                  Committee, to have his Pre-Tax Contribution Account, Prior
                  Employer Contribution Account, Rollover Account and Qualified
                  Nonelective Contribution Account allocated or reallocated
                  among the Investment Funds.

         (b)      Initial Investment Direction. Effective January 1, 1999, a
                  Participant's initial investment election must allocate his
                  entire Account in 1% increments among the Investment Funds, as
                  of the date of the directive, and all subsequent contributions
                  to each sub-account for so long as the election remains in
                  effect. For a period of time prior to January 1, 1999,
                  allocations among the Investment Funds were made in 10%
                  increments. An Employee who fails to make a proper investment
                  election by the deadline established by the Committee for such
                  purpose, shall be deemed to have elected the "Default
                  Enrollment Election" which allocates 100% of his Account in
                  the Default Fund (i.e., the Fixed Income Fund or other
                  Investment Fund which, in the opinion of the Committee, best
                  preserves the principal amount of the Participant's Account).
                  Furthermore, effective January 1, 1999, the initial investment
                  of each newly eligible Participant's Account shall
                  automatically be made to the Default Fund until such
                  Participant directs the investment of his or her Account.

         (c)      Subsequent Elections. Investment elections will remain in
                  effect until changed by a new election. Effective January 1,
                  1999, new elections may be made in 1% increments by a
                  Participant once each calendar month (and effective April 1,
                  2001, changes may be made on a daily basis) and shall be
                  effective as of the date the investment directive is delivered
                  to the Committee (or its designee), pursuant to the rules and
                  regulations established by the Committee and which are applied
                  in a consistent and nondiscriminatory manner. For a period of
                  time prior to January 1, 1999, a Participant may make a new
                  election to modify his investment elections

                                      -24-

<PAGE>

                  in 10% increments once each calendar quarter. New elections
                  may change future allocations to the Participant's Account,
                  may reallocate between the Investment Funds any amounts
                  previously credited to the Participant's Account, or may leave
                  the allocation of such prior amounts unchanged.

         (d)      Investment Options. The Committee shall select such Investment
                  Funds as are deemed appropriate and shall notify affected
                  Participants of such Investment Funds. The Committee may
                  modify, eliminate or select new Investment Funds from time to
                  time and shall notify affected Participants of such changes
                  and solicit new investment elections, if appropriate.

         (e)      Company Stock Fund. A Participant's Employer Matching
                  Contribution Account shall consist primarily of Company Stock.
                  Company Stock shall be held in the Participant's Company Stock
                  Fund. Participants may not direct the investment of their
                  Company Stock Fund and may not direct the Trustee to transfer
                  other contributions (e.g., Pre-Tax Contributions, etc.) to the
                  Company Stock Fund.

6.07     Errors.

         Where an error or omission is discovered in any Participant's Account,
         the Committee shall make appropriate corrective adjustments as of the
         end of the Plan Year in which the error or omission is discovered. If
         it is not practical to correct the error retroactively, then the
         Committee shall take such action in its sole discretion as may be
         necessary to make such corrective adjustments, provided that any such
         actions shall treat similarly situated Participants alike and shall not
         discriminate in favor of Highly Compensated Employees.

                                     VESTING

7.01     Termination Date On or After Age 65.

         A Participant who has a Termination Date on or after attaining age 65
         shall be 100% vested in his Account. Such Account will be distributed
         on the date and in the form specified in Article 8.

7.02     Permanent Disability.

         A Participant who has a Termination Date on account of Permanent
         Disability shall become 100% vested in his Account as of the date of
         such Permanent Disability and shall be entitled to a Distribution of
         his Account on the date and in the form specified in Article 8.

7.03     Death.

         A Participant who has a Termination Date on account of death shall
         become 100% vested in his Account. The Participant's Beneficiary shall
         receive a Distribution of such Account on the date and in the form
         specified in Article 8.

7.04     Other Termination Date.

         (a)      In General. For any reason other than a Termination Date on or
                  after age 65, Permanent Disability or death, the Participant
                  shall be entitled to the vested portion of his Account, which
                  shall be distributed on the date and in the form specified in
                  Article 8.

         (b)      100% Vesting in Certain Sub-Accounts. A Participant shall
                  always be one hundred percent (100%) vested in his Pre-Tax
                  Contribution Account, Qualified Nonelective Contribution
                  Account, and Rollover Account.

         (c)      Three Year Vesting For Certain Sub-Accounts. Any Participant
                  who has three or more Years of Credited Service shall be 100%
                  vested in his Employer Matching Contribution Account. If a
                  Participant has less than three Years of Credited Service at
                  the time he has a Termination Date, the Participant shall
                  forfeit all amounts held in his Employer Matching Contribution
                  Account.

         (d)      Prior Employer Account. See Schedule C for the vesting
                  provisions applicable to a Participant's Prior Employer
                  Account.

                                      -26-

<PAGE>

         (e)      Forfeiture. That portion of the Participant's Account which is
                  not vested upon the Participant's Termination Date shall be
                  forfeited in accordance with Section 7.05.

7.05     Forfeitures.

         (a)      No Distribution of Account Prior to Break in Service. A
                  Participant who has a Termination Date but who does not
                  receive a Distribution of his vested Account prior to
                  incurring a Break in Service shall, upon incurring the Break
                  in Service, forfeit the non-vested portion of his Account. If
                  the terminated Participant resumes Employment with the
                  Employer prior to incurring a Break in Service, then the
                  Participant's entire Account, unreduced by any forfeiture,
                  shall become his beginning Account on the date he resumes
                  participation in the Plan.

         (b)      Distribution of Vested Account Prior to Break in Service. A
                  Participant who has a Termination Date and receives a
                  Distribution of his entire vested Account prior to incurring a
                  Break in Service, shall, upon such Distribution, forfeit the
                  non-vested portion of his Account. A Participant who is not
                  vested in his Account shall be deemed to have received a
                  Distribution of his entire vested account upon his Termination
                  Date and the Participant's non-vested Account shall be
                  immediately forfeited.

         (c)      Repayment of Account; Restoration of Non-Vested Account.
                  Except as provided below, a Participant who is re-hired by the
                  Employer shall have the right to repay to the Plan the portion
                  of the Participant's Account which was previously distributed
                  to him. In the event the Participant repays the entire
                  Distribution he received from the Plan, the Employer shall
                  restore the non-vested portion of the Participant's Account. A
                  Participant's Account shall first be restored, to the extent
                  possible, out of forfeitures under the Plan in the Plan Year
                  in which he was reemployed. To the extent such forfeitures are
                  insufficient to restore the Participant's Account, restoration
                  shall be made from Employer Contributions. A Participant who
                  was deemed to have received a Distribution of his vested
                  Account (see subsection (b) above) shall be deemed to have
                  repaid such vested Account if such Participant is rehired
                  before incurring a Break in Service.

         (d)      Restrictions of Repayment Account. Notwithstanding anything to
                  the contrary in this Plan, a Participant shall not have the
                  right to repay to the Plan the portion of his Account which
                  was previously distributed to him after any of the following
                  events: (i) the Participant incurs a Break in Service before
                  returning to Employment, (ii) the Participant fails to repay
                  the prior Distribution within five years after the Participant
                  is re-employed by the Employer, or (iii) the Participant
                  received a Distribution of his entire Account balance at the
                  time of such earlier Distribution.

                                  DISTRIBUTIONS

8.01     Commencement of Distribution.

         (a)      Termination of Employment. If a Participant has a Termination
                  Date other than on account of death, the Participant's Account
                  will commence to be distributed as soon as administratively
                  feasible following the Committee's receipt of the
                  Participant's written request for a Distribution, but in no
                  event later than 60 days following the end of the Plan Year in
                  which such Participant requests a Distribution of his Account.
                  Such request shall be made on a form provided by the
                  Committee. See Section 8.01(c) for circumstances where the
                  Participant's consent to a Distribution is not required. This
                  paragraph (a) is effective January 1, 1999.

         (b)      Death. If a Participant has a Termination Date on account of
                  death, the Participant's Account shall be distributed within
                  90 days after the Participant's death unless the particular
                  facts and circumstances require a longer waiting period.
                  However, if the Spouse is the Participant's Beneficiary, the
                  Spouse may delay the distribution of the Participant's Account
                  until the latest date possible under Section 8.05 (relating to
                  mandatory distributions upon attaining age 70-1/2).

         (c)      Consent of Participant. A Participant's consent to a
                  Distribution of his Account shall not be required in the
                  circumstances described below, and the Committee shall direct
                  the Trustee to distribute the Participant's Account as
                  provided below:

                  (1)      Account Less Than $5,000. If the Participant's vested
                           Account balance is less than or equal to $5,000 at
                           the time of the Distribution, such Account will be
                           distributed in a lump sum no later than 60 days after
                           the end of the Plan Year in which such Termination
                           Date occurred. This provision is effective January 1,
                           1998.

                  (2)      Age 70-1/2. If a distribution is required under
                           Section 8.05 (relating to mandatory distributions for
                           Participants age 70-1/2), the Participant's Account
                           will be distributed as provided in such Section.

                  (3)      Termination Date On or After Age 65. If a Participant
                           has incurred a Termination Date and is age 65 or
                           older, the Plan shall begin distribution of the
                           Participant's Account no later than 60 days

                                      -29-

<PAGE>

                           following the end of the Plan Year in which the
                           Participant attains age 65 or, if later, within 60
                           days following the end of the Plan Year in which the
                           Participant has a Termination Date.

         (d)      Hardship Withdrawals. Hardship withdrawals (see Article 9)
                  shall commence no later than ninety (90) days after such
                  request is approved by the Committee.

         (e)      Committee Direction to Trustee. The Committee shall issue
                  directions to the Trustee concerning the recipient and the
                  distribution date of benefits which are to be paid from the
                  Trust pursuant to the Plan.

         (f)      Committee Guidelines. The Committee may establish for
                  administrative purposes, uniform and nondiscriminatory
                  guidelines concerning the commencement of benefits.

8.02     Method of Distribution.

         (a)      Lump Sum Payment. Distribution of the Participant's Account
                  will be made in a lump sum cash amount. However, see Schedule
                  C for other optional distribution forms that may be applicable
                  to the Participant's Prior Employer Account.

         (b)      Form of Payment. Distributions shall be in cash. However, if
                  the value of the vested Qualifying Employer Securities that
                  are allocated to the Participant's Account equals or exceeds
                  $1,000, the Participant shall have the option of receiving
                  whole shares of such Qualifying Employer Securities in lieu of
                  cash. Fractional shares, if any, shall be paid in cash.
                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any in-service withdrawals
                  shall be paid in cash.

8.03     Payment to Minors and Incapacitated Persons.

         In the event that any amount is payable to a minor or to any person
         who, in the judgment of the Committee, is incapable of making proper
         disposition thereof, such payment shall be made for the benefit of such
         minor or such person in any of the following ways as the Committee, in
         its sole discretion, shall determine:

         (a)      By payment to the legal representative of such minor or such
                  person;

         (b)      By payment directly to such minor or such person;

         (c)      By payment in discharge of bills incurred by or for the
                  benefit of such minor or such person. The Trustee shall make
                  such payments as directed by the Committee without the
                  necessary intervention of any guardian or

                                      -30-

<PAGE>

                  like fiduciary, and without any obligation to require bond or
                  to see to the further application of such payment. Any payment
                  so made shall be in complete discharge of the Plan's
                  obligation to the Participant and his Beneficiaries.

8.04     Application for Benefits.

         The Committee may require a Participant or Beneficiary to complete and
         file with the Committee certain forms as a condition precedent to the
         payment of benefits. The Committee may rely upon all such information
         given to it, including the Participant's current mailing address. It is
         the responsibility of all persons interested in distributions from the
         Trust Fund to keep the Committee informed of their current mailing
         addresses.

8.05     Special Distribution Rules.

         (a)      To the extent that the distribution rules described in this
                  Section provide a limitation upon distribution rules stated
                  elsewhere in this Plan, the distribution rules stated in this
                  Section shall take precedence over such conflicting rules.
                  However, under no circumstances shall the rules stated in this
                  Section be deemed to provide distribution rights to
                  Participants or their Beneficiaries which are more expansive
                  or greater than the distribution rights stated elsewhere in
                  this Plan. For example, if the only distribution method
                  permitted under the Plan is a lump sum, then distributions
                  under this Section 8.05 may only be made in a lump sum. In
                  addition, if the Plan requires distributions to commence at
                  age 65 for Participants who have terminated Employment,
                  distributions must commence at age 65 and may not be delayed
                  to age 70-1/2.

         (b)      In no event may the distribution of a Participant's Account
                  commence later than April 1 following the calendar year in
                  which the Participant attains age 70-1/2. However, if a
                  Participant is not a 5% owner of an Employer (as defined in
                  Code Section 401(a)(9) and the Treasury Regulations
                  thereunder), such Participant's Retirement Income shall
                  commence no later than April 1 following the calendar year in
                  which he terminates his Employment. (The applicable
                  commencement date described above, is referred to as the
                  "required beginning date")." Notwithstanding the preceding
                  distribution requirements, a distribution on behalf of any
                  Participant may be made in accordance with a benefit payment
                  election executed before January 1, 1984 in a manner that
                  satisfies the requirements of the transitional rule of Section
                  242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of
                  1982.

         (c)      The entire account balance of each Participant shall be
                  distributed, beginning not later than the required beginning
                  date, in a single lump sum.

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

                  The initial distribution shall be based on the Participant's
                  account balance as of the December 31 preceding the required
                  beginning date. During the calendar year which begins after
                  the required beginning date (and in each calendar year
                  thereafter), the Participant's entire account balance shall be
                  distributed in a single lump sum based on the value of such
                  account balance as of the first day of such calendar year.

         (d)      If a Participant dies before distribution of the Participant's
                  Account has begun in accordance with paragraph (c) above, the
                  Participant's entire vested Account must be distributed in a
                  lump sum within 90 days of the Participant's death unless the
                  Participant's Account is payable to or for the benefit of his
                  Spouse. If the Beneficiary is the Participant's Spouse, the
                  Spouse may delay a lump sum distribution of the Participant's
                  Account until the date on which the Participant would have
                  attained age 70-1/2.

         (e)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, distributions
                  under the Plan will comply with Treasury Regulations issued
                  under Code Section 401(a)(9) and any other provisions
                  reflecting Code Section 401(a)(9) as prescribed by the
                  Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.

8.06     Distributions Pursuant to Qualified Domestic Relations Orders.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, a "qualified
         domestic relations order", as defined in Code Section 414(p), may
         provide that any amount to be distributed to an alternate payee may be
         distributed immediately even though the Participant is not yet entitled
         to a distribution under the Plan. The intent of this Section is to
         provide for the distribution of benefits to an alternate payee as
         permitted by Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)-13(g)(3).

8.07     Direct Rollovers.

         (a)      In General. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the
                  contrary that would otherwise limit a Distributee's election
                  under this Section, a Distributee may elect, at the time and
                  in the manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to have
                  any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly
                  to an eligible retirement plan specified by the Distributee in
                  a direct rollover.

          (b)     Definitions.

                  Eligible Rollover Distribution. An Eligible Rollover
                  Distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the
                  balance to the credit of the Distributee, except that an
                  Eligible Rollover Distribution does not include (i) any
                  distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
                  periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for
                  the life (or life

                                      -32-

<PAGE>

                  expectancy) of the Distributee or the joint lives (or joint
                  life expectancies) of the Distributee and the Distributee's
                  designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years
                  or more; (ii) any distribution to the extent such distribution
                  is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; (iii) the
                  portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross
                  income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
                  unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities);
                  and (iv) effective as of January 1, 2000, hardship withdrawals
                  as defined in Code Section 401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV) which are
                  attributable to the Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions.

                  Eligible Retirement Plan. An Eligible Retirement Plan is an
                  individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of
                  the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in
                  Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in
                  Section 403(a) of the Code, or a qualified trust described in
                  Section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the Distributee's
                  Eligible Rollover Distribution. However, in the case of an
                  Eligible Rollover Distribution to the surviving spouse, an
                  Eligible Retirement Plan is an individual retirement account
                  or individual retirement annuity.

                  Distributee. A Distributee includes an Employee or former
                  Employee. In addition, the Employee's or former Employee's
                  surviving spouse and the Employee's or former Employee's
                  spouse or former spouse who is an alternate payee under a
                  qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section
                  414(p) of the Code, are Distributees with regard to the
                  interest of the spouse or former spouse.

                  Direct Rollover. A Direct Rollover is a payment by the Plan to
                  the Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee.

         (c)      Waiver of 30-day Notice. If a distribution is one to which
                  Sections 401(a)(11) and 417 of the Internal Revenue Code do
                  not apply, such distribution may commence less than 30 days
                  after the notice required under section 1.411(a)-11(c) of the
                  Income Tax Regulations is given, provided that:

                  (1)      the Plan Administrator clearly informs the
                           Participant that the Participant has a right to a
                           period of at least 30 days after receiving the notice
                           to consider the decision of whether or not to elect a
                           distribution (and, if applicable, a particular
                           distribution option), and

                  (2)      the Participant, after receiving the notice,
                           affirmatively elects a distribution.

8.08     Participant Withdrawals After Age 59-1/2.

         At any time after a Participant attains age 59-1/2, the Participant may
         elect to withdraw a part or all of his vested Account (including any
         earnings thereon). In no event shall a Participant be permitted to
         repay the amount of his or her in-service withdrawal. If the
         Participant withdraws only a portion of his vested Account, the
         Committee shall determine (in a nondiscriminatory manner) the source of
         the Accounts and Investment Funds from which the withdrawal shall be
         made.

                           HARDSHIP WITHDRAWALS; LOANS

9.01     Hardship Withdrawal of Account.

         (a)      In General. Any Participant may request the Committee to
                  distribute to him part or all of his vested Account (other
                  than amounts held in the Participant's Qualified Nonelective
                  Contribution Account, amounts used as collateral for a
                  Participant loan and certain earnings on the Participant's
                  Account as provided below). The Committee shall determine (in
                  a nondiscriminatory manner) the source of the Accounts (other
                  than the Accounts and amounts identified above) and Investment
                  Funds from which the withdrawal shall be made.

         (b)      No Distribution of Earnings. Income or gain that is allocated
                  to the Participant's Pre-Tax Contribution Account may not be
                  distributed in a hardship withdrawal.

9.02     Definition of Hardship.

         Hardship shall mean an immediate and heavy financial need experienced
         by reason of:

         (a)      Expenses of any accident to or sickness of such Participant,
                  his Spouse or his dependents or expenses necessary to provide
                  medical care for such Participant, his Spouse or his
                  dependents;

         (b)      Purchase of a primary residence for such Participant;

         (c)      Payment of tuition and related educational fees for the next
                  twelve months of post-secondary education for the Participant,
                  his Spouse, children or dependents;

         (d)      The need to prevent the eviction of the Participant from his
                  principal residence or foreclosure on the Participant's
                  principal residence; or

         (e)      Other financial hardships as permitted by Treasury Regulations
                  or other regulatory or judicial authority and approved by the
                  Committee.

9.03     Maximum Hardship Distribution.

         A hardship distribution cannot exceed the amount required to meet the
         immediate financial need created by the hardship (after taking into
         account applicable

                                      -35-

<PAGE>

         federal, state, or local income taxes and penalties) and not reasonably
         available from other resources of the Participant. In order to ensure
         compliance with this requirement, the Committee may require the
         Participant to satisfy any or all of the provisions described below in
         (a), (b), or (c) below as a condition precedent to the Participant
         receiving a hardship distribution:

         (a)      No Other Sources Available. Certification by the Participant
                  on a form provided by the Committee for such purpose that the
                  financial need cannot be relieved (1) through reimbursement or
                  payment by insurance; (2) by reasonable liquidation of the
                  Participant's assets; (3) by ceasing Pre-Tax Contributions
                  under the Plan; (4) by other in-service distributions
                  (including loans) under the Plan and under any other plan
                  maintained by the Employer; or (5) by borrowing from
                  commercial lenders on reasonable commercial terms.

         (b)      Receipt of all Distributions Available; Suspension of Future
                  Contributions. Receipt by the Participant of all distributions
                  that he is eligible to receive (including loans) under this
                  Plan and under any other plan maintained by the Employer.

                  In addition, the Participant must agree to the following
                  limitations and restrictions:

                  (1)      The Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions shall
                           automatically be suspended beginning on the first
                           payroll period that commences after such Participant
                           requests and receives a hardship distribution. Such
                           Participant may resume making Pre-Tax Contributions
                           only on the first day of a calendar month which is at
                           least 12 months after the effective date of such
                           suspension and only after informing the Committee in
                           writing at least 30 days (or such lesser time as
                           specified by the Committee) prior to the date on
                           which the Pre-Tax Contributions are to resume.
                           Hardship distributions made on or after January 1,
                           2002 shall result in a 6 month suspension rather than
                           a 12 month suspension.

                  (2)      The maximum Pre-Tax Contribution the Participant may
                           make for the calendar year following his hardship
                           distribution shall be reduced by the amount of
                           Pre-Tax Contributions made by the Participant during
                           the calendar year in which he received his hardship
                           distribution. This subparagraph (2) shall not be
                           effective on or after January 1, 2002.

                  (3)      The Participant shall be prohibited under a legally
                           enforceable agreement from making an employee
                           contribution to any other plan maintained by the
                           Employer for at least 12 months after the receipt

                           of the hardship distribution. For this purpose, the
                           phrase "any other plan" includes all qualified and
                           nonqualified plans of deferred compensation, stock
                           option plans and stock purchase plans. It does not
                           include a health or welfare plan including one that
                           is part of a section 125 cafeteria plan. Effective
                           for hardship distributions made on or after January
                           1, 2002, the 12 month restriction described above
                           shall become a 6 month restriction.

9.04     Procedure to Request Hardship.

         The request to receive a hardship distribution shall be made on such
         forms and following such procedures as the Committee may prescribe from
         time to time. Under no circumstances shall the Committee permit a
         Participant to repay to the Plan the amount of any withdrawal by a
         Participant under this Section.

9.05     Authority to Establish Loan Program.

         The Committee is authorized and directed to administer the loan
         program.

9.06     Eligibility for Loans.

         Loans shall be available to all Participants on a reasonably equivalent
         basis. For the purposes of receiving a loan, the term "Participant"
         shall include any Former Participant who is a "party in interest" as
         defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA.

9.07     Loan Amount.

         (a)      Minimum Loan. No loan of less than $1,000 will be made.

         (b)      Maximum Loan. A loan to any Participant (determined
                  immediately after the origination of the loan) shall not
                  exceed the lesser of:

                  (1)      Fifty percent (50%) of the Participant's vested
                           balance in his Account as of the Valuation Date with
                           respect to which the loan is processed; or

                  (2)      $50,000, reduced by the excess (if any) of (A) the
                           highest outstanding balance of loans from the Plan
                           during the one-year period ending on the day before
                           the date on which such loan was made, over (B) the
                           outstanding loan balance of loans from the Plan on
                           the date on which the loan was made.

9.08     Maximum Number of Loans.

         No more than one loan may be made outstanding to any Participant at any
         time.

                                      -37-

9.09     Assignment of Account.

         Each loan shall be supported by the Participant's promissory note for
         the amount of the loan, including interest, payable to the order of the
         Trustee. In addition, each loan shall be supported by an assignment of
         the Participant's right, title and interest in and to his Account equal
         to the amount of the loan and shall be supported by any other
         reasonable security required by the Trustee.

9.10     Interest.

         Interest shall be charged on any such loan at a rate established from
         time to time by the Trustee provided such rate is equivalent to a rate
         that would be charged by a commercial lender for a similar loan.

9.11     Term of Loan.

         The maximum repayment term of any loan is five years unless the loan is
         used to acquire any dwelling unit which within a reasonable time after
         the loan is made is to be used as the principal residence of the
         Participant. The maximum repayment term for a loan used to acquire a
         dwelling unit shall be a reasonable time, as determined by the
         Committee, that may exceed five years but shall not exceed fifteen
         years. Except for Former Participants described in Section 9.06, the
         term of the loan may not extend beyond the Participant's Termination
         Date. The Committee may, in its discretion, establish a shorter
         repayment term than the maximum repayment term otherwise permitted
         under the Plan.

9.12     Level Amortization.

         Each loan shall provide for level amortization with payments to be made
         at such regular intervals as the Committee determines in its
         discretion, but not less frequently than once every three months over
         the term of the loan. Loans to Participants in active Employment shall
         be repaid through payroll deductions and the Participant shall be
         required to authorize such payroll deduction as a condition to
         receiving the loan.

9.13     Directed Investment.

         A Participant who requests a loan shall be deemed to have directed the
         Committee to invest assets held in his Account by the amount of the
         loan, and until such loan is repaid, such loan shall be considered a
         directed investment of the Participant's Account hereunder. The Plan
         monies which are used to fund the Participant loan shall be withdrawn
         from the Participant's Account in the following order (and principal
         and interest loan repayments shall be added back to such Accounts in
         the same order):

                                      -38-

<PAGE>

         (a)      the Pre-Tax Contribution Account;

         (b)      the Rollover Account;

         (c)      the Qualified Nonelective Contribution Account; and

         (d)      the Prior Employer Account.

         Within each such Account the monies which are used to fund the
         Participant loan shall be withdrawn on a pro rata basis according to
         the value of the Investment Funds in which such Account was invested.
         Principal and interest payments on the loan will be allocated to the
         Participant's Investment Funds according to the Participant's
         investment election at the time of the payment. Prior to January 1,
         1999, loans could also be made from a Participant's Employer Matching
         Contribution Account. If a loan was made out of the Participant's
         Employer Matching Contribution Account, repayment of principal and
         interest attributable to such Account shall be allocated to the
         Participant's Company Stock Fund.

         This Section 9.13 shall be effective January 1, 1999.

9.14     Other Requirements.

         (a)      All loans issued to a married Participant pursuant to this
                  Plan on or after January 1, 1999 shall require the consent of
                  the Participant's Spouse. Such consent shall authorize the
                  Committee to default the loan and, when a distributable event
                  has occurred, foreclose on the loan pursuant to the loan
                  documents and loan guidelines without additional notice to or
                  consent by the Participant or the Participant's Spouse. Such
                  consent by the Spouse married to the Participant at the time
                  the loan is processed shall also apply to any future Spouse of
                  the Participant. Additionally, no current or future spousal
                  consent is required if the Participant was not married at the
                  time the loan was processed. Effective ninety (90) days after
                  the effective date described in Section XIII of Schedule C,
                  spousal consent will no longer be required to obtain a loan
                  from the Plan.

         (b)      The Committee may establish such additional guidelines and
                  rules as it deems necessary. Such guidelines and rules are
                  hereby incorporated by reference in the Plan. The Committee
                  may amend or modify the loan application, loan guidelines and
                  loan rules as it deems necessary to carry out the provisions
                  of this Article Nine (including retroactive amendments).

         (c)      This Section 9.14 is effective January 1, 1999.

9.15     Distribution of Loan.

                                      -39-

<PAGE>

         Loan proceeds will be distributed as soon as practicable after the loan
         is approved and after the Participant completes all documentation
         necessary to make such loan.

9.16     Suspension of Loan Repayments During Military Service

         Loan repayments will be suspended under this Plan as permitted under
         Code Section 414(u)(4) (e.g., suspension of loan repayments during a
         Participant's periods of military service as defined in Code Section
         414(u)).

10.01    Named Fiduciaries.

         The following parties are named as Fiduciaries of the Plan and shall

         expressly allocated to them in the Plan and in the Trust Agreement and
         shall have no other powers and duties in respect of the Plan; provided,
         however, that if a power or responsibility is not expressly allocated
         to a specific named fiduciary, the power or responsibility shall be
         that of the Company. No Fiduciary shall have any liability for, or
         responsibility to inquire into, the acts and omissions of any other
         Fiduciary in the exercise of powers or the discharge of
         responsibilities assigned to such other Fiduciary under this Plan or
         the Trust Agreement.

                  have the following powers and duties with respect to the Plan:

                  (1)      to appoint and remove the members of the Committee as

                  granted to the Committee).

         (c)      The Board shall have no other responsibilities with respect to
                  the Plan.

10.03    Trustee.

         The Trustee shall exercise all of the powers and duties assigned to the
         Trustee as set forth in the Trust Agreement. The Trustee shall have no
         other responsibilities with respect to the Plan.

10.04    Committee.

         (a)      A Committee of one or more individuals shall be appointed by
                  and serve at the pleasure of the Board or its Compensation and
                  Stock Option Committee to administer the Plan. Any
                  Participant, officer, or director of the Employer shall be
                  eligible to be appointed a member of the Committee and all
                  members shall serve as such without compensation. Upon
                  termination of his employment with the Employer, or upon
                  ceasing to be an officer or director, if not an employee, he
                  shall cease to be a member of the Committee. The Board or its
                  Compensation and Stock Option Committee shall have the right
                  to remove any member of the Committee at any time, with or
                  without cause. A member may resign at any time by written
                  notice to the Committee and the Board or its Compensation and
                  Stock Option Committee. If a vacancy in the Committee should
                  occur, a successor shall be appointed by the Board or its
                  Compensation and Stock Option Committee. The Committee shall
                  by written notice keep the Trustee notified of current
                  membership of the Committee, its officers and agents. The
                  Committee shall furnish the Trustee a certified signature card
                  for each member of the Committee and for all purposes
                  hereunder the Trustee shall be conclusively entitled to rely
                  upon such certified signatures.

         (b)      The Board or its Compensation and Stock Option Committee shall
                  appoint a Chairman and a Secretary from among the members of
                  the Committee. All resolutions, determinations and other
                  actions shall be by a majority vote of all members of the
                  Committee. The Committee may appoint such agents, who need not
                  be members of the Committee, as it deems necessary for the
                  effective performance of its duties, and may delegate to such
                  agents such powers and duties, whether ministerial or
                  discretionary, as the Committee deems expedient or
                  appropriate. The compensation of such agents shall be fixed by
                  the Committee; provided, however, that in no event shall
                  compensation be paid if such payment violates the provisions
                  of Section 408 of the Act and is not exempted from such
                  prohibitions by Section 408 of the Act.

         (c)      The Committee shall have complete control of the
                  administration of the Plan with all powers necessary to enable
                  it to properly carry out the provisions of the Plan. In
                  addition to all implied powers and responsibilities necessary
                  to carry out the objectives of the Plan and to

                  (11)     to adopt procedures for providing adequate notice in

                           for benefits under the Plan is denied, which notice
                           shall set forth the specific reasons for such denial
                           (written in a manner calculated to be understood by
                           the Participant or Beneficiary); and to provide a
                           procedure for affording a reasonable opportunity to
                           any Participant or Beneficiary whose claim for
                           benefits has been denied, a full and fair review by
                           the Committee of the decision denying the claim.

         (d)      To enable the Committee to perform its functions, the Employer
                  shall supply full and timely information of all matters
                  relating to the compensation and length of service of all
                  Participants, their retirement, death or other cause of
                  termination of employment, and such other pertinent facts as
                  the Committee may require. The Committee shall advise the
                  Trustee of such facts and issue to the Trustee such
                  instructions as may be required by the Trustee in the
                  administration of the Plan. The Committee and the Employer
                  shall be entitled to rely upon all certificates and reports
                  made by a Certified Public Accountant selected or approved by
                  the Employer. The Committee, the Employer and its officers and
                  the Trustee, shall be fully protected in respect of any action
                  suffered by them in good faith in reliance upon the advice or
                  opinion of any accountant or attorney, and all action so taken
                  or suffered shall be conclusive upon each of them and upon all
                  other persons interested in the Plan.

10.05    Standard of Fiduciary Duty.

         Any Fiduciary, or any person designated by a Fiduciary to carry out
         fiduciary responsibilities with respect to the Plan, shall discharge
         his duties solely in the interests of the Participants and
         Beneficiaries for the exclusive purpose of providing them with benefits
         and defraying the reasonable expenses of administering the Plan. Any
         Fiduciary shall discharge his duties with the care, skill, prudence and
         diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man
         acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matter would use in
         the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.
         Any Fiduciary shall discharge his duties in accordance with the
         documents and instruments governing the Plan insofar as such documents
         and instruments are consistent with the provisions of the Act.
         Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, no Fiduciary shall be
         authorized to engage in any transaction which is prohibited by Sections
         408 and 2003(a) of the Act or Section 4975 of the Code in the
         performance of its duties hereunder.

10.06    Claims Procedure.

                                      -44-

<PAGE>

         Any Participant, Former Participant, Beneficiary, or Spouse or
         authorized representative thereof (hereinafter referred to as
         "Claimant"), may file a claim for benefits under the Plan by submitting
         to the Committee a written statement describing the nature of the claim
         and requesting a determination of its validity under the terms of the
         Plan. Effective January 1, 2002, all applications for benefits must be
         submitted within the "applicable limitations period." The "applicable
         limitations period" shall be two years, beginning on (i) the date on
         which the payment was made, or (ii) for all other claims, the date on
         which the action complained or grieved of occurred. Within sixty (60)
         days after the date such claim is received by the Committee, it shall
         issue a ruling with respect to the claim.

         If special circumstances require an extension of time for processing,
         the Committee shall send the Claimant written notice of the extension
         prior to the termination of the 60-day period. In no case, however,
         shall the extension of time delay the Committee's decision on such
         appeal request beyond one hundred twenty (120) days following receipt
         of the actual request.

         If the claim is wholly or partially denied, written notice shall be
         furnished to the Claimant, which notice shall set forth in a manner
         calculated to be understood by the Claimant:

         (a)      The specific reason or reasons for denial;

         (b)      Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the
                  denial is based;

         (c)      A description of any additional material or information
                  necessary for the Claimant to perfect the claim and an
                  explanation of why such material or information is necessary;
                  and

         (d)      An explanation of the claims review procedures.

         Any Claimant whose claim for benefits has been denied, may appeal such
         denial by resubmitting to the Committee a written statement requesting
         a further review of the decision within sixty (60) days of the date the
         Claimant receives notice of such denial. Such statement shall set forth
         the reasons supporting the claim, the reasons such claim should not
         have been denied, and any other issues or comments which the Claimant
         deems appropriate with respect to the claim.

         If the Claimant shall request in writing, the Committee shall make
         copies of the Plan documents pertinent to his claim available for
         examination of the Claimant.

                                      -45-

<PAGE>

         Within sixty (60) days after the request for further review is
         received, the Committee shall review its determination of benefits and
         the reasons therefor and notify the Claimant in writing of its final
         decision.

         If special circumstances require an extension of time for processing,
         the Committee shall send the Claimant written notice of the extension
         prior to the termination of the 60-day period. In no case, however,
         shall the extension of time delay the Committee's decision on such
         appeal request beyond one hundred twenty (120) days following receipt
         of the actual request.

         Such written notice shall include specific reasons for the decision,
         written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant, with
         specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the
         decision is based. The decision of the Committee on any claim for
         benefits shall be final and conclusive upon all persons, and a
         Participant, or his Beneficiary or legal representative, shall not be
         permitted to bring suit at law or equity on an application without
         first exhausting the remedies available hereunder.

         Effective January 1, 2002, no action at law or in equity to recover
         under this Plan shall be commenced later than one year from the date of
         the decision on review (or if no decision is furnished within 120 days
         of receipt of the request for review, one year after the 120th day
         after receipt of the request for review).

10.07    Indemnification of Committee.

         To the extent permitted under the Act, the Plan shall indemnify the
         Board, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and the Committee
         against any cost or liability which they may incur in the course of
         administering the Plan and executing the duties assigned pursuant to
         the Plan. The Employer shall indemnify the Committee, the Compensation
         and Stock Option Committee and the members of the Board against any
         personal liability or cost not provided for in the preceding sentence
         which they may incur as a result of any act or omission in relation to
         the Plan or its Participants. The Employer may purchase fiduciary
         liability insurance to insure its obligation under this Section.

                            AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

11.01    Right to Amend.

         The Company intends for the Plan to be permanent so long as the
         corporation exists; however, (through action of the Board, Compensation
         and Stock Option Committee, or the Committee) it reserves the right to
         modify, alter, or amend this Plan or the Trust Agreement, from time to
         time, to any extent that it may deem advisable, including, but not
         limited to any amendment deemed necessary to ensure the continued
         qualification of the Plan under Sections 40l(a) and 401(k) of the Code
         or to ensure compliance with the Act; provided, however, that the
         Board, Compensation and Stock Option Committee, or the Committee shall
         not have the authority to amend this Plan in any manner which will:

         (a)      Permit any part of the Fund (other than such part as is
                  required to pay taxes and administrative expenses) to be used
                  for or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive
                  benefit of the Participants or their Beneficiaries;

         (b)      Cause or permit any portion of the funds to revert to or
                  become the property of the Employer;

         (c)      Change the duties, liabilities, or responsibilities of the
                  Trustee without its prior written consent.

         See Section 16.11 regarding the power of an Affiliated Sponsor to amend
         or terminate the Plan.

11.02    Termination or Discontinuance of Contributions.

         The Company (through action of the Board or Compensation and Stock
         Option Committee) shall have the right at any time to terminate this
         Plan (hereinafter referred to as "Plan Termination"). Upon Plan
         Termination, the Committee shall direct the Trustee with reference to
         the disposition of the Fund, after payment of any expenses properly
         chargeable against the Fund. The Trustee shall distribute all amounts
         held in Trust to the Participants and others entitled to Distributions
         in proportion to the Accounts of such Participants and other
         Distributees as of the date of such Termination. In the event that this
         Plan is partially terminated, then the provisions of this Section 11.02
         shall apply, but solely with respect to the Employees affected by the
         partial termination. The termination of sponsorship of the Plan by any
         Affiliated Sponsor shall not affect the sponsorship of the Plan by the
         Company or any other Affiliated Sponsor.

11.03    IRS Approval of Termination.

         Notwithstanding Section 11.02, the Trustee shall not be required to
         make any Distribution from this Plan in the event of complete or
         partial termination until the authorized officials of the Internal
         Revenue Service shall have determined that there will be no liability
         against the Trustee by reason of such Distribution.

                          SPECIAL DISCRIMINATION RULES

12.01    Definitions.

         Actual Contribution Percentage or ACP shall mean the ratio (expressed
         as a percentage) of (i) the sum of the Employer Matching Contributions
         on behalf of the Participant for the Plan Year and, to the extent
         permitted in Treasury Regulations and elected by the Employer, the
         Participant's Qualified Elective Deferrals and Qualified Nonelective
         Contributions to (ii) the Participant's Compensation for the Plan Year.
         The Employer, on an annual basis, may elect to include or not to
         include Qualified Elective Deferrals and Qualified Nonelective
         Contributions in computing the ACP for a Plan Year. An Employer may
         elect on an annual basis to count a Participant's Employer Matching
         Contribution toward satisfying the required minimum contribution under
         Section 15.03 (minimum contribution for Non-Key Employees in a
         top-heavy plan) in lieu of including such contributions in the ACP. If
         a Participant (as defined below) does not receive an allocation of
         Employer Contributions for a Plan Year, such Participant's ACP for the
         Plan Year shall be zero.

         Actual Deferral Percentage or ADP shall mean the ratio (expressed as a
         percentage) of (i) the sum of Pre-Tax Contributions on behalf of a
         Participant for the Plan Year (excluding any Excess Deferrals by a
         Non-highly Compensated Employee) and, to the extent permitted in
         Treasury Regulations and elected by the Employer, the Participant's
         Qualified Nonelective Contributions to (ii) the Participant's
         Compensation for the Plan Year. The Employer, on an annual basis, may
         elect to include or not to include Qualified Nonelective Contributions
         in computing the ADP for a Plan Year. In the case of a Participant (as
         defined below) who does not make a Pre-Tax Contribution for a Plan Year
         and is not allocated a Qualified Nonelective Contribution for such Plan
         Year, such Participant's ADP for the Plan Year shall be zero.

         Average Actual Contribution Percentage shall mean the average
         (expressed as a percentage) of the Actual Contribution Percentages of
         the Participants in a group. The percentage shall be rounded to the
         nearest one-hundredth of one percent (four decimal places).

         Average Actual Deferral Percentage shall mean the average (expressed as
         a percentage) of the Actual Deferral Percentages of the Participants in
         a group. The percentage shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth
         of one percent (four decimal places).

         Combined ADP and ACP Test shall have the meaning as defined in Section
         12.09.

         Compensation for purposes of this Article 12 shall be that definition
         selected by the Committee that satisfies the requirements of Code
         Sections 414(s) and 401(a)(17). Such definition may change from year to
         year but must apply uniformly among all Eligible Employees being tested
         under the Plan for a given Plan Year and among all Employees being
         tested under any other plan that is aggregated with this Plan during
         the Plan Year. If the Committee fails to select a definition of
         Compensation for purposes of this Article 12, Compensation (for
         purposes of Article 12) shall have the same meaning as defined in
         Article 2.

         Employer Matching Contributions. For purposes of this Article 12, an
         Employer Matching Contribution for a particular Plan Year includes only
         those contributions that are (i) allocated to the Participant's Account
         under the Plan as of any date within such Plan Year, (ii) contributed
         to the Trust no later than the end of the 12-month period following the
         close of such Plan Year, and (iii) made on account of such
         Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions for the Plan Year.

         Excess Deferrals shall have that meaning as defined in Section 12.02.

         Excess ACP Contributions shall have that meaning as defined in Section
         12.08.

         Excess ADP Deferrals shall have that meaning as defined in Section
         12.05.

         Highly Compensated Employee. See Article 13.

         Maximum Combined Percentage shall have the meaning as defined in
         Section 12.09(c).

         Non-highly Compensated Employee. See Article 13.

         Participant. For purposes of computing the Average Actual Contribution
         Percentage and related provisions of this Article 12, a Participant
         shall mean any Eligible Employee who (i) is eligible to receive an
         allocation of an Employer Matching Contribution, even if no Employer
         Matching Contribution is allocated due to the Eligible Employee's
         failure to make a required Pre-Tax Contribution or (ii) is unable to
         receive an Employer Matching Contribution because his or her
         Compensation is less than a stated amount. For purposes of computing
         the Average Actual Deferral Percentage and related provisions of this
         Article 12, a Participant shall mean any Eligible Employee who (i) is
         eligible to make a Pre-Tax Contribution, including an Eligible Employee
         whose right to make Pre-Tax Contributions has been suspended because of
         an election not to participate or a hardship distribution and (ii) is
         unable to make a Pre-Tax Contribution because his Compensation is less
         than a stated amount.

                                      -50-

         Pre-Tax Contributions. For purposes of this Article 12, a Pre-Tax
         Contribution is taken into account only if the contribution (i) is
         allocated to the Participant's Account under the terms of the Plan as
         of any date within the Plan Year, and (ii) relates to Compensation that
         would have been received by the Participant during the Plan Year or
         within 2-1/2 months after the Plan Year but for the deferral election.
         A Pre-Tax Contribution is considered to be allocated as of a date
         within a Plan Year only if the allocation is not contingent on
         participation in the Plan or performance of service after the Plan Year
         to which the Pre-Tax Contribution relates.

         Qualified Elective Deferral shall mean Pre-Tax Contributions designated
         by the Committee as Qualified Elective Deferrals in order to meet the
         ACP testing requirements of Section 12.06. In addition, the following
         requirements must be satisfied:

         (a)      The aggregate of all Pre-Tax Contributions for the Plan Year
                  (including the Qualified Elective Deferrals) must satisfy the
                  ADP testing requirements set forth in Section 12.03(a).

         (b)      The aggregate of all Pre-Tax Contributions for the Plan Year
                  (excluding the Qualified Elective Deferrals) must satisfy the
                  ADP testing requirements set forth in Section 12.03(a).

         (c)      Qualified Elective Deferrals must satisfy all other provisions
                  of this Plan applicable to Pre-Tax Contributions and shall
                  remain part of the Participant's Pre-Tax Contribution Account.

         (d)      Except as provided by this definition, Qualified Elective
                  Deferrals shall be excluded in determining whether any other
                  contribution or benefit satisfies the nondiscrimination
                  requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(4) and 401(k)(3).

         Qualified Nonelective Contribution shall mean an Employer contribution
         designated by the Committee as a Qualified Nonelective Contribution in
         order to meet the ADP testing requirements of Section 12.03 or the ACP
         testing requirements of Section 12.06. In addition, the following
         requirements must be satisfied:

         (a)      The Qualified Nonelective Contribution, whether or not used to
                  satisfy the requirements of Sections 12.03 or 12.06, must meet
                  the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(4).

         (b)      Qualified Nonelective Contributions which are taken into
                  account in order to meet the requirements of Section 12.03 or
                  12.06 (as applicable) shall

                                      -51-

<PAGE>

                  not be counted in determining whether the testing requirements
                  of any of such other Sections are met.

         (c)      The Qualified Nonelective Contributions shall be subject to
                  all provisions of this Plan applicable to Pre-Tax
                  Contributions (except that Qualified Nonelective Contributions
                  cannot be distributed in a hardship distribution).

         (d)      Except as provided in this paragraph, the Qualified
                  Nonelective Contributions shall be excluded in determining
                  whether any other contribution or benefit satisfies the
                  nondiscrimination requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(4) and
                  401(k)(3).

12.02    Limit on Pre-Tax Contributions.

         (a)      Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the
                  contrary, the aggregate of a Participant's Pre-Tax
                  Contributions during a calendar year may not exceed $10,500,
                  which will increase to $11,000 in 2002 (or such greater amount
                  as established by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to
                  Code Section 402(g)(5)). Any Pre-Tax Contributions in excess
                  of the foregoing limit ("Excess Deferral"), plus any income
                  and minus any loss allocable thereto, may be distributed to
                  the applicable Participant no later than April 15 following
                  the calendar year in which the Pre-Tax Contributions were
                  made.

         (b)      Any Participant who has an Excess Deferral during a calendar
                  year may receive a distribution of the Excess Deferral during
                  such calendar year plus any income or minus any loss allocable
                  thereto, provided (1) the Participant requests (or is deemed
                  to request) the distribution of the Excess Deferral, (2) the
                  distribution occurs after the date the Excess Deferral arose,
                  and (3) the Committee designates the distribution as a
                  distribution of an Excess Deferral.

         (c)      If a Participant makes a Pre-Tax Contribution under this Plan
                  and in the same calendar year makes a contribution to a
                  Code Section 401(k) plan containing a cash or deferred
                  arrangement (other than this Plan), a Code Section 408(k) plan
                  (simplified employee pension plan) or a Code Section 403(b)
                  plan (tax sheltered annuity) and, after the return of any
                  Excess Deferral pursuant to Section 12.02(a) and (b) the
                  aggregate of all such Pre-Tax Contributions and contributions
                  exceed the limitations contained in Code Section 402(g), then
                  such Participant may request that the Committee return all or
                  a portion of the Participant's Pre-Tax Contributions for the
                  calendar year plus any income and minus any loss allocable
                  thereto. The amount by which such Pre-Tax Contributions and
                  contributions exceed the Code Section 402(g) limitations will
                  also be known as an Excess Deferral.

         (d)      Any request for a return of Excess Deferrals arising out of
                  contributions to a plan described in Section 12.02(c) above
                  which is maintained by an entity other than the Employer must:

                  (1)      be made in writing;

                  (2)      be submitted to the Committee not later than the
                           March 1 following the Plan Year in which the Excess
                           Deferral arose;

                  (3)      specify the amount of the Excess Deferral; and,

                  (4)      contain a statement that if the Excess Deferral is
                           not distributed, it will, when added to amounts
                           deferred under other plans or arrangements described
                           in Sections 401(k), 408(k), or 403(b) of the Code,
                           exceed the limit imposed on the Participant by
                           Section 402(g) of the Code for the year in which the
                           Excess Deferral occurred.

                  In the event an Excess Deferral arises out of contributions to
                  a plan (including this Plan) described in Section 12.02(c)
                  above which is maintained by the Employer, the Participant
                  making the Excess Deferral shall be deemed to have requested a
                  return of the Excess Deferral.

         (e)      Pre-Tax Contributions may only be returned to the extent
                  necessary to eliminate a Participant's Excess Deferral. Excess
                  Deferrals shall be treated as Annual Additions under the Plan.
                  In no event shall the returned Excess Deferrals for a
                  particular calendar year exceed the Participant's aggregate
                  Pre-Tax Contributions for such calendar year.

         (f)      The income or loss allocable to a Pre-Tax Contribution that is
                  returned to a Participant pursuant to Section 12.02(a) or (c)
                  shall be determined by multiplying the income or loss
                  allocable to the Participant's Account for the calendar year
                  in which the Excess Deferral arose by a fraction. The
                  numerator of the fraction is the Excess Deferral. The
                  denominator of the fraction is the value of the Participant's
                  Account balance on the last day of the calendar year in which
                  the Excess Deferral arose reduced by any income allocated to
                  the Participant's Account for such calendar year and increased
                  by any loss allocated to the Participant's Account for such
                  calendar year.

         (g)      The income or loss allocable to an Excess Deferral that is
                  returned to a Participant pursuant to Section 12.02(b) shall
                  be determined using any reasonable method adopted by the Plan
                  to measure income earned or loss incurred during the Plan Year
                  or any other method authorized by the Internal Revenue Service
                  to compute the income earned or loss incurred for the period
                  commencing on January 1 of the calendar year in which the Pre-

<PAGE>

                  Tax Contribution was made and ending on the date the Excess
                  Deferral was distributed.

         (h)      Any Employer Matching Contribution allocable to an Excess
                  Deferral that is returned to a Participant pursuant to this
                  Section 12.02 shall be forfeited notwithstanding the
                  provisions of Article 7 (vesting). For this purpose, however,
                  the Pre-Tax Contributions that are returned to the Participant
                  as an Excess Deferral shall be deemed to be first those
                  Pre-Tax Contributions for which no Employer Matching
                  Contribution was made and second those Pre-Tax Contributions
                  for which an Employer Matching Contribution was made.
                  Accordingly, if the Pre-Tax Contributions that are returned to
                  the Participant as Excess Deferrals were not matched, no
                  Employer Matching Contribution will be forfeited.

12.03    Average Actual Deferral Percentage.

         (a)      The Average Actual Deferral Percentage for Highly Compensated
                  Employees for each Plan Year and the Average Actual Deferral
                  Percentage for Non-highly Compensated Employees for the same
                  Plan Year must satisfy one of the following tests:

                  (1)      The Average Actual Deferral Percentage for
                           Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for
                           the Plan Year shall not exceed the Average Actual
                           Deferral Percentage for Participants who are
                           Non-highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year
                           multiplied by 1.25; or

                  (2)      The excess of the Average Actual Deferral Percentage
                           for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees
                           for the Plan Year over the Average Actual Deferral
                           Percentage for Participants who are Non-highly
                           Compensated Employees for the Plan Year is not more
                           than two percentage points, and the Average Actual
                           Deferral Percentage for Participants who are Highly
                           Compensated Employees is not more than the Average
                           Actual Deferral Percentage for Participants who are
                           Non-highly Compensated Employees multiplied by two.

         (b)      The permitted disparity between the Average Actual Deferral
                  Percentage for Highly Compensated Employees and the Average
                  Actual Deferral Percentage for Non-Highly Compensated
                  Employees may be further reduced as required by Section 12.09.

         (c)      If at the end of the Plan Year, the Plan does not comply with
                  the provisions of Section 12.03(a), the Employer may do any or
                  all of the

<PAGE>

                  following, except as otherwise provided in the Code or
                  Treasury Regulations:

                  (1)      Distribute Pre-Tax Contributions to certain Highly
                           Compensated Employees as provided in Section 12.05;
                           or

                  (2)      Make a Qualified Nonelective Contribution on behalf
                           of any or all of the Non-highly Compensated Employees
                           and aggregate such contributions with the Non-highly
                           Compensated Employees' Pre-Tax Contributions
                           Deferrals as provided in Section 12.01 (definition of
                           ADP).

         (d)      In computing the Average Actual Deferral Percentage, the
                  Employer may exclude Non-highly Compensated Employees who
                  prior to the last day of the Plan Year have not yet attained
                  age 21 or have not yet completed a Year of Eligibility Service
                  (see Section 3.02) if the Employer satisfies a special
                  coverage rule described below. The special coverage rule
                  requires the Plan to satisfy the minimum coverage rules of
                  Code Section 410(b)(4)(B) with respect to all Employees who
                  are permitted to participate in the Plan but have not yet
                  attained age 21 or have not yet completed a Year of
                  Eligibility Service. This paragraph (d) shall be effective
                  January 1, 1999.

12.04    Special Rules For Determining Average Actual Deferral Percentage.

         (a)      The Actual Deferral Percentage for any Highly Compensated
                  Employee for the Plan Year who is eligible to have Pre-Tax
                  Contributions allocated to his Account under two or more
                  arrangements described in Section 401(k) of the Code that are
                  maintained by an Employer or its Affiliates shall be
                  determined as if such Pre-Tax Contributions were made under a
                  single arrangement.

         (b)      If two or more plans maintained by the Employer or its
                  Affiliates are treated as one plan for purposes of the
                  nondiscrimination requirements of Code Section 401(a)(4) or
                  the coverage requirements of Code Section 410(b) (other than
                  for purposes of the average benefits test), all Pre-Tax
                  Contributions that are made pursuant to those plans shall be
                  treated as having been made pursuant to one plan.

         (c)      The determination and treatment of the Pre-Tax Contributions
                  and Actual Deferral Percentage of any Participant shall be in
                  accordance with such other requirements as may be prescribed
                  from time to time in Treasury Regulations.

12.05    Distribution of Excess ADP Deferrals.

         (a)      Pre-Tax Contributions exceeding the limitations of Section
                  12.03(a) ("Excess ADP Deferrals") and any income or loss
                  allocable to such Excess ADP Deferral may be designated by the
                  Committee as Excess ADP Deferrals and may be distributed to
                  Highly Compensated Employees whose Accounts were credited with
                  the largest dollar amount of Pre-Tax Contributions. In
                  determining the amount of Excess ADP Deferrals for each Highly
                  Compensated Employee, the Committee shall reduce the ADP for
                  each Highly Compensated Employee as follows:

                  (1)      The amount of Salary Deferrals made by the Highly
                           Compensated Employee(s) with the highest dollar
                           amount of Salary Deferrals will be reduced until
                           equal to the second highest amount of Salary
                           Deferrals under the Plan; then

                  (2)      The amount of Salary Deferrals made by the two (or
                           more) Highly Compensated Employees with the highest
                           dollar amount of Salary Deferrals under the Plan will
                           be reduced until equal to the third highest dollar
                           amount of Salary Deferrals under the Plan; then

                  (3)      The steps described in (1) and (2) shall be repeated
                           with respect to the third and successive highest
                           Salary Deferrals under the Plan until the Plan has
                           distributed all Excess ADP Deferrals.

         (b)      To the extent administratively possible, the Committee shall
                  distribute all Excess ADP Deferrals and any income or loss
                  allocable thereto prior to 2-1/2 months following the end of
                  the Plan Year in which the Excess ADP Deferrals arose. In any
                  event, however, the Excess ADP Deferrals and any income or
                  loss allocable thereto shall be distributed prior to the end
                  of the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the Excess
                  ADP Deferrals arose. Excess ADP Deferrals shall be treated as
                  Annual Additions under the Plan.

         (c)      The income or loss allocable to Excess ADP Deferrals shall be
                  determined by multiplying the income or loss allocable to the
                  Participant's Account for the Plan Year in which the Excess
                  ADP Deferrals arose by a fraction. The numerator of the
                  fraction is the Excess ADP Deferral. The denominator of the
                  fraction is the value of the Participant's Account balance on
                  the last day of the Plan Year in which the Excess ADP
                  Deferrals arose reduced by any income allocated to the
                  Participant's Account for such Plan Year and increased by any
                  loss allocated to the Participant's Account for the Plan Year.

         (d)      If an Excess Deferral has been distributed to the Participant
                  pursuant to Section 12.02(a) or (b) for any taxable year of a
                  Participant, then any Excess ADP Deferral allocable to such
                  Participant for the same Plan Year in which such taxable year
                  ends shall be reduced by the amount of such Excess Deferral.

         (e)      Distribution of Excess ADP Deferrals to Participants described
                  in Section 12.04(c) shall be made in accordance with the
                  provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(k)-1(f)(5)(ii)
                  or any successor Treasury Regulation thereto.

         (f)      Any Employer Matching Contribution allocable to an Excess ADP
                  Deferral that is returned to the Participant pursuant to this
                  Section 12.05 shall be forfeited notwithstanding the
                  provisions of Article 7 (vesting). For this purpose, however,
                  the Pre-Tax Contributions that are returned to the Participant
                  shall be deemed to be first those Pre-Tax Contributions for
                  which no Employer Matching Contribution was made and second
                  those Pre-Tax Contributions for which an Employer Matching
                  Contribution was made. Accordingly, unmatched Pre-Tax
                  Contributions shall be returned as an Excess ADP Deferral
                  before matched Pre-Tax Contributions.

12.06    Average Actual Contribution Percentage.

         (a)      The Average Actual Contribution Percentage for Highly
                  Compensated Employees for each Plan Year and the Average
                  Actual Contribution Percentage for Non-highly Compensated
                  Employees for the same Plan Year must satisfy one of the
                  following tests:

                  (1)      The Average Actual Contribution Percentage for
                           Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for
                           the Plan Year shall not exceed the Average Actual
                           Contribution Percentage for Participants who are
                           Non-highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year
                           multiplied by 1.25; or

                  (2)      The excess of the Average Actual Contribution
                           Percentage for Participants who are Highly
                           Compensated Employees for the Plan Year over the
                           Average Actual Contribution Percentage for
                           Participants who are Non-highly Compensated Employees
                           for the Plan Year is not more than two percentage
                           points, and the Average Actual Contribution
                           Percentage for Participants who are Highly
                           Compensated Employees is not more than the Average
                           Actual Contribution Percentage for Participants who
                           are Non-highly Compensated Employees multiplied by
                           two.

         (b)      If at the end of the Plan Year, the Plan does not comply with
                  the provisions of Section 12.06(a), the Employer may do any or
                  all of the following in order to comply with such provision as
                  applicable (except as otherwise provided in the Code or in
                  Treasury Regulations):

                  (1)      Aggregate Qualified Elective Deferrals with the
                           Employer Matching Contributions of Non-highly
                           Compensated Employees as provided in Section 12.01
                           (definition of ACP).

                  (2)      Distribute Employer Matching Contributions to certain
                           Highly Compensated Employees as provided in Section
                           12.08.

                  (3)      Make a Qualified Nonelective Contribution on behalf
                           of any or all of the Non-highly Compensated Employees
                           and aggregate such contributions with the Non-highly
                           Compensated Employees' Employer Matching
                           Contributions as provided in Section 12.01
                           (definition of ACP).

         (c)      In computing the Average Actual Contribution Percentage, the
                  Employer may exclude Non-highly Compensated Employees who
                  prior to the last day of the Plan Year have not yet attained
                  age 21 if the Employer satisfies a special coverage rule
                  described below. The special coverage rule requires the Plan
                  to satisfy the minimum coverage rules of Code Section
                  410(b)(4)(B) with respect to all Employees who are permitted
                  to participate in the Plan but have not yet attained age 21.
                  This paragraph (d) shall be effective January 1, 1999.

12.07    Special Rules For Determining Average Actual Contribution Percentages.

         (a)      The Actual Contribution Percentage for any Highly Compensated
                  Employee for the Plan Year who is eligible to have Employer
                  Matching Contributions allocated to his Account under two or
                  more arrangements described in Sections 401(a) or 401(m) of
                  the Code that are maintained by an Employer or its Affiliates
                  shall be determined as if such contributions were made under a
                  single arrangement.

         (b)      If two or more plans maintained by the Employer or its
                  Affiliates are treated as one plan for purposes of the
                  nondiscrimination requirements of Code Section 401(a)(4) or
                  the coverage requirements of Code Section 410(b) (other than
                  for purposes of the average benefits test), all Employer
                  Matching Contributions that are made pursuant to those plans
                  shall be treated as having been made pursuant to one plan.

                                      -58-

<PAGE>

         (c)      The determination and treatment of the Actual Contribution
                  Percentage of any Participant shall satisfy such other
                  requirements as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the
                  Treasury.

12.08    Distribution of Employer Matching Contributions.

         (a)      Employer Matching Contributions exceeding the limitations of
                  Section 12.06(a) ("Excess ACP Contributions") and any income
                  or loss allocable to such Excess ACP Contribution may be
                  designated by the Committee as Excess ACP Contributions and
                  may be distributed in the Plan Year following the Plan Year in
                  which the Excess ACP Contributions arose to those Highly
                  Compensated Employees whose Accounts were credited with Excess
                  ACP Contributions in the preceding Plan Year. The amount of
                  Excess ACP Contributions to be distributed to a Highly
                  Compensated Employee shall be determined using the procedure
                  described in Section 12.05(a).

         (b)      To the extent administratively possible, the Committee shall
                  distribute all Excess ACP Contributions and any income or loss
                  allocable thereto prior to 2-1/2 months following the end of
                  the Plan Year in which the Excess ACP Contributions arose. In
                  any event, however, the Excess ACP Contributions and any
                  income or loss allocable thereto shall be distributed prior to
                  the end of the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the
                  Excess ACP Contributions arose.

         (c)      The income or loss allocable to Excess ACP Contributions shall
                  be determined by multiplying the income or loss allocable to
                  the Participant's Account for the Plan Year in which the
                  Excess ACP Contribution arose by a fraction. The numerator of
                  the fraction is the Excess ACP Contributions. The denominator
                  of the fraction is the value of the Participant's Account on
                  the last day of the Plan Year reduced by any income allocated
                  to the Participant's Account by such Plan Year and increased
                  by any loss allocated to the Participant's Account for the
                  Plan Year.

         (d)      Amounts distributed to Highly Compensated Employees under this
                  Section 12.08 shall be treated as Annual Additions with
                  respect to the Employee who received such amount.

         (e)      Distribution of Excess ACP Contributions to Participants
                  described in Section 12.08(c) shall be made in accordance with
                  the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section
                  1.401(m)-1(e)(2)(iii) or any successor Treasury Regulations
                  thereto.

12.09    Combined ACP and ADP Test.

                                      -59-

<PAGE>

         For Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2002, the following
         provisions regarding the Combined ACP and ADP Test apply. Theses
         provisions no longer apply effective January 1, 2002.

         (a)      The Plan must satisfy the Combined ACP and ADP Test described
                  in this Section 12.09 only if (1) the Average Actual Deferral
                  Percentage of the Highly Compensated Employees exceeds 125% of
                  the Average Actual Deferral Percentage of the Non-highly
                  Compensated Employees and (2) the Average Actual Contribution
                  Percentage of the Highly Compensated Employees exceeds 125% of
                  the Average Actual Contribution Percentage of the Non-highly
                  Compensated Employees.

         (b)      The Combined ACP and ADP Test is satisfied if the sum of the
                  Highly Compensated Employees' Average Actual Deferral
                  Percentage and Average Actual Contribution Percentage is equal
                  to or less than the Maximum Combined Percentage defined in
                  paragraph (c) below.

         (c)      The Maximum Combined Percentage shall be determined by
                  adjusting the Non-highly Compensated Employees' Average Actual
                  Deferral Percentage and Average Actual Contribution Percentage
                  in the following manner:

                  (1)      The greater of the two percentages shall be
                           multiplied by 1.25; and

                  (2)      The lesser of the two percentages shall be increased
                           by two percentage points; however, in no event shall
                           such adjusted percentage exceed twice the original
                           percentage.

                  The sum of (1) and (2) shall be the Maximum Combined
                  Percentage.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Maximum Combined Percentage
                  shall be determined in the following manner if such
                  calculation results in a higher Maximum Combined Percentage
                  than the formula specified above:

                  (1)      The lesser of the Average Actual Deferral Percentage
                           and Average Actual Contribution Percentage of the
                           Non-Highly Compensated Employees shall be multiplied
                           by 1.25; and

                  (2)      The greater of such two percentages shall be
                           increased by two percentage points; however, in no
                           event shall such percentage exceed twice the original
                           percentage.

         (d)      In the event the Plan does not satisfy the Combined ADP and
                  ACP Test, the Highly Compensated Employees' Average Actual
                  Contribution Percentage shall be decreased by either
                  distributing Employer Matching Contributions to certain Highly
                  Compensated Employees by using the

                                      -60-

<PAGE>

                  procedures described in Section 12.08 or by making a Qualified
                  Nonelective Contribution as provided in Section 12.06(b)(3)
                  until the sum of such percentage and the Highly Compensated
                  Employees' Average Actual Deferral Percentage equals the
                  Maximum Combined Percentage.

         (e)      If Employer Matching Contributions are distributed to certain
                  Highly Compensated Employees in order to satisfy the Combined
                  ADP and ACP Test, income or loss allocable to such Employer
                  Matching Contributions shall also be distributed.

         (f)      To the extent administratively possible, the Committee shall
                  distribute the Employer Matching Contributions (if applicable)
                  and allocable income or loss prior to 2-1/2 months following
                  the end of the Plan Year for which the Combined ADP and ACP
                  Test is computed. In any event, however, such Employer
                  Matching Contributions (if applicable) and allocable income or
                  loss shall be distributed by the end of the Plan Year
                  following the Plan Year for which the Combined ADP and ACP
                  Test is computed. Employer Matching Contributions that are
                  distributed pursuant to this Section 12.09 shall be treated as
                  Annual Additions under the Plan.

         (g)      The income or loss allocable to returned Employer Matching
                  Contributions shall be determined using the same procedures as
                  Section 12.05(c).

12.10    Order of Applying Certain Sections of Article.

         In applying the provisions of this Article 12, the determination and
         distribution of Excess Deferrals shall be made first, the determination
         and elimination of Excess ACP Deferrals shall be made second, the
         determination and elimination of Excess ADP Contributions shall be made
         third and finally, to the extent applicable, the determination and any
         necessary adjustment related to the Combined ADP and ACP Test shall be
         made.

                          HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES

13.01    In General.

         For the purposes of this Plan, the term "Highly Compensated Employee"
         is any active Employee described in Section 13.02 below and any Former
         Employee described in Section 13.03 below. Various definitions used in
         this Section are contained in Section 13.04. A Non-highly Compensated
         Employee is an Employee who is not a Highly Compensated Employee.

13.02    Highly Compensated Employee.

         (a)      Look-Back Year. An Employee is a Highly Compensated Employee
                  if during a Look Back Year the Employee:

                  (1)      is a 5 Percent Owner; or

                  (2)      receives Compensation in excess of $85,000.

                  The dollar amount described above shall be increased annually
                  as provided in Code Section 414(q)(1).

         (b)      Current Year. An Employee is a Highly Compensated Employee if
                  during a Current Year the Employee is a 5 Percent Owner.

         (c)      This Section 13.02 shall be effective January 1, 1997.

13.03    Former Highly Compensated Employee.

         A Former Employee is a Highly Compensated Employee if (applying the
         rules of Section 13.02(a) or (b)) the Former Employee was a Highly
         Compensated Employee during a Separation Year or during any Current
         Year ending on or after the Former Employee's 55th birthday.

13.04    Definitions.

         The following special definitions shall apply to this Article 13:

         Compensation for purposes of this Article 13 shall mean any definition
         of Compensation that satisfies the requirements of Code Section 414(q).
         If no such definition is elected by the Committee, Compensation shall
         mean the gross annual earnings reported on the Participant's IRS Form
         W-2 (box 1 or its comparable

                                      -62-

<PAGE>

         location as provided on Form W-2 in future years) as required by Code
         Sections 6041(d) and 6051(a)(3). In addition, Compensation shall
         include compensation which is not includible in the Participant's IRS
         Form W-2 (Box 1) by reason of Code Section 402(a)(8) (employee Salary
         Deferrals under a Code Section 401(k) plan) or Code Section 125 (salary
         deferrals under a cafeteria plan). Compensation shall not include
         amounts paid or reimbursed by the Employer for moving expenses if, at
         the time of the payment of such moving expenses, it is reasonable to
         believe that the moving expenses will be deductible by the Participant
         under Code Section 217. Compensation shall be determined by ignoring
         any income exclusions under Code Section 3401(a) based on the nature or
         location of employment. In no event shall more than $170,000 (as
         adjusted annually pursuant to Code Section 401(a)(17)) in Compensation
         be taken into account for any Employee. Compensation shall also include
         salary deferrals for qualified transportation fringe benefits under
         Code Section 132(f).

         Current Year shall mean the current Plan Year.

         Employer for purposes of this Article 13 shall mean the Employer and
         its Affiliates.

         5 Percent Owner shall mean any Employee who owns or is deemed to own
         (within the meaning of Code Section 318), more than five percent of the
         value of the outstanding stock of the Employer or stock possessing more
         than five percent of the total combined voting power of the Employer.

         Former Employee shall mean an Employee (i) who has incurred a Severance
         from Service Date or (ii) who remains employed by the Employer but who
         has not performed services for the Employer during the Current Year
         (e.g., an Employee on Authorized Absence).

         Look Back Year shall mean the Plan Year preceding the Current Year, or
         if the Employer elects (and such election is available to the
         Employer), the calendar year ending with or within the Current Year.

         Separation Year shall mean any of the following years:

         (1)      An Employee who incurs a Termination Date shall have a
                  Separation Year in the Current Year in which such Termination
                  Date occurs;

         (2)      An Employee who remains employed by the Employer but who
                  temporarily ceases to perform services for the Employer (e.g.,
                  an Employee on an Authorized Absence) shall have a Separation
                  Year in the calendar year in which he last performs services
                  for the Employer;

                                      -63-

<PAGE>

         (3)      An Employee who remains employed by the Employer but whose
                  Compensation for a calendar year is less than 50% of the
                  Employee's average annual Compensation for the immediately
                  preceding three calendar years (or the Employee's total years
                  of employment, if less) shall have a Separation Year in such
                  calendar year. However, such Separation Year shall be ignored
                  if the Employee remains employed by the Employer and the
                  Employee's Compensation returns to a level comparable to the
                  Employee's Compensation immediately prior to such Separation
                  Year.

13.05    Other Methods Permissible.

         To the extent permitted by the Code, judicial decisions, Treasury
         Regulations and IRS pronouncements, the Committee may (without further
         amendment to this Plan) take such other steps and actions or adopt such
         other methods or procedures (in addition to those methods and
         procedures described in this Article 13) to determine and identify
         Highly Compensated Employees (including adopting alternative
         definitions of Compensation which satisfy Code Section 414(q)(7) and
         are uniformly applied).

                                MAXIMUM BENEFITS

14.01    General Rule.

         (a)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, for any Plan
                  Year, the Annual Additions to a Participant's Account, when
                  combined with the Annual Additions to the Participant's
                  Account under all other Qualified individual account plans
                  maintained by the Employer or its Affiliates shall not exceed
                  the lesser of (i) $35,000 or (ii) twenty-five percent (25%) of
                  the Participant's Compensation for such Plan Year (the
                  "maximum permissible amount").

         (b)      The Employer hereby elects that the limitation year
                  ("Limitation Year") for purposes of Code Section 415 shall be
                  the Plan Year.

         (c)      For purposes of determining the limit on Annual Additions
                  under paragraph (a) of this Section, the dollar limit
                  described therein, to wit, $35,000, shall be increased for
                  each Plan Year to the extent permitted by law.

         (d)      If the amount to be allocated to a Participant's Account
                  exceeds the maximum permissible amount (and for this purpose
                  Employer Contributions shall be deemed to be allocated after
                  Pre-Tax Contributions), the excess will be disposed of as
                  follows. First, if the Participant's Annual Additions exceed
                  the maximum permissible amount as a result of (i) a reasonable
                  error in estimating the Participant's Compensation, (ii) a
                  reasonable error in estimating the amount of Pre-Tax
                  Contributions that the Participant could make under Code
                  Section 415 or (iii) other facts and circumstances that the
                  Internal Revenue Service finds justifiable, the Committee may
                  direct the Trustee to return to the Participant his Pre-Tax
                  Contributions for such Plan Year to the extent necessary to
                  reduce the excess amount. Such returned Pre-Tax Contributions
                  shall be ignored in performing the discrimination tests of
                  Article 12. Second, any excess Annual Additions still
                  remaining after the return of Pre-Tax Contributions shall be
                  reallocated as determined by the Committee among the
                  Participants whose accounts have not exceeded the limit in the
                  same proportion that the Compensation of each such Participant
                  bears to the Compensation of all such Participants. If such
                  reallocation would result in an addition to another
                  Participant's Account which exceeds the permitted limit, that
                  excess shall likewise be reallocated among the Participants
                  whose Accounts do not exceed the limit. However, if the
                  allocation or reallocation of the excess amounts pursuant

                                      -65-

<PAGE>

                  to these provisions causes the limitations of Section 415 of
                  the Code to be exceeded with respect to each Participant for
                  the Limitation Year, then any such excess shall be held
                  unallocated in an account (the "415 Suspense Account"). If the
                  415 Suspense Account is in existence at any time during a
                  Limitation Year, other than the Limitation Year described in
                  the preceding sentence, all amounts in the 415 Suspense
                  Account shall be allocated and reallocated to Participants'
                  Accounts (subject to the limitations of Code Section 415)
                  before any Contributions which would constitute Annual
                  Additions may be made to the Plan for that Limitation Year.

         (e)      If the Participant is covered under another qualified defined
                  contribution plan maintained by an Employer during any
                  Limitation Year, the Annual Additions which may be credited to
                  a Participant's account under this Plan for any such
                  Limitation Year shall not exceed the maximum permissible
                  amount reduced by the Annual Additions credited to a
                  Participant's account under all such plans for the same
                  Limitation Year. If a Participant's Annual Additions under
                  this Plan and such other plans would result in an excess
                  amount for a Limitation Year, the excess amount will be deemed
                  to consist of the Annual Additions last allocated (and for
                  this purpose, Employer Contributions shall be deemed to be
                  allocated after Pre-Tax Contributions). If an excess amount is
                  allocated to a Participant on an allocation date of this Plan
                  which coincides with an allocation date of another plan, the
                  excess amount attributed to this Plan will be the product of

                  (1)      the total excess amount as of such date, times

                  (2)      the ratio of (A) the Annual Additions allocated to
                           the Participant for the Limitation Year as of such
                           date under this Plan to (B) the total Annual
                           Additions allocated to the Participant for the
                           Limitation Year as of such date under this and all
                           the other qualified defined contribution plans
                           maintained by the Employer.

         Any excess amount attributed to this Plan will be disposed in the
         manner described in this Section 14.01 above.

14.02    Combined Plan Limitation Repealed.

         Effective January 1, 2000, the combined plan test of Code Section 415
         is repealed and no longer applicable.

14.03    Definitions. For the purposes of this Article 14, the following
         definitions shall apply:

                                      -66-

<PAGE>

         (a)      "Annual Addition" shall mean the sum of:

                  (1)      Employee Contributions;

                  (2)      Employer Contributions;

                  (3)      Forfeitures; and

                  (4)      Amounts described in Code Sections 415(l)(1) and
                           419A(d)(2).

         Annual Additions shall not include any amounts credited to the
         Participant's Account resulting from Rollover Contributions.

         (b)      "Affiliates" shall have that meaning contained in Article 2
                  except that for purposes of determining who is an Affiliate
                  the phrase "more than 50 percent" shall be substituted for the
                  phrase "at least 80 percent" each place it appears in Code
                  Section 1563(a)(1).

         (c)      "Compensation" shall have the same meaning as defined in
                  Section 13.04 (thereby including Pre-Tax Contributions under
                  this Plan and salary deferrals under a Code Section 125
                  Cafeteria Plan and a Code Section 132(f) qualified
                  transportation fringe benefit plan in the definition of
                  Compensation).

                                 TOP HEAVY RULES

15.01    General.

         The provisions of this Article of the Plan shall become effective in
         any Plan Year in which the Plan is determined to be Top Heavy and shall
         supersede any conflicting provision of this Plan.

15.02    Definitions.

         (a)      Top Heavy. The Plan shall be Top Heavy for the Plan Year if,
                  as of the Valuation Date which coincides with or immediately
                  precedes the Determination Date, the value of the Participant
                  Accounts of Key Employees exceeds 60% of the value of all
                  Participant Accounts. If the Employer maintains more than one
                  plan, all plans in which any Key Employee participates and all
                  plans which enable this Plan to satisfy the
                  anti-discrimination requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(4)
                  and 410 must be combined with this Plan ( "Required
                  Aggregation Group") for the purposes of applying the 60% test
                  described in the preceding sentence. Plans maintained by the
                  Employer which are not in the required aggregation group may
                  be combined at the Employer's election with this Plan for the
                  purposes of determining Top Heavy status if the combined plan
                  satisfies the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(4) and 410 (
                  "Permissive Aggregation Group"). In determining the value of
                  Participant Accounts, all distributions made during the
                  five-year period ending on the Determination Date shall be
                  included and any unallocated Employer Contributions or
                  forfeitures attributable to the Plan Year in which the
                  Determination Date falls shall also be included. The Account
                  of (i) any Employee who at one time was a Key Employee but who
                  is not a Key Employee for any of the five Plan Years ending on
                  the Determination Date; and (ii) any Employee who has not
                  performed services for the Employer or a related employer
                  maintaining a plan in the aggregation group for the five Plan
                  Years ending on the Determination Date, shall be disregarded
                  in determining Top Heavy status.

                  If the Employer maintains a defined benefit plan during the
                  Plan Year which is subject to aggregation with this Plan, the
                  60% test shall be applied after calculating the present value
                  of the Participants' accrued benefits under the defined
                  benefit plan in accordance with the rules set forth in that
                  plan and combining the present value of such accrued benefits
                  with the Participant's account balances under this Plan.

                  Effective January 1, 1987, solely for the purpose of
                  determining if the Plan, or any other plan included in the
                  Required Aggregation Group, is Top-Heavy, a Non-Key Employee's
                  accrued benefit in a defined benefit plan shall be determined
                  under (i) the method, if any, that uniformly applies for
                  accrual purposes under all plans maintained by the Affiliates,
                  or (ii) if there is no such method, as if such benefit accrued
                  not more rapidly than the slowest accrual rate permitted under
                  the fractional accrual rate of Code Section 411(b)(1)(C).

         (b)      Key Employee. Any employee of the Employer who, during the
                  Plan Year or the four preceding Plan Years was an officer
                  receiving Compensation in excess of 50% of the limit described
                  in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A), one of the ten employees of the
                  Employer owning the largest interests in the Employer and
                  receiving Compensation equal to or greater than the dollar
                  limit described in Code Section 415(c)(1)(A), a greater than
                  5% owner of the Employer, a greater than 1% owner of the
                  Employer receiving Compensation in excess of $150,000, or the
                  Beneficiary of a Key Employee. The Code Section 415(b)(1)(A)
                  and 415(c)(1)(A) limits referred to in the preceding sentence
                  shall be the specified dollar limit plus any increases
                  reflecting cost of living adjustments specified by the
                  Secretary of the Treasury.

         (c)      Determination Date. The last day of the Plan Year immediately
                  preceding the Plan Year for which Top Heavy status is
                  determined. For the first Plan Year, the Determination Date
                  shall be the last day of the first Plan Year.

         (d)      Non-Key Employee. Any Participant who is not a Key Employee.

         (e)      Employer. The term "Employer" shall include any Affiliate of
                  such Employer.

         (f)      Compensation. The term "Compensation" shall have that meaning
                  as defined in Article 14.

15.03    Minimum Benefit.

         (a)      Except as provided below, the Employer Contributions allocated
                  on behalf of any Non-Key Employee who is employed by the
                  Employer on the Determination Date shall not be less than the
                  lesser of (i) 3% of such Non-Key Employee's Compensation or
                  (ii) the largest percentage of Employer Contributions and
                  Pre-Tax Contributions, as a percentage of the Key Employee's
                  Compensation, allocated on behalf of any Key Employee for such
                  Plan Year. Pre-Tax Contributions allocated to the Accounts of
                  Non-Key Employees and Employer Matching Contributions
                  allocated to the Accounts of Non-Key Employees that are used
                  to satisfy the provisions of

                                      -69-

<PAGE>

                  Article 12 shall not be considered in determining whether a
                  Non-Key Employee has received the minimum contribution
                  required by this Section 15.03.

         (b)      The minimum allocation is determined without regard to any
                  Social Security contribution and shall be made even though,
                  under other Plan provisions, the Non-Key Employee would have
                  received a lesser allocation or no allocation for the Plan
                  Year because of the Non-Key Employee's failure to complete
                  1,000 Hours of Service, his failure to make mandatory employee
                  contributions, or his earning compensation less than a stated
                  amount.

         (c)      If the Employer maintains a defined benefit plan in addition
                  to this Plan, the minimum contribution and benefit
                  requirements for both plans in a Top Heavy Plan Year may be
                  satisfied by an allocation of Employer Contributions to the
                  Account of each Non-Key Employee in the amount of 5% of the
                  Non-Key Employee's compensation.

15.04    Combined Plan Limitation For Top-Heavy Years Repealed.

         Effective January 1, 2000, adjustments to the combined plan limitation
         of Code Section 415 for top heavy plans are repealed and no longer
         applicable.

16.01    Headings.

         The headings and sub-headings in this Plan have been inserted for
         convenience of reference only and are to be ignored in any construction
         of the provisions hereof.

16.02    Action by Employer.

         Any action by an Employer under this Plan shall be by resolution of its
         Board of Directors, or by any person or persons duly authorized by
         resolution of said Board to take such action.

16.03    Spendthrift Clause.

         Except as otherwise required by (1) a "qualified domestic relations
         order" as defined in Code Section 414(p), or (2) a judgment, order,
         decree or settlement agreement described in Code Section 401(a)(13)(C)
         entered on or after January 1, 2002, none of the benefits, payments,
         proceeds or distributions under this Plan shall be subject to the claim
         of any creditor of any Participant or Beneficiary, or to any legal
         process by any creditor of such Participant or Beneficiary, and none of
         them shall have any right to alienate, commute, anticipate or assign
         any of the benefits, payments, proceeds or distributions under this
         Plan except for the extent expressly provided herein to the contrary.
         If any Participant shall attempt to dispose of the benefits provided
         for him hereunder, or to dispose of the right to receive such benefits,
         or in the event there should be an effort to seize such benefits or the
         right to receive such benefits by attachment, execution or other legal
         or equitable process, such right to benefits shall pass and be
         transferred, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, to such one
         or more as may be appointed by the Plan Administrator from among the
         Beneficiaries, if any theretofore designated by the Participant, or
         from the spouse, children or other dependents of the Participant, in
         such shares as the Committee may appoint. Any appointment so made by
         the Committee may be revoked by it at any time and further appointment
         made by it which may include the Participant.

16.04    Distributions Upon Termination of Plan.

         Subject to Section 11.03, Pre-Tax Contributions and any income
         attributable thereto, shall be distributed to Participants or their
         Beneficiaries as soon as administratively feasible after the
         termination of the Plan, provided that neither the Employer nor its
         Affiliates maintain a "successor plan," as defined in

         respect to all Participants similarly situated and shall not permit
         discrimination in favor of Highly Compensated Employees.

         Any payment to a Participant or Beneficiary, or to their legal
         representatives, in accordance with the provisions of this Plan, shall
         to the extent thereof be in full satisfaction of all claims hereunder
         against the Trustee, Plan Administrator, Committee and the Employer,
         any of whom may require such Participant, Beneficiary, or legal
         representative, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a
         receipt and release therefor in such form as shall be determined by the
         Trustee, the Committee, or the Employer, as the case may be.

16.07    Compliance with Applicable Laws.

         The Company, through the Plan Administrator, shall interpret and
         administer the Plan in such manner that the Plan and Trust shall remain
         in compliance with the Code, with the Act, and all other applicable
         laws, regulations, and rulings.

16.08    Agent for Service of Process.

         The agent for service of process of this Plan shall be the person
         listed from time to time in the current records of the Secretary of
         State of Georgia as the agent for the service of process for the
         Company.

16.09    Merger.

         In the event of any merger or consolidation of the Plan with any other
         Plan, or the transfer of assets or liabilities by the Plan to another
         Plan, each Participant must receive (assuming that the Plan would
         terminate) the benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or
         transfer which is equal to or greater than the benefit such Participant
         would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger,
         consolidation, or transfer (assuming that the Plan had then
         terminated), provided such merger, consolidation, or transfer took
         place after the date of enactment of the Act.

16.10    Governing Law.

                                      -72-

<PAGE>

         The Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia to the
         extent that such laws are not preempted by Federal law.

16.11    Adoption of the Plan by an Affiliated Sponsor.

         (a)      The Committee shall determine which employers shall become
                  Affiliated Sponsors within the terms of the Plan. In order for
                  the Committee to designate an Employer as an Affiliated
                  Sponsor, the Committee must approve the addition of the
                  Affiliated Sponsor's identity to Schedule A or Schedule B
                  (which approval may be retroactive to an earlier effective
                  date). The Committee may also specify such terms and
                  conditions pertaining to the adoption of the Plan by the
                  Affiliated Sponsor as the Committee deems appropriate. With
                  the Committee's consent, an Affiliated Sponsor may limit
                  participation in the Plan to certain of its Employees.

         (b)      The Plan of the Affiliated Sponsor and of the Company shall be
                  considered a single plan for purposes of Treasury
                  Regulations Section 1.414(1)-1(b)(1). All assets contributed
                  to the Plan by the Affiliated Sponsor shall be held in a
                  single fund together with the assets contributed by the
                  Company (and with the assets of any other Affiliated
                  Sponsors); and so long as the Affiliated Sponsor continues to
                  be designated as such, all assets held in such fund shall be
                  available to pay benefits to all Participants and
                  Beneficiaries covered by the Plan irrespective of whether such
                  Employees are employed by the Company or by the Affiliated
                  Sponsor. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to
                  prohibit the separate accounting of assets contributed by the
                  Company and the Affiliated Sponsors for purposes of cost
                  allocation if directed by the Committee or the holding of Plan
                  assets in more than one Trust Fund with more than one Trustee.

         (c)      So long as the Affiliated Sponsor's designation as such
                  remains in effect, the Affiliated Sponsor shall be bound by,
                  and subject to all provisions of the Plan and the Trust
                  Agreement. The exclusive authority to amend the Plan and the
                  Trust Agreement shall be vested in the Board, its Compensation
                  and Stock Option Committee and the Committee and no Affiliated
                  Sponsor shall have any right to amend the Plan or the Trust
                  Agreement. Any amendment to the Plan or the Trust Agreement
                  adopted by the Board, its Compensation and Stock Option
                  Committee or the Committee shall be binding upon every
                  Affiliated Sponsor without further action by such Affiliated
                  Sponsor.

         (d)      Each Affiliated Sponsor shall be solely responsible for making
                  an Employer Contribution with respect to its Employees and
                  solely

                                      -73-

<PAGE>

                  responsible for making any contribution required by Article
                  15. Furthermore, if an Affiliated Sponsor determines to make a
                  Qualified Nonelective Contribution on behalf of its Employees,
                  such Affiliated Sponsor shall be solely responsible for making
                  such contribution. Neither the Company nor any other
                  Affiliated Sponsor is obligated to make an Employer Matching
                  Contribution or Qualified Nonelective Contribution on behalf
                  of the Employees of a different Affiliated Sponsor.

         (e)      The Company and each Affiliated Sponsor which is an Affiliate
                  will be tested on a combined basis to determine whether the
                  Company and such Affiliated Sponsors satisfy the Average
                  Actual Deferral Percentage Test described in Section 12.03 and
                  the Average Actual Contribution Percentage test described in
                  Section 12.06. An Affiliated Sponsor which is not an Affiliate
                  shall be tested separately from the Company and those
                  Affiliated Sponsors that are Affiliates for purposes of the
                  ADP test and ACP test described in Article 12.

         (f)      No Affiliated Sponsor other than the Company shall have the
                  right to terminate the Plan. However, any Affiliated Sponsor
                  may withdraw from the Plan by action of its board of directors
                  provided such action is communicated in writing to the
                  Committee. The withdrawal of an Affiliated Sponsor shall be
                  effective as of the last day of the Plan Year following
                  receipt of the notice of withdrawal (unless the Committee
                  consents to a different effective date). In addition, the
                  Committee may terminate the designation of an Affiliated
                  Sponsor to be effective on such date as the Committee
                  specifies. Any such Affiliated Sponsor which ceases to be an
                  Affiliated Sponsor shall be liable for all cost accrued
                  through the effective date of its withdrawal or termination
                  and any contributions owing as a result of Pre-Tax
                  Contributions by its Employees or any other contribution as
                  provided in paragraphs (d) and (e). In the event of the
                  withdrawal or termination of an Affiliated Sponsor as provided
                  in this paragraph, such Affiliated Sponsor shall have no right
                  to direct that assets of the Plan be transferred to a
                  successor plan for its Employees unless such a transfer is
                  approved by the Committee in its sole discretion.

16.12    Protected Benefits.

         Early retirement benefits, retirement-type subsidies, or optional forms
         of benefits protected under Code Section 411(d)(6) ("Protected
         Benefits") shall not be reduced or eliminated with respect to benefits
         accrued under such Protected Benefits unless such reduction or
         elimination is permitted under the Code authority issued by the
         Internal Revenue Service, or judicial authority.

16.13    Location of Participant or Beneficiary Unknown.

         In the event that all or any portion of the distribution payable to a
         Participant or his Beneficiary shall remain unpaid solely by reason of
         the Committee's inability to ascertain the whereabouts of such
         Participant or Beneficiary, the amount unpaid shall be forfeited.
         However, such forfeiture shall not occur until five (5) years after the
         amount first became payable. The Committee shall make a diligent effort
         to locate the Participant or Beneficiary, including the mailing of a
         registered letter, return receipt requested, to the last known address
         of such Participant or Beneficiary. In the event a Participant or
         Beneficiary is located subsequent to his benefit being forfeited, such
         benefit shall be restored and distributed.

16.14    Qualified Military Service.

         Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary,
         contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified
         military service will be provided in accordance with Code Section
         414(u). It is the intent of this Section 16.14 to adopt the IRS model
         amendment set forth in Rev. Proc. 96-49 for the purposes set forth in
         such revenue procedure.

16.15    Use of Electronic Media.

         Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Plan may
         fulfill any notice, election, consent, disclosure, or other requirement
         using electronic media, to the extent permitted by relevant guidance
         from the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of Labor.
         Electronic media includes, but is not limited to, e-mail, Internet,
         intranet systems, voice response, telephone, or other paperless
         systems. Accordingly, any requirement in the Plan or applicable law or
         regulations that a particular action be done in writing may be
         fulfilled electronically, to the extent permitted by the Internal
         Revenue Service or the Department of Labor.

                                EGTRRA AMENDMENTS

17.01    Background.

         (a)      Adoption and effective date of amendment. This Article 17 is
                  adopted to reflect certain provisions of the Economic Growth
                  and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 ("EGTRRA"). This
                  amendment is intended as good faith compliance with the
                  requirements of EGTRRA and is to be construed in accordance
                  with EGTRRA and guidance issued thereunder. Except as
                  otherwise provided, this Article 17 shall be effective as of
                  the first day of the first plan year beginning after December
                  31, 2001.

         (b)      Supersession of inconsistent provisions. This Article 17 shall
                  supersede the provisions of the Plan to the extent those
                  provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of this
                  Article 17.

17.02    Limitations on Contributions.

         (a)      Effective Date. This section shall be effective for limitation
                  years beginning after December 31, 2001.

         (b)      Maximum Annual Addition. Except to the extent permitted under
                  Section 17.05 and section 414(v) of the Code, if applicable,
                  the annual addition that may be contributed or allocated to a
                  participant's account under the plan for any limitation year
                  shall not exceed the lesser of:

                  (1)      $40,000, as adjusted for increases in the
                           cost-of-living under section 415(d) of the Code, or

                  (2)      100 percent of the participant's compensation, within
                           the meaning of Article 14 for the Limitation Year.
                           The compensation limit referred to in this paragraph
                           (2) shall not apply to any contribution for medical
                           benefits after separation from service (within the
                           meaning of section 401(h) or section 419A(f)(2) of
                           the Code) which is otherwise treated as an Annual
                           Addition.

17.03    Increase in Compensation Limit.

         The annual Compensation of each Participant taken into account in
         determining allocations for any Plan Year beginning after December 31,
         2001, shall not exceed $200,000, as adjusted for cost-of-living
         increases in accordance with section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code. Annual
         Compensation means Compensation during

                                      -76-

<PAGE>

         the Plan Year or such other consecutive 12-month period over which
         Compensation is otherwise determined under the Plan (the determination
         period). The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year
         applies to annual Compensation for the determination period that begins
         with or within such calendar year.

17.04    Elective Deferrals - Contribution Limitation.

         No Participant shall be permitted to have elective deferrals made under
         this Plan, or any other qualified plan maintained by the Employer
         during any taxable year, in excess of the dollar limitation contained
         in section 402(g) of the Code in effect for such taxable year, except
         to the extent permitted under Section 17.05 and section 414(v) of the
         Code, if applicable.

17.05    Catch-Up Contributions.

         (a)      All Employees who are eligible to make elective deferrals
                  under this Plan and who have attained age 50 before the close
                  of the Plan Year shall be eligible to make catch-up
                  contributions in accordance with, and subject to the
                  limitations of, section 414(v) of the Code. Such catch-up
                  contributions shall not be taken into account for purposes of
                  the provisions of the Plan implementing the required
                  limitations of sections 402(g) and 415 of the Code. The Plan
                  shall not be treated as failing to satisfy the provisions of
                  the Plan implementing the requirements of section 401(k)(3),
                  401(k)(11), 401(k)(12), 410(b), or 416 of the Code, as
                  applicable, by reason of the making of such catch-up
                  contributions.

         (b)      Effective Date. This Section shall apply to contributions
                  after December 31, 2001.

17.06    Direct Rollovers of Plan Distributions.

         (a)      Effective Date. This section shall apply to distributions made
                  after December 31, 2001.

         (b)      Modification of Definition of Eligible Retirement Plan. For
                  purposes of the direct rollover provisions in Section 8.07 of
                  the Plan, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an
                  annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code and
                  an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is
                  maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or
                  any agency or instrumentality of a state or political
                  subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account
                  for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan. The
                  definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the
                  case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse
                  or former

                                      -77-

<PAGE>

                  spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic
                  relation order, as defined in section 414(p) of the Code.

         (c)      Modification of Definition of Eligible Rollover Distribution
                  to Exclude Hardship Distributions. For purposes of the direct
                  rollover provisions in Section 8.07 of the Plan, any amount
                  that is distributed on account of hardship shall not be an
                  eligible rollover distribution and the distributee may not
                  elect to have any portion of such a distribution paid directly
                  to an eligible retirement plan.

         (d)      Modification of Definition of Eligible Rollover Distribution
                  to Include After-Tax Employee Contributions. For purposes of
                  the direct rollover provisions in Section 8.07 of the Plan, a
                  portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible
                  rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of
                  after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in
                  gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to
                  an individual retirement account or annuity described in
                  section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined
                  contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the
                  Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so
                  transferred, including separately accounting for the portion
                  of such distribution which is includible in gross income and
                  the portion of such distribution which is not so includible.

17.07    Rollovers from Other Plans.

         (a)      The Plan will accept Participant rollover contributions and/or
                  direct rollovers of distributions made after December 31,
                  2001, from the following types of plans, beginning on the
                  effective date specified in subsection (d) below:

                  A qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the
                  Code, excluding after-tax employee contributions.

         (b)      The Plan will accept a Participant contribution of an eligible
                  rollover distribution from the following plans:

                  A qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the
                  Code.

         (c)      The Plan will not accept a participant rollover contribution
                  of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement
                  account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of
                  the Code that is eligible to be rolled over and would
                  otherwise be includible in gross income.

         (d)      Effective Date of Direct Rollover and Participant Rollover
                  Contribution Provisions. This Section shall be effective
                  January 1, 2002.

                  contributions, and earnings attributable to these
                  contributions shall be distributed on account of the
                  Participant's severance from employment. However, such a
                  distribution shall be subject to the other provisions of the
                  Plan regarding distributions, other than provisions that
                  require a separation from service before such amounts may be
                  distributed.

         (c)      This Section (Distribution upon Severance from Employment),
                  shall apply for distributions after December 31, 2001,
                  regardless of when the severance from employment occurred.

         (a)      A Participant who receives a distribution of elective
                  deferrals after December 31, 2001, on account of hardship

                  deferrals in calendar year 2001 on account of hardship shall
                  be prohibited from making elective deferrals and employee
                  contributions under this and all other plans of the Employer
                  for the period specified in the provisions of the Plan
                  relating to suspension of elective deferrals that were in

<PAGE>

                  satisfies the minimum benefits requirements of section 416(c)
                  of the Code for such years. This Section amends Section 15 of
                  the Plan.

         (b)      Determination of Top-Heavy Status.

                  (1)      Key Employee. Key employee means any employee or
                           former employee (including any deceased employee) who
                           at any time during the Plan Year that includes the
                           determination date was an officer of the Employer
                           having annual compensation greater than $130,000 (as

                           $150,000. For this purpose, annual compensation means
                           compensation within the meaning of section 415(c)(3)
                           of the Code. The determination of who is a key

                  (2)      Determination of Present Values and Amounts. This
                           paragraph (2) shall apply for purposes of determining
                           the present values of accrued benefits and the
                           amounts of account balances of Employees as of the

                                    determination date shall be increased by the
                                    distributions made with respect to the
                                    Employee under the Plan and any plan
                                    aggregated with the Plan under section
                                    416(g)(2) of the Code during the 1-year

                                    preceding sentence shall also apply to
                                    distributions under a terminated plan which,
                                    had it not been terminated, would have been
                                    aggregated with the Plan under section
                                    416(g)(2)(A)(i) of the Code. In the case of
                                    a distribution made for a reason other than
                                    separation from service, death, or
                                    disability, this provision shall be applied
                                    by substituting "5-year period" for "1-year
                                    period."

                           (B)      Employees Not Performing Services During
                                    Year Ending On The Determination Date. The
                                    accrued benefits and accounts of any
                                    individual who has not performed services
                                    for the Employer during the 1-year period
                                    ending on the determination date shall not

         (c)      Minimum Benefits

                  (1)      Matching Contributions. Employer matching
                           contributions shall be taken into account for
                           purposes of satisfying the minimum contribution
                           requirements of section 416(c)(2) of the Code and the
                           Plan. The preceding sentence shall apply with respect
                           to matching contributions under the Plan or, if the
                           Plan provides that the minimum contribution
                           requirement shall be met in another plan, such other
                           plan. Employer matching contributions that are used
                           to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements
                           shall be treated as matching contributions for
                           purposes of the actual contribution percentage test
                           and other requirements of section 401(m) of the Code.

                  (2)      Contributions Under Other Plans. If the Company
                           desires to have the top heavy minimum benefit
                           requirement met in another plan, the Company shall so
                           indicate in this paragraph (2) by identifying the
                           name of the other plan, the minimum benefit that will
                           be provided under such other plan and the employees
                           who will receive the minimum benefit under such other
                           plan. Unless so indicated in this paragraph (2), the
                           top heavy minimum benefit requirement will be
                           satisfied by contributions to this Plan.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Plan to be duly
executed and its seal to be hereunto affixed on the date indicated below, but
effective as of January 1, 2001.
