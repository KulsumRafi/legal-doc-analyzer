<p style="line-height:normal" align="center">SCHEDULE A</p>
<p>Executive Planning Group's Bonus Program as designed for First Citizens
National Bank and First Citizens Bancshares, Inc.</p>
<p><font size="3"><b>THE INCENTIVE PLAN</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve
the goals of the bank, to motivate and reward employees, to attract and retain
good employees, and to address the problems with the current plan, the following
incentive plan is proposed for use at First Citizens National Bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The basic plan will consist of establishing the budget goals for each manager.
It is recommended that the manager prepare the budget with all interest
sensitive factors removed (i.e. interest income and expenses). The budget would
then be approved by a four person committee consisting of Stallings Lipford,
Katie Winchester, Jeff Agee and Judy Long. This approved budget would be the
standard set for that employee for the next year. The actual results would then
be compared to the budget and classified in one of five categories (See Exhibit
One). The level of each employee will also be established by rank within the
bank using a tiered management system will be used as shown in (Exhibit Two).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
resulting matrix will include budgetry performance and level of management as
shown in Exhibit Two. Note that employees not achieving within 10% of budgets
are not included in the matrix and will not participate in the incentive plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
funding for this program would be related to bank performance as determined by
return on assets as shown in Exhibit Three. The base plan would start out with
$20 per point and increase to a top level of $30 per point in the matrix. If a
minimum of .85% return on average assets is not achieved, the plan will not be
in effect. Under the base plan if all participants meet budget projections and
the bank achieves between the .85% and 1.00% return on assets, the expense to
the bank is $70,000.00. Our recommendation is that this amount be budgeted and
communicated to all participants. Under the proposed fixed point value system it
is conceivable that total bonus payout would be less than $70,000.00. In this
case, we would recommend that those dollars not paid be carried forward to the
next year to increase the total bonus pool and the point value. A provision is
made for participants who get within 10% of budget to receive 10% of the base
plan amount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
resulting final matices are shown in Exhibit Four for all levels of management,
all budget performance levels, and various dollar amounts per point. This
exhibit could be shown to employees to let them know how the incentive plan
works. Under this plan, employees are rewarded for their efforts individually
and for their efforts as part of the bank team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This plan
would also have a review board for appear, and based on extraordinary
happenings. This would allow an employee to explain an extraordinary happening
that negatively impacted their budget performance to a three member board made
up of representatives from each tier of management and a member of Executive
Management, with or without Executive veto. Their budget could be modified based
on the board's recommendation. This will give all participants a feeling of
subjective review in an otherwise objective evaluation program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address
the problem of individual good performance in a bad year for the bank, a credit
of ten percent of the points earned would be carried over to the next year, and
every subsequent year until the bank achieves the minimum return on assets to
put the plan into effect. This would address the problem that occurred in 1990,
to avoid an individual disincentive due to the overall performance of the bank.</p>
<p><font size="3">CONCLUDING REMARKS</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
incentive plan should be easy for the employees to understand and easy for the
bank to implement. This plan also addresses the problems with the current plan,
with one notable person. The incentive plan should be extended to include all
bank employees. It is management's desire to extend the plan to all employees
and to create a pool of $50,000,000 to fund the plan. We have preliminary
discussed how to accomplish these goals. We would recommend that we further
develop these ideas in our December meeting. We feel that the bank should set a
goal to have a plan to announce to all employees by the end of the first
quarter. To maximize its impact, the earlier the program is in place, the
greater the potential results.</p>

<p style="line-height:normal" align="center">SCHEDULE A</p>
<p>Executive Planning Group's Bonus Program as designed for First Citizens
National Bank and First Citizens Bancshares, Inc.</p>
<p><font size="2">THE INCENTIVE PLAN</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To achieve the goals of the bank, to motivate and reward employees, to attract
and retain good employees, and to address the problems with the current plan,
the following incentive plan is proposed for use at First Citizens National
Bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basic
plan will consist of establishing the budget goals for each manager. It is
recommended that the manager prepare the budget with all interest sensitive
factors removed (i.e. interest income and expenses). The budget would then be
approved by a four person committee consisting of Stallings Lipford, Katie
Winchester, Jeff Agee and Judy Long. This approved budget would be the standard
set for that employee for the next year. The actual results would then be
compared to the budget and classified in one of five categories (See Exhibit
One). The level of each employee will also be established by rank within the
bank using a tiered management system will be used as shown in (Exhibit Two).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
resulting matrix will include budgetry performance and level of management as
shown in Exhibit Two. Note that employees not achieving within 10% of budgets
are not included in the matrix and will not participate in the incentive plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
funding for this program would be related to bank performance as determined by
return on assets as shown in Exhibit Three. The base plan would start out with
$20 per point and increase to a top level of $30 per point in the matrix. If a
minimum of .85% return on average assets is not achieved, the plan will not be
in effect. Under the base plan if all participants meet budget projections and
the bank achieves between the .85% and 1.00% return on assets, the expense to
the bank is $70,000.00. Our recommendation is that this amount be budgeted and
communicated to all participants. Under the proposed fixed point value system it
is conceivable that total bonus payout would be less than $70,000.00. In this
case, we would recommend that those dollars not paid be carried forward to the
next year to increase the total bonus pool and the point value. A provision is
made for participants who get within 10% of budget to receive 10% of the base
plan amount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
resulting final matices are shown in Exhibit Four for all levels of management,
all budget performance levels, and various dollar amounts per point. This
exhibit could be shown to employees to let them know how the incentive plan
works. Under this plan, employees are rewarded for their efforts individually
and for their efforts as part of the bank team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This plan
would also have a review board for appear, and based on extraordinary
happenings. This would allow an employee to explain an extraordinary happening
that negatively impacted their budget performance to a three member board made
up of representatives from each tier of management and a member of Executive
Management, with or without Executive veto. Their budget could be modified based
on the board's recommendation. This will give all participants a feeling of
subjective review in an otherwise objective evaluation program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address
the problem of individual good performance in a bad year for the bank, a credit
of ten percent of the points earned would be carried over to the next year, and
every subsequent year until the bank achieves the minimum return on assets to
put the plan into effect. This would address the problem that occurred in 1990,
to avoid an individual disincentive due to the overall performance of the bank.</p>
<p><font size="2">CONCLUDING REMARKS</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
incentive plan should be easy for the employees to understand and easy for the
bank to implement. This plan also addresses the problems with the current plan,
with one notable person. The incentive plan should be extended to include all
bank employees. It is management's desire to extend the plan to all employees
and to create a pool of $50,000,000 to fund the plan. We have preliminary
discussed how to accomplish these goals. We would recommend that we further
develop these ideas in our December meeting. We feel that the bank should set a
goal to have a plan to announce to all employees by the end of the first
quarter. To maximize its impact, the earlier the program is in place, the
greater the potential results.</p>
