          shares of the capital stock of the Company are duly authorized and validly
          issued, and are fully paid and nonassessable. There are no outstanding
          subscriptions, warrants, options, convertible stock and/or other rights
          (contingent or other) to purchase or otherwise acquire from the Company (or, to
          the best of the Company&#146;s knowledge, from any other person or entity) any
          equity stock of the Company. Except as set forth in the attached Disclosure
          Schedule, the Company has no obligation to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
          any of its equity securities or any interest therein or to pay any dividend or
          make any other distribution in respect thereof. There are no voting trusts or

          agreements, rights of first refusal, preemptive rights (statutory or
          contractual) or proxies relating to any equity stock of the Company (whether or
          not the Company is a party thereto). Except as set forth in Disclosure Schedule,
          there are no restrictions on the transfer of shares of capital stock of the
          Company, other than those that may be imposed by relevant securities laws of the
          United States and Japan. The issuance of the Purchased Shares will not result in
          any adjustment under the anti-dilution or exercise rights of any holders of any
          outstanding shares of capital stock, options, warrants or other rights to
          acquire any security of the Company. The offer and sale of all shares of capital
          stock and other securities of the Company issued before the date hereof complied
          with or were exempt from any registration requirements imposed under applicable
          securities laws of Japan. </FONT></P>

          proceeding or investigation pending or, to the best of the Company&#146;s
          knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Company, at law or in equity, or

          or of any governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or

          operations, properties, assets, products and services, and the Company has all
          necessary permits, licenses and other authorizations required to conduct its
          business as conducted and as proposed to be conducted, except to the extent
          failure to comply or obtain any such permits, licenses or authorizations will
          not have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no existing law, rule, regulation
          or order, and the Company is not aware of any proposed law, rule, regulation or
          order, which would prohibit or materially restrict the Company from, or
          otherwise materially and adversely affect the Company in, conducting its
          business in any jurisdiction in which it is now conducting business or in which
          it proposes to conduct business. </FONT></P>
