with the Swingline  Lender (up to the amount  available  therein) in order to immediately  pay the Swingline  Lender the amount of such
Swingline  Loans to the extent amounts  received from the Lenders are not sufficient to repay in full the  outstanding  Swingline Loans

the failure of the  Administrative  Agent to so notify the Borrower  shall not result in any liability to the  Administrative  Agent or
affect its right to charge such  account.  If any portion of any such amount paid to the  Swingline  Lender shall be recovered by or on

shared among all the Lenders in  accordance  with their  respective  Commitment  Percentages  (unless the amounts so recovered by or on
behalf of the Borrower  pertain to a Swingline Loan extended after the occurrence and during the  continuance of an Event of Default of
which the  Administrative  Agent has received  notice in the manner  required  pursuant to Section 12.5 and which such Event of Default
has not been waived by the Required Lenders or the Lenders, as applicable).</FONT></P>

(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Each Lender  acknowledges  and agrees that its obligation to refund  Swingline  Loans in accordance
with the terms of this Section 2.2 is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance  whatsoever,  including,
without  limitation,  non-satisfaction  of the conditions set forth in Article V. Further,  each Lender agrees and acknowledges that if
prior to the  refunding of any  outstanding  Swingline  Loans  pursuant to this  Section  2.2,  one of the events  described in Section
11.1(j) or (k) shall have occurred,  each Lender will, on the date the applicable  Revolving Credit Loan would have been made, purchase
an undivided  participating  interest in the  Swingline  Loan to be refunded in an amount  equal to its  Commitment  Percentage  of the
aggregate  amount of such Swingline Loan.  Each Lender will  immediately  transfer to the Swingline  Lender,  in immediately  available
funds,  the amount of its  participation  and upon  receipt  thereof the  Swingline  Lender will  deliver to such Lender a  certificate
evidencing such participation  dated the date of receipt of such funds and for such amount.  Whenever,  at any time after the Swingline
Lender has received  from any Lender such Lender's  participating  interest in a Swingline  Loan,  the  Swingline  Lender  receives any
payment on  account  thereof,  the  Swingline  Lender  will  distribute  to such  Lender  its  participating  interest  in such  amount
(appropriately  adjusted,  in the case of interest  payments,  to reflect the period of time during which such  Lender's  participating
interest was outstanding and funded).</FONT></P>

<U>L/C Commitment</U>.
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Lender, in reliance on
the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in Section 3.4(a), agrees to issue
standby letters of credit (&#147;Letters of Credit&#148;) for the account of the
Borrower on any Business Day from the Closing Date through but not including the
Revolving Credit Termination Date in such form as may be approved from time to
time by the Issuing Lender; provided, that the Issuing Lender shall have no
obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such
issuance, (a) the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment, (b) the
Available Commitment of any Lender would be less than zero, or (c) the aggregate
principal amount of all outstanding Loans plus the aggregate outstanding amount
of the L/C Obligations (after giving effect to the Letter of Credit being
requested at such time) would exceed the Aggregate Commitment. Each Letter of
Credit shall (i) be denominated in Dollars in a minimum amount of $500,000, (ii)
be a standby letter of credit issued to support obligations of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries, contingent or otherwise, (iii) expire no later than one
(1) year from the date of issuance thereof; provided, that in no case shall such
expiration date be later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Revolving
Credit Termination Date and (iv) be subject to the Uniform Customs and/or ISP98,
as set forth in the Application or as determined by the Issuing Lender and, to
the extent not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of North Carolina.
The Issuing Lender shall not at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of
Credit hereunder if such issuance would conflict with, or cause the Issuing
Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any Applicable
Law. References herein to &#147;issue&#148; and derivations thereof with respect
to Letters of Credit shall also include extensions or modifications of any
existing Letters of Credit, unless the context otherwise requires. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Procedure for
Issuance of Letters of Credit</U>. The Borrower may from time to time request that
the Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to the Issuing Lender
at the Administrative Agent&#146;s Office an Application therefor, completed to
the satisfaction of the Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents
and other papers and information as the Issuing Lender may request. Upon receipt
of any Application, the Issuing Lender shall process such Application and the
certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in
connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall,
subject to Section 3.1 and Article V hereof, promptly but no later than five (5)
Business Days from the date of its receipt of the Application therefor, issue
the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall the Issuing Lender
be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three (3) Business Days
after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates,
documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by issuing the
original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may
be agreed by the Issuing Lender and the Borrower. If requested by the Borrower,
the Issuing Lender shall furnish to the Borrower a draft of any Letter of Credit
prior to its issuance. The Issuing Lender shall promptly furnish to the Borrower
a copy of such Letter of Credit and promptly notify each Lender of the issuance
and upon request by any Lender, furnish to such Lender a copy of such Letter of
Credit and the amount of such Lender&#146;s L/C Participation therein. </FONT></P>

Issuing  Lender,  an issuance  fee with respect to each Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the face amount of such Letter of Credit

which the Issuing  Lender is not  reimbursed in full by the Borrower  through a Revolving  Credit Loan or otherwise in accordance  with
the terms of this  Agreement,  such L/C  Participant  shall pay to the Issuing Lender upon demand at the Issuing  Lender's  address for

Issuing Lender shall notify each L/C  Participant of the amount and due date of such required  payment and such L/C  Participant  shall
pay to the Issuing  Lender the amount  specified on the  applicable  due date.  If any such amount is paid to the Issuing  Lender after
the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender on demand,  in addition to such amount,  the product
of (i) such amount,  times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Rate as determined by the  Administrative  Agent during the period from
and  including the date such payment is due to the date on which such payment is  immediately  available to the Issuing  Lender,  times
(iii) a fraction the  numerator of which is the number of days that elapse  during such period and the  denominator  of which is 360. A
certificate  of the Issuing  Lender with respect to any amounts  owing under this Section  3.4(b) shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error.  With respect to payment to the Issuing Lender of the  unreimbursed  amounts  described in this Section 3.4(b),  if the
L/C  Participants  receive  notice that any such  payment is due (A) prior to 1:00 p.m.  (Charlotte  time) on any  Business  Day,  such
payment  shall be due that  Business  Day, and (B) after 1:00 p.m.  (Charlotte  time) on any Business Day, such payment shall be due on

thereof,  the Issuing Lender will distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share thereof;  provided,  that in the event that any

<U>Reimbursement
Obligation of the Borrower</U>. In the event of any drawing under any Letter of
Credit, the Borrower agrees to reimburse (either with the proceeds of a
Revolving Credit Loan as provided for in this Section 3.5 or with funds from
other sources), the Issuing Lender on each date on which the Issuing Lender
notifies the Borrower of the date and amount of a draft paid under any Letter of
Credit for the amount of (a) such draft so paid and (b) any amounts referred to
in Section 3.3(c) incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with such
payment. Unless the Borrower shall immediately notify the Issuing Lender that
the Borrower intends to reimburse the Issuing Lender for such drawing from other
sources or funds, the Borrower shall be deemed to have timely given a Notice of
Borrowing to the Administrative Agent requesting that the Lenders make a
Revolving Credit Loan bearing interest at the Base Rate on such date in the
amount of (a) such draft so paid and (b) any amounts referred to in Section
3.3(c) incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with such payment, and the
Lenders shall make a Revolving Credit Loan bearing interest at the Base Rate in
such amount, the proceeds of which shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing
Lender for the amount of the related drawing and costs and expenses. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to fund a Revolving Credit Loan in
accordance with this Section 3.5 to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any draft
paid under a Letter of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be
affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation,
non-satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 2.3(a) or Article V. If
the Borrower has elected to pay the amount of such drawing with funds from other
sources and shall fail to reimburse the Issuing Lender as provided above, the
unreimbursed amount of such drawing shall bear interest at the rate which would
be payable on any outstanding Base Rate Loans which were then overdue from the
date such amounts become payable (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise) until payment in full. </FONT></P>

<U>Obligations
Absolute</U>. The Borrower&#146;s obligations under this Article III (including
without limitation the Reimbursement Obligation) shall be absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any set-off,
counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower may have or have had
against the Issuing Lender or any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other
Person. The Borrower also agrees that the Issuing Lender and the L/C
Participants shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower&#146;s Reimbursement
Obligation under Section 3.5 shall not be affected by, among other things, the
validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though
such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any
dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of
Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or
any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of
Credit or any such transferee. The Issuing Lender shall not be liable for any
error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of
any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of
Credit, except for errors or omissions caused by the Issuing Lender&#146;s gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or
omitted by the Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit
or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence
or willful misconduct shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in
any liability of the Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to the Borrower. The
responsibility of the Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any
draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any
payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited
to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such
Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are in conformity with such
Letter of Credit. </FONT></P>

any provision contained in any Application or other certificate, document or
other paper provided by the Borrower in connection with an Application
(collectively, the &#147;Application Documents&#148;) which purports to convey
to the Issuing Bank or any of its affiliates a Lien as security for any

of Default. Accordingly, any provision contained in any of the Application
Documents providing for or specifying events of default shall be of no force and

<u>Nature of
Obligations of Lenders Regarding Extensions of Credit; Assumption by the
Administrative Agent</U>. The obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement to
make the Loans and issue or participate in Letters of Credit are several and are
not joint or joint and several. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice from a Lender prior to a proposed borrowing date that such
Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender&#146;s
ratable portion of the amount to be borrowed on such date (which notice shall
not release such Lender of its obligations hereunder), the Administrative Agent
may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the
Administrative Agent on the proposed borrowing date in accordance with Section
2.3(b) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If such amount is
made available to the Administrative Agent on a date after such borrowing date,
such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount, until
paid, equal to the product of (a) the amount not made available by such Lender
in accordance with the terms hereof, times (b) the daily average Federal Funds
Rate during such period as determined by the Administrative Agent, times (c) a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and
including such borrowing date to the date on which such amount not made
available by such Lender in accordance with the terms hereof shall have become
immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the denominator of which
is 360. A certificate of the Administrative Agent with respect to any amounts
owing under this Section 4.7 shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such
Lender&#146;s Commitment Percentage of such borrowing is not made available to
the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days after
such borrowing date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such
amount made available by the Administrative Agent with interest thereon at the
rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder, on demand, from the
Borrower. The failure of any Lender to make available its Commitment Percentage
of any Loan requested by the Borrower shall not relieve it or any other Lender
of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Commitment Percentage of such
Loan available on the borrowing date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Lender to make its Commitment Percentage of such Loan
available on the borrowing date. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to
the contrary, any Lender that fails to make available its Commitment Percentage
of any Loan shall not (a)&#160;have any voting or consent rights under or with
respect to any Loan Document or (b) constitute a &#147;Lender&#148; (or be
included in the calculation of Required Lenders hereunder) for any voting or
consent rights under or with respect to any Loan Document. </FONT></P>

Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall
have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which successor

Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and

Administrative Agent&#146;s giving of notice of resignation, then the
Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent, which successor shall have minimum capital and surplus of

Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor
Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all

the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and

resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section

omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent. </FONT></P>
