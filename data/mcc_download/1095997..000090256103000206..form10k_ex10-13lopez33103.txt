     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this  Agreement,  and during the
term of this Agreement,  Lender agrees to make advances ("Advances") to Borrower
in an amount at any one time  outstanding  not to exceed an amount  equal to the
lesser of (i) the Maximum  Revolver  Amount less the Letter of Credit Usage,  or
(ii) the Borrowing  Base less the Letter of Credit  Usage.  For purposes of this
Agreement, "Borrowing Base," as of any



                                       31
<PAGE>

date of  determination,  shall  mean the  result  of (y) the  lesser  of (i) the
product of  Borrower's  EBITDA for the 12 month period ending as of the last day
of the month  immediately  preceding such date of  determination  times 125%, or
(ii) the product of Borrower's Annualized Quarterly EBITDA as of the last day of
the month immediately preceding such date of determination times 125%, minus (z)
the aggregate  amount of reserves,  if any,  established by Lender under Section
2.1(b).

     (b) Anything to the contrary in this  Section 2.1  notwithstanding,  Lender
shall have the right to establish reserves in such amounts,  and with respect to
such matters,  as Lender in its  Permitted  Discretion  shall deem  necessary or
appropriate,  against the Borrowing Base, including reserves with respect to (i)
sums that  Borrower is required  to pay (such as taxes,  assessments,  insurance
premiums, or, in the case of leased assets, rents or other amounts payable under
such  leases) and has failed to pay under any Section of this  Agreement  or any
other Loan Document (including the reserve  contemplated by Section 8.7 hereof),
and (ii) amounts owing by Borrower to any Person to the extent secured by a Lien
on, or trust over, any of the Collateral (other than any existing Permitted Lien
set forth on Schedule P-3 which is specifically  identified  thereon as entitled
to have priority over the Lender's Liens), which Lien or trust, in the Permitted
Discretion of Lender likely would have a priority superior to the Lender's Liens
(such  as Liens  or  trusts  in  favor  of  landlords,  warehousemen,  carriers,
mechanics,  materialmen,  laborers,  or  suppliers,  or Liens or  trusts  for ad
valorem,  excise,  sales,  or other taxes where given priority under  applicable
law) in and to such item of the Collateral.

     (c) Lender shall have no obligation to make additional  Advances  hereunder
to the extent such additional  Advances would cause the Revolver Usage to exceed
the Maximum Revolver Amount.

     (d) Amounts borrowed pursuant to this Section may be repaid and, subject to
the terms and  conditions of this  Agreement,  reborrowed at any time during the
term of this Agreement.

<PAGE>

     (b) Making of  Advances.  If Lender has  received  a timely  request  for a
Borrowing  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  hereof,  and  subject  to  the
satisfaction  of the applicable  terms and  conditions set forth herein,  Lender
shall make the proceeds of such Advance  available to Borrower on the applicable
Funding Date by transferring  immediately available funds equal to such proceeds
to Borrower's Designated Account.

2.4   Payments

     (a) Payments by Borrower.

          (i) Except as otherwise  expressly  provided  herein,  all payments by
     Borrower shall be made to Lender's Account and shall be made in immediately
     available  funds,  no later than 11:00 a.m.  (California  time) on the date
     specified  herein.  Any payment  received  by Lender  later than 11:00 a.m.
     (California  time) shall be deemed to have been  received on the  following
     Business Day and any  applicable  interest or fee shall  continue to accrue
     until such following Business Day.

     (b) Application and Reversal of Payments.

          (i) All  payments  shall be remitted  to Lender and all such  payments
     (other  than  payments  received  while no Default or Event of Default  has
     occurred and is continuing  and which relate to the payment of principal or
     interest of specific Obligations or which relate to the payment of specific
     fees), and all proceeds of Accounts or other Collateral received by Lender,
     shall be applied as follows:

               A. first, to pay any Lender Expenses then due to Lender under the
          Loan Documents, until paid in full,

               B.  second,  to pay any fees  then due to  Lender  under the Loan
          Documents until paid in full,

               C. third,  ratably to pay interest due in respect of the Advances
          until paid in full,

               D. fourth,  to pay the  principal  of all Advances  until paid in
          full,

               E. fifth,  if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
          to be held by Lender as cash collateral in an amount up to 105% of the
          then extant Letter of Credit Usage until paid in full,

               F. sixth, to pay any other Obligations until paid in full, and

               G. seventh,  to Borrower (to be wired to the Designated  Account)
          or such other Person entitled thereto under applicable law.



                                       33
<PAGE>

               (ii) In each instance,  so long as no Default or Event of Default
          has occurred and is continuing,  Section 2.4(b) shall not be deemed to
          apply to any payment by Borrower  specified  by Borrower to be for the
          payment of specific  Obligations then due and payable (or pre-payable)
          under any provision of this Agreement.

               (iii) For purposes of the foregoing, "paid in full" means payment
          of all amounts owing under the Loan  Documents  according to the terms
          thereof,   including  loan  fees,  service  fees,  professional  fees,
          interest  (and  specifically  including  interest  accrued  after  the
          commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding), default interest, interest
          on interest, and expense reimbursements, whether or not the same would
          be or is allowed or disallowed  in whole or in part in any  Insolvency
          Proceeding.

               (iv) In the  event  of a direct  conflict  between  the  priority
          provisions of this Section 2.4 and other  provisions  contained in any
          other Loan  Document,  it is the intention of the parties  hereto that
          such priority  provisions in such documents shall be read together and
          construed,  to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each
          other. In the event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot
          be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this Section 2.4
          shall control and govern.

     2.5  Overadvances.  If,  at any  time  or for any  reason,  the  amount  of
Obligations  owed by  Borrower to Lender  pursuant  to Sections  2.1 and 2.12 is
greater than either the Dollar or percentage  limitations  set forth in Sections
2.1 or 2.12, (an  "Overadvance"),  Borrower  immediately shall pay to Lender, in
cash, the amount of such excess,  which amount shall be used by Lender to reduce
the  Obligations in accordance  with the priorities set forth in Section 2.4(b).
In  addition,  Borrower  hereby  promises  to  pay  the  Obligations  (including
principal,  interest, fees, costs, and expenses) in Dollars in full to Lender as
and when due and payable  under the terms of this  Agreement  and the other Loan
Documents.

     2.6  Interest  Rates  and  Letter  of  Credit  Fee:  Rates,  Payments,  and
Calculations.

     (a) Interest Rates. Except as provided in clause (c) below, all Obligations
(except  for  undrawn  Letters  of  Credit)  that have been  charged to the Loan
Account  pursuant to the terms hereof shall bear  interest on the Daily  Balance
thereof,  at Borrower's option in accordance with Section 2.13 below, as follows
(i) if the relevant Obligation is an Advance that is a LIBOR Rate Loan, at a per
annum  rate  equal to the  LIBOR  Rate  plus the  LIBOR  Rate  Margin,  and (ii)
otherwise, at a per annum rate equal to the Base Rate plus the Base Rate Margin.

     The  foregoing  notwithstanding,  at no  time  shall  any  portion  of  the
Obligations  bear interest on the Daily Balance thereof at a per annum rate less
than 8.50%. To the extent that interest accrued  hereunder at the rate set forth
herein would be less than the foregoing  minimum  daily rate,  the interest rate
chargeable hereunder for such day automatically shall be deemed increased to the
minimum rate.



                                       34
<PAGE>

     (b) Letter of Credit Fee.  Borrower shall pay Lender a Letter of Credit fee
(in addition to the charges,  commissions,  fees, and costs set forth in Section
2.12(e))  which shall  accrue at a rate equal to 1.25% per annum times the Daily
Balance of the undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit.

     (c) Default Rate.  Upon the  occurrence and during the  continuation  of an
Event of Default,

          (i) all Obligations  (except for undrawn Letters of Credit ) that have
     been  charged to the Loan  Account  pursuant to the terms hereof shall bear
     interest  on the  Daily  Balance  thereof  at a per annum  rate  equal to 2
     percentage points above the per annum rate otherwise applicable  hereunder,
     and

          (ii) the Letter of Credit fee provided for above shall be increased to
     2  percentage  points  above  the  per  annum  rate  otherwise   applicable
     hereunder.

     (d) Payment.  Interest,  Letter of Credit fees,  and all other fees payable
hereunder shall be due and payable,  in arrears,  on the first day of each month
at any time that  Obligations  or  obligation  to extend  credit  hereunder  are
outstanding.  Borrower hereby authorizes Lender, in accordance with Section 2.10
below and from time to time without  prior  notice to  Borrower,  to charge such
interest  and fees,  all Lender  Expenses (as and when  incurred),  the charges,
commissions,  fees,  and costs  provided  for in  Section  2.12(e)  (as and when
accrued or  incurred),  the fees and costs  provided for in Section 2.11 (as and
when accrued or  incurred),  and all other  payments as and when due and payable
under any Loan Document to Borrower's  Loan  Account,  which amounts  thereafter
constitute  Advances  hereunder  and  shall  accrue  interest  at the rate  then
applicable  to  Advances  hereunder.  Any  interest  not paid  when due shall be
compounded  by being  charged to  Borrower's  Loan Account and shall  thereafter
constitute  Advances  hereunder  and  shall  accrue  interest  at the rate  then
applicable to Advances that are Base Rate Loans hereunder.

     (e) Computation.  All interest and fees chargeable under the Loan Documents
shall be computed  on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual  number of days
elapsed. In the event the Base Rate is changed from time to time hereafter,  the
rates  of  interest  hereunder  based  upon  the  Base  Rate  automatically  and
immediately shall be increased or decreased by an amount equal to such change in
the Base Rate.



                                       35
<PAGE>

     (f) Intent to Limit  Charges to Maximum  Lawful Rate. In no event shall the
interest rate or rates payable under this Agreement, plus any other amounts paid
in connection herewith, exceed the highest rate permissible under any law that a
court  of  competent   jurisdiction  shall,  in  a  final  determination,   deem
applicable.  Borrower and Lender,  in executing and delivering  this  Agreement,
intend legally to agree upon the rate or rates of interest and manner of payment
stated within it;  provided,  however,  that,  anything  contained herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, if said rate or rates of interest or manner of payment
exceeds the maximum  allowable under applicable law, then, ipso facto, as of the
date of this Agreement,  Borrower is and shall be liable only for the payment of
such maximum as allowed by law, and payment  received from Borrower in excess of
such legal maximum,  whenever received, shall be applied to reduce the principal
balance of the Obligations to the extent of such excess.

     2.7 [Intentionally Omitted.]

     2.8 Crediting Payments. The receipt of any payment item by Lender shall not
be  considered a payment on account  unless such payment item is a wire transfer
of immediately  available  federal funds made to Lender's  Account or unless and
until such  payment  item is honored  when  presented  for  payment.  Should any
payment item not be honored when  presented for payment,  then Borrower shall be
deemed  not  to  have  made  such  payment  and  interest  shall  be  calculated
accordingly.  Anything to the contrary  contained  herein  notwithstanding,  any
payment  item shall be deemed  received by Lender  only if it is  received  into
Lender's Account on a Business Day on or before 11:00 a.m. (California time). If
any payment item is received into the Lender's  Account on a non-Business Day or
after 11:00 a.m. (California time) on a Business Day, it shall be deemed to have
been  received  by Lender  as of the  opening  of  business  on the  immediately
following Business Day.

     2.9  Designated  Account.  Lender is authorized  to make the Advances,  and
Lender is authorized to issue the Letters of Credit,  under this Agreement based
upon telephonic or other  instructions  received from anyone purporting to be an
Authorized  Person,  or without  instructions  if  pursuant  to Section  2.6(d).
Borrower  agrees to  establish  and  maintain  the  Designated  Account with the
Designated  Account  Bank for the  purpose  of  receiving  the  proceeds  of the
Advances  requested by Borrower and made by Lender  hereunder.  Unless otherwise
agreed by Lender and  Borrower,  any Advance  requested  by Borrower and made by
Lender hereunder shall be made to the Designated Account.

     2.10 Maintenance of Loan Account;  Statements of Obligations.  Lender shall
maintain an account on its books in the name of Borrower (the "Loan Account") on
which  Borrower  will be charged with all Advances made by Lender to Borrower or
for  Borrower's  account,  the Letters of Credit issued by Lender for Borrower's
account,  and with all other  payment  Obligations  hereunder or under the other
Loan  Documents,  including,  accrued  interest,  fees and expenses,  and Lender
Expenses. In accordance with Section 2.8, the Loan Account will be credited with
all payments received by Lender from Borrower or for Borrower's account.  Lender
shall  render  statements  regarding  the Loan  Account to  Borrower,  including
principal,  interest,  fees,  and  including an  itemization  of all charges and




                                       36
<PAGE>

expenses  constituting  Lender  Expenses  owing,  and such  statements  shall be
conclusively  presumed  to be correct and  accurate  and  constitute  an account
stated between Borrower and Lender unless,  within 30 days after receipt thereof
by  Borrower,  Borrower  shall  deliver  to  Lender  written  objection  thereto
describing the error or errors contained in any such statements.

     2.11 Fees.  Borrower  shall pay to Lender the  following  fees and charges,
which  fees and  charges  shall be  non-refundable  when paid  (irrespective  of
whether this Agreement is terminated thereafter):

     (a) Unused Line Fee. On the first day of each month during the term of this
Agreement,  an unused  line fee in an amount  equal to .375% per annum times the
result of (a) the Maximum Revolver  Amount,  less (b) the sum of (i) the average
Daily Balance of Advances that were outstanding during the immediately preceding
month,  plus (ii) the average Daily Balance of the Letter of Credit Usage during
the immediately preceding month,

     (b) Fee Letter Fees. As and when due and payable under the terms of the Fee
Letter, Borrower shall pay to Lender the fees set forth in the Fee Letter, and

     (c)  Audit,  Appraisal,   and  Valuation  Charges.  Audit,  appraisal,  and
valuation  fees and charges as follows (i) a fee of $650 per day,  per  auditor,
plus  out-of-pocket  expenses for each financial audit of Borrower  performed by
personnel employed by Lender,  (ii) a fee of $1,500 per day per appraiser,  plus
out-of-pocket  expenses,  for each  appraisal  of the  Collateral  performed  by
personnel  employed by Lender,  and (iii) the actual charges paid or incurred by
Lender if it elects to employ  the  services  of one or more  third  Persons  to
perform financial audits of Borrower, to appraise the Collateral, or any portion
thereof, or to assess Borrower's business valuation; provided, however, that, so
long as no Event of Default has occurred and is  continuing,  Borrower shall not
be obligated to reimburse Lender for the costs and expenses of more than 8 audit
days in any 12 consecutive month period.

     2.12 Letters of Credit.

     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Lender agrees to
issue  letters of credit  for the  account of  Borrower  (each,  an "L/C") or to
purchase  participations  or execute  indemnities or  reimbursement  obligations
(each such undertaking,  an "L/C Undertaking") with respect to letters of credit
issued by an Underlying  Issuer (as of the Closing Date, such issuing bank to be
Wells Fargo) for the account of  Borrower.  To request the issuance of an L/C or
an L/C  Undertaking (or the amendment,  renewal,  or extension of an outstanding
L/C or L/C Undertaking), Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by
electronic  communication,  if  arrangements  for doing so have been approved by
Lender) to Lender  (reasonably  in advance of the  requested  date of  issuance,
amendment,  renewal, or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of an L/C or
L/C  Undertaking,  or  identifying  the L/C or L/C  Undertaking  to be  amended,
renewed, or extended,  the date of issuance,  amendment,  renewal, or extension,
the date on which such



                                       37
<PAGE>

L/C or L/C Undertaking is to expire,  the amount of such L/C or L/C Undertaking,
the name and  address of the  beneficiary  thereof  (or the  beneficiary  of the
Underlying Letter of Credit, as applicable), and such other information as shall
be necessary to prepare, amend, renew, or extend such L/C or L/C Undertaking. If
requested by Lender,  Borrower also shall be an applicant  under the application
with respect to any Underlying  Letter of Credit that is to be the subject of an
L/C Undertaking.  Lender shall have no obligation to issue a Letter of Credit if
any of the following would result after giving effect to the requested Letter of
Credit:

          (i) the Letter of Credit  Usage would exceed the  Borrowing  Base less
     the amount of outstanding Advances, or

          (ii) the Letter of Credit  Usage would  exceed the Maximum L/C Amount,
     or

          (iii) the Letter of Credit  Usage would  exceed the  Maximum  Revolver
     Amount less the then extant amount of outstanding Advances.

     Borrower and Lender  acknowledge and agree that certain  Underlying Letters
of  Credit  may be  issued  to  support  letters  of  credit  that  already  are
outstanding  as of the Closing  Date.  Each Letter of Credit (and  corresponding
Underlying  Letter of Credit)  shall  have an expiry  date no later than 20 days
prior to the  Maturity  Date and all such  Letters of Credit (and  corresponding
Underlying Letter of Credit) shall be in form and substance acceptable to Lender
(in the exercise of its Permitted  Discretion),  including the requirement  that
the  amounts  payable  thereunder  must be  payable  in  Dollars.  If  Lender is
obligated to advance funds under a Letter of Credit,  Borrower immediately shall
reimburse such L/C Disbursement to Lender by paying to Lender an amount equal to
such L/C  Disbursement  not later than 11:00 a.m.,  California time, on the date
that such L/C  Disbursement is made, if Borrower shall have received  written or
telephonic notice of such L/C Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., California time,
on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by




                                       38
<PAGE>

Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 11:00 a.m.,
California time, on the Business Day that Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., California time, on the date of receipt,
and, in the absence of such reimbursement, the L/C Disbursement immediately and
automatically shall be deemed to be an Advance hereunder and, thereafter, shall
bear interest at the rate then applicable to Advances that are Base Rate Loans
under Section 2.6. To the extent an L/C Disbursement is deemed to be an Advance
hereunder, Borrower's obligation to reimburse such L/C Disbursement shall be
discharged and replaced by the resulting Advance.

     (b) Borrower  hereby agrees to  indemnify,  save,  defend,  and hold Lender
harmless from any loss, cost,  expense, or liability,  and reasonable  attorneys
fees  incurred  by Lender  arising  out of or in  connection  with any Letter of
Credit;  provided,  however,  that Borrower shall not be obligated  hereunder to
indemnify for any loss, cost,  expense, or liability that is caused by the gross
negligence or willful  misconduct of Lender.  Borrower agrees to be bound by the
Underlying Issuer's  regulations and interpretations of any Underlying Letter of
Credit  or by  Lender's  interpretations  of any L/C  issued by Lender to or for
Borrower's  account,  even  though this  interpretation  may be  different  from
Borrower's  own,  and Borrower  understands  and agrees that Lender shall not be
liable for any error, negligence, or mistake, whether of omission or commission,
in following Borrower's  instructions or those contained in the Letter of Credit
or any modifications,  amendments,  or supplements thereto. Borrower understands
that the L/C Undertakings may require Lender to indemnify the Underlying  Issuer
for certain costs or liabilities  arising out of claims by Borrower against such
Underlying Issuer.  Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify,  save, defend, and hold
Lender harmless with respect to any loss, cost,  expense  (including  reasonable
attorneys fees), or liability  incurred by Lender under any L/C Undertaking as a
result of Lender's indemnification of any Underlying Issuer; provided,  however,
that Borrower shall not be obligated  hereunder to indemnify for any loss, cost,
expense,  or  liability  that is  caused  by the  gross  negligence  or  willful
misconduct of Lender.

     (c) Borrower hereby authorizes and directs any Underlying Issuer to deliver
to Lender all instruments,  documents,  and other writings and property received
by such Underlying  Issuer  pursuant to such Underlying  Letter of Credit and to
accept and rely upon Lender's  instructions  with respect to all matters arising
in connection with such Underlying Letter of Credit and the related application.

     (d) Any and all charges,  commissions,  fees,  and costs incurred by Lender
relating to Underlying  Letters of Credit shall be Lender  Expenses for purposes
of this Agreement and  immediately  shall be  reimbursable by Borrower to Lender
for the account of Lender; it being acknowledged and agreed by Borrower that, as
of the Closing Date, the issuance charge imposed by the  prospective  Underlying
Issuer is .825% per annum  times the face  amount of each  Underlying  Letter of
Credit, that such issuance charge may be changed from time to time, and that the
Underlying Issuer also imposes a schedule of charges for amendments, extensions,
drawings, and renewals.



                                       39
<PAGE>

     (e) If by reason of (i) any change in any applicable law, treaty,  rule, or
regulation or any change in the  interpretation  or  application  thereof by any
Governmental  Authority,  or (ii) compliance by the Underlying  Issuer or Lender
with any direction,  request, or requirement (irrespective of whether having the
force of law) of any  Governmental  Authority or monetary  authority  including,
Regulation  D of the Federal  Reserve  Board as from time to time in effect (and
any successor thereto):

          (i) any  reserve,  deposit,  or  similar  requirement  is or  shall be
     imposed or modified in respect of any Letter of Credit issued hereunder, or

          (ii) there  shall be imposed  on the  Underlying  Issuer or Lender any
     other condition  regarding any Underlying Letter of Credit or any Letter of
     Credit issued pursuant hereto,

and the result of the foregoing is to increase, directly or indirectly, the cost
to Lender of issuing, making, guaranteeing,  or maintaining any Letter of Credit
or to reduce the amount  receivable in respect  thereof by Lender,  then, and in
any such case,  Lender  may, at any time within a  reasonable  period  after the
additional cost is incurred or the amount received is reduced,  notify Borrower,
and  Borrower  shall pay on demand  such  amounts  as Lender  may  specify to be
necessary to  compensate  Lender for such  additional  cost or reduced  receipt,
together with interest on such amount from the date of such demand until payment
in full thereof at the rate then  applicable to Base Rate Loans  hereunder.  The
determination by Lender of any amount due pursuant to this Section, as set forth
in a certificate  setting forth the  calculation  thereof in reasonable  detail,
shall, in the absence of manifest or demonstrable error, be final and conclusive
and binding on all of the parties hereto.

     2.13 LIBOR Option

     (a) Interest and Interest Payment Dates. In lieu of having interest charged
at the rate based upon the Base Rate, Borrower shall have the option (the "LIBOR
Option") to have  interest  on all or a portion of the  Advances be charged at a
rate of interest  based upon the LIBOR Rate.  Interest on LIBOR Rate Loans shall
be payable on the earliest of (i) the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto,  (ii) the  occurrence  of an Event of Default in  consequence  of which
Lender  has  elected  to  accelerate  the  maturity  of the  Obligations,  (iii)
termination  of this Agreement  pursuant to the terms hereof,  or (iv) the first
day of each month that such LIBOR Rate Loan is  outstanding.  On the last day of
each applicable  Interest  Period,  unless  Borrower  properly has exercised the
LIBOR Option with respect  thereto,  the interest rate  applicable to such LIBOR
Rate Loan automatically shall convert to the rate of interest then applicable to
Base Rate Loans of the same type hereunder. At any time that an Event of Default
has  occurred  and is  continuing,  Borrower no longer  shall have the option to
request that  Advances bear interest at the LIBOR Rate and Lender shall have the
right to convert the interest  rate on all  outstanding  LIBOR Rate Loans to the
rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder.



                                       40
<PAGE>

     (b) LIBOR Election.

     (i) Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, so long as no Event of
Default has  occurred and is  continuing,  elect to exercise the LIBOR Option by
notifying Lender prior to 11:00 a.m.  (California time) at least 3 Business Days
prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  proposed   Interest  Period  (the  "LIBOR
Deadline").  Notice of  Borrower's  election of the LIBOR Option for a permitted
portion of the Advances and an Interest Period pursuant to this Section shall be
made by delivery to Lender of a LIBOR Notice received by Lender before the LIBOR
Deadline,  or by telephonic  notice received by Lender before the LIBOR Deadline
(to be  confirmed  by  delivery to Lender of a LIBOR  Notice  received by Lender
prior to 5:00 p.m. (California time) on the same day).

     (ii) Each LIBOR Notice  shall be  irrevocable  and binding on Borrower.  In
connection with each LIBOR Rate Loan, Borrower shall indemnify, defend, and hold
Lender  harmless  against  any loss,  cost,  or expense  incurred by Lender as a
result of (a) the payment of any  principal of any LIBOR Rate Loan other than on
the last day of an Interest Period applicable  thereto (including as a result of
an Event of Default),  (b) the  conversion  of any LIBOR Rate Loan other than on
the last day of the Interest Period  applicable  thereto,  or (c) the failure to
borrow, convert, continue or prepay any LIBOR Rate Loan on the date specified in
any LIBOR Notice  delivered  pursuant hereto (such losses,  costs, and expenses,
collectively,  "Funding  Losses").  Funding  Losses shall be deemed to equal the
amount  determined  by Lender to be the  excess,  if any,  of (i) the  amount of
interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such LIBOR Rate Loan
had such event not occurred,  at the LIBOR Rate that would have been  applicable
thereto,  for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then
current  Interest  Period  therefor  (or,  in the case of a failure  to  borrow,
convert,  or continue,  for the period that would have been the Interest  Period
therefor), minus (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal
amount for such period at the  interest  rate which Lender would be offered were
it to be offered,  at the  commencement  of such  period,  Dollar  deposits of a
comparable  amount and period in the London  interbank  market. A certificate of
Lender  delivered to Borrower setting forth any amount or amounts that Lender is
entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

     (iii) Borrower shall have not more than 5 LIBOR Rate Loans in effect at any
given time.  Borrower only may exercise the LIBOR Option for LIBOR Rate Loans of
at least $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof.



                                       41
<PAGE>

     (c)  Prepayments.  Borrower  may  prepay  LIBOR  Rate  Loans  at any  time;
provided,  however,  that in the event that LIBOR Rate Loans are  prepaid on any
date  that  is not the  last  day of the  Interest  Period  applicable  thereto,
including  as  a  result  of  any  automatic  prepayment  through  the  required
application  by Lender of proceeds of  Collections  in  accordance  with Section
2.4(b) or for any other reason,  including early termination of the term of this
Agreement  or  acceleration  of the  Obligations  pursuant to the terms  hereof,
Borrower shall indemnify,  defend, and hold Lender and its Participants harmless
against any and all Funding Losses in accordance with clause (b)(ii) above.

     (d) Special Provisions Applicable to LIBOR Rate.

          (i) The LIBOR Rate may be adjusted by Lender on a prospective basis to
     take  into  account  any  additional  or  increased   costs  to  Lender  of
     maintaining or obtaining any eurodollar  deposits or increased costs due to
     changes in applicable law occurring  subsequent to the  commencement of the
     then  applicable  Interest  Period,  including  changes in tax laws (except
     changes of general  applicability in corporate income tax laws) and changes
     in the  reserve  requirements  imposed  by the  Board of  Governors  of the
     Federal   Reserve  System  (or  any   successor),   excluding  the  Reserve
     Percentage,  which additional or increased costs would increase the cost of
     funding loans bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate. In any such event, Lender
     shall give Borrower notice of such a determination and adjustment and, upon
     its receipt of the notice from  Lender,  Borrower  may, by notice to Lender
     (y) require  Lender to furnish to Borrower a  statement  setting  forth the
     basis for  adjusting  such LIBOR Rate and the  method for  determining  the
     amount of such  adjustment,  or (z) repay the LIBOR Rate Loans with respect
     to which such  adjustment  is made  (together  with any  amounts  due under
     clause (b)(ii) above).

          (ii) In the event  that any  change in market  conditions  or any law,
     regulation,  treaty,  or  directive,  or  any  change  therein  or  in  the
     interpretation  of  application  thereof,  shall at any time after the date
     hereof,  in  the  reasonable  opinion  of  Lender,   make  it  unlawful  or
     impractical  for Lender to fund or maintain  LIBOR  Advances or to continue
     such funding or  maintaining,  or to determine or charge  interest rates at
     the LIBOR Rate,  Lender shall give notice of such changed  circumstances to
     Borrower and (y) in the case of any LIBOR Rate Loans that are  outstanding,
     the date specified in Lender's notice shall be deemed to be the last day of
     the Interest  Period of such LIBOR Rate Loans,  and interest upon the LIBOR
     Rate Loans  thereafter shall accrue interest at the rate then applicable to
     Base Rate Loans,  and (z) Borrower shall not be entitled to elect the LIBOR
     Option  until  Lender  determines  that it would no longer be  unlawful  or
     impractical to do so.



                                       42
<PAGE>

     (e) No Requirement of Matched Funding.  Anything to the contrary  contained
herein notwithstanding, neither Lender, nor any of its Participants, is required
actually  to acquire  eurodollar  deposits to fund or  otherwise  match fund any
Obligation as to which  interest  accrues at the LIBOR Rate.  The  provisions of
this Section shall apply as if Lender or its  Participants  had match funded any
Obligation  as to which  interest  is  accruing  at the LIBOR Rate by  acquiring
eurodollar  deposits  for each  Interest  Period in the amount of the LIBOR Rate
Loans.

     2.14 Capital  Requirements.  If, after the date hereof,  Lender  reasonably
determines  that (i) the adoption of or change in any law,  rule,  regulation or
guideline regarding capital requirements for banks or bank holding companies, or
any change in the  interpretation  or  application  thereof by any  Governmental
Authority charged with the administration  thereof, or (ii) compliance by Lender
or its parent bank holding company with any guideline,  request, or directive of
any such entity regarding  capital adequacy  (whether or not having the force of
law),  the effect of reducing the return on Lender's or such  holding  company's
capital as a consequence of Lender's obligations hereunder to a level below that
which Lender or such holding  company could have achieved but for such adoption,
change,  or  compliance  (taking  into  consideration  Lender's or such  holding
company's then existing  policies with respect to capital  adequacy and assuming
the full utilization of such entity's  capital) by any amount  reasonably deemed
by Lender to be material,  then Lender may notify  Borrower  thereof.  Following
receipt of such  notice,  Borrower  agrees to pay Lender on demand the amount of
such  reduction of return of capital as and when such  reduction is  determined,
payable within 90 days after presentation by Lender of a statement in the amount
and setting  forth in reasonable  detail  Lender's  calculation  thereof and the
assumptions  upon which such  calculation  was based (which  statement  shall be
deemed true and correct absent  manifest  error).  In  determining  such amount,
Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

hereunder)  is subject  to the  fulfillment,  on or before  the date  applicable

<PAGE>

     (c) no injunction,  writ,  restraining  order, or other order of any nature
prohibiting,  directly or  indirectly,  the  extending of such credit shall have
been issued and remain in force by any Governmental  Authority against Borrower,
Lender, or any of their Affiliates.

     (d) no Material Adverse Change shall have occurred.

     3.4 Term.  This  Agreement  shall become  effective  upon the execution and
delivery  hereof by  Borrower  and Lender and shall  continue  in full force and
effect  for a term  ending on  February  23,  2005 (the  "Maturity  Date").  The
foregoing  notwithstanding,  Lender  shall  have  the  right  to  terminate  its
obligations  under  this  Agreement  immediately  and  without  notice  upon the
occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default.

     3.5 Effect of  Termination.  On the date of termination of this  Agreement,
all Obligations (including contingent reimbursement obligations of Borrower with
respect  to  outstanding  Letters of Credit)  immediately  shall  become due and
payable  without notice or demand.  No termination of this  Agreement,  however,
shall  relieve or discharge  Borrower of its duties,  Obligations,  or covenants
hereunder and the Lender's Liens in the Collateral  shall remain in effect until
all Obligations have been fully and finally discharged and Lender's  obligations
to provide additional credit hereunder have been terminated. When this Agreement
has been  terminated  and all of the  Obligations  have been  fully and  finally
discharged and Lender's  obligations to provide additional credit under the Loan
Documents  have been  terminated  irrevocably,  Lender will, at Borrower's  sole
expense,  execute and deliver any UCC  termination  statements,  lien  releases,
mortgage  releases,   re-assignments  of  trademarks,   discharges  of  security
interests, and other similar discharge or release documents (and, if applicable,
in  recordable  form) as are  necessary to release,  as of record,  the Lender's
Liens and all notices of security interests and liens previously filed by Lender
with respect to the Obligations.

     3.6 Early  Termination  by Borrower.  Borrower has the option,  at any time
upon 90 days prior  written  notice to Lender,  to terminate  this  Agreement by
paying to Lender,  in immediately  available funds,  the Obligations  (including
either (a) providing cash  collateral to be held by Lender in an amount equal to
105% of the then extant  Letter of Credit  Usage,  or (b)  causing the  original
Letters  of  Credit  to be  returned  to  Lender),  in full,  together  with the
Applicable   Prepayment  Premium;   provided,   however,  that  such  Applicable
Prepayment Premium (i) shall be reduced to zero if the Obligations are repaid in
full and this  Agreement  is  terminated  as a direct  result  of a  refinancing
provided by Wells Fargo at any time  subsequent to the first  anniversary of the
Closing Date, and (ii) shall be reduced by 50% if the  Obligations are repaid in
full and this Agreement is terminated as a direct result of the  consummation of
an  initial  public  offering  of  Borrower's  stock,  a  private  placement  of
Borrower's  stock or subordinated  debt, or a sale (other than a sale that takes
place as a consequence of a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceeding or an
Insolvency  Proceeding)  in of all or  substantially  all the stock or assets of
Borrower.  If  Borrower  has  sent  a  notice  of  termination  pursuant  to the
provisions of this Section, then Lender's obligations to extend credit hereunder
shall  terminate  and  Borrower  shall be  obligated  to repay  the  Obligations

(including  either  (i)  providing  cash  collateral  to be held by Lender in an
amount equal to 105% of the then extant Letter of Credit Usage,  or (ii) causing
the original Letters of Credit to be returned to Lender), in full, together with
the  Applicable  Prepayment  Premium,  on the  date  set  forth  as the  date of
termination of this Agreement in such notice. In the event of the termination of

damages  to  Lender  or  profits  lost by  Lender  as a  result  of  such  early
termination,  and  by  mutual  agreement  of  the  parties  as  to a  reasonable
estimation and  calculation  of the lost profits or damages of Lender,  Borrower
shall pay the Applicable  Prepayment Premium to Lender,  measured as of the date

4. CREATION OF SECURITY INTEREST.

     4.1  Grant  of  Security  Interest.  Borrower  hereby  grants  to  Lender a
continuing  security  interest in all of its right,  title,  and interest in all
currently   existing  and  hereafter   acquired  or  arising  Personal  Property
Collateral in order to secure prompt repayment of any and all of the Obligations
in accordance  with the terms and  conditions of the Loan Documents and in order
to secure  prompt  performance  by Borrower of each of its  covenants and duties
under the Loan  Documents.  The Lender's  Liens in and to the Personal  Property
Collateral shall attach to all Personal Property  Collateral without further act
on the part of Lender or Borrower.  Anything  contained in this Agreement or any
other Loan  Document  to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  except for Asset Sales
permitted  under  Section  7.4 of this  Agreement,  Borrower  has no  authority,
express or implied, to dispose of any item or portion of the Collateral.

     4.2  Negotiable  Collateral.  In the event that any  Collateral,  including
proceeds,  is evidenced by or consists of Negotiable  Collateral,  and if and to
the extent  that  perfection  or  priority  of  Lender's  security  interest  is
dependent on or enhanced by possession,  Borrower,  immediately upon the request
of Lender,  shall endorse and deliver  physical  possession  of such  Negotiable
Collateral to Lender.

     4.3 Collection of Accounts, General Intangibles, and Negotiable Collateral.
At any time after the  occurrence  and during  the  continuation  of an Event of
Default,  Lender or Lender's designee may (a) notify Account Debtors of Borrower
that the Accounts,  chattel paper, or General  Intangibles have been assigned to
Lender or that  Lender has a  security  interest  therein,  or (b)  collect  the
Accounts,  chattel  paper,  or  General  Intangibles  directly  and  charge  the
collection costs and expenses to the Loan Account.  Borrower agrees that it will
hold in trust for Lender, as Lender's trustee,  any Collections that it receives
and immediately  will deliver said  Collections to Lender in their original form
as received by Borrower.

     4.4 Delivery of  Additional  Documentation  Required.  At any time upon the
request of Lender,  Borrower  shall  execute and deliver to Lender,  any and all
financing  statements,  original  financing  statements in lieu of  continuation
statements,   fixture  filings,  security  agreements,   pledges,   assignments,
endorsements of certificates of title,  and all other documents (the "Additional
Documents")  that Lender may request in its  Permitted  Discretion,  in form and
substance  satisfactory to Lender,  to perfect and continue  perfected or better
perfect the  Lender's  Liens in the  Collateral  (whether now owned or hereafter
arising or acquired), to create and perfect Liens in favor of Lender in any Real
Property  acquired after the Closing Date, and in order to fully  consummate all
of the transactions  contemplated hereby and under the other Loan Documents.  To
the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,  Borrower  authorizes  Lender to
execute any such Additional  Documents in Borrower's name and authorizes  Lender
to file such executed Additional  Documents in any appropriate filing office. In
addition,  on such periodic basis as Lender shall reasonably  require,  Borrower
shall (a) provide Lender with a report of all new patentable,  copyrightable, or
trademarkable  materials  acquired or  generated  by  Borrower  during the prior
period, (b) cause all patents,  copyrights, and trademarks acquired or generated
by  Borrower  that  are not  already  the  subject  of a  registration  with the
appropriate filing office (or an application therefor diligently  prosecuted) to
be registered  with such  appropriate  filing  office in a manner  sufficient to
impart constructive notice of Borrower's  ownership thereof, and (c) cause to be
prepared,  executed,  and  delivered  to Lender  supplemental  schedules  to the
applicable Loan Documents to identify such patents,  copyrights,  and trademarks
as being subject to the security interests created thereunder.

     4.5 Power of Attorney. Borrower hereby irrevocably makes, constitutes,  and
appoints Lender (and any of Lender's officers,  employees,  or agents designated
by Lender) as Borrower's true and lawful attorney, with power to (a) if Borrower
refuses  to,  or fails  timely  to  execute  and  deliver  any of the  documents
described  in Section  4.4,  sign the name of Borrower  on any of the  documents
described  in Section 4.4, (b) at any time that an Event of Default has occurred
and is  continuing,  sign  Borrower's  name on any  invoice  or  bill of  lading
relating  to the  Collateral,  drafts  against  Account  Debtors,  or notices to
Account Debtors, (c) after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, send requests for verification of Accounts, (d) after the occurrence
and during the  continuance of an Event of Default,  endorse  Borrower's name on

an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, make, settle, and adjust all
claims under Borrower's  policies of insurance and make all  determinations  and
decisions  with respect to such policies of insurance,  and (f) at any time that
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,  settle and adjust  disputes
and claims  respecting  the  Accounts,  chattel  paper,  or General  Intangibles
directly with Account Debtors, for amounts and upon terms that Lender determines
to be  reasonable,  and  Lender  may  cause to be  executed  and  delivered  any
documents and releases that Lender  determines to be necessary.  The appointment
of Lender as  Borrower's  attorney,  and each and  every one of its  rights  and
powers,  being  coupled  with  an  interest,  is  irrevocable  until  all of the
Obligations  have been fully and  finally  repaid  and  performed  and  Lender's
obligations to extend credit hereunder are terminated.

of, or any other matter relating to, the Collateral.

10 days) and that any loss payable  thereunder shall be payable to Lender as its
interest may appear notwithstanding any act or omission of Borrower which might,
absent  such  agreement,  result  in a  forfeiture  of  all or a  part  of  such
insurance. Borrower shall deliver to Lender certified copies of such policies of
insurance and evidence of the payment of all premiums therefor.

     insurance).

          payable under any such insurance  policies and receive from Lender any
          monies  Lender has  received  as  payment  for any loss under any such
          policies  where  (1) the  amount of such loss is less than or equal to
          $1,000,000, (2) the amount of such loss is greater than $1,000,000 but

          loss is less than or equal to the amount of such loss; and

          adjustments, and shall have the option to apply any monies received as
          payment for any loss under any such policies  either to the prepayment
          of the  Obligations  or to  the  cost  of  repairs,  replacements,  or
          restorations of the damaged or destroyed  property by disbursing funds
          to Borrower in accordance with the terms of Section 6.8(e).

          (iii)Any monies Lender receives as payment for any loss under any such
     insurance  policy in excess of the amount of the Obligations on the date of
     such payment shall be distributed promptly to Borrower.

     (e) Borrower  acknowledges  and agrees that Lender shall have no obligation
to disburse any insurance  proceeds  received by Lender following the occurrence
of a casualty loss to Borrower for the repair,  replacement,  or  restoration of
the items of property damaged or destroyed unless (i) Lender shall have received

"Restoration   Plan"),  and  (ii)  the  following  conditions  shall  have  been
satisfied:  (A) no  Default  or Event of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
continuing or result from any such Advance or disbursement of monies received as

such repair,  replacement,  or restoration,  (C) Lender is reasonably  satisfied
that the amount of such  cash,  Cash  Equivalents,  Availability,  or  insurance
proceeds will be sufficient  fully to repair,  replace,  or restore the affected
assets,  (D)  completion  of the  repair,  replacement,  or  restoration  of the
affected assets is to be completed in accordance with the Restoration  Plan, (E)
completion of the repair,  replacement,  or  restoration  shall be effected with
reasonable promptness and shall be of a value (the "Replaced Value") that is (1)
at least equal to the replacement  value (the  "Destroyed  Value") of the assets
destroyed prior to such  destruction,  or (2) of a value less than the Destroyed
Value so long as the  difference  between the  Destroyed  Value and the Replaced
Value is applied to the prepayment of the Obligations  without premium,  and (F)
all monies  paid by  Borrower  to Lender may be  commingled  with other funds of
Lender and will not bear interest pending disbursement hereunder.

     (f) Borrower  will not take out separate  insurance  concurrent  in form or
contributing in the event of loss with that required to be maintained under this
Section 6.8,  unless  Lender is included  thereon as named insured with the loss
payable to Lender under a lender's loss payable  endorsement or its  equivalent.

whether now owned or  hereafter  acquired,  or any income or profits  therefrom,
except as to Subsidiaries other than Peninsula Gaming Corporation, for Permitted
Liens  (including  Liens that are  replacements of Permitted Liens to the extent
that the original Indebtedness is refinanced,  renewed, or extended under clause
(i) of the definition of "Permitted Indebtedness" and so long as the replacement
Liens only  encumber  those  assets that  secured the  refinanced,  renewed,  or
extended Indebtedness).

consolidation,  reorganization, or recapitalization, or reclassify its Stock, or

     surviving Person;

          (ii)  immediately  after giving  effect to such  transaction  on a pro
     forma basis, no Default or Event of Default exists;

          (iii) such  transaction  would not result in the loss or suspension or
     material  impairment of any Gaming License unless a comparable  replacement
     Gaming  License is  effective  prior to or  simultaneously  with such loss,
     suspension, or material impairment;

          (iv) (i) Borrower has  Consolidated Net Worth  (immediately  after the
     transaction but prior to any purchase accounting adjustments resulting from
     the  transaction)  equal to or greater than the  Consolidated  Net Worth of
     Borrower immediately  preceding such transaction,  and (ii) Borrower had an
     Interest  Coverage  Ratio of not less than  2.0:1.0 for the period from the
     date  hereof  to,  but  not  including,   January  1,  2003,  and  2.25:1.0

     fiscal  quarters for which  internal  financial  statements  are  available
     immediately  preceding  the date of such  transaction  and after giving pro
     forma effect thereto as if such  transaction  had occurred at the beginning
     of the applicable four-quarter period; and

          (v) Borrower or such Restricted  Subsidiary,  as applicable,  prior to
     the  consummation  of any proposed  transaction,  shall deliver to Lender a

     applicable,  to the foregoing effect,  an opinion of counsel,  stating that
     all conditions  precedent to the proposed  transaction  provided for herein
     have been complied with and a written  statement from a firm of independent
     public   accountants  of   established   national   reputation   reasonably
     satisfactory  to Lender that the  proposed  transaction  complies  with the
     foregoing clause (iv).

     (b) Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary may sell, transfer, assign, lease
or otherwise dispose of its assets in a transaction that is permitted by Section
7.4; and

     (c) Any  Restricted  Subsidiary  may  liquidate  or  dissolve  if  Borrower
determines in good faith that such  liquidation  or  dissolution  is in the best
interests of Borrower and is not materially disadvantageous to Lender.

     7.4 Ownership and Disposal of Assets

     (a) Make any  sale,  lease,  exchange,  or other  disposition,  in one or a
series of related transactions,  of all or any portion of the assets of Borrower

     (other than an Asset Sale that is a consequence of an Event of Loss);

          (iii) Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable,  receives
     75% of the consideration for such Asset Sale (other than an Asset Sale that
     is a  consequence  of an  Event  of  Loss)  in the  form  of  cash  or Cash

     requirements of Section 6.8(d) hereof;

     (c) Pending the final  application of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale in
accordance  with Section  7.4(b),  Borrower shall apply such Net Proceeds to the
outstanding Obligations or retain such Net Proceeds, in each case, in accordance
with the terms hereof.

subordinate  in right of payment to such  guarantee of the  Obligations on terms
and conditions  reasonably  satisfactory to Lender, (c) guarantees  constituting

extent in any line or lines of business  activity other than that which,  in the
reasonable  good  faith  judgment  of the  Managers  of  Borrower,  is a Related

     (a) Except in connection with a refinancing  permitted by clause (i) of the
definition of Permitted Indebtedness,  except as may be necessary to comply with

     the period (taken as one accounting period) from the beginning of the first
     fiscal quarter commencing  immediately after the Closing Date to the end of
     Borrower's  then most  recently  ended  fiscal  quarter for which  internal
     financial statements are available (or, if such Consolidated Net Income for
     such  period is a deficit,  100% of such  deficit),  plus,  (2) 100% of the
     aggregate net cash proceeds (or of the net cash proceeds  received upon the

     to, but not including,  January 1, 2003, and 2.25:1.0  thereafter,  in each
     case,  determined on a pro forma basis, as if such Investment had been made
     at the beginning of such four-quarter period;

          (ii) no Event of Default  shall have occurred and be continuing at the
     time such Investment is made or would occur as a consequence thereof; and

     Investments  that are not  Permitted  Investments  and are made pursuant to
     this Section  7.13(b) and all dividends  made  pursuant to Section  7.11(j)
     after the Closing Date, is less than the sum of (1) 50% of the Consolidated
     Net Income of Borrower for the period (taken as one accounting period) from
     the beginning of the first fiscal quarter commencing  immediately after the
     Closing  Date to the end of  Borrower's  then most  recently  ended  fiscal
     quarter for which internal financial  statements are available (or, if such
     Consolidated  Net  Income  for  such  period  is a  deficit,  100%  of such
     deficit),  plus, (2) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds (or of the net

          such transactions are conducted in good faith and on terms that are no
          less favorable to Borrower or the relevant Restricted  Subsidiary than
          those that would have been  obtained in a  comparable  transaction  at
          such time by Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary on an arm's-length
          basis  from a Person  that is not an  Affiliate  of  Borrower  or such
          Restricted  Subsidiary and (B) prior to entering into such transaction
          Borrower shall have delivered to Lender a certificate  from an officer
          of Borrower certifying to such effect;

               (ii) Affiliate  Transactions  entered into in the ordinary course

          and on terms that are no less  favorable  to Borrower or the  relevant
          Restricted  Subsidiary  than those that would have been  obtained in a
          comparable  transaction  at such time by Borrower  or such  Restricted
          Subsidiary  on an  arm's-length  basis  from a  Person  that is not an

          entering into such transaction Borrower shall have delivered to Lender
          a certificate  from an officer of Borrower  certifying to such effect;
          or

               (iii) Affiliate  Transactions entered into in the ordinary course

          firm of national standing.

     7.22 Permitted Tax Distributions.

     (a) Notwithstanding  Section 7.11, Borrower, at its option, may declare and
pay Permitted Tax Distributions to its Members;  provided,  that (i) no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of any such  Permitted
Tax  Distribution  or would result  therefrom,  (ii) prior to the payment of any
such  Permitted  Tax   Distribution,   Borrower  shall  provide  Lender  with  a
certificate  from an officer of Borrower and an opinion of counsel to the effect
that Borrower and each Subsidiary of Borrower in respect of which such Permitted
Tax Distributions  are being made,  qualify as Flow Through Entities for federal
income tax  purposes  and for the states in respect of which such  distributions
are being made,  and (iii) at the time of any such  Permitted Tax  Distribution,
the most recent  audited  financial  statements  of Borrower  provided to Lender
pursuant to Section 6.3 provide  that  Borrower  and each such  Subsidiary  were
treated as Flow Through Entities for the period of such financial statements.

     (b) Estimated tax distributions  shall be made within thirty days following
March 15, May 15,  August  15, and  December  15 based upon an  estimate  of the
excess  of (x) the tax  distributions  that  would  be  payable  for the  period
beginning  on January 1 of such year and ending on March 15, May 15,  August 15,
and December 15 if such period were a taxable year (computed as provided  above)
over (y)  distributions  attributable  to all prior periods  during such taxable
year. The excess of the Permitted Tax  Distributions for a taxable year over the
amounts previously distributed as estimated tax distributions may be distributed
to Equity Holders within thirty days of the date on which Borrower has filed its
federal income tax return with respect to such taxable years. To the extent that
the estimated tax  distributions  previously paid to an Equity Holder in respect
of any taxable year are greater than the  Permitted Tax  Distributions  for such
year,  such excess  shall be treated for all  purposes of this  Agreement  as if
distributed as an estimated tax  distribution on March 15 of the next succeeding
year for the purpose of determining  amounts permitted to be distributed in such
succeeding taxable year.

     (c) The amount of the  Permitted  Tax  Distributions  shall be  re-computed
promptly after (i) the filing by Borrower of its annual tax return, and (ii) the
appropriate Federal or state taxing authority finally determines that the amount
of the items of taxable  income,  gain,  deduction,  or loss of  Borrower  which
affected the calculation of the Permitted Tax  Distributions for any year should
be changed or adjusted,  including the determination  that Borrower or any other
entity is not a Flow Through Entity (a "Tax Calculation Event"). In the event of
a Tax  Calculation  Event,  the amount by which the



                                       72
<PAGE>

Permitted Tax Distributions  would have been reduced had they been calculated in
accordance with the Tax Calculation Event (an  "Overdistribution")  shall offset
the  amounts  permitted  to be  distributed  through  the  next  two  successive
estimated tax payment dates (and such amounts  permitted to be distributed shall
be, for purposes of this Agreement,  treated as if distributed to Equity Holders
and used to repay the  Overdistribution).  If the amount of any Overdistribution
has not been repaid in full by the end of the second  estimated tax payment date
following  the Tax  Calculation  Event,  Borrower  will use its best  efforts to
collect  the  remaining  Overdistribution  Amount  from the Equity  Holders.  If
following  a Tax  Calculation  Event,  the  amount  by which the  Permitted  Tax
Distributions  would have been increased had they been  calculated in accordance
with the Tax  Calculation  Event (an  "Underdistribution"),  the  amount of such
Underdistribution  shall be  distributed to Equity Holders within 90 days of the
date of the Tax Calculation Event.

     (d) Prior to making any estimated tax distribution,  Borrower shall require
each Equity Holder to agree to make any payment  required under Section  7.22(c)
hereof.

     (e) To the extent that any tax distribution  would otherwise be made to any
Equity  Holder  at a time when an  obligation  of such  Equity  Holder to make a
payment to Borrower pursuant to Section 7.22(c) remains outstanding,  the amount
of any tax  distribution  to be made shall be reduced by the amounts such Equity
Holder is obligated to pay Borrower.

     7.23  Restrictions  on Sale and Issuance of  Subsidiary  Stock.  Sell,  nor
permit  any  Restricted  Subsidiary  to issue or sell,  any  Stock  (other  than
directors"  qualifying shares) of any Restricted  Subsidiary to any Person other
than Borrower or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Borrower;  provided, that Borrower
and its  Restricted  Subsidiaries  may sell all (but not less  than  all) of the
capital Stock of a Restricted  Subsidiary  owned by Borrower and its  Restricted
Subsidiaries  if the Net  Proceeds  from such Asset Sale are used in  accordance
with the terms of Section 7.4 hereof.

     7.24 Membership Interests.  Authorize or issue certificates  evidencing the
membership interests in Borrower.

     7.25 Limitation on Restricted Subsidiary Dividends. Directly or indirectly,
create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any encumbrance
or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

     (a) pay dividends or make any other distributions to Borrower or any of its
Restricted  Subsidiaries  (i) on such Restricted  Subsidiary's  capital Stock or
(ii) with  respect to any other  interest or  participation  in, or measured by,
such Restricted Subsidiary's profits, or

     (b)  pay  any  Indebtedness  owed  to  Borrower  or any  of its  Restricted
Subsidiaries, or

     (d)  transfer  any of  its  assets  to  Borrower  or any of its  Restricted
Subsidiaries,

except,  with respect to clauses (a) through (d) above, for such encumbrances or
restrictions existing under or by reason of:

          (i) this Agreement or the other Loan Documents;

          (ii) the Senior Note Documents;

          (iii) applicable law;

          (iv) Acquired Debt; provided,  that such encumbrances and restrictions
     are not  applicable  to any  Person,  or the  properties  or  assets of any
     Person,  other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so
     acquired;

          (v) customary non-assignment and net worth provisions of any contract,

          (vii) the agreements  governing  permitted  refinancing  Indebtedness;
     provided,  that such restrictions contained in any agreement governing such
     refinancing  Indebtedness  are no more  restrictive than those contained in
     any agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced; and

          (viii)  any  restrictions  with  respect  to a  Restricted  Subsidiary
     imposed pursuant to a binding  agreement that has been entered into for the

     the Equity Interests or assets of such Restricted  Subsidiary being sold or
     otherwise disposed.

8. EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

     Any one or more of the  following  events  shall  constitute  an  event  of
default (each, an "Event of Default") under this Agreement:

     8.1 If Borrower fails to pay when due and payable, or when declared due and
payable, all or any portion of the Obligations  (whether of principal,  interest
(including any interest  which,  but for the provisions of the Bankruptcy  Code,
would have accrued on such amounts), fees and charges due Lender,  reimbursement
of  Lender  Expenses,  or other



                                       74
<PAGE>

amounts  constituting  Obligations);  provided,  however,  that  in the  case of
Overadvances  that are  caused by the  charging  of  interest,  fees,  or Lender
Expenses  to the Loan  Account,  such  event  shall not  constitute  an Event of
Default if, within 3 Business Days of Borrower's  receipt of telephonic or other
notice of such Overadvance, Borrower eliminates such Overadvance;

     8.2 If Borrower  fails or neglects  to  perform,  keep,  or observe (a) any
term, provision,  condition,  covenant, or agreement:  (i) contained in Sections

this  Agreement and such failure  continues for a period of 15 Business Days; or
(b) any other term,  provision,  condition,  covenant, or agreement contained in
this Agreement or any material term, provision, condition, covenant or agreement
contained  in any of the  other  Loan  Documents  (giving  effect  to any  grace
periods,  cure periods,  or required notices,  if any, expressly provided for in
such  other  Loan  Documents;  in each  case,  other  than any term,  provision,
condition,  covenant,  or agreement that is the subject of another  provision of
this


                                       75
<PAGE>

Section 8, in which event such other  provision of this Section 8 shall govern);
provided,  that,  during any period of time that any such  failure or neglect of
Borrower referred to in this Section 8.2 exists, even if such failure or neglect
is not yet an Event of  Default  by virtue of the  existence  of a grace or cure
period or the  pre-condition  of the  giving of a  notice,  Lender  shall not be
required to make Advances (or otherwise extend credit) hereunder;

     8.3 If any  material  portion  of  Borrower's  or any of its  Subsidiaries'
assets is  attached,  seized,  subjected to a writ or distress  warrant,  levied
upon, or comes into the possession of any third Person;

     8.4 If an  Insolvency  Proceeding  is  commenced  by Borrower or any of its

(b)  the  petition   commencing   the   Insolvency   Proceeding  is  not  timely
controverted,  (c) the petition  commencing  the  Insolvency  Proceeding  is not
dismissed  within 60 calendar days of the date of the filing thereof;  provided,
however,  that, during the pendency of such period,  Lender shall be relieved of
its obligations to extend credit hereunder,  (d) an interim trustee is appointed
to take possession of all or any substantial portion of the properties or assets
of, or to operate all or any substantial portion of the business of, Borrower or
any of its  Subsidiaries,  or (e) an order for relief  shall  have been  entered
therein;

     8.6 If Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is enjoined,  restrained,  or in
any way prevented by court order from  continuing to conduct all or any material
part of the business affairs of Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  taken as a whole
for a period of 5 consecutive Business Days;

     8.7 If (a) a notice of Lien,  levy,  or  assessment is filed of record with

entities becomes a Lien, whether choate or otherwise,  upon Borrower's or any of
its  Subsidiaries'  properties or assets and the same is not paid on the payment
date thereof  (provided,  however,  that, if such Lien secures an amount that is
less than  $50,000  and if Lender is able to create and  maintain a reserve  for
such Lien in an amount  equal to 150  percent of the  obligation  that such Lien
secures  (which  Borrower  hereby  expressly  authorizes  Lender to do)  without
creating  an  Overadvance,  then such  Lien  shall  not  constitute  an Event of
Default), or (b) notices of Lien, levy, or assessment




                                       76
<PAGE>

in an aggregate  amount in excess of $5,000,000 are filed of record with respect
to  Borrower's  or any of its  Subsidiaries'  properties or assets by any state,
county, municipal, or governmental agency, or if any taxes or debts owing at any
time hereafter to any one or more of such entities  becomes a Lien exceeding the
foregoing aggregate limitation,  whether choate or otherwise, upon Borrower's or
any of its  Subsidiaries'  properties  or assets and the same is not paid before
the  earlier  of 30 days  after the date it first  arises or 5 days prior to the
date on which such asset is subject to being forfeited;

     8.8 If a final  non-appealable  judgment  or  judgments  for the payment of
money  (other  than  judgments  as to which a  reputable  insurance  company has
accepted full liability) is or are entered by a court of competent  jurisdiction
against  Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries  and such  judgment  or  judgments
remain undischarged,  unbonded, or unstayed for a period of 60 days after entry;
provided, that the aggregate amount of all such judgments exceeds $5,000,000;

     8.9 If there is a default in any payment of Indebtedness  (beyond any grace
period) in any agreement to which Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
relative to Indebtedness  of Borrower or such Subsidiary  involving an aggregate
amount of $5,000,000  or more and such default (a) occurs at the final  maturity
of the  obligations  thereunder,  or (b)  results in a right by the other  party
thereto,  irrespective  of whether  exercised,  to  accelerate  the  maturity of
Borrower's  or its  Subsidiaries'  obligations  thereunder,  to  terminate  such
agreement, or to refuse to renew such agreement pursuant to an automatic renewal
right therein;

     8.10 If Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries makes any payment on account of
Indebtedness that has been contractually subordinated in right of payment to the
payment of the  Obligations,  except to the  extent  such  payment is  permitted
hereunder or by the terms of the  subordination  provisions  applicable  to such
Indebtedness;

     8.11 If any material misstatement or material  misrepresentation exists now
or  hereafter  in any  warranty,  representation,  statement,  or Record made to
Lender by Borrower,  its  Subsidiaries,  or any  officer,  employee,  agent,  or
director of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;

     8.12 If the  obligation of any Guarantor  under its guaranty or other third
Person under any Loan  Document is limited or  terminated by operation of law or
by the  Guarantor or other third  Person  thereunder,  or any such  Guarantor or
other third Person becomes the subject of an Insolvency Proceeding;

     8.13 If this Agreement or any other Loan Document that purports to create a
Lien, shall, for any reason,  fail or cease to create a valid and perfected and,
except to the extent  permitted by the terms hereof or thereof,  first  priority
Lien on or security interest in the Collateral covered hereby or thereby;



                                       77
<PAGE>

     8.14 Any provision of any Loan Document shall at any time for any reason be
declared to be null and void, or the validity or enforceability thereof shall be
contested by Borrower, or a proceeding shall be commenced by Borrower, or by any
Governmental  Authority having jurisdiction over Borrower,  seeking to establish
the invalidity or unenforceability thereof, or Borrower shall deny that Borrower
has any liability or obligation purported to be created under any Loan Document;

     8.15 If (i) there is an "Event of  Default"  under,  and as defined in, the
Indenture or (ii) there is a default  under the Lease that results in a right by
any party thereto (other than Borrower),  irrespective of whether exercised,  to
terminate  the  Lease or the Lease is not  renewed  or is  otherwise  terminated
(provided,  however,  that such termination or non-renewal of the Lease will not
constitute an Event of Default if such  termination or non-renewal will not have
a Material Adverse Change on Borrower and its business (due, for example, to the
prior  securing  of an  alternative  location  from  which  to  operate  with  a
substitute or alternative  lease on terms and conditions  satisfactory to Lender
in its Permitted Discretion);

     8.16 If, for a period of 5 consecutive  Business  Days,  Borrower  fails to
keep in full force and effect, suffers the termination,  revocation, forfeiture,
nonrenewal or  suspension  of, or suffers a material  adverse  amendment to, any
material  Gaming License,  franchise,  registration,  qualification,  finding of
suitability or other approval or  authorization  required to enable  Borrower to
own,  operate,  or otherwise  conduct or manage its  businesses,  including  the
riverboat,  dockside or land based gaming  activities at  Borrower's  Ice Harbor
Facility and any other location where Borrower conducts such business; or

     8.17 If, for a period of 5  consecutive  Business  Days,  any  Governmental
Authority terminates,  suspends,  amends, revokes, repeals or fails to renew any
law, license, franchise, registration,  qualification, finding of suitability or
other  approval  or  authorization  required  to enable  Borrower  or any of its
Subsidiaries  to own,  operate,  or otherwise  conduct or manage its businesses,
including the riverboat,  dockside or land-based gaming activities at Borrower's
Ice  Harbor  Facility  and any  other  location  where  Borrower  conducts  such
business.

9. LENDER'S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

     9.1 Rights and Remedies. Upon the occurrence,  and during the continuation,
of an Event of  Default,  Lender  (at its  election  but  without  notice of its
election  and without  demand) may do any one or more of the  following,  all of
which are authorized by Borrower:

     (a) Declare all Obligations, whether evidenced by this Agreement, by any of
the other Loan Documents, or otherwise, immediately due and payable;

     (b) Cease  advancing  money or  extending  credit to or for the  benefit of
Borrower under this  Agreement,  under any of the Loan  Documents,  or under any
other agreement between Borrower and Lender;



                                       78
<PAGE>

     (c) Terminate  this Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents as to any
future  liability or  obligation  of Lender,  but without  affecting  any of the
Lender's Liens in the Collateral and without affecting the Obligations;

     (d) Settle or adjust  disputes and claims directly with Account Debtors for
amounts  and upon terms which  Lender  considers  advisable,  and in such cases,
Lender will credit Borrower's Loan Account with only the net amounts received by
Lender in payment of such disputed  Accounts after deducting all Lender Expenses
incurred or expended in connection therewith;

     (e) Without  notice to or demand upon Borrower or any  Guarantor  make such
payments and do such acts as Lender considers necessary or reasonable to protect
its  security  interests  in the  Collateral.  Borrower  agrees to assemble  the
Personal  Property  Collateral  if Lender so requires,  and to make the Personal
Property  Collateral  available  to Lender at a place that Lender may  designate
which is reasonably  convenient to both parties.  Borrower  authorizes Lender to
enter the premises where the Personal  Property  Collateral is located,  to take
and maintain possession of the Personal Property Collateral,  or any part of it,
and to  pay,  purchase,  contest,  or  compromise  any  Lien  that  in  Lender's
determination  appears  to  conflict  with  the  Lender's  Liens  and to pay all
expenses incurred in connection  therewith and to charge Borrower's Loan Account
therefor.  With respect to any of Borrower's owned or leased premises,  Borrower
hereby grants Lender a license to enter into  possession of such premises and to
occupy the same,  without charge, in order to exercise any of Lender's rights or
remedies provided herein, at law, in equity, or otherwise;

     (f) Without notice to Borrower (such notice being  expressly  waived),  and
without  constituting  a  retention  of any  collateral  in  satisfaction  of an
obligation  (within  the  meaning  of  the  Code),  set  off  and  apply  to the
Obligations any and all (i) balances and deposits of Borrower held by Lender, or
(ii)  Indebtedness  at any time  owing to or for the  credit or the  account  of
Borrower held by Lender;

     (g) Hold, as cash collateral, any and all balances and deposits of Borrower
held by Lender to secure the full and final repayment of all of the Obligations;

     (h) Ship, reclaim,  recover, store, finish,  maintain,  repair, prepare for
sale,  advertise  for sale,  and sell (in the manner  provided  for  herein) the
Personal  Property  Collateral.  Borrower  hereby  grants to Lender a license or
other right to use,  without charge,  Borrower's  labels,  patents,  copyrights,
trade secrets, trade names,  trademarks,  service marks, and advertising matter,
or any property of a similar  nature,  as it pertains to the  Personal  Property
Collateral,  in completing  production of, advertising for sale, and selling any
Personal  Property  Collateral and Borrower's  rights under all licenses and all
franchise agreements shall inure to Lender's benefit;



                                       79
<PAGE>

     (i) Sell the  Personal  Property  Collateral  at either a public or private
sale, or both, by way of one or more contracts or  transactions,  for cash or on
terms,  in such manner and at such places  (including  Borrower's  premises)  as
Lender  determines is  commercially  reasonable.  It is not  necessary  that the
Personal Property Collateral be present at any such sale;

     (j) Lender shall give notice of the  disposition  of the Personal  Property
Collateral as follows:

          (i)  Lender  shall  give  Borrower a notice in writing of the time and
     place of  public  sale,  or, if the sale is a  private  sale or some  other
     disposition other than a public sale is to be made of the Personal Property
     Collateral,  then the  time on or after  which  the  private  sale or other
     disposition is to be made; and

          (ii) The notice  shall be  personally  delivered  or  mailed,  postage
     prepaid, to Borrower as provided in Section 12, at least 10 days before the
     earliest time of disposition set forth in the notice; no notice needs to be
     given  prior to the  disposition  of any portion of the  Personal  Property
     Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline  speedily in value or
     that is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market;

     (k) Lender may credit bid and purchase at any public sale; and

     (l)  Lender  may seek the  appointment  of a  receiver  or  keeper  to take
possession  of all or any portion of the  Collateral  or to operate same and, to
the maximum extent permitted by law, may seek the appointment of such a receiver
without the requirement of prior notice or a hearing;

     (m) Lender shall have all other rights and remedies  available at law or in
equity or pursuant to any other Loan Document;

     (n) Borrower agrees that, upon the occurrence of and during the continuance
of an Event of Default and at Lender's  request,  Borrower  will, and will cause
each Restricted Subsidiary of Borrower to (and, by its execution and delivery of
a Guaranty or a joinder  thereto,  each of  Borrower's  Restricted  Subsidiaries
agrees to),  immediately file such  applications for approval and shall take all
other and  further  actions  required  by Lender to  obtain  such  approvals  or
consents of regulatory  authorities  as are necessary to transfer  ownership and
control to Lender,  of the Gaming  Licenses  held by it, or its  interest in any
Person  holding  any such Gaming  License.  To enforce  the  provisions  of this
Section  9.1(n),  Lender is empowered to request the  appointment  of a receiver
from any court of competent  jurisdiction.  Such receiver shall be instructed to
seek from the applicable Gaming Authority an involuntary  transfer of control of
any Gaming  License  for the  purpose of seeking a bona fide  purchaser  to whom
control will ultimately be transferred. Borrower hereby agrees to authorize, and
to cause each  Restricted  Subsidiary  of Borrower  to  authorize  (and,  by its
execution  and  delivery of a Guaranty  or a joinder  thereto,  each  Restricted
Subsidiary of



                                       80
<PAGE>

Borrower agrees to authorize)  such an involuntary  transfer of control upon the
request of the  receiver so  appointed  and, if Borrower or any such  Restricted
Subsidiary shall refuse to authorize the transfer,  its approval may be required
by the  court.  Upon the  occurrence  and  continuance  of an Event of  Default,
Borrower  shall further use its  reasonable  best efforts to assist in obtaining
approval of the  applicable  Gaming  Authority,  if required,  for any action or
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement or the Loan  Documents,  including,
preparation,  execution,  and filing with the applicable Gaming Authority of the
assignor's  or  transferor's  portion of any  application  or  applications  for
consent to the assignment of any Gaming License or transfer of control necessary
or appropriate under the applicable Gaming Authority's rules and regulations for
approval  of the  transfer  or  assignment  of any  portion  of the  Collateral,
together with any Gaming License or other authorization.  Borrower  acknowledges
that the  assignment  or  transfer  of Gaming  Licenses  is integral to Lender's
realization of the value of the Collateral,  that there is no adequate remedy at
law for failure by Borrower to comply with the provisions of this Section 9.1(n)
and that such  failure  would not be  adequately  compensable  in  damages,  and
therefore  agrees that the  agreements  contained in this Section  9.1(n) may be
specifically enforced; and

     (o) Any deficiency that exists after  disposition of the Personal  Property
Collateral as provided above will be paid  immediately  by Borrower.  Any excess
will be returned,  without  interest and subject to the rights of third Persons,
by Lender to Borrower.

All right,  remedies,  and powers  provided  in this  Agreement  relative to the
Collateral  may be exercised  only to the extent that the exercise  thereof does
not violate any applicable  mandatory  provision of the applicable  gaming laws,
rules,  and  regulations   enacted  by  the  applicable  Gaming  Authority  (the
"Applicable  Gaming Laws") and all provisions of this Agreement  relative to the
Collateral are intended to be subject to all applicable  mandatory provisions of
the Applicable  Gaming Laws and to be limited solely to the extent  necessary to
not render the provisions of this Agreement invalid or  unenforceable,  in whole
or in part.  Lender will timely apply for and receive all required  approvals of
the  applicable  Gaming  Authority for the sale or other  disposition  of gaming
Equipment  regulated  by  Applicable  Gaming  Laws  (including  any such sale or
disposition  of gaming  Equipment  consisting of slot  machines,  gaming tables,
cards,  dice,  gaming  chips,  player  tracking  systems,  and all other "gaming
devices" (as such term or words of like import referring  thereto are defined in
the Applicable  Gaming Laws), and "associated  equipment" (as such term or words
of like import referring thereto are defined in the Applicable Gaming Laws).

     9.2  Remedies  Cumulative.  The rights and  remedies  of Lender  under this
Agreement,  the  other  Loan  Documents,  and  all  other  agreements  shall  be
cumulative.  Lender shall have all other  rights and  remedies not  inconsistent
herewith as provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. No exercise by Lender
of one right or remedy shall be deemed an  election,  and no waiver by Lender of
any Event of Default  shall be deemed a  continuing  waiver.  No delay by Lender
shall constitute a waiver, election, or acquiescence by it.



                                       81
<PAGE>

10. TAXES AND EXPENSES.

     If Borrower fails to pay any monies (whether taxes, assessments,  insurance
premiums, or, in the case of leased properties or assets, rents or other amounts
payable under such leases) due to third  Persons,  or fails to make any deposits
or furnish any required  proof of payment or deposit,  all as required under the
terms of this Agreement,  then, Lender, in its Permitted  Discretion and without
prior notice to Borrower or any  Guarantor,  may do any or all of the following:
(a) make payment of the same or any part  thereof,  (b) set up such  reserves in
Borrower's  Loan  Account as Lender deems  necessary to protect  Lender from the
exposure  created by such  failure,  or (c) in the case of the failure to comply
with  Section 6.8 hereof,  obtain and  maintain  insurance  policies of the type
described  in Section 6.8 and take any action with  respect to such  policies as
Lender deems prudent.  Any such amounts paid by Lender shall  constitute  Lender
Expenses and any such  payments  shall not  constitute an agreement by Lender to
make  similar  payments  in the  future  or a waiver  by  Lender of any Event of
Default  under this  Agreement.  Lender  need not  inquire as to, or contest the
validity  of,  any such  expense,  tax,  or Lien and the  receipt  of the  usual
official  notice for the payment  thereof shall be conclusive  evidence that the
same was validly due and owing.

11. WAIVERS; INDEMNIFICATION.

     11.1 Demand;  Protest.  Borrower waives demand, protest, notice of protest,
notice of default or dishonor,  notice of payment and nonpayment,  nonpayment at
maturity, release, compromise,  settlement,  extension, or renewal of documents,
instruments,  chattel paper,  and guarantees at any time held by Lender on which
Borrower may in any way be liable.

     11.2 Lender's Liability for Collateral. Borrower hereby agrees that (absent
any  gross  negligence  and  willful  misconduct  of Lender  while  Lender is in
possession  of  the  Collateral):  (a) so  long  as  Lender  complies  with  its
obligations,  if any,  under the Code,  Lender shall not in any way or manner be
liable or responsible for: (i) the safekeeping of the Collateral,  (ii) any loss
or damage thereto  occurring or arising in any manner or fashion from any cause,
(iii) any  diminution  in the value  thereof,  or (iv) any act or default of any
carrier,  warehouseman,  bailee, forwarding agency, or other Person, and (b) all
risk of  loss,  damage,  or  destruction  of the  Collateral  shall  be borne by
Borrower.

     11.3 Indemnification.  Borrower shall pay, indemnify,  defend, and hold the
Lender-Related Persons, each Participant, and each of their respective officers,
directors,  employees,  agents,  and  attorneys-in-fact  (each,  an "Indemnified
Person")  harmless (to the fullest extent permitted by law) from and against any
and all  claims,  demands,  suits,  actions,  investigations,  proceedings,  and
damages, and all reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements and other costs and
expenses  actually  incurred  in  connection  therewith  (as and  when  they are
incurred and  irrespective  of whether suit is  brought),  at any time  asserted
against, imposed upon, or incurred by any of them (a) in connection with or as a
result of or related to the execution,  delivery,  enforcement,  performance, or
administration  of this  Agreement,  any of the  other  Loan  Documents,  or the
transactions  contemplated  hereby  or  thereby,  and (b)  with  respect  to any
investigation,  litigation,  or proceeding related to this



                                       82
<PAGE>

Agreement,  any other Loan  Document,  or the use of the  proceeds of the credit
provided  hereunder  (irrespective of whether any Indemnified  Person is a party
thereto),  or any act,  omission,  event,  or circumstance in any manner related
thereto (all the foregoing,  collectively,  the "Indemnified Liabilities").  The
foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding,  Borrower shall have no obligation to
any  Indemnified  Person under this Section 11.3 with respect to any Indemnified
Liability  that a court of competent  jurisdiction  finally  determines  to have
resulted  from the gross  negligence or willful  misconduct of such  Indemnified
Person.  This provision  shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
repayment of the Obligations. If any Indemnified Person makes any payment to any
other  Indemnified  Person with respect to an Indemnified  Liability as to which
Borrower  was  required to  indemnify  the  Indemnified  Person  receiving  such
payment,   the  Indemnified  Person  making  such  payment  is  entitled  to  be
indemnified and reimbursed by Borrower with respect thereto. WITHOUT LIMITATION,
THE FOREGOING  INDEMNITY SHALL APPLY TO EACH INDEMNIFIED  PERSON WITH RESPECT TO
INDEMNIFIED  LIABILITIES WHICH IN WHOLE OR IN PART ARE CAUSED BY OR ARISE OUT OF
ANY NEGLIGENT ACT OR OMISSION OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED PERSON OR OF ANY OTHER PERSON.

12.   NOTICES.

AND  THEREOF,  AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES  HERETO AND THERETO WITH RESPECT TO

14. ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS; SUCCESSORS.

     14.1 Assignments and Participations.

     (a)  Lender  may  assign and  delegate  to one or more  assignees  (each an
"Assignee")  all, or any ratable part of all, of the  Obligations  and the other
rights and  obligations of Lender  hereunder and under the other Loan Documents;
provided,  however,  that Borrower may continue to deal solely and directly with
Lender in  connection  with the  interest so  assigned to an Assignee  until (i)
written  notice  of  such  assignment,   together  with  payment   instructions,
addresses, and related information with respect to the Assignee, have been given
to Borrower by Lender and the  Assignee,  and (ii) Lender and its Assignee  have
delivered  to Borrower  an  appropriate  assignment  and  acceptance  agreement.
Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Lender agrees for the
sole benefit of Borrower  that,  so long as no Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing,  Lender shall (x) retain at least 50.1 percent of the Obligations
and commitment to make Advances under Section 2.1 of this Agreement, and (y) not
assign any ratable part of the Obligations and commitment to make Advances under
Section 2.1 of this  Agreement  to more than three  Assignees at any given time,
provided,  however, that, the minimum retention of Obligations



                                       85
<PAGE>

and  commitment to make Advances and the  restriction on the number of Assignees
shall not be  applicable if such  assignment  is in connection  with any merger,
consolidation,  sale,  transfer,  or other disposition of all or any substantial
portion of the business or loan portfolio of Lender.

     (b) From and after the date that Lender provides Borrower with such written
notice and  executed  assignment  and  acceptance  agreement,  (i) the  Assignee
thereunder  shall  be a  party  hereto  and,  to  the  extent  that  rights  and
obligations  hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such  assignment and
acceptance  agreement,   shall  have  the  assigned  and  delegated  rights  and
obligations of Lender under the Loan  Documents,  and (ii) Lender shall,  to the
extent that rights and obligations  hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
have  been  assigned  and  delegated  by it  pursuant  to  such  assignment  and
acceptance agreement, relinquish its rights (except with respect to Section 11.3
hereof) and be released from its  obligations  under this  Agreement (and in the
case of an assignment  and acceptance  covering all or the remaining  portion of
Lender's  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  and the  other  Loan
Documents,  Lender  shall  cease to be a party  hereto  and  thereto),  and such
assignment shall affect a novation between Borrower and the Assignee.

     (c) Immediately upon Borrower's  receipt of such fully executed  assignment
and acceptance  agreement,  this Agreement  shall be deemed to be amended to the
extent,  but only to the  extent,  necessary  to  reflect  the  addition  of the
Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the rights and duties of Lender arising
therefrom.

     (d) Lender may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks,  financial
institutions,  or other Persons not Affiliates of such Lender (a  "Participant")
participating interests in the Obligations and the other rights and interests of
Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that (i)
Lender shall remain the  "Lender"  for all  purposes of this  Agreement  and the
other Loan Documents and the Participant receiving the participating interest in
the  Obligations  and the  other  rights  and  interests  of  Lender  shall  not
constitute a "Lender"  hereunder or under the other Loan  Documents and Lender's
obligations  under this  Agreement  shall  remain  unchanged,  (ii) Lender shall
remain  solely  responsible  for  the  performance  of such  obligations,  (iii)
Borrower and Lender shall  continue to deal solely and directly  with each other
in connection with Lender's rights and obligations  under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents,  (iv) Lender shall not transfer or grant any participating
interest under which the  Participant has the right to approve any amendment to,
or any consent or waiver  with  respect  to,  this  Agreement  or any other Loan
Document,  except to the extent  such  amendment  to, or consent or waiver  with
respect to this  Agreement  or of any other Loan  Document  would (A) extend the
final maturity date of the  Obligations  hereunder in which such  Participant is
participating,  (B) reduce  the  interest  rate  applicable  to the  Obligations
hereunder  in which such  Participant  is  participating,  (C)  release all or a
material portion of the Collateral or guaranties (except to the extent expressly
provided  herein or in any of the Loan  Documents)  supporting  the  Obligations
hereunder in which such Participant is  participating,  (D) postpone the payment
of, or reduce the amount of, the  interest or fees  payable to such  Participant
through  Lender,  or (E) change the amount or due dates of  scheduled  principal
repayments or



                                       86
<PAGE>

prepayments or premiums, and (v) all amounts payable by Borrower hereunder shall
be  determined  as if Lender had not sold such  participation,  except that,  if
amounts  outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been
declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default,  each  Participant  shall be  deemed to have the  right of  set-off  in
respect of its  participating  interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to
the same  extent  as if the  amount of its  participating  interest  were  owing
directly to it as Lender  under this  Agreement.  The rights of any  Participant
only shall be derivative through Lender and no Participant shall have any rights
under this  Agreement  or the other Loan  Documents  or any direct  rights as to
Borrower,  the  Collections,  the  Collateral,  or  otherwise  in respect of the
Obligations.  No Participant shall have the right to participate directly in the
making of decisions by Lender.

     (e) In connection  with any such  assignment or  participation  or proposed
assignment or participation, a Lender may disclose all documents and information
which it now or hereafter may have relating to Borrower or Borrower's business.

     (f) Any other  provision in this Agreement  notwithstanding,  Lender may at
any time  create a security  interest  in, or pledge,  all or any portion of its
rights under and interest in this Agreement in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank
in accordance  with  Regulation A of the Federal  Reserve Bank or U.S.  Treasury
Regulation  31 CFR  ss.203.14,  and such  Federal  Reserve Bank may enforce such
pledge or security  interest in any manner  permitted under  applicable law. The
foregoing to the contrary  notwithstanding,  no such pledge shall relieve Lender
from any of its obligations hereunder.

     14.2 Successors.  This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the
respective  successors  and assigns of each of the parties;  provided,  however,
that  Borrower may not assign this  Agreement or any rights or duties  hereunder
without  Lender's prior written consent and any prohibited  assignment  shall be
absolutely  void ab initio.  No consent to  assignment  by Lender shall  release
Borrower from its  Obligations.  Lender may assign this  Agreement and the other
Loan Documents and its rights and duties  hereunder and  thereunder  pursuant to
Section 14.1 hereof and, except as expressly  required  pursuant to Section 14.1
hereof,  no consent or approval by Borrower is required in  connection  with any
such assignment.

15. AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS.

     15.1  Amendments  and Waivers.  No amendment or waiver of any  provision of
this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document,  and no consent with respect to any
departure by Borrower therefrom,  shall be effective unless the same shall be in
writing  and  signed by Lender  (or,  if Lender  has  assigned  a portion of the
Obligations  hereunder pursuant to Section 14.1(a) hereof,  lenders holding more
than 50% of the outstanding  Obligations)  and Borrower and then any such waiver
or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which given.

     15.2 No Waivers;  Cumulative Remedies. No failure by Lender to exercise any
right,  remedy,  or option under this Agreement or any other Loan  Document,  or
delay by



                                       87
<PAGE>

Lender in exercising the same,  will operate as a waiver  thereof.  No waiver by
Lender will be  effective  unless it is in writing,  and then only to the extent
specifically  stated.  No  waiver  by Lender  on any  occasion  shall  affect or
diminish Lender's rights thereafter to require strict performance by Borrower of
any provision of this  Agreement.  Lender's  rights under this Agreement and the
other Loan  Documents will be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or
remedy that Lender may have.

16. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

     16.1  Effectiveness.  This Agreement shall be binding and deemed  effective
when executed by Borrower and Lender.

     16.2 Section Headings.  Headings and numbers have been set forth herein for
convenience  only.  Unless the contrary is compelled by the context,  everything
contained in each Section applies equally to this entire Agreement.

     16.3  Interpretation.   Neither  this  Agreement  nor  any  uncertainty  or
ambiguity  herein shall be construed  against Lender or Borrower,  whether under
any rule of construction or otherwise.  On the contrary, this Agreement has been
reviewed by all parties and shall be construed and interpreted  according to the
ordinary  meaning of the words used so as to accomplish  fairly the purposes and
intentions of all parties hereto.

     16.4 Severability of Provisions.  Each provision of this Agreement shall be
severable  from every  other  provision  of this  Agreement  for the  purpose of
determining the legal enforceability of any specific provision.

     16.5 Withholding  Taxes.  All payments made by Borrower  hereunder or under
any note will be made without setoff, counterclaim,  or other defense, except as
required by  applicable  law other than for Taxes (as defined  below).  All such
payments  will be made free and clear of, and without  deduction or  withholding
for, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts,  duties, fees, assessments or
other charges of whatever  nature now or hereafter  imposed by any  jurisdiction
(other  than the  United  States)  or by any  political  subdivision  or  taxing
authority  thereof or therein  (other than of the United States) with respect to
such  payments (but  excluding,  any tax imposed by any  jurisdiction  or by any
political  subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (i) measured by or
based on the net income or net  profits of  Lender,  or (ii) to the extent  that
such tax  results  from a change in the  circumstances  of Lender,  including  a
change in the residence,  place of organization,  or principal place of business
of Lender,  or a change in the branch or lending office of Lender  participating
in the  transactions  set forth herein) and all  interest,  penalties or similar
liabilities with respect thereto (all such non-excluded taxes, levies,  imposts,
duties,  fees,  assessments or other charges being referred to  collectively  as
"Taxes"). If any Taxes are so levied or imposed, Borrower agrees to pay the full
amount of such Taxes,  and such  additional  amounts as may be necessary so that
every  payment  of all  amounts  due  under  this  Agreement  or under any note,
including  any amount paid  pursuant to this Section 16.5 after  withholding  or
deduction  for or on  account  of any  Taxes,  will not be less than the  amount
provided for herein;  provided,  however, that Borrower shall not be required to
increase  any such  amounts  payable



                                       88
<PAGE>

to Lender if the  increase in such amount  payable  results  from  Lender's  own
willful  misconduct  or gross  negligence.  Borrower  will  furnish to Lender as
promptly as possible  after the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to
applicable  law  certified  copies of tax  receipts  evidencing  such payment by
Borrower.

     16.6 [Intentionally Omitted.]

     16.7 Counterparts;  Telefacsimile Execution. This Agreement may be executed
in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts,
each of which,  when executed and delivered,  shall be deemed to be an original,
and all of which,  when taken  together,  shall  constitute but one and the same
Agreement.   Delivery  of  an  executed   counterpart   of  this   Agreement  by
telefacsimile  shall be equally as effective as delivery of an original executed
counterpart of this Agreement.  Any party delivering an executed  counterpart of
this  Agreement  by  telefacsimile  also  shall  deliver  an  original  executed
counterpart  of this  Agreement but the failure to deliver an original  executed
counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and binding effect of
this Agreement.  The foregoing  shall apply to each other Loan Document  mutatis
mutandis.

     16.8 Revival and Reinstatement of Obligations. If the incurrence or payment
of the  Obligations by Borrower or any  Guarantor,  or the transfer to Lender of
any  property  should  for any reason  subsequently  be  declared  to be void or
voidable under any state or federal law relating to creditors' rights, including
provisions  of  the   Bankruptcy   Code  relating  to  fraudulent   conveyances,
preferences,  or other voidable or recoverable payments of money or transfers of
property  (collectively,  a "Voidable  Transfer"),  and if Lender is required to
repay or restore, in whole or in part, any such Voidable Transfer,  or elects to
do so upon the reasonable  advice of its counsel,  then, as to any such Voidable
Transfer,  or the amount  thereof  that Lender is required or elects to repay or
restore, and as to all reasonable costs,  expenses, and attorneys fees of Lender
related  thereto,  the  liability of Borrower and each  Guarantor  automatically
shall be  revived,  reinstated,  and  restored  and shall  exist as though  such
Voidable Transfer had never been made.

     16.9 Integration.  This Agreement,  together with the other Loan Documents,
reflects  the  entire   understanding   of  the  parties  with  respect  to  the
transactions  contemplated  hereby and shall not be contradicted or qualified by
any other agreement, oral or written, before the date hereof.
