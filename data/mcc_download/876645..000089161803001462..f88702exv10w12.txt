      system for the last market trading day prior to the time of determination,
      as reported in The Wall Street Journal or such other source as the
      Committee deems reliable; or

            (ii) in the absence of an established market for the Common Stock,
      the Fair Market Value thereof shall be determined in good faith by the
      Board.
