qualified as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction

<PAGE>

     5.2.  Authorization, etc.

           (a)  This Agreement and the Notes have been duly authorized by all
     necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and this Agreement
     constitutes, and upon execution and delivery thereof, each Note will
     constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company
     enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as
     such enforceability may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy,
     insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the
     enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of
     equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
     proceeding in equity or at law).

           (b)  The Subsidiary Guarantee has been duly authorized by all
     necessary corporate action on the part of each Subsidiary Guarantor and,
     upon execution and delivery thereof, the Subsidiary Guarantee will
     constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Subsidiary
     Guarantor, enforceable against each such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance
     with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i)
     applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
     similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
     (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
     enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and
     public policy.

     5.3.  Disclosure.

     The Company, through the Placement Agent, has delivered to each Purchaser a
copy of a Private Placement Memorandum, dated November, 2002 (the "Memorandum"),
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. The Memorandum fairly
describes, in all material respects, the general nature of the business and
principal properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in
Schedule 5.3, this Agreement, the Memorandum, the documents, certificates or
other writings delivered to the Purchasers by or on behalf of the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the financial
statements listed in Schedule 5.5, taken as a whole, do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under
which they were made. Except as disclosed in the Memorandum or as expressly
described in Schedule 5.3, or in one of the documents, certificates or other
writings delivered to the Purchasers by or on behalf of the Company in
connection with the transactions

                                        6

<PAGE>

contemplated hereby, or in the financial statements listed in Schedule 5.5,
since September 30, 2002, there has been no change in the financial condition,
operations, business, properties or prospects of the Company or any Subsidiary
except changes that individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no fact known to the
Company that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect that
has not been set forth herein or in the Memorandum or in the other documents,
certificates and other writings delivered to the Purchasers by or on behalf of
the Company specifically for use in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

     5.4.  Organization and Ownership of Shares of Subsidiaries; Affiliates.

           (a)  Schedule 5.4 contains (except as noted therein) complete and
     correct lists of (i) the Company's Subsidiaries, showing, as to each
     Subsidiary, the correct name thereof, the jurisdiction of its organization,
     the percentage of shares of each class of its Capital Stock outstanding
     owned by the Company and each other Subsidiary and whether such Subsidiary
     is a Subsidiary Guarantor as of the date of the Closing, and (ii) the
     Company's Affiliates, other than Subsidiaries.

           (b)  All of the outstanding shares of Capital Stock of each
     Subsidiary shown in Schedule 5.4 as being owned by the Company and its
     Subsidiaries have been validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and
     are owned by the Company or another Subsidiary free and clear of any Lien
     (except as otherwise disclosed in Schedule 5.4).

           (c)  Each Subsidiary identified in Schedule 5.4 is a corporation or
     other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
     under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified
     as a foreign corporation or other legal entity and is in good standing in
     each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other
     than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in
     good standing could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
     expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary has the
     corporate or other power and authority to own or hold under lease the
     properties it purports to own or hold under lease and to transact the
     business it transacts and proposes to transact. Each Subsidiary Guarantor
     has the corporate power and authority to

     thereof.

     restriction or any agreement (other than this Agreement, the agreements
     listed in Schedule 5.4 and customary limitations imposed by corporate law
     statutes) restricting the ability of such Subsidiary to pay dividends out
     of profits or make any other similar distributions of profits to the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries that owns outstanding shares of Capital
     Stock of such Subsidiary.

     5.5.  Financial Statements.

     The Company has delivered to each Purchaser copies of the consolidated
financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries listed in Schedule 5.5.
All of said financial statements (including in each case the related schedules

accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved except

statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

     5.6.  Compliance with Laws, Other Instruments, etc.

     Neither the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the Notes nor the execution, delivery and performance of the
Subsidiary Guarantee by the Subsidiary Guarantors will

           (a)  contravene, result in any breach of, or constitute a default
     under, or result in the creation of any Lien in respect of any property of
     the Company or any Subsidiary under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of
     trust, loan, purchase or credit agreement, lease, corporate charter or
     by-laws, or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any
     Subsidiary is bound or by which the Company or any Subsidiary or any of
     their respective properties may be bound or affected,

           (b)  conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms,
     conditions or provisions of any order, judgment, decree, or ruling of any
     court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority applicable to the Company or

     No consent, approval or authorization of, or registration, filing or
declaration with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement or the
Notes. No consent, approval or authorization of, or registration, filing or
declaration with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance by each Subsidiary Guarantor of the
Subsidiary Guarantee.

     5.8.  Litigation; Observance of Agreements, Statutes and Orders.

           (a)  Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.8, there are no actions, suits
     or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
     against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or any property of the
     Company or any Subsidiary in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind
     or before or by any Governmental Authority that, individually or in the
     aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

           (b)  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default under any
     term of any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it
     is bound, or any order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court, arbitrator
     or Governmental Authority or is in violation of any applicable law,
     ordinance, rule or regulation (including, without limitation, Environmental
     Laws and the USA Patriot Act) of any Governmental Authority, which default
     or violation, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
     expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     5.9.  Taxes.

     The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all tax returns that are
required to have been filed in any jurisdiction, and have paid all taxes shown
to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes and assessments levied
upon them or their properties, assets, income or franchises, to the extent such
taxes and assessments have become due and payable and before they have become
delinquent, except for any taxes and assessments (a) the amount of which is not
individually or in the aggregate Material or (b) the amount, applicability or
validity of which

                                       9

<PAGE>

is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
respect to which the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, has
established adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP. The Company knows of no
basis for any other tax or assessment that could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of Federal, state or other taxes
(and in respect of any payment pursuant to any tax sharing agreement) for all
fiscal periods are adequate.

     5.10. Title to Property; Leases.

     The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and sufficient title to their
respective properties that individually or in the aggregate are Material,
including all such properties reflected in the most recent audited balance sheet
referred to in Section 5.5 or purported to have been acquired by the Company or
any Subsidiary after said date (except as sold or otherwise disposed of in the
ordinary course of business), in each case free and clear of Liens prohibited by
this Agreement. All leases that individually or in the aggregate are Material
are valid and subsisting and are in full force and effect in all material
respects.

     5.11. Licenses, Permits, etc.

     Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.11,

           (a)  the Company and its Subsidiaries own or possess all licenses,
     permits, franchises, authorizations, patents, copyrights, service marks,
     trademarks and trade names, or rights thereto, that individually or in the
     aggregate are Material, without known conflict with the rights of others;

           (b)  to the best knowledge of the Company, no product of the Company
     or any Subsidiary infringes in any material respect any license, permit,
     franchise, authorization, patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, trade
     name or other right owned by any other Person; and

           (c)  to the best knowledge of the Company, there is no Material
     violation by any Person of any right of the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries with respect to any patent, copyright, service mark,
     trademark, trade name or other right owned or used by the Company or any of
     its Subsidiaries.

     5.12. Compliance with ERISA.

           (a)  The Company and each ERISA Affiliate have operated and
     administered each Plan in compliance with all applicable laws except for
     such instances of noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not
     reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
     Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability pursuant to
     Title I or IV of ERISA in the nature of a penalty or excise tax or the
     penalty or excise tax provisions of the Code relating to employee benefit
     plans (as defined in section 3 of ERISA), and no event, transaction or
     condition has occurred or exists that could reasonably be expected to
     result in the incurrence of any such liability by the Company or any ERISA
     Affiliate, or in the imposition of any Lien on any of the rights,
     properties or assets of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, in either case
     pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or to such penalty or excise tax
     provisions or to section 401(a)(29) or 412 of the Code, other than such
     liabilities or Liens as would not be individually or in the aggregate
     Material.

           (b)  The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities under
     each of the Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA (other than Multiemployer
     Plans), determined as of the end of each such Plan's most recently ended
     plan year on the basis of the actuarial assumptions specified for funding
     purposes in such Plan's most recent actuarial valuation report, did not
     exceed the aggregate current value of the assets of such Plan allocable to
     such benefit liabilities. The term "benefit liabilities" has the meaning
     specified in section 4001 of ERISA and the terms "current value" and
     "present value" have the meaning specified in section 3 of ERISA.

           (c)  The Company and the ERISA Affiliates have not incurred
     withdrawal liabilities (and are not subject to contingent withdrawal
     liabilities) under section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA in respect of
     Multiemployer Plans that individually or in the aggregate are Material.

           (d)  The expected postretirement benefit obligation (determined as of
     the last day of the Company's most recently ended fiscal year in accordance
     with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 106, without regard
     to liabilities attributable to continuation coverage mandated by section
     4980B of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries is not Material.

                                       11

<PAGE>

           (e)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance
     and sale of the Notes hereunder will not involve any transaction that is
     subject to the prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA or in connection with
     which a tax could be imposed pursuant to section 4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the
     Code. The representation by the Company in the first sentence of this
     Section 5.12(e) is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of
     each Purchaser's representation in Section 6.2 as to the Sources used to
     pay the purchase price of the Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser.

           (f)  Schedule 5.12 sets forth all ERISA Affiliates and all "employee
     benefit plans" maintained by the Company (or any "affiliate" thereof) or in
     respect of which the Notes could constitute an "employer security"
     ("employee benefit plan" has the meaning specified in section 3 of ERISA,
     "affiliate" has the meaning specified in section 407(d) of ERISA and
     section V of the Department of Labor Prohibited Transaction Exemption 95-60
     (60 FR 35925, July 12, 1995) and "employer security" has the meaning
     specified in section 407(d) of ERISA).

     5.13. Private Offering by the Company.

     Neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has offered the Notes
or any similar securities for sale to, or solicited any offer to buy any of the
same from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect thereof with, any
Person other than the Purchasers and not more than 28 other Institutional
Investors who were offered the Notes at a private sale for investment. Neither
the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has taken, or will take, any action
that would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes to the registration
requirements of section 5 of the Securities Act.

     5.14. Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations.

     The Company will apply the proceeds of the sale of the Notes as set forth
in Schedule 5.14. No part of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes hereunder
will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any
margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (12 CFR 221), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or
trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Company in
a violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker
or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Margin
stock does not constitute more than 5% of the value of the consolidated assets
of the

                                       12

<PAGE>

Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company does not have any present intention
that margin stock will constitute more than 5% of the value of such assets. As
used in this Section, the terms "margin stock" and "purpose of buying or
carrying" shall have the meanings assigned to them in said Regulation U.

     5.15. Existing Debt; Future Liens.

           (a)  Except as described therein, Schedule 5.15 sets forth a complete
     and correct list of all outstanding Debt of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries as of December 19, 2002 (and specifying, as to each such Debt,
     the collateral, if any, securing such Debt), since which date there has
     been no Material change in the amounts, interest rates, sinking funds,
     installment payments or maturities of the Debt of the Company or its
     Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default and no
     waiver of default is currently in effect, in the payment of any principal
     or interest on any Debt of the Company or such Subsidiary and no event or
     condition exists with respect to any Debt of the Company or any Subsidiary
     that would permit (or that with notice or the lapse of time, or both, would
     permit) one or more Persons to cause such Debt to become due and payable
     before its stated maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of
     payment.

           (b)  Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.15, neither the Company nor
     any Subsidiary has agreed or consented to cause or permit in the future
     (upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise) any of its property,
     whether now owned or hereafter acquired, to be subject to a Lien not
     permitted by Section 10.8(a).

     5.16. Foreign Assets Control Regulations, etc.

     Neither the sale of the Notes by the Company hereunder nor its use of the
proceeds thereof will violate the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, or any
of the foreign assets control regulations of the United States Treasury
Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as amended) or any enabling
legislation or executive order relating thereto. Without limiting the foregoing,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (i) is or will become a blocked person
described in Section 1 of Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001 Blocking
Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, Threaten to
Commit, or Support Terrorism (66 Fed. Reg. 49079 (2001)) or (ii) engages or will
engage in any dealings or transactions, or is otherwise associated, with any
such Person.

     Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is subject to regulation under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended, the Transportation Acts (49 U.S.C.), as amended, or the
Federal Power Act, as amended.

     5.18. Environmental Matters.

     Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has knowledge of any claim or has
received any notice of any claim, and no proceeding has been instituted raising
any claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective real properties now or formerly owned, leased or operated by any of
them or other assets, alleging any damage to the environment or violation of any
Environmental Laws, except, in each case, such as could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in Schedule
5.18,

           (a)  neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has knowledge of any
     facts which would give rise to any claim, public or private, of violation
     of Environmental Laws or damage to the environment emanating from,
     occurring on or in any way related to real properties now or formerly
     owned, leased or operated by any of them or to other assets or their use,
     except, in each case, such as could not reasonably be expected to result in
     a Material Adverse Effect;

           (b)  neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has stored any
     Hazardous Materials on real properties now or formerly owned, leased or
     operated by any of them or disposed of any Hazardous Materials in a manner
     contrary to any Environmental Laws in each case in any manner that could
     reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; and

           (c)  all buildings on all real properties now owned, leased or
     operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
     applicable Environmental Laws, except where failure to comply could not
     reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

6.   REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PURCHASERS.

     Each Purchaser represents that it is purchasing the Notes for its own
account or for one or more separate accounts maintained by it or for

the account of one or more pension or trust funds and not with a view to the
distribution thereof, provided that the disposition of its or their property

8.   PAYMENT OF THE NOTES.

     8.1.  Required Prepayment; Payment at Maturity.

           (a)  Required Principal Prepayments. In addition to paying the entire
     outstanding principal amount and the interest due on the Notes on the
     maturity date thereof, on December 20, 2008, and June 20, 2009, and on each
     December 20 and June 20 thereafter to and including June 20, 2012, the
     Company will prepay, $3,333,333 (or such lesser amount as shall then be
     outstanding) in principal amount of the Notes, without penalty or any
     requirement to pay any Make-Whole Amount with respect thereto. Each such
     prepayment shall be at 100% of the principal amount prepaid, together with
     interest accrued thereon to the date of prepayment; provided that, upon any
     partial prepayment of the Notes pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 8.6, the
     principal amount of each required prepayment of the Notes becoming due and
     payable under this Section 8.1 on and after the date of such prepayment or
     purchase shall be reduced in the same proportion as the aggregate unpaid
     principal amount of the Notes is reduced as a result of such prepayment or
     purchase.

           (b)  Maturity. The principal amount of the Notes remaining
     outstanding, together with accrued unpaid interest thereon, shall be due
     and payable on December 20, 2012.

     8.2.  Optional Prepayments with Make-Whole Amount.

     The Company may, at its option, upon notice as provided below, prepay at
any time all, or from time to time any part of, the Notes, on a pro rata basis
in respect of all Notes outstanding at such time, in an amount not less than 5%
of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding in the case of a
partial prepayment, at 100% of the principal amount so prepaid and accrued
interest thereon to the date of prepayment, plus the Make-Whole Amount, if any,
determined for the prepayment date with respect to the principal amount of Notes
being so prepaid. The Company will give each holder of Notes written notice of
each optional prepayment under this Section 8.2 not less than 30 days and not
more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such prepayment. Each such notice
shall specify such prepayment date, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
to be prepaid on such date, the principal amount of each Note held by such
holder to be prepaid (determined in accordance with Section 8.3), and the
interest to be paid on the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount
being prepaid, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of a Senior Financial
Officer as

                                       22

<PAGE>

to the estimated Make-Whole Amount, if any, due in connection with such
prepayment (calculated as if the date of such notice were the date of the
prepayment), setting forth the details of such computation. Two Business Days
prior to such prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each holder of Notes a
certificate of a Senior Financial Officer specifying the calculation of such
Make-Whole Amount, if any, as of the specified prepayment date. Each calculation
by the Company set forth in any such certificate furnished to a holder of Notes
of the Make-Whole Amount applicable in respect of a prepayment of Notes held by
such holder shall be subject to verification by such holder; and any
redetermination of such Make-Whole Amount by such holder shall, in the absence
of manifest error, be conclusive and binding as between the Company and such
holder.

     8.3.  Allocation of Partial Prepayments.

     In the case of each partial prepayment of the Notes, the principal amount
of the Notes to be prepaid shall be allocated among all of the Notes at the time
outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid
principal amounts thereof not theretofore called for prepayment. All partial
prepayments made pursuant to Section 8.6 with respect to a Change in Control
shall be applied as provided for in Section 8.4.

     8.4.  Maturity; Surrender, etc.

     In the case of each prepayment of Notes pursuant to this Section 8, the
principal amount of each Note to be prepaid shall mature and become due and
payable on the date fixed for such prepayment, together with interest on such
principal amount accrued to such date and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if
any. From and after such date, unless the Company shall fail to pay such
principal amount when so due and payable, together with the interest and
Make-Whole Amount, if any, as aforesaid, interest on such principal amount shall
cease to accrue. Any Note paid or prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the
Company and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and no Note shall be issued in
lieu of any prepaid principal amount of any Note.

     Any prepayment of Notes in respect of a Change in Control under Section 8.6
shall be on terms as set forth in said Section 8.6, provided that only those
holders who shall have accepted the offer under said Section 8.6 shall have
their Notes prepaid in whole in connection therewith. Any Debt Prepayment
Application shall be on terms as set forth in Section 8.2 and this Section 8.4.

                                       23

<PAGE>

     8.5.  No Other Optional Prepayments or Purchase of Notes.

     The Company will not and will not permit any Affiliate to purchase, redeem,
prepay or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of the outstanding
Notes except upon the payment or prepayment of the Notes in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Notes. The Company will promptly cancel all
Notes acquired by it or any Affiliate pursuant to any payment, prepayment or
purchase of Notes pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and no Notes may
be issued in substitution or exchange for any such Notes.

     8.6.  Offer to Prepay upon Change in Control, etc.

           (a)  Notice and Offer. In the event of either

                (i)   a Change in Control, or

                (ii)  the obtaining of actual knowledge of a Control Event by a
           Senior Financial Officer,

the Company will, within five Business Days of the occurrence of either of such
events, give written notice of such Change in Control or Control Event to each
holder of Notes by facsimile transmission and, simultaneously with the sending
of such facsimile notice, send a copy of such notice to each such holder via an
overnight courier of national reputation. Such written notice shall contain, and
such written notice shall constitute, an irrevocable offer to prepay all, but
not less than all, the Notes held by such holder on a date specified in such
notice (the "Control Prepayment Date") that is not less than 60 days and not
more than 90 days after the date of such notice, provided that, in the case of a
Control Event that does not give rise to a Change in Control, such notice shall
be null and void and in the case of a Control Event that does give rise to a
Change in Control which shall occur more than 90 days following the date the
written notice required by this Section 8.6(a) must be given, the Control
Prepayment Date may be delayed by the Company to a date not later than the date
on which the Change in Control arising from such Control Event shall actually be
consummated or finalized. If the Control Prepayment Date shall not be specified
in such notice, the Control Prepayment Date shall be the 60th day after the date
of such notice; it being understood by the parties hereto, for purposes of the
avoidance of doubt, that any such notice shall be dated the date on which it is
first given to the holders of Notes and that all notices to all holders of Notes
shall bear the same date.

     If the Company shall not have received a written response to such written
notice from any holder of Notes within 10 days after the date of

                                       24

<PAGE>

the facsimile transmission of such notice to such holder, the Company shall use
its best efforts to send a second written notice via an overnight courier of
national reputation to such holder of Notes but shall be under no obligation to
do so.

           (b)  Acceptance and Payment; Acceptance.

                (i)   Acceptance and Payment. To accept or reject such offered
           prepayment, a holder of Notes shall cause a notice of such acceptance
           or rejection to be delivered to the Company not later than 30 days
           after the date of the notice constituting such offered prepayment
           (which, if there shall have been two written notices, shall be deemed
           to be the first written notice). If so accepted, such offered
           prepayment in respect of such principal amount of such Notes shall be
           due and payable on the Control Prepayment Date. Such offered
           prepayment shall be made at 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
           held by holders having accepted such offer, together with interest on
           the Notes then being prepaid accrued to the Control Prepayment Date
           and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any.

                (ii)  Rejection. A failure by any holder of Notes to respond in
           writing to all written offers of prepayment referred to in Section
           8.6(b) by the deadlines set forth therein shall be deemed to
           constitute a rejection of such offer by such holder.

           (c)  Officer's Certificate. Each offer to prepay the Notes pursuant
     to this Section 8.6 shall be accompanied by a certificate, executed by a
     Senior Financial Officer and dated the date of such offer, specifying:

                (i)   the Control Prepayment Date;

                (ii)  that such offer is being made pursuant to this Section 8.6
           and that failure by a holder to respond to such offer by the
           deadlines as established by this Section 8.6 shall result in such
           offer to such holder being deemed rejected;

                (iii) the interest that would be due on each such Note offered
           to be prepaid, accrued to the date fixed for payment;

                (iv)  a calculation of the estimated Make-Whole Amount due in
           connection with such prepayment (calculated

                                       25

<PAGE>

           as if the date of such notice were the date of the prepayment),
           setting forth the details of such computation;

                (v)   that the conditions of this Section 8.6 have been
           fulfilled; and

                (vi)  in reasonable detail, a description of the nature and date
           or proposed date of the Change in Control.

           (d)  Calculation of Make-Whole Amount. Two Business Days prior to the
     Control Prepayment Date, the Company shall deliver to each holder of Notes
     that has accepted an offer of prepayment under this Section 8.6 a
     certificate of a Senior Financial Officer specifying the calculation of
     such Make-Whole Amount, if any, as of the Control Prepayment Date.

           (e)  Cancellation of Notes. Any Note acquired by the Company under
     this Section 8.6 shall be cancelled and shall not be reissued.

     8.7.  Make-Whole Amount.

     The term "Make-Whole Amount" means, with respect to any Note, an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled
Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the amount of
such Called Principal, provided that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be
less than zero. For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the
following terms have the following meanings:

     "Called Principal" means, with respect to any Note, the principal of such
Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 8.6, or has become
or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.2, as
the context requires.

     "Discounted Value" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note,
the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect
to such Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the
Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with
accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same
periodic basis as that on which interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the
Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal.

     "Reinvestment Yield" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any
Note, the sum of (a) 0.50% per annum plus (b) the yield to maturity

                                       26

<PAGE>

implied by (i) the yields reported, as of 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the
second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called
Principal, on the display designated as "Page U.S.D." of the Bloomberg Financial
Markets Services Screen (or, if not available, any other nationally recognized
trading screen reporting on-line intraday trading in U.S. Treasury securities)
for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the
Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date, or
(ii) if such yields are not reported as of such time or the yields reported as
of such time are not ascertainable (including by interpolation), the Treasury
Constant Maturity Series Yields reported, for the latest day for which such
yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the
Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve
Statistical Release H.15 (519) (or any comparable successor publication) for
actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a constant maturity equal to the
Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. Such
implied yield will be determined, if necessary, by (1) converting U.S. Treasury
bill quotations to bond-equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial
practice and (2) interpolating linearly between (A) the actively traded U.S.
Treasury security with the maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining
Average Life and (B) the actively traded U.S. Treasury security with the
maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Average Life.

     "Remaining Average Life" means, with respect to any Called Principal, the
number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) obtained by
dividing

                (i)   such Called Principal into

                (ii)  the sum of the products obtained by multiplying

                      (A)  the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled
                Payment with respect to such Called Principal by

                      (B)  the number of years (calculated to the nearest
                one-twelfth year) that will elapse between the Settlement Date
                with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date
                of such Remaining Scheduled Payment.

     "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to the Called Principal
of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that
would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if
no payment of such Called Principal were

                                       27

<PAGE>

made prior to its scheduled due date, provided that if such Settlement Date is
not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of the
Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be
reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required
to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Section 8.2, Section 8.6 or
Section 12.1.

     "Settlement Date" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note,
the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2
or Section 8.6 or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable
pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.

9.   AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.

     The Company covenants that so long as any of the Notes are outstanding:

     9.1.  Compliance with Law.

     The Company will and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to comply with all
laws, ordinances or governmental rules or regulations to which each of them is
subject, including, without limitation, Environmental Laws, and will obtain and
maintain in effect all licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and other
governmental authorizations necessary to the ownership of their respective
properties or to the conduct of their respective businesses, in each case to the
extent necessary to ensure that non-compliance with such laws, ordinances or
governmental rules or regulations or failures to obtain or maintain in effect
such licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and other governmental
authorizations could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     9.2.  Insurance.

     The Company will and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to maintain, with
financially sound and reputable insurers, insurance with respect to their
respective properties and businesses against such casualties and contingencies,
of such types, on such terms and in such amounts (including deductibles,
co-insurance and self-insurance, if adequate reserves are maintained with
respect thereto) as is customary in the case of entities of established
reputations engaged in the same or a similar business and similarly situated.

                                       28

<PAGE>

     9.3.  Maintenance of Properties.

     The Company will and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to maintain and
keep, or cause to be maintained and kept, their respective properties in good
repair, working order and condition (other than ordinary wear and tear), so that
the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly conducted at all
times, provided that this Section shall not prevent the Company or any
Subsidiary from discontinuing the operation and the maintenance of any of its
properties if such discontinuance is desirable in the conduct of its business
and the Company has concluded that such discontinuance could not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     9.4.  Payment of Taxes and Claims.

     The Company will and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to file all tax
returns required to be filed in any jurisdiction and to pay and discharge all
taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes,
assessments, governmental charges, or levies imposed on them or any of their
properties, assets, income or franchises, to the extent such taxes, assessments,
charges or levies have become due and payable and before they have become
delinquent and all claims for which sums have become due and payable that have
or might become a Lien on properties or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary,
provided that neither the Company nor any Subsidiary need pay any such tax or
assessment or claims if (a) the amount, applicability or validity thereof is
contested by the Company or such Subsidiary on a timely basis in good faith and
in appropriate proceedings, and the Company or a Subsidiary has established
adequate reserves therefor in accordance with GAAP on the books of the Company
or such Subsidiary or (b) the nonpayment of all such taxes, assessments, charges
and levies in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

     9.5.  Corporate Existence, etc.

     The Company will at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect
its corporate existence. Subject to Sections 10.2, and 10.9, the Company will at
all times preserve and keep in full force and effect the corporate existence of
each of its Subsidiaries (unless merged into the Company or a Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary) and all rights and franchises of the Company and its Subsidiaries
unless, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the termination of or failure
to preserve and keep in full force and effect such corporate existence, right or
franchise could not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.

                                       29

<PAGE>

10.  NEGATIVE COVENANTS.

     The Company covenants that so long as any of the Notes are outstanding:

     10.1. Transactions with Affiliates.

     The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, enter into
directly or indirectly any Material transaction or Material group of related
transactions (including, without limitation, the purchase, lease, sale or
exchange of properties of any kind or the rendering of any service) with any
Affiliate (other than the Company or another Subsidiary), except in the ordinary
course and pursuant to the reasonable requirements of the Company's or such
Subsidiary's business and upon fair and reasonable terms no less favorable to
the Company or such Subsidiary than would be obtainable in a comparable
arm's-length transaction with a Person not an Affiliate.

     10.2. Merger, Consolidation, etc.

     The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
consolidate or merge with or into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease
all or substantially all of its assets in a single transaction or series of
transactions to any Person (except that (x) any Subsidiary may consolidate or
merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its
assets in a single transaction or series of transactions to, the Company or any
Wholly-Owned Subsidiary (provided, if such Subsidiary is a Subsidiary Guarantor,

event, become) a Subsidiary Guarantor) and (y) any Subsidiary may transfer or
lease all or substantially all of its assets if permitted pursuant to Section
10.9(d)), provided that the foregoing restrictions do not apply to the
consolidation or merger of the Company with or into, or the conveyance, transfer
or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in a single
transaction or series of transactions to, any Person so long as:

                (i)   the successor formed by such consolidation or the survivor
           of such merger or the Person that acquires by conveyance, transfer or
           lease all or substantially all of the assets of the Company as an
           entirety, as the case may be (the "Successor Company"), shall be a
           solvent corporation organized and existing under the laws of the
           United States of America or any State thereof (including, without
           limitation, the District of Columbia);

<PAGE>

                (ii)  if the Company is not the Successor Company, such
           Successor Company shall have executed and delivered to each holder of
           any Notes its assumption of the due and punctual payment of the
           principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all of the Notes,
           according to their tenor, and the due and punctual performance and
           observance of each covenant and condition of this Agreement and the
           Notes and shall have caused to be delivered to each holder of any
           Notes an opinion of independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to
           the Required Holders, to the effect that all agreements or
           instruments effecting such assumption have been duly authorized,
           executed and delivered and are enforceable in accordance with their
           terms and comply with the terms hereof;

                (iii) each Subsidiary Guarantor shall have confirmed, in
           writing, its obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantee; and

                (iv)  immediately before and after giving effect to such
           transaction no Default or Event of Default would exist.

No such conveyance, transfer or lease of substantially all of the assets of the
Company shall have the effect of releasing the Company or any Successor Company
from its liability under this Agreement or the Notes, and no such conveyance,
transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of any Subsidiary
Guarantor shall have the effect of releasing such Subsidiary Guarantor from its
liability under the Subsidiary Guarantee except as provided in Section 10.13(c).

     10.3. Consolidated Tangible Net Worth.

     The Company will not, at any time, permit Consolidated Tangible Net Worth
to be less than the sum of

                (i)   $148,299,000, plus

                (ii)  an aggregate amount equal to 25% of Consolidated Adjusted
           Net Income (but only if a positive number) for each completed fiscal
           quarter of the Company beginning with the fiscal quarter ending
           September 30, 2002.

     10.4. Limitation on Current Debt.

     The Company will not, and will not allow any Subsidiary to, have any
Current Debt outstanding on any date after the date of the Closing unless, for
any period of 30 consecutive days during the fiscal year of the Company most
recently ended prior to such time, the aggregate principal amount of
Consolidated Current Debt outstanding on each day during such 30 day period did
not exceed the amount of additional Consolidated Debt which the Company would
have been permitted to incur on such day pursuant to Section 10.5(b).

     10.5. Limitation on Debt.

           (a)  Subsidiary Debt. The Company will not permit any of its
     Subsidiaries to directly or indirectly create, incur, assume, guarantee, or
     otherwise become liable in respect of any Debt after the date of the
     Closing, unless, after giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt and the
     application of the proceeds thereof,

                (i)   no Default or Event of Default would exist and

                (ii)  the aggregate principal amount (without duplication) of

                      (A)  all Debt of the Company then outstanding secured by
                Liens permitted pursuant to clause (k) of Section 10.8
                (excluding, in any case, any such Debt owing to a Subsidiary)
                and

                      (B)  all Adjusted Consolidated Subsidiary Debt then
                outstanding does not exceed 15% of Consolidated Tangible Net
                Worth, determined at such time.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 10.5(a) shall have no application
to the creation, incurrence, assumption or guarantee of any Debt of a Subsidiary
owing to the Company or a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, any Debt of a Person existing
at the time such Person becomes a Subsidiary (unless such Debt was created in
anticipation of, or in connection with, such Person becoming a Subsidiary), any
Debt owing by any Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor and any Debt secured
by Liens expressly permitted under clause (f), (h), (i) or (j) of Section 10.8.

                                       32

<PAGE>

           (b)  Limitation on Debt. The Company will not, at any time, permit
     the ratio of Consolidated Debt determined at such time to Consolidated Net
     Capitalization determined as of the last day of the most recently ended
     fiscal quarter of the Company to exceed 0.60:1.00.

     10.6. Fixed Charge Coverage.

     The Company will not at any time permit the ratio of

           (a)  Consolidated Net Income Available for Fixed Charges for the
     period of 4 consecutive fiscal quarters of the Company then most recently
     ended to

           (b)  Consolidated Fixed Charges for such period to be less than 1.75
     to 1.0.

     10.7. Restricted Payments; Restricted Investments.

           (a)  Restricted Payments. The Company will not, nor will it permit
     any Subsidiary to, at any time, declare or make or incur any liability to
     declare or make any Restricted Payment unless immediately after giving
     effect to the proposed Restricted Payment no Default or Event of Default
     would exist (for the purpose of determining compliance with financial
     covenants, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made on the
     last day of the preceding fiscal quarter).

           (b)  Authorization of Restricted Payment. The Company will not, nor
     will it permit any Subsidiary to, authorize a Restricted Payment that is
     not payable within 60 days of authorization.

           (c)  Restricted Investments. The Company will not, nor will it permit
     any Subsidiary to, at any time, make any Restricted Investment.

     10.8. Liens.

     The Company will not and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to
directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or permit to exist (upon the
happening of a contingency or otherwise) any Lien on or with respect to any
property or asset (including, without limitation, any document or instrument in
respect of goods or accounts receivable) of the Company or such Subsidiary,
whether now owned or held or hereafter acquired, or any income or profits
therefrom or assign or otherwise convey any right

                                       33

<PAGE>

to receive such income or profits, unless it makes, or causes to be made,
effective provision whereby the Notes will be equally and ratably secured with
any and all other obligations thereby secured, such security to be pursuant to
an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders and, in any such
case, the Notes shall have the benefit, to the fullest extent that, and with
such priority as, the holders of the Notes may be entitled under applicable law,
of an equitable Lien on such property, provided that the foregoing restrictions
and limitations shall not apply to:

           (a)  Liens for taxes, assessments or other governmental charges the
     payment of which is not at the time required by Section 9.4, and

           (b)  Liens

                (i)   arising from judicial attachments and judgments,

                (ii)  securing appeal bonds or supersedeas bonds, or

           without limitation, surety bonds and letters of credit or any other
           instrument serving a similar purpose),

provided that (1) the execution or other enforcement of such Liens is

     any Subsidiary and other similar charges or encumbrances, in each case
     incidental to, and not interfering with, the ordinary conduct of the
     business of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, provided
     that such charges and encumbrances do not, in the aggregate, materially
     detract from the value of such property;

                                       34

<PAGE>

           (e)  Liens incurred or deposits made in the ordinary course of
     business (i) in connection with workers' compensation, unemployment

     of such business;

           (f)  Liens (i) existing on the date of the Closing and referred to in

     that all of the following conditions are satisfied:

                (i)   any such Lien shall extend solely to the item or items of

           instrument originally creating such Lien, other property which is an

           lesser of (A) the cost to such person of the property (or improvement
           thereon) so acquired or constructed and (B) the Fair Market Value (as
           determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company) of

           (i)  Liens existing on property of a Person immediately prior to its
     being consolidated or merged into the Company or any Subsidiary or its
     becoming a Subsidiary, or any Lien existing on any property acquired by the
     Company or any Subsidiary at the time such property is so acquired (whether
     or not the Debt secured thereby shall have been assumed), provided that

                (i)   no such Lien shall have been created or assumed in
           contemplation of such consolidation or merger or such Person's
           becoming a Subsidiary or such acquisition of property,

                (ii)  each such Lien shall extend solely to the item or items of
           property so acquired and proceeds thereof and, if required by the

           Subsidiary or acquisition; and

           (j)  Liens renewing, extending or replacing Liens permitted by
     clauses (a) through (i) above, provided that all of the following
     conditions are satisfied:

                (i)   no such new Lien shall extend to any property of the
           Company or any Subsidiary other than property already encumbered by
           the existing Lien being so renewed, extended or replaced,

                                       36

<PAGE>

                (ii)  the principal amount of the underlying obligation secured
           by such existing Lien outstanding at the time of such renewal,
           extension or replacement shall not be increased in connection with

     Debt, as of the date of the creation of such Lien, does not exceed the
     remainder of

                (i)   15% of Consolidated Tangible Net Worth, determined as of
           the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter of the Company,
           minus

                (ii)  the sum (without duplication) of (A) the aggregate

           creation of such Lien secured by Liens pursuant to this clause (k).

     For the purposes of this Section 10.8, any Person becoming a Subsidiary
after the date of the Closing shall be deemed, at the time it becomes a
Subsidiary, to have incurred all of its then existing Liens securing outstanding
Debt.

     10.9. Sale of Assets, etc.

     Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will make any Transfer, provided
that the foregoing restriction does not apply to a Transfer:

           (a)  if the asset that is the subject of such Transfer constitutes
     either (i) inventory held for sale or (ii) equipment, fixtures, supplies or
     materials no longer required in the operation of the business of the
     Company or any Subsidiary or that is obsolete, and, in each case, such
     Transfer is in the ordinary course of business;

           (b)  if such Transfer is from the Company or any Subsidiary to any
     Wholly-Owned Subsidiary or any Subsidiary to the Company or to any
     Wholly-Owned Subsidiary;

                                       37

<PAGE>

           (c)  if such Transfer is subject to Section 10.2 and satisfies the
     requirements thereof;

           (d)  if such Transfer is not a Transfer described in clause (a)
     through clause (c) above (each Transfer not described in clause (a) through
     clause (c) above is referred to as a "Basket Transfer"), and all of the
     following conditions shall have been satisfied with respect to such
     Transfer:

                (i)   the Transfer is in exchange for consideration with a Fair
           Market Value (determined in good faith by a Responsible Officer) at
           least equal to that of the asset exchanged,

                (ii)  immediately after giving effect to such transaction no
           Default or Event of Default would exist, and

                (iii) immediately after giving effect to such Transfer:

                      (A)  if such asset so Transferred consists of Timberland
                Assets, the Fair Market Value of all Timberland Assets that were
                the subject of Basket Transfers after the date of the Closing
                occurring during the period of 365 days immediately preceding
                such time would not exceed 10% of Consolidated Total Assets
                determined as of the last day of the then most recently ended
                fiscal quarter of the Company;

                      (B)  if such asset so Transferred is not a Timberland
                Asset, the net book value of all assets other than Timberland
                Assets that were the subject of Basket Transfers after the date
                of the Closing occurring during the period of 365 days
                immediately preceding such time would not exceed 15% of
                Consolidated Total Assets determined as of the last day of the
                then most recently ended fiscal quarter of the Company; and

                      (C)  the sum of

                           (I)   the Fair Market Value of all Timberland Assets
                      that were the subject of each Basket Transfer after the
                      date of the Closing occurring during the period of 365
                      days immediately preceding such time, plus

                                       38

<PAGE>

                           (II)  the net book value of all property other than
                      Timberland Assets that was the subject of each Basket
                      Transfer after the date of the Closing occurring during
                      the period of 365 days immediately preceding such time

would not exceed 15% of Consolidated Total Assets determined as of the last day
of the then most recently ended fiscal quarter of the Company.

     If the Net Proceeds Amount, or any portion thereof, with respect to any
Basket Transfer is applied to a Debt Prepayment Application and/or is applied
to, or committed in writing to, a Property Reinvestment Application, in each
case within 365 days (or, in the case of the Chenal Valley Transfer, within 730
days) after the consummation of such Transfer (and, in the case of any such
commitment, such Property Reinvestment Application is actually consummated
within 30 days after the expiration of such 365-day period, or such 730-day
period, as the case may be), then such Basket Transfer (or, in the case of a
partial application or partial commitment of such Net Proceeds Amount, a ratable
portion of such Basket Transfer) shall be excluded from any calculations set
forth above in subclause (iii) of this clause (d).

     For purposes of determining the book value of any asset that is the subject
of a Transfer, such book value shall be the net book value of such asset as
determined in accordance with GAAP, at the time of the consummation of such
Transfer, provided that, in the case of a Transfer of any Capital Stock of a
Subsidiary, the book value thereof shall be deemed to be an amount equal to

           (A)  the remainder (determined after eliminating all inter-company
     transactions, assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP) of

                (1)   the book value of the total net assets of such Subsidiary
           less

                (2)   the liabilities of such Subsidiary times

           (B)  a percentage that is equal to the percentage of total equity
     interests of such Subsidiary attributable to the Capital Stock being so
     Transferred.

     10.10. Line of Business.

     The Company will not and will not permit any Subsidiary to engage in any
business if, as a result, the general nature of the businesses in

                                       39

<PAGE>

which the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, would then be engaged
would be substantially changed from the general nature of the businesses of the
Company and the Subsidiaries as described in the Memorandum.

     10.11. Pari Passu Obligations.

     The Company covenants that its obligations under the Notes and under this
Agreement do and will rank at least pari passu in right of payment with all of
its other present and future unsecured and unsubordinated Debt except for those
obligations that are mandatorily preferred by law.

     10.12. Restrictions on Dividends of Subsidiaries, Etc.

     Except as provided for in this Agreement, the Company will not, and will
not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into any agreement with a Person
which would restrict any such Subsidiary's ability or right to pay dividends to,
or make advances to or Investments in, the Company or, if such Subsidiary is not
directly owned by the Company, the "parent" Subsidiary of such Subsidiary.

     10.13. Maintenance of Guarantees of Subsidiaries.

          (a)  Additional Subsidiary Guarantors -- Conformity to Certain Other
     Agreements. No Subsidiary will be or become a guarantor, obligor or
     co-obligor in respect of any bank credit facility of the Company unless
     such Subsidiary is already a party to, and a guarantor under, the
     Subsidiary Guarantee or unless such Subsidiary shall contemporaneously
     therewith become a party to, and a guarantor under, the Subsidiary
     Guarantee.

          (b)  Delivery of Subsidiary Guarantee. In connection with any
     Subsidiary becoming a Subsidiary Guarantor under clause (a) of this Section
     10.13, (i) if the Subsidiary Guarantee is not outstanding and in effect at
     such time, then the Company shall cause such Subsidiary to execute and
     deliver to each holder of Notes (x) the Subsidiary Guarantee, substantially
     in the form thereof set forth in Exhibit B(SG), and (y) each of the
     documents, certificates and opinions described on Annex 3 to the Subsidiary
     Guarantor Accession Agreement (defined below) prepared with respect to such
     Subsidiary, and until the Subsidiary Guarantee and each of such documents,
     certificates and opinions is delivered to each of the holders of Notes,
     such Subsidiary shall not be deemed to be a Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder
     and (ii) if the Subsidiary Guarantee is outstanding and in effect at such
     time,

                                       40

<PAGE>

     then the Company shall cause such Subsidiary to execute and deliver to each
     holder of Notes a Subsidiary Guarantor Accession Agreement, substantially
     in the form thereof set forth in Exhibit B(SGAA) (together with each of the
     documents, certificates and opinions set forth on the schedules thereto, a
     "Subsidiary Guarantor Accession Agreement"), and until such Subsidiary
     Guarantor Accession Agreement is delivered to each of the holders of Notes,
     such Subsidiary shall not be deemed to be a Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder.

          (c)  Release of Subsidiary Guarantee of Subsidiary Guarantors. If,
     with respect to any Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor,

               (i)   all, or substantially all, of the assets of such Subsidiary
          Guarantor are Transferred in accordance with the requirements of
          Sections 10.2 and 10.9 and such Subsidiary Guarantor is wound-up and
          terminated in accordance with the requirements of Section 9.5 or is
          deemed, in the good faith opinion of a Senior Financial Officer, to
          not have material assets,

               (ii)  all of the Company's and any Subsidiary's capital shares or
          other equity ownership interests in such Subsidiary Guarantor is
          Transferred in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.9, or

               (iii) such Subsidiary Guarantor is not required to be maintained
          as a Subsidiary Guarantor in order for the Company to remain in
          compliance with Section 10.13(a),

then the Company may elect to cause the withdrawal of such Subsidiary Guarantor
from the Subsidiary Guarantee and such Subsidiary Guarantor will thereby be
deemed to be fully discharged from the Subsidiary Guarantee. Such election shall
be exercised by a Senior Financial Officer (A) informing, in writing, each
holder of Notes of such election, (B) certifying that the requirements of this
Section 10.13(c) have been satisfied, (C) certifying that the requirements of
Section 10.13(a) will be satisfied immediately after giving effect to the
withdrawal and cessation of the Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to the
Subsidiary Guarantee and (D) certifying that no Default or Event of Default
exists. Thereafter, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be discharged from the
Subsidiary Guarantee and, at the Company's election and expense and upon the
Company's reasonable request, the holders of the Notes will provide written
confirmation of each such discharge. Any Subsidiary

                                       41

<PAGE>

Guarantor that has been discharged is nonetheless available to again become a

12.  REMEDIES ON DEFAULT, ETC.

     12.1. Acceleration.

           (a)  If an Event of Default with respect to the Company described in
     paragraph (g) or paragraph (h) of Section 11 (other than an Event of
     Default described in clause (i) of paragraph (g) or described in clause
     (vi) of paragraph (g) by virtue of the fact that such clause encompasses
     clause (i) of paragraph (g)) has occurred, all the Notes then outstanding
     shall automatically become immediately due and payable.

           (b)  If any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
     any holder or holders of more than 33 and 1/3% in principal amount of the
     Notes at the time outstanding may at any time at its or their option, by
     notice or notices to the Company,

                                       45

<PAGE>

     declare all the Notes then outstanding to be immediately due and payable.

           (c)  If any Event of Default described in paragraph (a) or (b) of
     Section 11 has occurred and is continuing, any holder or holders of Notes
     at the time outstanding affected by such Event of Default may at any time,
     at its or their option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare all
     the Notes held by it or them to be immediately due and payable.

     Upon any Notes becoming due and payable under this Section 12.1, whether
automatically or by declaration, such Notes will forthwith mature and the entire
unpaid principal amount of such Notes, plus (x) all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon and (y) the Make-Whole Amount determined in respect of such principal
amount (to the full extent permitted by applicable law), shall all be
immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment, demand,
protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. The Company
acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the
right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Company
(except as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment
of a Make-Whole Amount by the Company in the event that the Notes are prepaid or
are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide
compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances.

     12.2. Other Remedies.

     If any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and
irrespective of whether any Notes have become or have been declared immediately
due and payable under Section 12.1, the holder of any Note at the time
outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce the rights of such holder by an
action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate proceeding, whether for the
specific performance of any agreement contained herein or in any Note, or for an
injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid
of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise.

     12.3. Rescission.

     At any time after any Notes have been declared due and payable pursuant to
clause (b) or clause (c) of Section 12.1, the holders of not less than 67% in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the
Company, may rescind and annul any such declaration and its consequences if (i)
the Company has paid all overdue interest on the Notes, all principal of and
Make-Whole Amount, if any,

                                       46

<PAGE>

due and payable on any Notes other than by reason of such declaration, and all
interest on such overdue principal and Make-Whole Amount, if any, and (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) any overdue interest in respect of the
Notes, at the Default Rate, (ii) all Events of Default and Defaults, other than
non-payment of amounts that have become due solely by reason of such
declaration, have been cured or have been waived pursuant to Section 17, and
(iii) no judgment or decree has been entered for the payment of any monies due
pursuant hereto or to the Notes. No rescission and annulment under this Section
12.3 will extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or
impair any right consequent thereon.

     12.4. No Waivers or Election of Remedies, Expenses, etc.

     No course of dealing and no delay on the part of any holder of any Note in
exercising any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or
otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or
remedy conferred by this Agreement or by any Note upon any holder thereof shall
be exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or therein
or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
Without limiting the obligations of the Company under Section 15, the Company
will pay to the holder of each Note on demand such further amount as shall be
sufficient to cover all costs and expenses of such holder incurred in any
enforcement or collection under this Section 12, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements.

13.  REGISTRATION; EXCHANGE; SUBSTITUTION OF NOTES.

     13.1. Registration of Notes.

     The Company shall keep at its principal executive office a register for the
registration and registration of transfers of Notes. The name and address of
each holder of one or more Notes, each transfer thereof and the name and address
of each transferee of one or more Notes shall be registered in such register.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Person in whose name
any Note shall be registered shall be deemed and treated as the owner and holder
thereof for all purposes hereof, and the Company shall not be affected by any
notice or knowledge to the contrary. The Company shall give to any holder of a
Note that is an Institutional Investor promptly upon request therefor, a
complete and correct copy of the names and addresses of all registered holders
of Notes.

                                       47

     13.2. Transfer and Exchange of Notes.

     Except as set forth in the last sentence of this Section 13.2, upon
surrender of any Note at the principal executive office of the Company for
registration of transfer or exchange (and in the case of a surrender for
registration of transfer, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument
of transfer duly executed by the registered holder of such Note or his attorney
duly authorized in writing and accompanied by the address for notices of each
transferee of such Note or part thereof), the Company shall execute and deliver,
at the Company's expense (except as provided below), one or more new Notes (as
requested by the holder thereof) in exchange therefor, in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of the surrendered Note. Each such
new Note shall be payable to such Person as such holder may request and shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit 1. Each such new Note shall be dated and
bear interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on the
surrendered Note or dated the date of the surrendered Note if no interest shall
have been paid thereon. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any stamp tax or governmental charge imposed in respect of any such
transfer of Notes. Notes shall not be transferred in denominations of less than
$1,000,000, provided that if necessary to enable the registration of transfer by
a holder of its entire holding of Notes, one Note may be in a denomination of
less than $1,000,000. Any transferee, by its acceptance of a Note registered in
its name (or the name of its nominee), shall be deemed to have made the
representation set forth in Section 6.2. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no Note shall be transferred to a Competitor.

     13.3. Replacement of Notes.

     Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of
the ownership of and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note
(which evidence shall be, in the case of an Institutional Investor, notice from
such Institutional Investor of such ownership and such loss, theft, destruction
or mutilation), and

           (a)  in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity
     reasonably satisfactory to it (provided that if the holder of such Note is,
     or is a nominee for, an original Purchaser or another holder of a Note with
     a minimum net worth of at least $100,000,000, such Person's own unsecured
     agreement of indemnity shall be deemed to be satisfactory), or

                                       48

<PAGE>

           (b)  in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
     thereof,

the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new
Note, dated and bearing interest from the date to which interest shall have been
paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or dated the date of such
lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest shall have been paid
thereon.

14.  PAYMENTS ON NOTES.

     14.1. Place of Payment.

     Subject to Section 14.2, payments of principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any,
and interest becoming due and payable on the Notes shall be made in El Dorado,
Arkansas at the principal office of BancorpSouth in such jurisdiction. The
Company may at any time, by notice to each holder of a Note, change the place of
payment of the Notes so long as such place of payment shall be either the
principal office of the Company in such jurisdiction or the principal office of
a bank or trust company in such jurisdiction.

     14.2. Home Office Payment.

     So long as any Purchaser or its nominee shall be the holder of any Note,
and notwithstanding anything contained in Section 14.1 or in such Note to the
contrary, the Company will pay all sums becoming due on such Note for principal,
Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest by the method and at the address
specified for such purpose below such Purchaser's name in Schedule A, or by such
other method or at such other address as such Purchaser shall have from time to
time specified to the Company in writing for such purpose, without the
presentation or surrender of such Note or the making of any notation thereon,
except that upon written request of the Company made concurrently with or
reasonably promptly after payment or prepayment in full of any Note, such
Purchaser shall surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably promptly after
any such request, to the Company at its principal executive office or at the
place of payment most recently designated by the Company pursuant to Section
14.1. Prior to any sale or other disposition of any Note held by any Purchaser
or its nominee such Purchaser will, at its election, either endorse thereon the
amount of principal paid thereon and the last date to which interest has been
paid thereon or surrender such Note to the Company in exchange for a new Note or
Notes pursuant to Section 13.2. The Company will afford the benefits of this
Section 14.2 to any Institutional Investor that is the

                                       49

Purchaser has made in this Section 14.2.

15.  EXPENSES, ETC.

     15.1. Transaction Expenses.

     Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the
Company will pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees of
one special counsel and, if reasonably required, one local counsel) incurred

any, of brokers and finders (other than those retained by the Purchasers).

     15.2. Survival.

     The obligations of the Company under this Section 15 will survive the
payment or transfer of any Note, the enforcement, amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or the Notes, and the termination of this Agreement.

16.  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

     All representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes, the purchase or transfer
by any Purchaser of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein and the
payment of any Note, and may be relied upon by any subsequent holder of a Note,

                                       50

with (and only with) the written consent of the Company and the Required
Holders, except that (a) no amendment or waiver of any of the provisions of any
of Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 21, or any defined term (as it is used
therein), will be effective as to any Purchaser unless consented to by such
Purchaser in writing, (b) no such amendment or waiver may, without the written
consent of the holder of each Note at the time outstanding affected thereby, (i)

     information, sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is
     required, to enable such holder to make an informed and considered decision
     with respect to any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any
     of the provisions hereof or of the Notes. The Company will deliver executed
     or true and correct copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected
     pursuant to the provisions of this Section 17 to each holder of outstanding
     Notes promptly following the date on which it is executed and delivered by,
     or receives the consent or approval of, the requisite holders of Notes.

     cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or
     additional interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security, to any holder
     of Notes as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by
     any holder of Notes of any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and
     provisions hereof unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or
     security is concurrently granted, on the same terms, ratably to each holder
     of Notes then outstanding even if such holder did not consent to such
     waiver or amendment.

           (c)  Consent in Contemplation of Transfer. Any consent made pursuant
     to this Section 17 by a holder of Notes that has transferred or has agreed
     to transfer its Notes to the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate of
     the Company and has provided or has agreed to provide such written consent
     as a condition to such transfer shall be void and of no force or effect
     except solely as to such holder, and any amendments effected or waivers
     granted or to be effected or granted that would not have been or would not
     be so effected or granted but for such consent (and the consents of all
     other holders of Notes that were acquired under the same or similar
     conditions) shall be void and of no force or effect except solely as to
     such holder.

     17.3. Binding Effect, etc.

     Any amendment or waiver consented to as provided in this Section 17 applies
equally to all holders of Notes and is binding upon them and upon each future
holder of any Note and upon the Company without regard to whether such Note has
been marked to indicate such amendment or waiver. No such amendment or waiver
will extend to or affect any obligation, covenant, agreement, Default or Event
of Default not expressly amended or waived or impair any right consequent
thereon. No course of dealing between the Company and the holder of any Note nor
any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note shall operate as
a waiver of any rights of any holder of such Note.

     17.4. Notes held by Company, etc.

     Solely for the purpose of determining whether the holders of the requisite
percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding approved
or consented to any amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this
Agreement or the Notes, or have directed the taking of any action provided
herein or in the Notes to be taken upon the direction of the holders of a
specified percentage of the aggregate

                                       52

<PAGE>

principal amount of Notes then outstanding, Notes directly or indirectly owned
by the Company or any of its Affiliates shall be deemed not to be outstanding.

18.  NOTICES.

     All notices and communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing
and sent (a) by telecopy if the sender on the same day sends a confirming copy
of such notice by a recognized overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), or
(b) by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested (postage
prepaid), or (c) by a recognized overnight delivery service (with charges
prepaid). Any such notice must be sent:

                (i)   if to any Purchaser or its nominee, to such Purchaser or
           such nominee at the address specified for such communications in
           Schedule A, or at such other address as such Purchaser or such

                (ii)  if to any other holder of any Note, to such holder at such
           address as such other holder shall have specified to the Company in
           writing, or

                (iii) if to the Company, to the Company at its address set forth
           at the beginning hereof to the attention of Clefton D. Vaughan,
           telecopier: (870) 881-6457, or at such other address as the Company
           shall have specified to the holder of each Note in writing.

Notices under this Section 18 will be deemed given only when actually received.

19.  REPRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS.

     This Agreement and all documents relating hereto, including, without
limitation, (a) consents, waivers and modifications that may hereafter be
executed, (b) documents received by the Purchasers at the Closing (except the
Notes themselves), and (c) financial statements, certificates and other
information previously or hereafter furnished to the Purchasers, may be
reproduced by the Purchasers by any photographic, photostatic, microfilm,
microcard, miniature photographic or other similar process and the Purchasers
may destroy any original document so reproduced. The Company agrees and
stipulates that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any such
reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any
judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in
existence and whether or not

                                       53

<PAGE>

such reproduction was made by the Purchasers in the regular course of business)
and any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of such reproduction
shall likewise be admissible in evidence. This Section 19 shall not prohibit the
Company or any other holder of Notes from contesting any such reproduction to
the same extent that it could contest the original, or from introducing evidence
to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any such reproduction.

20.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

         For the purposes of this Section 20, "Confidential Information" means
information delivered to any Purchaser by or on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement, provided that such term does not include information
that

           (a)  was publicly known or otherwise known to such Purchaser prior to
     the time of such disclosure,

           (b)  subsequently becomes publicly known through no act or omission
     by such Purchaser or any person acting on its behalf,

           (c)  otherwise becomes known to such Purchaser other than through
     disclosure by the Company or any Subsidiary, or

           (d)  constitutes financial statements delivered to such Purchaser
     under Section 7.1 that are otherwise publicly available.

Each Purchaser will maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential
Information in accordance with procedures adopted by it in good faith to protect
confidential information of third parties delivered to it, provided that such
Purchaser may deliver or disclose Confidential Information to:

                (i)   its directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents,
           attorneys and affiliates (to the extent such disclosure reasonably
           relates to the administration of the investment represented by its
           Notes),

                (ii)  its financial advisors and other professional advisors who
           agree to hold confidential the Confidential Information substantially
           in accordance with the terms of this Section 20,

                (iii) any other holder of any Note,

                (iv)  any Institutional Investor to which such Purchaser sells
           or ffers to sell such Note or any part thereof

                                       54

<PAGE>

           or any participation therein (if such Person has agreed in writing
           prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by
           the provisions of this Section 20),

                (v)    any Person from which such Purchaser offers to purchase
           any security of the Company (if such Person has agreed in writing
           prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by
           the provisions of this Section 20),

                (vi)   any federal or state regulatory authority having
           jurisdiction over such Purchaser,

                (vii)  the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, its
           Securities Valuation Office or any similar organization, or any
           nationally recognized statistical rating organization that requires
           access to information about such Purchaser's investment portfolio or

                (viii) any other Person to which such delivery or disclosure may
           be necessary or appropriate

                       (A)  to effect compliance with any law, rule, regulation
                or order applicable to such Purchaser,

                       (B)  in response to any subpoena or other legal process,

                       (C)  in connection with any litigation to which such
                Purchaser is party, or

                       (D)  if an Event of Default has occurred and is
                continuing, to the extent such Purchaser may reasonably
                determine such delivery and disclosure to be necessary or
                appropriate in the enforcement or for the protection of the
                rights and remedies under its Notes and this Agreement.

Each holder of a Note, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have
agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this Section 20 as
though it were a party to this Agreement. On reasonable request by the Company
in connection with the delivery to any holder of a Note of information required
to be delivered to such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder
(other than a holder that is a party to this Agreement or its nominee), such
holder will enter into an agreement with the Company embodying the provisions of
this Section 20.

                                       55

21.  SUBSTITUTION OF PURCHASER.

     Each Purchaser shall have the right to substitute any one of its Affiliates
as the purchaser of the Notes that such Purchaser has agreed to purchase
hereunder, by written notice to the Company, which notice shall be signed by
both such Purchaser and its Affiliate, shall contain such Affiliate's agreement
to be bound by this Agreement and shall contain a confirmation by such Affiliate
of the accuracy with respect to it of the representations set forth in Section
6. Upon receipt of such notice, wherever the word "Purchaser" is used in this
Agreement (other than in this Section 21), such word shall be deemed to refer to
such Affiliate in lieu of such Purchaser. In the event that such Affiliate is so
substituted as a purchaser hereunder and such Affiliate thereafter transfers to
such Purchaser all of the Notes then held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the
Company of notice of such transfer, wherever the word "Purchaser" is used in
this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), such word shall no longer be
deemed to refer to such Affiliate, but shall refer to such Purchaser, and such
Purchaser shall have all the rights of an original holder of the Notes under
this Agreement.

22.  MISCELLANEOUS.

     22.1. Successors and Assigns.

     All covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement by or on
behalf of any of the parties hereto bind and inure to the benefit of their
respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any subsequent
holder of a Note) whether so expressed or not.

     22.2. Payments Due on Non-Business Days.

     Anything in this Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding,
any payment of principal of or Make-Whole Amount or interest on any Note that is
due on a date other than a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day without including the additional days elapsed in the computation of
the interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day.

     22.3. Severability.

     Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by

                                       56

<PAGE>

law) not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

     22.4. Construction.

     Each covenant contained herein shall be construed (absent express provision
to the contrary) as being independent of each other covenant contained herein,
so that compliance with any one covenant shall not (absent such an express
contrary provision) be deemed to excuse compliance with any other covenant.
Where any provision herein refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which
such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable
whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person.

     22.5. Counterparts.

     This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one instrument.
Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each signed by less
than all, but together signed by all, of the parties hereto.

     22.6. Governing Law.

     THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND THE
RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
EXCLUDING CHOICE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW OF SUCH STATE THAT WOULD REQUIRE
THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN SUCH STATE.

     Guaranteed Obligations at any reasonable time;

          (c)  notice of the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, subject to
     such Subsidiary Guarantor's right to make inquiry of each holder of Notes

     time;

          (d)  notice of adverse change in the financial condition of the
     Company, any other Subsidiary Guarantor or any Subsidiary or any other fact

          (e)  notice of presentment for payment, demand, protest, and notice
     thereof as to the Notes or any other instrument;

          (f)  notice of any Default or Event of Default (except if such notice
     or demand is specifically otherwise required to be given to such Subsidiary
     Guarantor pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement);

          (g)  all other notices and demands to which such Subsidiary Guarantor
     might otherwise be entitled (except if such notice or demand is
     specifically otherwise required to be given to such Subsidiary Guarantor
     pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement);

          (h)  the right by statute or otherwise to require any holder of Notes
     to institute suit against the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor or
     to exhaust its rights and remedies against the Company or any other

                                 Exhibit B(SG)-3

<PAGE>

     if such Guaranteed Obligations were directly owing to the holders of Notes

          (i)  any defense of the Company under the Note Purchase Agreement and
     the Notes other than the full and timely performance thereof;

          (j)  any defense relating to the validity or enforceability (or
     absence or failure thereof) of any term of the Note Purchase Agreement and
     the Notes;

          (k)  any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense
     (other than the defense that the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been
     fully and finally performed and indefeasibly paid) of the Company or by
     reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of the
     Company in respect thereof, and any other defense that such Subsidiary
     Guarantor may otherwise have against the Company or any holder of Notes;

          (l)  any stay (except in connection with a pending appeal), valuation,
     appraisal, redemption or extension law now or at any time hereafter in
     force which, but for this waiver, might be applicable to any sale of
     property of such Subsidiary Guarantor made under any judgment, order or
     decree based on this Guarantee, and such Subsidiary Guarantor covenants
     that it will not at any time insist upon or plead, or in any manner claim
     or take the benefit or advantage of such law; and

          (m)  any other defense which a Subsidiary Guarantor may have to the
     full and complete performance of its obligations hereunder.

     2.4  Certain Waivers of Subrogation, Reimbursement and Indemnity.

     Until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been fully and finally
paid, no Subsidiary Guarantor shall have any right of subrogation, reimbursement

assets or property of the Company. Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the
liability of any of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder except the full and
final performance and indefeasible payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.

     Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors consents and agrees that, without notice
to or by such Subsidiary Guarantor and without impairing, releasing, abating,
deferring, suspending, reducing, terminating or otherwise affecting the
obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder, each holder of Notes, in the
manner provided in the Note Purchase Agreement, by action or inaction, may:

          (a)  compromise or settle, renew or extend the period of duration or
     the time for the payment, or discharge the performance of, or may refuse

     and the Notes; and

<PAGE>

     2.6  Marshaling.

     Each Subsidiary Guarantor consents and agrees that:

          (a)  each holder of Notes shall be under no obligation to marshal any
     assets in favor of such Subsidiary Guarantor or against or in payment of
     any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations; and

          (b)  to the extent the Company, another Subsidiary Guarantor or
     another guarantor makes a payment or payments to any holder of Notes, which
     payment or payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,
     declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, or required, for any
     of the foregoing reasons or for any other reason, to be repaid or paid over
     to a custodian, trustee, receiver, or any other party under any bankruptcy
     law, common law, or equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment or
     repayment, the obligation or part thereof intended to be satisfied thereby
     shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment
     or payments had not been made and such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be
     primarily liable for such obligation.

     2.7  Liability.

     Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that the liability of such Subsidiary
Guarantor in respect of this Guarantee shall be immediate and shall not be
contingent upon the exercise or enforcement by any holder of Notes of whatever
remedies such holder may have against the Company, any other Subsidiary
Guarantor or any other guarantor or the enforcement of any Lien or realization
upon any security such holder may at any time possess.

     2.8  Character of Obligation.

     The Guarantee set forth herein is a primary and original obligation of each
Subsidiary Guarantor and is an absolute, unconditional, continuing and
irrevocable guarantee of payment and performance (and not of collectibility) and
shall remain in full force and effect until the full, final and indefeasible
payment of the Guaranteed Obligations without respect to future changes in
conditions.

     The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder, to the extent that
there is more than one Subsidiary Guarantor, are joint and several. The
obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under this

                                 Exhibit B(SG)-6

<PAGE>

Guarantee and the rights of the holders of Notes to enforce such obligations by
any proceedings, whether by action at law, suit in equity or otherwise, shall
not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination, whether
by reason of any claim of any character whatsoever or otherwise, including,
without limitation, claims of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or
compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense, set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment or termination whatsoever.

     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each
Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise
affected by:

          (a)  any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the
     performance by the Company of any obligations of any kind or character
     whatsoever of the Company (including, without limitation, the obligations
     and undertakings of the Company under the Note Purchase Agreement);

          (b)  any creditors' rights, bankruptcy, receivership or other
     insolvency proceeding of the Company or any other Person or in respect of
     the property of the Company or any other Person or any merger,
     consolidation, reorganization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of
     the Company or any other Person;

          (c)  impossibility or illegality of performance on the part of the
     Company of its obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement or under the
     Notes;

          (d)  the validity or enforceability of the Note Purchase Agreement or
     the Notes;

          (e)  in respect of the Company or any other Person, any change of
     circumstances, whether or not foreseen or foreseeable, whether or not
     imputable to the Company or any other Person, or other impossibility of
     performance through fire, explosion, accident, labor disturbance, floods,
     droughts, embargoes, wars (whether or not declared), civil commotions, acts
     of God or the public enemy, delays or failure of suppliers or carriers,
     inability to obtain materials, action of any regulatory body or agency,
     change of law or any other causes affecting performance, or any other force
     majeure, whether or not beyond the control of the Company or any other
     Person and whether or not of the kind hereinbefore specified;

                                 Exhibit B(SG)-7

<PAGE>

          (f)  any order, judgment, decree, law, ruling or regulation (whether
     or not valid) of any court of any nation or of any political subdivision
     thereof or any body, agency, department, official or administrative or
     regulatory agency of any thereof or any other action, happening, event or
     reason whatsoever which shall delay, interfere with, hinder or prevent, or
     in any way adversely affect, the performance by any party of its respective
     obligations under any instruments; or

          (g)  any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense
     available to, or a discharge of, any Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the
     obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guarantee.

     2.9  No Election.

     Each holder of Notes shall have the right to seek recourse against each
Subsidiary Guarantor to the fullest extent provided for in this Guarantee and
against the Company to the fullest extent provided for in the Note Purchase
Agreement and the Notes. No election to proceed in one form of action or
proceeding, or against any party, or on any obligation, shall constitute a
waiver of the right of such holder of Notes to proceed in any other form of
action or proceeding or against other parties unless such holder of Notes has
expressly waived such right in writing. Specifically, but without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no action or proceeding by any holder of Notes
against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor under any document or instrument
evidencing obligations of the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor to such
holder of Notes shall serve to diminish the liability of any Subsidiary
Guarantor under this Guarantee except to the extent that such holder of Notes
finally and unconditionally shall have realized payment by such action or
proceeding, notwithstanding the effect of any such action or proceeding upon
such Subsidiary Guarantor's right of subrogation against the Company.

     2.10 Other Enforcement Rights.

     Each holder of Notes may proceed to protect and enforce this Guarantee by
suit or suits or proceedings in equity, at law or in bankruptcy, and whether for
the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein or in
execution or aid of any power herein granted or for the recovery of judgment for
or in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations or for the enforcement of any other
proper, legal or equitable remedy available under applicable law.

                                 Exhibit B(SG)-8

<PAGE>

     2.11 Delay or Omission; No Waiver.

     No course of dealing on the part of any holder of Notes and no delay or
failure on the part of such holder to exercise any right under the Note Purchase
Agreement, the Notes or this Guarantee shall impair such right or operate as a
waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers and
remedies hereunder. Every right and remedy given in or by this Guarantee or by
law to any holder of Notes may be exercised from time to time as often as may be
deemed expedient by such Person.

     2.12 Restoration of Rights and Remedies.

     If any holder of Notes shall have instituted any proceeding to enforce any
right or remedy contained in this Guarantee, under the Note Purchase Agreement
or under any Note held by such holder and such proceeding shall have been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined
adversely to such holder, then and in every such case each such holder, the
Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall, except as may be limited or
affected by any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and
respectively to its respective former positions hereunder and thereunder, and
thereafter the rights and remedies of such holder shall continue as though no
such proceeding had been instituted.

     2.13 Cumulative Remedies.

     No remedy under this Guarantee, the Note Purchase Agreement, or the Notes
is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, but each and every remedy shall
be cumulative and in addition to any and every other remedy given pursuant to
this Guarantee, the Note Purchase Agreement or the Notes.

     2.14 Survival.

     So long as the Guaranteed Obligations shall not have been fully and finally
performed and indefeasibly paid, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor
under this Guarantee shall survive the transfer and payment of any Note and the
payment in full of all the Notes.

     2.15 Miscellaneous.

                                 Exhibit B(SG)-9

<PAGE>

     If an Event of Default (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) exists,
then the holders of Notes (as provided in and subject to Section 12 of the Note
Purchase Agreement) shall have the right to declare all of the Guaranteed
Obligations to be, and such Guaranteed Obligations shall thereupon become,
forthwith due and payable, without any presentment, demand, protest or other
notice of any kind, all of which have been expressly waived by the Company and
the Subsidiary Guarantors, and notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing such declaration (or such Guaranteed Obligations from
becoming automatically due and payable) as against the Company. In any such
event, the holders of Notes shall have immediate recourse to each of the
Subsidiary Guarantors to the fullest extent set forth herein.

     Notwithstanding any provision in this Guarantee or the Note Purchase
Agreement to the contrary, each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that any
indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor owing to the Company or another
Subsidiary Guarantor shall be subordinated in right of payment to the Guaranteed
Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guarantee owing to the
holders of Notes.

     2.16 Termination.

     If the Company shall at any time be entitled to discharge any Subsidiary
Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.13 of the Note Purchase
Agreement, and shall have delivered the notices to the holders of the Notes
required pursuant thereto, then such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be discharged
from this Guarantee.

3.   MISCELLANEOUS

     3.1  Certain Representations and Warranties.

     Each Guarantor hereby confirms that each of the warranties and
representations contained in Section 5 of the Note Purchase Agreement is,
insofar as it refers to a Subsidiary specifically, or to the Subsidiaries
generally, true and correct with respect to such Guarantor. In addition to the
foregoing, each Guarantor represents and warrants that

          (a)  this Guarantee has been duly authorized by all necessary,
     corporate action on the part of such Guarantor and constitutes a legal,
     valid and binding obligation of such Guarantor, enforceable against it in
     accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
     (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
     similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
     (ii)

                                Exhibit B(SG)-10

<PAGE>

     general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
     considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and public policy;

          (b)  such Guarantor has the corporate power and authority to execute
     and deliver this Guarantee and to perform the provisions hereof; and

          (c)  the execution, delivery and performance by such Guarantor of this
     Guarantee will not (i) contravene, result in any breach of, or constitute a
     default under, or result in the creation of any Lien in respect of any
     property of such Guarantor under, any Material indenture, mortgage, deed of
     trust, loan, purchase or credit agreement or lease, or the memorandum and
     articles of association, corporate charter or bylaws of such Guarantor, or
     any other Material agreement or instrument to which such Guarantor is party
     or by which such Guarantor or any of its properties may be bound or
     affected, (ii) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms,
     conditions or provisions of any order, judgment, decree, or ruling of any
     court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority applicable to such Guarantor or
     (iii) violate any provision of any statute or other rule or regulation of
     any Governmental Authority applicable to such Guarantor.

     3.2  No Waiver.

     No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising on the part of the
holders of Notes or any of them of any right, power or privilege under this
Guarantee shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise
thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No waiver by
the holders of Notes, or any of them, shall be effective unless it is in writing
and any such waiver shall affect only the rights of that party under this
Guarantee.

     3.3  Governing Law.

     THIS GUARANTEE SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND THE
RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
EXCLUDING CHOICE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW OF SUCH STATE THAT WOULD REQUIRE
THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN SUCH STATE.
