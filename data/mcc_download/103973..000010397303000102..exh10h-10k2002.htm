&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the length of deferral of such deferred amounts, and the earnings thereon, in accordance with the terms of Section 5.3; and<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length of Deferral.</B><BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Participant who makes a deferral election as to any Plan Year may elect the length of such deferral by designating a Payout Year. Such election shall be irrevocable except as otherwise provided in Section 5.5. The deferral of Base Salary and the deferral of the Annual Bonus in any Plan Year shall be considered separate deferral elections and each may be deferred to a different Payout Year. Deferral elections are subject to the following limitations, unless the Committee permits otherwise:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Payout Year designated shall be no earlier than the second year following the end of the Plan Year in which the compensation deferred is earned; and<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Payout Year shall not be later than the year following the Participant's 65th birthday.<BR>
<BR>
All deferral elections are subject to Section 8(a), which requires an immediate lump-sum payment in the event of a Change in Control.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a deferral election is made and no Payout Year is designated, the Participant shall be deemed to have elected a deferral until the Payout Year following the year of the Participant's Retirement.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the Payout Years designated by a Participant pursuant to this Section 5.3 or the form of payout elected by a Participant pursuant to Section 5.4, if at any time prior to the end of any deferral period a Participant's employment with the Company is terminated for any reason other than Retirement or Disability (including termination of employment by reason of the Participant's death), (i) all Payout Years shall be accelerated to the year following the year in which the termination of the Participant's employment occurs, and (ii) all deferred amounts, and the earnings thereon, for all Plan Years shall be paid to the Participant in a single lump-sum cash payment.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Internal Revenue Service determines that a Participant or beneficiary is subject to federal income tax on an amount credited to the Participant's account under the Plan before that amount would otherwise become payable under the Plan, the amount that is then subject to tax shall be paid to the Participant or beneficiary in a single lump-sum cash payment as soon as practicable after the Committee is notified or the Internal Revenue Service's determination.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Form of Payout.</B><BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each participant who makes a deferral election as to any Plan Year may elect as the form of payout either (i) a single lump-sum payment or (ii) up to fifteen approximately equal annual installment payments (such number to be specified by the Participant); provided that all compensation (whether Base Salary or Annual Bonus) deferred to a specific Payout Year (regardless of the Plan Year for which the compensation is deferred) shall be payable in the same form. Such election shall be irrevocable except as otherwise provided in Section 5.5. If no such election is made, then all deferred amounts, and the earnings thereon, shall be paid in the form of a single lump-sum payment. All deferral elections are subject to Section 8(a), which requires an immediate lump-sum payment in the event of a Change in Control<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lump-sum and installment payments shall be made on the following terms:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Lump-Sum Payment</U>. Each payout to be made in the form of a single lump-sum payment shall be made in cash on or before the last business day of March in the Payout Year.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Installment Payments</U>. The first installment payment of a payout to be made in installments shall be made in cash on or before the last business day of March in the Payout Year. The remaining installment payments shall be made in cash each year thereafter, on or before the last business day of March of such year, until the entire balance of such Participant's applicable account has been paid in full. Earnings shall continue to accrue to the Participant's account during the payment period. The amount of each installment payment shall be equal to the balance remaining in the applicable account immediately prior to each such payment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one, and the denominator of which is the number of installment payments remaining (including the installment payment immediately due).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the termination of the employment of a Participant due to Retirement or Disability, notwithstanding the forms of payout elected by a Participant pursuant to this Section 5.4 for all remaining Payout Years, if, on the date any lump-sum or installment payment is due, the payment to be made would cause the aggregate amount of all of the Participant's account balances under the Plan to fall below $50,000, then the amount due, and the remaining balance of each of the Participant's accounts, shall be paid to such Participant on such date in a single lump-sum cash payment.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.4, if a Participant is a "covered employee" (within the meaning of Section 162(m)(3) of the Code) when a payment is scheduled to be made under the Plan, any portion of the payment that would be nondeductible under Section 162(m) of the Code (when considered with all other compensation that the Participant is expected to receive in the same taxable year) shall be deferred, and shall be paid on the earliest date on which it would be deductible under Section 162(m).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Company fails to make any payment due under the Plan within 90 days after it first becomes due, the Committee shall direct the trustee of the Rabbi Trust to make the payment from the Rabbi Trust (to the extent there are assets in the Rabbi Trust available to make the payment).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change in Deferral Election.</B><BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Postponement With Committee Consent</U>. A Participant may petition the Committee to allow a change from the Payout Year he has previously elected to a later Payout Year, or to allow an increase in the number of payments he has previously elected, or both. The Participant's request may relate to all or any part of the Base Salary and Annual Bonus (and related investment returns) earned in the same calendar year, and may relate to all or any part of the amounts that are otherwise scheduled to be paid in the same Payout Year. The Committee may grant or refuse the Participant's request. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, suspend the Participant's right to make additional deferrals under the Plan for a period following the effective date of the change in the Participant's deferral election. Any change in a Participant's deferral election shall be effective no earlier than twelve months after the request was granted, and shall not apply to any amount that was otherwise scheduled to be paid to the Participant before the effective date of the election. Once a Participant has changed the Payout Year, the number of payments, or both with respect to amounts earned in a single calendar year, the Participant may not make another change in the time or number of payments for amounts earned in the same calendar year. The Participant may, however, make other changes in the time or number of payments for amounts originally scheduled to be paid in the same Payout Year, provided that those amounts were earned in different calendar years.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Change With Early Payment Penalty</U>. A Participant may elect to receive an early payout of all or any portion of the deferral amount, and the earnings thereon, with respect to any Payout Year in the form of a single lump-sum cash payment. As a penalty for early payout, the Participant shall forfeit an amount equal to 10% of the amount requested as a payout, such that the actual payment shall be equal to 90% of the amount by which the balance of the Participant's account for such Payout Year is reduced. Such payout shall be made as soon as practicable following the receipt of the Participant's request.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Change As a Result of Financial Hardship</U>. If a Participant establishes, to the satisfaction of the Committee, severe financial hardship, the Committee may:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authorize the cessation of deferrals by such Participant;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide that all or a portion of the amounts previously deferred by the Participant shall immediately be paid in a single lump-sum cash payment;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide that all or a portion of the installments payable over a period of time shall be paid immediately in a single lump-sum cash payment; or<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide for such other payment schedule as deemed appropriate by the Committee under the circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Hardship Criteria</U>. Severe financial hardship will be deemed to exist in the event of an unanticipated emergency that is caused by the Participant's long and serious illness, impending bankruptcy, or a similar event that is beyond the control of the Participant and that would result in severe financial hardship to the Participant if cessation of deferrals or modified payments were not permitted. The amount distributed pursuant to Section 5.5(c) shall not exceed that amount which the Committee determines to be reasonably necessary for the Participant to meet the financial hardship at the time of distribution.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Other Criteria</U>. The Committee's decision with respect to the manner, if at all, in which the Participant's future deferral opportunities shall cease, and/or the manner in which, if at all, the payment of deferred amounts to the Participant shall be modified, shall be final, conclusive, and not subject to appeal. If a Participant is a "covered employee" (within the meaning of Section 162(m)(3) of the Code), any change in the Participant's payout election shall be subject to the limitation described in Section 5.4(d).<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participant's Accounts.</B><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company shall establish and maintain a separate bookkeeping account for each deferral made by a Participant, and the earnings thereon. Deferrals shall be credited to a Participant's account as of the date the amount deferred otherwise would have become due and payable to such Participant. Each Participant shall be furnished a statement of his deferred compensation account balances at least annually.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment and maintenance of such deferred compensation accounts by the Company shall not be construed as entitling any Participant to any specific assets of the Company. The rights of Participants to receive any distribution under the Plan shall be an unsecured claim against the general assets of the Company.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment Returns on Deferred Amounts.</B><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All compensation deferred by a Participant pursuant to Section 5.1 shall be deemed invested, as directed by the Participant, in one or more of the investment alternatives made available from time to time by the Committee. Each such investment election shall be made (i) by means of the execution by the Participant and delivery to the Company of a "New Investment Election Form" or (ii) by means of such other methods as the Committee shall approve. The Committee shall specify the available investment alternatives and may adopt such rules and procedures for the allocation of deferrals among such investment alternatives as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate. An investment election shall be effective for all subsequent deferrals under the Plan until the Participant makes a new investment election.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Participant shall be permitted, at any time and from time to time, to reallocate his deferred compensation account balances under the Plan among the investment alternatives then available, subject to right of the Committee to impose such restrictions on a Participant's ability to change investment elections as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate. The election of a Participant to reallocate account balances shall be made by means of a form provided to the Participant by the Committee for such purpose, and shall become effective as soon as practicable after a properly-executed form is received by the Committee from the Participant.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balances of each Participant's deferred compensation accounts shall be credited with earning and charged with losses based upon the actual results that would have been achieved had such balances actually been invested pursuant to the investment elections of the Participant.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company shall have no obligation to invest the compensation deferred under the Plan, or the earnings thereon, in any of the investment alternatives selected by Participants.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charges Against Accounts.</B>  All payments made to a Participant under the Plan shall be charged against such Participant's accounts when and as made.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Article 7. Rabbi Trust</B><BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishment of a Rabbi Trust.</B>  As soon as administratively practicable following the Effective Date, the Company shall establish an irrevocable Rabbi Trust to accumulate assets that will assist the Company in meeting its obligation under the Plan. The Rabbi Trust shall have an independent trustee that is selected by the Company. The trust agreement with respect to the Rabbi Trust shall provide that the assets of the Rabbi Trust shall at all times be specifically subject to the claims of the Company's general creditors in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency (as defined by the Rabbi Trust Agreement) of the Company.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding of the Rabbi Trust.</B>  The Company may contribute cash, Company Stock, or any other asset to the Rabbi Trust, as the Company deems appropriate. It is intended that the Rabbi Trust will hold assets with a value approximately equal to the Accrued Rabbi Trust Obligations.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Article 8. Change in Control<BR>
</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change In Control.</B>  Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company shall, within ten business days after the Change in Control, accelerate all deferred amounts to the date of the Change in Control and pay all such deferred amounts, and the earnings thereon, to each Participant or Beneficiary in a single lump-sum cash payment.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of the Committee immediately prior to the Change in Control shall not be changed after the Change in Control, except with the consent of a majority of the Continuing Directors. If, after the Change in Control, a member of the Committee resigns or is unable to serve due to death or disability, the remaining members of the Committee shall appoint a replacement.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company promptly shall reimburse a Participant for all legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred in successfully enforcing any right or benefit under the Plan.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Article 9.  Beneficiary Designation<BR>
</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designation of Beneficiary.</B>  Each Participant may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries who, upon the Participant's death, will receive the amounts that otherwise would have been paid to the Participant under the Plan. All such designations shall be signed by the Participant, and shall be in such form as is prescribed by the Committee. Each designation shall be effective as of the date delivered to the Committee (or to a Company employee appointed by the Committee to receive such designations); provided that the Committee must receive any beneficiary designation or change therein before the Participant's death. A Participant may change his beneficiary designation at any time and from time to time on such form as is prescribed by the Committee. In the event of the death of the Participant, the payment of all amounts deferred under the Plan, and the earnings thereon, shall be in accordance with the last written beneficiary designation signed and delivered by the Participant and not revoked.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment to Beneficiary.</B>  If a Participant dies before the end of the deferral period for any amount under the Plan, the payment of that amount to the Participant's beneficiary or beneficiaries shall be made in a single lump-sum cash payment as provided in Section 5.3. If a Participant dies after installment payments have commenced, but before they have been completed, the remaining payments shall be made to the Participant's beneficiary or beneficiaries under the installment schedule elected by the Participant.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death of Beneficiary.</B>  In the event that all the beneficiaries of a Participant predecease the Participant, all amounts deferred under the Plan, and the earnings thereon, that would have been paid to the Participant under the Plan shall be paid in a single lump-sum cash payment to the Participant's estate, or to the person or persons designated in writing by the Participant's estate.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>9.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ineffective Designation.</B>  In the event a Participant does not designate a beneficiary, or for any reason such designation is ineffective, in whole or in part, the amounts that otherwise would have been paid to the Participant under the Plan shall be paid in a single lump-sum cash payment to the Participant's estate.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Article 10.  Withholding of Taxes<BR>
</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company shall have the right to either (i) require Participants to remit to the Company, or any person or entity designated by the Committee to administer the Plan, an amount sufficient to satisfy any applicable federal, state, and local income and employment tax withholding requirements or (ii) to deduct from any payment made pursuant to the Plan amounts sufficient to satisfy such withholding requirements.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Article 11. Amendment and Termination<BR>
</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has the right to amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan at any time by action of the Board of Directors, except that (i) no such amendment, suspension, or termination shall, without the written consent of a Participant, change the time or form of any payout under the Plan or otherwise adversely affect, in any material respect, such Participant's rights with respect to amounts theretofore deferred under the Plan, and the earnings thereon, and (ii) following a Change in Control, the Company shall not amend Section 5.4(e), Articles 3, 7 or 8, or this Article 11, and shall not amend any other provision of the Plan in a manner that would alter the effect of Section 5.4(e), Articles 3, 7 or 8, or this Article 11.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Article 12.  Miscellaneous<BR>
</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>12.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment.</B>  No provision of the Plan, nor any action taken by the Committee or the Company pursuant to the Plan, shall give or be construed as giving a Participant any right to be retained in the employ of the Company, or affect or limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate his employment.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>12.2</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Notice</B>. Any notice required or permitted to be given to the Committee or the Company under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, sent by registered or certified mail, or deliver in any other manner authorized by the Committee, to the Committee (or to a person designated by the Committee to receive such notices).  Such notices, if mailed, shall be addressed to the principal executive offices of the Company.  Notice to any Participant shall be given in any manner authorized by the Committee and, if mailed, shall be sent to the Participant's address as is set forth in the records of the Company.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>12.3</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Unfunded Plan</B>. This Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. The Plan is intended primarily to provide deferred compensation benefits for "a select group of management or highly compensated employees" within the meaning of Sections 201, 301, and 401 of ERISA, and therefore is further intended to be exempt from the provisions of Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Title&nbsp;I of ERISA.  The Committee may terminate the Plan for any or all Participants, subject to Article 11, in order to achieve and maintain these intended results.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>12.4</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Successors</B>. All obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect merger or consolidation, the purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or otherwise.  The provision of the Plan with respect to each Participant shall be binding on such Participant's heirs, executors, administrators or other successors in interest.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>12.5</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Nontransferability</B>. The Committee may recognize the right of an alternate payee named in a domestic relations order to receive all or a portion of a Participant's benefit under the Plan, provided that (i) the domestic relations order would be a "qualified domestic relations order" within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code if Section 414(p) were applicable to the Plan, (ii) the domestic relations order does not purport to give the alternate payee any right to assets of the Company or its affiliates, and (iii) the domestic relations order does not purport to give the alternate payee any right to receive payments under the Plan before the Participant is eligible to receive such payments.  Except as set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to domestic relations orders, and except as required under applicable federal, state, or local laws concerning the withholding of tax, the rights of any Participant or beneficiary to amounts deferred under the Plan, and the earnings thereon, are not subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or any beneficiary, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In no event shall the Company make any payment under the Plan to any assignee or creditor of a Participant or beneficiary.<BR>
