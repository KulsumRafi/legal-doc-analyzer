         This FIRST AMENDMENT TO LEASE (this "Amendment") is made this 5th day
of August, 1997, by and between WRC PROPERTIES, INC. ("Landlord") and ICOS

                                    RECITALS

         Landlord is landlord and Tenant is the tenant under that certain Lease
dated for reference purposes December 20, 1996 (the "Premier South Lease"), for
premises located at 22025 20th Avenue S.E., Bothell, Washington 98021 (the
"Premises"). The legal description of the land on which the Premises is located
is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

         Tenant simultaneously leases from Landlord in the same building as the
Premises, space consisting of 1,511 rentable square feet (the "1,511 RSF Space")
pursuant to a lease between Landlord and Tenant dated for reference purposes
February 26, 1992, as amended by First Amendment dated for reference purposes
August 21, 1992 (the "Premier North Lease").

         By amendment to the Premier North Lease executed simultaneously
herewith, Landlord and Tenant have agreed that, effective September 15, 1997,
the 1,511 RSF Space shall be deleted from the premises under the Premier North
Lease. Landlord and Tenant agree that effective September 15, 1997, the 1,511
RSF Space shall be added to the Premises under the Premier South Lease and
simultaneously therewith the Base Monthly Rent and pro rata charges based on
Tenant's square footage under lease shall be adjusted to reflect the addition of
the 1,511 RSF Space.

         Except as specifically provided herein, all capitalized terms shall
have the meanings assigned in the Premier South Lease.


                                    AGREEMENT

         NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

         Effective September 15, 1997, the 1,511 RSF Space shall be added to the
Premises under the Premier South Lease. With such addition, the rentable square
footage of the Premises under the Premier South Lease is 17,496 square feet and
all charges under the Premier South Lease based on Tenant's pro rata square
footage under lease shall reflect that square footage.

         The Base Monthly Rent schedule for the Premier South Lease shall be as
follows, provided that the schedule shall not apply to any period prior to
September 15, 1997, such prior period being governed by the Premier South Lease
without reference to this First Amendment:
