              Governmental Agency:

              (i)    the Standby Redraw Facility Provider incurs a cost as a
                     result of its having entered into or performing its
                     obligations under this Agreement or as a result of any

                     Advances made under this Agreement,

              then from time to time on notification by the Standby Redraw
