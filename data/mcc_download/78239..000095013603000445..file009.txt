                                     CONSENT


                  This Consent dated as of February 12, 2003. Reference is made
to the First Amendment and Waiver Agreement, dated as of December 13, 2002 (the
"Amendment Agreement"), to the Credit Agreement, dated as of October 17, 2002
(as the same may be further amended, supplemented or modified from time to time
in accordance with its terms, the "Credit Agreement") among PHILLIPS-VAN HEUSEN
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation, THE IZOD CORPORATION, a Pennsylvania
corporation, PVH WHOLESALE CORP., a Delaware corporation, PVH RETAIL CORP., a
Delaware corporation, IZOD.COM INC., a Delaware corporation, G.H. BASS
FRANCHISES INC., a Delaware corporation, CD GROUP INC., a Delaware corporation,
the LENDERS party thereto, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, as Administrative Agent and
Collateral Agent, Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner, FLEET RETAIL FINANCE INC.,
as Co-Arranger and Co-Syndication-Agent, SUN TRUST BANK, as Co-Syndication
Agent, THE CIT GROUP/COMMERCIAL SERVICES, INC., as Co-Documentation Agent and
BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., as Co-Documentation Agent. Terms used herein and not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings attributed thereto in the
Credit Agreement (as amended by the Amendment Agreement).

                  Pursuant to the terms of the Amendment Agreement, and as
provided in Section 1.12 thereof, the Administrative Agent is permitted to
approve amendments to the Schedules provided that such amendments do not have
the effect of waiving a Default without the consent of the Required Lenders.

                  The amended Schedules which are annexed to this Consent
provide for up to $2,000,000 of letters of credit issued in Italy for the
account of Calvin Klein Europe S.r.L.. (Italy) and also provide for unsecured
lines of credit up to $30,000,000 from CKI to Calvin Klein (Europe II) Corp. in
connection with Calvin Klein stores in London and Paris. Both such items
constitute Indebtedness which is not presently permitted under the terms of the
Credit Agreement. The Lenders, by executing and delivering this Consent, hereby
specifically authorize the Administrative Agent to approve the amended Schedules
and permit the additional Indebtedness described therein.

                  Section 1.10 of the Amendment Agreement restated in its
entirety Section 6.06 of the Credit Agreement dealing with Restricted Payments.
One of the purposes of such restatement was to provide relief for PVH with
respect to cash dividends on its common stock in fiscal year 2003 by modifying
the requirements with respect to Average Availability and Covenant Availability.
Through inadvertent error, such relief was provided with respect to Average
Availability, but not with respect to Covenant Availability. Accordingly, the
Lenders, by executing and delivering this Consent, hereby agree to a
substitution of page 10 of the

<PAGE>

Amendment Agreement in the form annexed hereto indicating the change proposed to
correct the previous error for the existing page 10 in the Amendment Agreement.

                  The parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, have
executed and delivered the foregoing Consent as of the day and year first above
written.
