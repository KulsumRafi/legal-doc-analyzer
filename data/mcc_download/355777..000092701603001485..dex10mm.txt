Dear                          :
     -------------------------

        LoJack Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"),
considers the establishment and maintenance of a sound and vital management to
be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company and
its shareholders. In this connection, the Company recognizes that, as is the
case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a change in
control may arise and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions
which it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction
of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders.
Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined
that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued
attention and dedication of members of the Company's management to their
assigned duties without distraction in circumstances arising from the
possibility of a change in control of the Company. In particular, the Board
believes it important, should the Company or its shareholders receive a proposal
for transfer of control of the Company, that you be able to assess and advise
the Board whether such proposal would be in, the best interests of the Company
and its shareholders and to take such other action regarding such proposal as
the Board might determine to be appropriate, without being influenced by the
uncertainties our own situation.

        In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company, this
letter agreement, which has been approved by the Board, sets forth the severance
benefits which the Company agrees will be provided to you in the event your
employment with the Company is terminated subsequent to a "change in control" of
the Company under the circumstances described below.

        1.      Agreement to Provide Services: Right to Terminate.

                (i)     Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (ii) below,
        the Company or you may terminate your employment at any time, subject to
        the Company's providing the benefits hereinafter specified in accordance
        with the terms hereof.

                (ii)    In the event a tender offer or exchange offer is made by
        a Person (as hereinafter defined) for more than 35% of the combined
        voting power of the Company's outstanding securities ordinarily having
        the right to vote at elections of directors ("Outstanding Company Voting
        Securities"), including shares of common stock ($.01 par value) of the
        Company (the "Stock"), you agree that you will not leave the employ of
        the Company (other than as a result of Disability or upon Retirement, as
        such terms are hereinafter defined) and will render the services
        contemplated in the recitals to this Agreement until such tender offer
        or exchange offer has been abandoned or terminated or a change in
        control of the Company, as defined in Section 3 hereof, has occurred.
        For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Person" shall mean and include
        any individual, corporation, partnership, group, association or other
        "person," as such term is defined in Section 3(a)(9) and as used in
        Section 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange
        Act"), other than the Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
        or any employee benefit plan(s) sponsored by the Company or a subsidiary
        of the Company.

        2.      Term of Agreement. This Agreement shall commence on the date
hereof and shall continue in effect until February 28, 2004; provided, however,
that this Agreement shall continue in effect for a period of twenty-four (24)
months after a change in control of the Company, as defined in Section 3 hereof,
if such change in control shall have occurred during the term of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2 to the contrary, this Agreement shall
terminate if you or the Company terminates your employment prior to a change in
control of the Company as provided in Section 1 (i) above.

        3.      Change in Control. For the purposes of this Agreement a "Change
in Control" shall mean:

                (i)     The acquisition by any Person of beneficial ownership
        (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of
        35% or more of either (i) the then outstanding shares of the Stock or
        (ii) the combined voting power of the Outstanding Company Voting
        Securities; provided, however, that the following acquisitions shall not
        constitute a Change of Control: (A) any acquisition directly from the
        Company (excluding an acquisition by virtue of the exercise of a
        conversion privilege), (B) any acquisition by the Company or by any

        corporation controlled by the Company; (C) any acquisition by any
        employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the
        Company or any corporation controlled by the Company; or (D) any
        acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a consolidation or merger,
        if, following such consolidation or merger, the conditions described in
        clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of subsection (c) of this paragraph are
        satisfied; or

                (ii)    Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the
        Board (the "Incumbent Board") ceasing for any reason to constitute at
        least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual
        becoming a director (other than a director designated by a Person who
        has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a transaction
        described in clauses (a) or (c) of this Section) subsequent to the date
        hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's
        shareholders, was approved by a vote or resolution of at least a
        majority of the directors then composing the Incumbent Board shall be
        considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent
        Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose
        initial assumption of office occurs as a result of either an actual or
        threatened election contest (as such terms are used in Rule 14a-1l of
        Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) or other actual or
        threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
        Person other than the Board; or

                (iii)   Adoption by the Board of a resolution approving an
        agreement of consolidation of the Company with or merger of the Company
        into another corporation or business entity in each case, unless,
        following such consolidation, or merger, (i) more than 60% of,
        respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the
        corporation resulting from such consolidation or merger and/or the
        combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such
        corporation or business entity entitled to vote generally in the
        election of directors (or other persons having the general power to
        direct the affairs of such entity) is then beneficially owned, directly
        or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and
        entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Stock and
        Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such
        consolidation or merger in substantially the same proportions as their
        ownership, immediately prior to such consolidation or merger, of the
        Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be,
        (ii) no Person (excluding the Company, any employee benefit plan (or
        related trust) of the Company or such corporation or other business
        entity resulting from such consolidation or merger and any Person

        securities of such corporation or business entity entitled to vote
        generally in the election of its directors (or other persons having the
        general power to direct the affairs of such entity) and (iii) at least a
        majority of the members of the board of directors (or other group of
        persons having the general power to direct the affairs of the
        corporation or other business entity) resulting from such consolidation
        or merger were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the
        execution of the initial agreement providing for such consolidation or
        merger; provided, that any right to receive compensation pursuant to
        Section 5 below which shall vest by reason of the action of the Board
        pursuant to this subsection (c) shall be divested upon (A) the rejection
        of such agreement of consolidation or merger by the stockholders of the
        Company or (B) its abandonment by either party thereto in accordance
        with its terms; or

                (iv)    Adoption by the requisite majority of the whole Board,
        or by the holders of such majority of stock of the Company as is
        required by law or by the Certificate of incorporation or By-Laws of the
        Company as then in effect, of a resolution or consent authorizing (i)
        the dissolution of the Company or (ii) the sale or other disposition of
        all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, other than to a

        the then outstanding shares of common stock of such corporation and/or
        the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of such
        corporation or other entity to vote generally in the election of its
        directors (or other persons have the general power to direct its
        affairs) is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or
        substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the:
        beneficial owners, respectively, of the Stock and Outstanding Company
        Voting Securities immediately prior to such sale or other disposition in
        substantially the same proportion as their ownership, immediately prior
        to such sale or other disposition, of the Stock and/or Outstanding
        Company Voting Securities, as the case may be, (B) no Person (excluding
        the Company and any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the
        Company or such corporation or other business entity and any Person
        beneficially owning, immediately prior to such sale or other
        disposition, directly or indirectly, 35% or more of the Stock and/or

        execution of the initial agreement of action of the Board providing for
        such sale or other disposition of assets of the Company; provided, that
        any right to receive compensation pursuant to Section 5 below which
        shall vest by reason of the action of the Board or the stockholders
        pursuant to this subsection shall be divested upon the abandonment by
        the Company of such dissolution, or such sale of or other disposition of
        assets, as the case may be.

                Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, no

        Agreement by virtue of any transaction which results in you, or a group
        of Persons which includes you acquiring, directly or indirectly, 35% or
        more of the combined voting power of the Company's Outstanding Voting
        Securities.

        4.      Termination Following a Change in Control. If any of the events
described in Section 3 hereof constituting a change in control of the Company
shall have occurred, you shall be entitled to the benefits provided in Section 5
hereof upon the termination of your employment with the Company within

                (i)     Disability. Termination by the company of your
        employment based on "Disability" shall mean termination because of your
        absence from your duties with the Company on a full time basis for one
        hundred twenty (120) consecutive days as a result of your incapacity due
        to physical or mental illness, unless within thirty (30) days after
        Notice of Termination (as hereinafter defined) is given to you following

        your duties.

                (ii)    Retirement. Termination by you or by the Company of your
        employment based on "Retirement" shall mean termination on or after your
        normal retirement date as defined in the Company's Pension Plan (or any
        successor or substitute plan or plans of the Company put into effect
        prior to a change in control) (the "Pension Plan").

                (iii)   Notice of Termination. Any purported termination by the
        Company or by you following a change in control shall be communicated by
        written Notice of Termination to the other party hereto. For purposes of
        this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice which
        shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement
        relied upon.

                (iv)    Date of Termination. "Date of Termination" following a
        change in control shall mean (a) if your employment is to be terminated
        for Disability, thirty (30) days after Notice of Termination is given

        the Company, the date specified in the Notice of Termination, which in
        no event shall be a date earlier than ninety (90) days after the date on
        which a Notice of Termination is given, unless an earlier date has been
        expressly agreed to by you in writing either in advance of, or after,
        receiving such Notice of Termination.

        5.      Compensation Upon Termination or During Disability; other
Agreements.

                (i)     During any period following a change in control of the
        Company that you fail to perform your duties as a result of incapacity
        due to physical or mental illness, you shall continue to receive your
        salary at the rate then in effect and any benefits or awards under any
        Plans shall continue to accrue during such period, to the extent not
        inconsistent with such Plans, until your employment is terminated
        pursuant to and in accordance with paragraphs 4(i) and 4 (iii) hereof.
        Thereafter, your benefits shall be determined in accordance with the
        Plans then in effect.

                (ii)    Subject to Section 8 hereof, if, within twenty-four (24)

        above, shall have occurred, your employment by the Company shall be
        terminated (a) by the Company other than for Disability or Retirement,
        or (b) by you for any reason, then the Company shall pay to you, no
        later than the fifth day following the Date of Termination, without
        regard to any contrary provisions of any Plan, the following:

        (A)     (x) your salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in
effect just prior to the time a Notice of Termination is given (or, if higher,
as in effect immediately prior to the change in control) and (y) any benefits or
awards (including both the cash and stock components) which pursuant to the
terms of any Plans have been earned or become payable, but which have not yet
been paid to you; and

<PAGE>

        (B)     you shall receive an amount equal to 1.5 times your calendar
year earnings from the Company, consisting for the purposes of this Agreement of
average base salary during the period consisting of the five (5) most recent
consecutive calendar years (or fewer than 5, if applicable) ending on or before
the date of the change of control, plus the highest bonus paid for any such
year. For purposes of computing payment under this Agreement, compensation for
any partial calendar year, including the year during which a change of control
occurs, shall be annualized, and any bonus shall be considered compensation for
the year to which it is attributable, if different from the year in which it is
paid.

                (iii)   if, within twenty-four (24) months after a change in
        control of the Company, as defined in Section 3 above, shall have
        occurred, your employment by the Company shall be terminated (a) by the
        Company other than for Disability or Retirement or (b) by you, then the
        Company shall maintain in full force and effect, for the continued
        benefit of you and your dependents for a period terminating on the
        earliest of (a) thirty months after the Date of Termination, (b) the
        commencement date of equivalent benefits from a new employer or (c) your
        normal retirement date under the terms of the Retirement Plan, all
        insured and self-insured employee welfare benefit Plans in which you
        were entitled to participate immediately prior to the Date of
        Termination, provided that your continued participation is possible
        under the general terms and provisions of such Plans (and any applicable
        funding media) and you continue to pay an amount equal to your regular
        contribution under such plans for such participation. In the event that
        your participation in any such Plan is barred, the Company, at its sole
        cost and expense, shall arrange to have issued for the benefit of you
        and your dependents individual policies of insurance providing benefits
        substantially similar (on an after-tax basis) to those which you
        otherwise would have been entitled to receive under such Plans pursuant
        to this paragraph (iv) or, if such insurance is not available at a
        reasonable cost to the Company, the Company shall otherwise provide you
        and your dependents with equivalent benefits (on an after-tax basis).
        You shall not be required to pay any premiums or other charges in an
        amount greater than that which you would have paid in order to
        participate in such Plans. If, at the end of three years after the
        Termination Date, you have not reached your normal retirement date, you
        are participating in any of such Plans and you have not previously
        received or are not then receiving equivalent benefits from a new
        employer, the Company shall arrange, at its sole cost and expense, to
        enable you to convert your and your dependents' coverage under such
        Plans to individual policies or programs upon the same terms as
        employees of the Company may apply for such conversions.

                (iv)    Except as specifically provided in paragraph (iii)
        above, the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 5 shall
        not be reduced, offset or subject to recovery by the Company by reason
        of any compensation earned by you as the result of employment by another
        employer after the Date of Termination, or otherwise.

        6.      Successors; Binding Agreement.

                (i)     The Company will seek, by written request at least five
        business days prior to the time a Person becomes a Successor (as
        hereinafter defined), to have such Person assent to the fulfillment of
        the Company's obligations under this Agreement. For purposes of this
        Agreement, "successor" shall mean any Person that succeeds to, or has
        the practical ability to control (either immediately or with the passage
        of time), the Company's business directly, by merger or consolidation,
        or indirectly, by purchase of the Company's voting securities or
        otherwise.

                (ii)    This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
        enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, executors,
        administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.
        If you should die while any amount would still be payable to you
        hereunder if you had continued to live, all such amounts, unless
        otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of
        this Agreement to your devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there
        be no such designee, to your estate.

                (iii)   For purposes of this Agreement, the "Company" shall
        include any corporation or other entry which is the surviving or
        continuing entity in respect of any merger, consolidation or form of
        business combination in which the Company ceases to exist.

        7.      Fees and Expenses; Mitigation.

                (i)     The Company shall reimburse you, on a current basis, for
        all reasonable legal fees and related expenses incurred by you in
        connection with the Agreement following a change in control of the
        Company, including, without limitation, (a) all such fees and expenses,
        if any, incurred in contesting or disputing any termination of your
        employment or incurred by you in seeking advice with respect to the
        matters set forth in Section 8 hereof or (b) your seeking to obtain or
        enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement, in each case,
        regardless of whether or not your claim is upheld by a court of
        competent jurisdiction; provided, however, you shall

<PAGE>

        be required to repay any such amounts to the Company to the extent that
        a court issues a final and non-appealable order setting forth the
        determination that the position taken by you was frivolous or advanced
        by you in bad faith.

                (ii)    You shall not be required to mitigate the amount the
        Company becomes obligated to make to you in connection with this
        Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise.

        8.      Taxes.

                (i)     All payments to be made to you under this Agreement will
        be subject to required withholding of federal, state and local income
        and employment taxes.

                (ii)    Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the
        contrary, if any of the payments provided for in this Agreement,
        together with any other payments which you have the right to receive
        from the Company or any corporation which is a member of an "affiliated
        group" (as defined in Section 1504 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
        1986 (the "Code") without regard to Section 1504(b) of the Code) of
        which the Company is a member, would constitute a "parachute payment"
        (as defined in Section 2BOG (b) (2) of the Code), the payments pursuant
        to this Agreement shall be reduced (reducing first the payments under
        Section 5 (iii) (B) ) to the largest amount as will result in no portion
        of such payments being subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999
        of the Code; provided, however, that the determination as to whether any
        reduction in the payments under this Agreement pursuant to this proviso
        is necessary shall be made by you in good faith, and such determination
        shall be conclusive and binding on the Company with respect to its
        treatment of the payment for tax reporting purposes.

        9.      Survival. The respective obligations of, and benefits afforded
to, the Company and you as provided in Sections 5, 6 (ii), 7, 8, 13 and 14 of
this Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement.

        10.     Notice. For the purposes of this Agreement, notices and all
other communications provided for in the Agreement shall be in writing and shall
be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed by United States
registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid and addressed, in the
case of the Company, to the address set forth on the first page of this
Agreement or, in the case of the undersigned employee, to the address set forth

the other in writing in accordance herewith, except that notice of change of
address shall be effective only upon receipt.

        11.     Miscellaneous. No provision of this Agreement may be modified,
waived or discharged unless such modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to
in a writing signed by you and an officer or other person authorized by the
Board to act on its behalf in this matter. No waiver by either party hereto at
any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or of compliance with, any
condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party
shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at
the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or representations,
