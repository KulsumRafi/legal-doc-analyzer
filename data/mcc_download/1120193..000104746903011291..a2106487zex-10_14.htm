required, the Accounting Firm shall provide its determination (the "Determination"), together with detailed supporting calculations regarding the amount of any Gross-Up Payment and any other relevant
matter both to the Company and the Executive by no later than ten (10) days following the Termination Date, if applicable, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company or the Executive (if the
Executive reasonably believes that any of the Total Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax). If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall furnish the
Executive and the Company with a written statement that such Accounting Firm has concluded that no Excise Tax is payable (including the reasons therefor) and that the Executive has substantial
authority not to report any Excise Tax on his federal income tax return. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a Gross-Up Payment is determined to be payable, it shall be paid to the Executive within twenty (20) days after the Determination (and all accompanying calculations
and other material supporting the Determination) is delivered to the Company by the Accounting Firm. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive,
absent manifest error. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a result of uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is
possible that Gross-Up Payments not made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), or the Gross-Up Payments will have been made by the Company which should not have been made
("Overpayment"). In either such event, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment or Overpayment that has occurred. In the case of an Underpayment, the amount of such
Underpayment (together with any interest and penalties payable by the Executive as a result of such Underpayment) shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the case of an Overpayment, the Executive shall, at the direction and expense of the Company, take such steps as are reasonably necessary (including the filing of
returns and claims for refund), follow reasonable instructions from, and procedures established by, the Company, and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Company to correct such Overpayment,
provided, however, that (i)&nbsp;the Executive shall not in any event be obligated to return to the Company an amount greater than the net after-tax portion of the Overpayment that he has retained
or has recovered as a refund from the applicable taxing authorities and (ii)&nbsp;this provision shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the intent of Section&nbsp;9(f)(i), which is to
make the Executive whole, on an after-tax basis, from the application of the Excise Taxes, it being acknowledged and understood that the correction of an Overpayment may result in the Executive
repaying to the Company an amount which is less than the Overpayment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service relating to the possible application of the Excise Tax under
Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code to any of the payments and amounts referred to herein and shall afford the Company, at its expense, the opportunity to control the defense of such claim. </FONT></P>
