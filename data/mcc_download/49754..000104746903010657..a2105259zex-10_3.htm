materially injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise; or (3) the

relied upon and sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
claimed to provide a basis for the termination of the Employee&#146;s employment

Change in Control (as defined in Section 10(g)), the Date of Termination shall
be the earlier of the expiration date of the Agreement, or the date on which
the dispute is finally resolved, either by mutual written agreement of the
parties or by a final judgment, order or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect to which the time for

notice giving rise to the dispute was given (including, but not limited to,

would not be deductible (in whole or part), by the Company as a result of the
application of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (&#147;Code&#148;),

described in the preceding subsection (e) that the aggregate benefits paid to
or for the Employee&#146;s benefit are in an amount that would result in any portion
of such &#147;parachute payments&#148; not being deductible by reason of Section 280G of
the Code, then the Employee shall have an obligation to pay the Company upon

&#147;parachute payments&#148; paid to or for the Employee&#146;s benefit over the aggregate
&#147;parachute payments&#148; that could have been paid to or for the Employee&#146;s benefit
without any portion of such &#147;parachute payments&#148; not being deductible by reason
of Section 280G of the Code; and (ii) interest on the amount set forth in
clause (i) of this sentence at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of
the Code from the date of the Employee&#146;s receipt of such excess until the date

to interest on such amounts at the rate of 3% above the prime rate (defined as
the base rate on corporate loans at large U.S. money center commercial banks as
published by the Wall Street Journal), compounded monthly, for the period from
the date such amounts were otherwise due until payment is made to the Employee
