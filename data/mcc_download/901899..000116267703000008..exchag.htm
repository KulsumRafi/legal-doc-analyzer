A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company desires to
purchase and each and all of the ADS Shareholders desire to sell
all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of ADS,
and rights to receive ADS stock, in a stock for stock exchange that
would qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section
368(a)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code (the
&ldquo;<u>IRC</u>&rdquo;), on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement.&nbsp; This Agreement is not intended to constitute
a share exchange pursuant to Article 5.02 of the Texas Business
Corporation Act.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The respective
Boards of Directors of the Company and ADS have adopted resolutions
approving and adopting the proposed plan of exchange (the
"Exchange") upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth in
this Agreement.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ADS Shareholders
listed on Schedule 1 hereto hold ____________________ (____,000)
shares of ADS's Common Stock and Austin Capital, LLC holds
_____________ warrants entitling it to purchase ______________
shares of ADS Common Stock&nbsp; (the "ADS Shares").&nbsp; The
attached Schedule 1 sets forth the holdings of each ADS Shareholder
opposite their respective names on said Schedule 1, which shares
represent all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock
of ADS, taking into account all dilution.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound,
agree as follows:<br />
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><br />
<b>ARTICLE 1<br />
THE EXCHANGE<br />
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New
Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The Exchange</u>.&nbsp;
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Closing
(as hereinafter defined) the ADS Shareholders will sell, convey,
assign, transfer and deliver to the Company stock certificate(s),
properly endorsed,&nbsp; representing the ADS Shares, and the
Company will issue to the ADS Shareholders, in exchange for the ADS
Shares, stock certificates representing an aggregate of Seventy
Five Percent (75%) of its common stock on a fully diluted and fully
converted basis, as of the Closing Date after the issuance of the
shares issued pursuant to this Agreement (the "Company
Shares")&nbsp; The number of Company Shares to be exchanged and the
exchange rate per share of ADS common stock will be determined by
multiplying the total number of shares of Common Stock of the
Company outstanding immediately prior to Closing (fully diluted and
based on the Closing Certificate provided by the Company and its
officers) by three (3).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Closing</u>.&nbsp; The
closing of the Exchange (the "Closing") shall take place the sooner
of December 31, 2002, or as soon as the conditions set forth in
<u>Article 6</u> have been satisfied or waived. Such date is herein
referred to as the "Closing Date." Subject to the provisions of
<u>Article 6</u>, the failure to consummate the Exchange on the
date and time determined pursuant to this <u>Section 1.2</u> &nbsp;
will not result in the termination of this Agreement and will not
relieve any party of any obligation hereunder.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Termination
Date.</u>&nbsp; Pursuant to Article 7.2, this Agreement shall
terminate on January 1, 2003 (the &ldquo;Termination Date&rdquo;)
and the parties will have no further obligations to the other to
effectuate a Closing, unless Company and ADS consent and agree to
extend the Termination Date for a period not to exceed ninety (90)
days.&nbsp; In order to extend the Termination Date, Company and
ADS must obtain the written consent of three of the following,
which are collectively referenced herein as the
&ldquo;Investors&rdquo;:<br />

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ADS AND THE ADS
SHAREHOLDERS<br />
</font></b></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New
Roman">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ADS hereby
represents and warrants to the Company as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Organization</u>.&nbsp; ADS
has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation
and is in good standing under the laws of its state of
incorporation, and has the requisite corporate power and specific
board and shareholder authority to carry on its business as now
conducted.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Capitalization</u>.&nbsp; The
authorized capital stock of ADS consists of 500,000 shares of
common stock, no par value, of which ________________ shares are
issued and outstanding, and no shares of preferred stock. All of
the issued and outstanding shares of common stock are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free of
preemptive rights.&nbsp; Save and except the Austin Capital
Warrant(s) (as hereinafter defined in Section 5.7) issued pursuant
to ADS&rsquo;s engagement agreement with Austin Capital, LLC (the
&ldquo;Austin Capital Agreement&rdquo;), there are no outstanding
or authorized options, rights, warrants, calls, convertible
securities, rights to subscribe, conversion rights or other
agreements or commitments to which ADS is a party or which are
binding upon ADS providing for the issuance or transfer by ADS of
additional shares of its capital stock and ADS has not reserved any
shares of its capital stock for issuance, nor are there any
outstanding stock option rights, phantom equity or similar rights,
contracts, arrangements or commitments. There are no voting trusts
or any other agreements or understandings with respect to the
voting of ADS's capital stock, other than as specifically set forth
herein.&nbsp; There are no dividends declared and unpaid on any of
the ADS Shares.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Certain Corporate
Matters</u>.&nbsp; ADS is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the ownership of its properties, the employment of its
personnel or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified, except where such failure would not have a material
adverse effect on ADS&rsquo;s financial condition, results of
operations or business. ADS has full corporate power and authority
and all authorizations, licenses and permits necessary to carry on
the business in which it is engaged and to own and use the
properties owned and used by it, and the conduct of such business
by ADS is not in contravention of any covenant, agreement, or other
obligation of ADS or the ADS Shareholders.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Authority Relative to this
Agreement</u>.&nbsp; ADS has the requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out its
obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by ADS and the consummation by ADS of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the
Board of Directors of ADS and, except for approval by the ADS
Shareholders, no other actions on the part of ADS are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
ADS and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of ADS,
enforceable against ADS in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally or by general principles of equity.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Consents and Approvals;
No Violations</u>.&nbsp; No filing with, and no permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any third party, public body
or authority is necessary for the consummation by ADS of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by ADS nor the consummation by ADS
of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by ADS with
any of the provisions hereof, will (a) conflict with or result in
any breach of any provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws of ADS, (b) result in a violation or breach of, or
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a
default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license, contract, agreement
or other instrument or obligation to which ADS is a party or by
which it or its properties or assets may be bound or (c) violate
any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation
applicable to ADS, or any of its properties or assets, except in
the case of clauses (b) and (c) for violations, breaches or
defaults which are not in the aggregate material to ADS taken as a
whole.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Disclosure</u>.&nbsp; The
representations and warranties and statements of fact made by ADS
in this Agreement are, as applicable, accurate, correct and
complete and do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements and information contained herein not false or
misleading.<br />
<br />
B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ADS
Shareholders, individually and severally with respect to the ADS
Shares held by such ADS Shareholder, but not jointly, each
respectively represent and warrant as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Ownership by ADS
Shareholders</u>.&nbsp; Such ADS Shareholder is the owner of record
of the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common
stock of ADS set forth opposite his/her name on the attached
Schedule 1 and is transferring those shares to the Company free and
clear of any liens or encumbrances.&nbsp; No person other than the
ADS Shareholder owns any right, title or interest in the ADS Shares
being transferred to the Company.&nbsp; Such ADS Shareholder has no
basis to claim any share amount other than what is listed, whether
it be by reason of employment, contract, options, warrants, share
issuance, verbal agreement, or other contract or
arrangement.&nbsp;<br />

2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Authorization</u>.&nbsp;

binding obligation of such ADS Shareholder, enforceable against the

2.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Investment Intent</u>.
Such ADS Shareholder represents that the shares of common stock
being acquired under this Agreement are being acquired for
investment purposes only, and not with a view to reselling the
shares or dividing participation in those shares with others,
except as permitted by law.&nbsp; Such ADS Shareholder represents
that he/she/it has no present intent to resell or otherwise dispose
of all or any part of these shares.&nbsp; Such ADS Shareholder
acknowledges that the shares being received in the Exchange have
not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
&ldquo;Act&rdquo;).&nbsp; The Company may require, as a condition
of the subsequent sale or transfer of the Company Shares, an
opinion of counsel that the sale or transfer would be pursuant to
an effective registration statement under the Act or pursuant to an
exemption from such registration requirements.&nbsp; Such ADS
Shareholder acknowledges that the Company Shares to be received in
the Exchange shall be stamped with a legend in substantially the
following form:<br />
<br />
<b><i>&ldquo;The shares represented by this Certificate have not
been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
&ldquo;Act&rdquo;) and are &ldquo;restricted securities&rdquo; as
that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Act.&nbsp; These shares
may not be offered for sale, sold, or otherwise transferred except
pursuant to the effective registration statement under the Act, the
availability of which is to be established to the satisfaction of
the Company.&rdquo;</i></b><i><br />
<br />
</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Disclosure of
Information</u>.&nbsp; Each ADS Shareholder represents that he, she
or it (i) has carefully reviewed the representations concerning the
Company contained in this Agreement and other information provided
to the ADS Shareholder on behalf of the Company and (ii) had
adequate opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from the
company regarding the terms and conditions of the Exchange and the
assets, prospects and financial condition of the Company.<br />

qualify or comply under this subsection (b) may be deferred one or
more times for a period not to exceed 90 days in the

(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In case the Company
shall receive from Initiating Holders a written request that the
Company file a registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor
form to Form S-3) for a public offering of Registrable Securities
the aggregate price to the public of which would exceed $250,000,
and the Company is a registrant entitled to use Form S-3 to
register the Registrable Securities for such an offering, the
Company shall use best efforts to cause such Registrable Securities
to be registered for the offering on such form and to cause such
Registrable Securities to be qualified in such jurisdictions as
such ADS Shareholder or ADS Shareholders may reasonably request;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to effect
more than one registration pursuant to this Section in any six
month period. If such offering is to be an underwritten offering,
the underwriters shall be selected for such underwriting by a
majority in interest of the Initiating Holders, but subject to the
Company's reasonable approval. The Company shall inform the other
ADS Shareholders of the proposed registration and offer them the
opportunity to participate.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to take any action
pursuant to this Section 0:<br />

(vi.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the filing of, and
for 180 days immediately following the effective date of, any
registration statement pertaining to securities of the Company
(other than a registration of securities in a Rule 145 transaction
or with respect to an employee benefit plan), provided that the
Company is actively employing in good faith commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such registration statement to become
effective;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(vii.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within six months after the Company
has effected such a registration pursuant to subsection 0, and such
registration has been declared or ordered effective; or<br />
<br />

the Company (A) giving notice of its bona fide intention to effect
the filing of a registration statement with the Commission, or (B)
stating that, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors,
it would be seriously detrimental to the Company or its
stockholders for a registration statement to be filed in the near
future, then the Company's obligation to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to file a registration statement may be deferred
one or more times for a period not to exceed 90 days in the
aggregate.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Registration
Procedures</u>.&nbsp; In the case of each registration effected by
the Company pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will keep each
ADS Shareholder advised in writing as to the initiation of such
registration and as to the completion thereof. The Company
will:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepare and file with
the Commission a registration statement and such amendments and
supplements as may be necessary and cause such registration
statement to become and remain effective until (i) in the case of
registrations pursuant to subsection (b) -- the earlier of (A) 120
days following the date the registration statement is declared
effective, or (B) the distribution described in the registration
statement has been completed or, (ii) in the case of a registration
pursuant to Section 0, until the distribution described in the
registration statement is effected; and<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furnish to the ADS
Shareholders participating in such registration and to the
underwriters of the securities being registered such reasonable
number of copies of the registration statement, preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus and such other documents as such ADS
Shareholders and underwriters may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the public offering of such securities.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall notify each ADS Shareholder whose
securities are included in a registration of the happening of any
event which makes any statement made in the registration statement
or related prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or
which requires the making of any changes in the registration
statement or prospectus so that, in the case of the registration
statement, it will not contain an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and
that in the case of the prospectus, it will not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In
such event, the Company may suspend use of the prospectus on
written notice to each participating ADS Shareholder, in which case
each participating ADS Shareholder shall not dispose of Registrable
Securities covered by the registration statement or prospectus
until copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus are
distributed to the participating ADS Shareholders or until the
participating ADS Shareholders are advised in writing by the
Company that the use of the applicable prospectus may be resumed
(the period of such suspension shall be a "Blackout Period"). The
Company shall ensure that the use of the prospectus may be resumed
as soon as practicable. The Company shall, upon the occurrence of
any event contemplated by this paragraph, prepare a supplement or
post&#8209;effective amendment to the registration statement or a
supplement to the related prospectus or any document incorporated
therein by reference or file any other required document so that,
as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable
Securities being sold thereunder, such prospectus will not contain
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In the
event that the Company declares one or more Blackout Periods, the
120&#8209;day period set forth in subsection (f)(1) shall be
extended by the number of days that constitute any such Blackout
Periods.&nbsp; The Company shall give each ADS Shareholder due
diligence access, furnish reasonably requested comfort letters and
opinions and cooperate as reasonably requested to facilitate the
distribution.<br />

(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company will
indemnify each ADS Shareholder, each of its officers and directors
and partners, and each person controlling such ADS Shareholder
within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, with
respect to which registration has been effected pursuant to this
Agreement, against all expenses, claims, losses, damages and
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), including any of the
foregoing incurred in settlement of any litigation, commenced or
threatened, arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or
alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any
registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other
document, or any amendment or supplement thereto, incident to any
such registration, or based on any omission (or alleged omission)
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or any
violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
state securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated under
such laws applicable to the Company in connection with any such
registration, and the Company will reimburse each such ADS
Shareholder, each of its officers and directors, and each person
controlling such ADS Shareholder, for any legal and any other
expenses reasonably incurred, as such expenses are incurred, in
connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such
claim, loss, damage, liability or action, provided that the Company
will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such
claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based
on any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
omission, made in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such ADS
Shareholder for use therein.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each ADS Shareholder
will, if Registrable Securities held by such ADS Shareholder are
included in the securities as to which such registration is being
effected, indemnify the Company, each of its officers and
directors, each person who controls the Company within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act, each other holder of the
Company's securities covered by such registration statement, and
each such holder's, officers and directors and each person
controlling such holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities
(or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any
untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact
contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering
circular or other document, or any omission (or alleged omission)
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, of any
violation by the ADS Shareholder of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, state securities laws or any rule or regulation
promulgated under such laws applicable to the ADS Shareholder, and
will reimburse the Company, such other holders, such officers,
directors, or control persons for any legal or any other expenses
reasonably incurred, as such expenses are incurred, in connection
with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage,
liability or action, but in the case of the Company or the other
holders or their officers, directors, or control persons, only to
the extent that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement)
or omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration
statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the
Company in writing by such ADS Shareholder for use therein.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of each ADS
Shareholder under this subsection (g)(2) shall be limited to an
amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering received by such
ADS Shareholder. A ADS Shareholder will not be required to enter
into any agreement or undertaking in connection with any
registration under this Section providing for any indemnification
or contribution on the part of such ADS Shareholder greater than
the ADS Shareholder's obligations under this subsection
(g)(2).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each party entitled
to indemnification under this subsection (g) (the <i>"Indemnified
Party&rdquo;)</i> shall give notice to the party required to
provide indemnification (the <i>&ldquo;Indemnifying
Party&rdquo;)</i> promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and
shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any
such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that
counsel for the Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense
of such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the Indemnified
Party (which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), and the
Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such party's
expense, and provided further that the failure of any Indemnified
Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Agreement unless
the failure to give such notice is materially prejudicial to an
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend such action and provided
further, that the Indemnifying Party shall not assume the defense
for matters as to which there is a conflict of interest or there
are separate and different defenses. No Indemnifying Party, in the
defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the
consent of each Indemnified Party (whose consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified
Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the indemnity and
reimbursement obligation provided in any paragraph of this
subsection (g) is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
Indemnified Party in respect of any losses, damages and liabilities
(or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then the
Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable
by the Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, damages and
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying
Party on the one hand and the Indemnified Party on the other hand
in connection with statements or omissions which resulted in such
losses, damages and liabilities as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations.&nbsp; The relative fault shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission of
or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information
supplied by the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or
omission.&nbsp; The parties hereto agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to
be determined by <i>pro rata</i> allocation or by any other method
of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in the first sentence of this
paragraph.&nbsp; The amount paid by an Indemnified Party as a
result of the losses, damages, and liabilities referred to in the
first sentence of this paragraph shall be deemed to include any
legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with investigating or defending any losses,
damages or liabilities which is the subject of this
paragraph.<br />
<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and
contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into
in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict
with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting
agreement shall control.<br />

(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Information by ADS

Registrable Securities included in any registration shall furnish
to the Company such information regarding such ADS Shareholder or
ADS Shareholders, the Registrable Securities held by them and the
distribution proposed by such ADS Shareholder or ADS Shareholders
as the Company may reasonably request in writing and as shall be
required in connection with any registration referred to in this
Agreement.<br />
