     rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board), as amended,
     as a hedge of foreign currency exposure or interest rate exposure, as
     calculated in accordance with GAAP;"

               B.   New Definitions.

          The following new definitions are hereby added to Section 1.1 in

               "Consolidated Total Assets shall mean, as of any date, the total
     assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which would be shown as assets

     income and expenses and other components of such statements are computed
     consistently with the corresponding items of the Borrower and its
     Subsidiaries in all material respects (subject to the adjustments described
     in Section 7.2.6.2 and Schedule 7.2.6), or (ii) to the extent there are
     differences in such computations that result in covenant levels more

     combined financial statements to eliminate such differences (subject to the
     adjustments described in Section 7.2.6.2 and Schedule 7.2.6, to the extent
