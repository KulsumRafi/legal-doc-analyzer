                             SECURED PROMISSORY NOTE


Principal Amount $2,900,000.00                           Date:  October 1, 2002


         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, CRESCENT OPERATING, INC., a Delaware corporation
(the "BORROWER"), promises to pay to the order of CRESCENT REAL ESTATE EQUITIES
LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Delaware limited partnership (the "HOLDER"), the
principal sum of TWO MILLION NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($2,900,000.00) or if
less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all advances made by the Holder
to the Borrower from time to time under this Secured Promissory Note (the
"NOTE"), together with interest thereon as set forth in this Note.

1.       Advances.

         (a)      Advances with Respect to Budget. So long as no Event of
                  Default (as defined in Section 6) has occurred and is
                  continuing under this Note, and subject to Section 5.05 of the
                  Settlement Agreement (as defined below), prior to the Maturity
                  Date (as defined in Section 3), for each month listed in the
                  budget attached hereto as SCHEDULE A (the "BUDGET"), the
                  Holder shall make an advance to the Borrower in the amount
                  specified as "NET CASH" for such month in the Budget; provided
                  that the amount to be advanced by the Holder as set forth in
                  the Budget with respect to any particular month shall be
                  reduced to the extent that the amounts advanced to the
                  Borrower in prior months pursuant to this Section 1(a)
                  exceeded the amount used to pay "Permitted Expenses" (as
                  defined below) incurred by "Eligible Entities" (as defined
                  below) in accordance with the Budget. Each such advance will
                  be made on the last "Business Day" (as defined below) of the
                  preceding month (except that the advance with respect to the
                  month of October 2002 shall be made within three Business Days
                  following the date of this Note). The advances made to the
                  Borrower pursuant to this Section 1(a) shall be used by
                  Borrower solely to pay Permitted Expenses, to the extent the
                  Eligible Entities are unable to do so from their own resources
                  (after all such resources have been applied to the payment of
                  Permitted Expenses).

                  When used in this Note, "SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT" means the
                  Settlement Agreement dated as of February 14, 2002 entered
                  into by and among the Holder, Crescent Real Estate Equities
                  Company, the Borrower, Rosestar Management LLC, Canyon Ranch
                  Leasing, L.L.C., Wine Country Hotel, LLC d/b/a Vintage
                  Resorts, LLC, Rosestar Southwest, LLC and COI Hotel Group,
                  Inc., as amended by the First Amendment to Settlement
                  Agreement, dated October 1, 2002, and "Business Day" shall
                  have the meaning set forth in Section 1.01 of the Settlement
                  Agreement.

                  "PERMITTED EXPENSES" are the reasonable and necessary
                  documented out-of- pocket operating expenses of the types, and
                  including the categories, of expenses set forth on SCHEDULE A
                  to be incurred by the Eligible Entities, including expenses of
                  the Transferors (as such term is defined in the Settlement
                  Agreement) incurred in connection with the Settlement
                  Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including
                  without limitation, the fees and expenses of attorneys,
                  accountants



<PAGE>

                  and investment bankers), but do not include expenses
                  attributed to, related to or incurred by Crescent Machinery
                  Company, a Texas corporation, and its subsidiaries.

                  "ELIGIBLE ENTITIES" are the Borrower and its subsidiaries
                  (other than Crescent Machinery Company, a Texas corporation,
                  and its subsidiaries).

                  Upon the Holder's approval, not to be unreasonably withheld,
                  upon request of the Borrower, the Holder may advance to the
                  Borrower from time to time in any given month an amount in
                  excess of the Budget amount for that month.

                  Borrower shall provide to Holder, within five (5) business
                  days after the end of each calendar month, each month a
                  schedule showing the amounts advanced hereunder and the
                  application of such amounts and other available funds.

                  In no event will the aggregate amount of advances made
                  pursuant to this Section 1(a) exceed $2,000,000.00.

         (b)      Advances with Respect to Specific Expenditures. So long as no
                  Event of Default (as defined in Section 6) has occurred and is
                  continuing under this Note, prior to the Maturity Date (as
                  defined in Section 3), the Holder shall make advances to the
                  Borrower within three Business Days of Holder's receipt of
                  Borrower's written request for an advance of funds for the
                  "PERMITTED PURPOSE" set forth on SCHEDULE B.


                  Each request for an advance under this Section 1(b) shall
                  specify (i) the reason that the advance is being requested for
                  the Permitted Purpose at that time, (ii) the amount being
                  requested and (iii) such other information as Holder may
                  reasonably request to confirm that the funds are to be used
                  for the Permitted Purpose contemplated by Holder and Borrower,
                  and also shall contain a representation and warranty of the
                  Borrower that the aggregate amount of funds requested for the
                  Permitted Purpose (including the amount of the current
                  request) does not exceed the maximum amount that the Borrower
                  may request for the Permitted Purpose as set forth in Schedule
                  B. The Borrower shall use advances made under this Section
                  1(b) solely for the Permitted Purpose.


                  In no event will the aggregate amount of advances made
                  pursuant to this Section 1(b) exceed $900,000.00.

         (c)      General Provisions Relating to Advances. Each advance made
                  under this Note shall bear interest from the date made until
                  paid as set forth in this Note. Advances that have been repaid
                  may not be reborrowed. The Holder shall be under no obligation
                  to make any advance the proceeds of which would be used by
                  Borrower to evaluate, threaten or commence or continue legal
                  actions against Holder or any its affiliates.

2.       Interest Rate; Payment of Interest. Interest shall accrue and be
         payable on the unpaid principal balance of this Note outstanding from
         time to time at the rate of 2.03% per annum (such interest rate being
         equivalent to the October Short-Term Applicable Federal Rate),


                                       2
<PAGE>

         with no compounding of interest, and shall be computed on the basis of
         a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed
         (including the first day but excluding the last day). If the rate of
         interest provided in this Note would exceed the maximum legal rate of
         interest under applicable law for the indebtedness evidenced by this
         Note, then the rate of interest on this Note shall be automatically
         reduced, effective on and as of the date of this Note, to the highest
         rate of interest that would not exceed such maximum legal rate and any
         amounts paid in excess of such maximum shall be deemed to be voluntary
         prepayments of the principal of this Note (or refunded to Borrower to
         the extent the principal of this Note has been repaid in full).

         All interest on this Note shall be payable in full on the Maturity Date
         (as defined in Section 3).

3.       Payments; Prepayment.

         (a)      Payments. Unless sooner paid in full, the entire unpaid
                  principal balance of this Note, together with all outstanding
                  and unpaid accrued interest, and any other amounts due
                  hereunder, shall be due and payable on the maturity date of
                  March 31, 2003 (the "MATURITY DATE").

         (b)      Mandatory Prepayments. In addition to the payments described
                  above, Borrower agrees and promises to pay Holder, as
                  mandatory prepayments on the principal amount hereof, any "Net
                  Proceeds" available to Borrower within three Business Days
                  after such Net Proceeds become available to Borrower. For
                  purposes of this Note, "NET PROCEEDS" shall mean one hundred
                  percent (100%) of the proceeds from the claim more
                  particularly described in SCHEDULE C attached hereto or from
                  any settlement or judgment arising from such claim. Borrower
                  shall notify Holder in writing of its receipt of any Net
                  Proceeds within one Business Day following receipt. By its
                  signature below, Borrower also agrees, for the benefit of
                  Holder, to cause any such Net Proceeds otherwise payable to
                  Borrower, to be payable instead directly to Holder on its
                  behalf, to the extent designated by Holder. Notwithstanding
                  the foregoing, if Holder notifies Borrower in writing that
                  Borrower may retain all or a specified portion of the Net
                  Proceeds that Borrower receives, then Borrower is hereby
                  authorized to retain all or such portion, if any, of the Net
                  Proceeds designated in such written notice, provided that all
                  Net Proceeds so retained by Holder must be used to pay
                  Permitted Expenses.

         (c)      Optional Prepayments. Borrower may prepay this Note in whole
                  or in part at any time without premium or penalty.

4.       Payments Generally. All payments shall be made in U.S. dollars.
         Payments shall be made to the address of Holder specified pursuant to
         Section 12. Any payment of principal or interest hereunder that is not
         paid within five Business Days of the date on which it is due in
         accordance with the terms of this Note shall bear interest at a rate of
         5.03% per annum until paid, and such interest shall be payable on
         demand. If any payments to be made by Borrower hereunder shall become
         due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on
         the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be
         included in computing any interest in respect of such payment. All
         payments received


                                       3

<PAGE>

         under this Note shall be applied first to late charges, costs and other
         amounts except interest and principal, then to accrued interest, and
         the balance, if any, to principal; provided that if Borrower is in
         default, Holder shall have the right to apply such payments in such
         order as Holder shall determine in its sole discretion.

5.       Collection Costs. Borrower shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
         and expenses incurred by Holder in enforcing this Note, including
         without limitation all such costs and expenses incurred by Holder in or
         relating to any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings of Borrower and
         any attorney's fees, expenses and costs reasonably incurred in
         connection with any of the foregoing (collectively, "COLLECTION
         COSTS").

6.       Default. The occurrence of any of the following events shall be an
         "EVENT OF DEFAULT":

         (a)      default in the payment of any principal or interest on this
                  Note when it becomes due and payable;

                  of the Borrower under this Note;

                  excess of $1,000,000, either individually or in the aggregate,
                  shall be rendered against the Borrower and such judgment or
                  order shall continue unsatisfied, unstayed and unbonded for a
                  period of 30 days; provided, however, that a judgment or order
                  fully covered by insurance, which coverage has not been
                  disputed by the insurer, shall not be considered a default;

         (d)      the entry of a decree or order by a court having jurisdiction
                  in the premises adjudging the Borrower a bankrupt or
                  insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking
                  reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or
                  in respect of the Borrower under the Federal Bankruptcy Code
                  or any other applicable federal or state law, or appointing a

                  part of its property, or ordering the winding up or
                  liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such
                  decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90
                  consecutive days;

         (e)      the institution by the Borrower of proceedings to be
                  adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to
                  the institution of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings
                  against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or
                  consent seeking reorganization or relief under the Federal
                  Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable federal or state law,
                  or the consent by it to the filing of any such petition or to

                  sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Borrower or of
                  any substantial part of its property, or the making of an
                  assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by
                  it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as
                  they become due;

         (f)      the occurrence of any breach by Borrower, Rosestar Management
                  LLC, Canyon Ranch Leasing, L.L.C., Wine Country Hotel, LLC
                  d/b/a Vintage Resorts, LLC,

                  Rosestar Southwest, LLC or COI Hotel Group, Inc. under the

                  Settlement Agreement);

                  certificate or other document delivered pursuant to or in
                  connection with the Settlement Agreement or any such other
                  agreement) shall have been incorrect when made in any material
                  respect;

         (h)      any default under that certain Security Agreement, dated of
                  even date herewith, made by Borrower in favor of Holder (the
                  "SECURITY AGREEMENT") and not cured within the applicable cure
                  period, if any, applicable to such default; or

         (i)      any default by Borrower with respect to any obligation of
                  Borrower under that certain Amended and Restated Note, dated
                  October 1, 2002, in the original principal amount of
                  $6,331,000.00, and not cured within the applicable cure
                  period, if any, applicable to such default.

7.       Acceleration. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (other than
         pursuant to clause (d) or (e) of Section 6), the unpaid principal
         balance of this Note together with all accrued and unpaid interest and
         all other amounts payable under this Note shall, at the option of
         Holder, become immediately due and payable. Upon the occurrence of an
         Event of Default pursuant to clause (d) or (e) of Section 6, the unpaid
         principal balance of this Note together with all accrued and unpaid
         interest and all other amounts payable under this Note shall become
         immediately due and payable without any demand or other action on the
         part of the Holder; provided that, upon approval in a bankruptcy
         proceeding instituted by the Borrower and issuance of an order of the
         bankruptcy court reasonably acceptable to Holder, Holder shall be
         obligated to advance funds to the Borrower on the terms set forth in
         this Note as though the related Event of Default had not occurred.

8.       Certain Waivers. Borrower waives presentment, notice of dishonor,
         protest and notice of protest, demand and notice of nonpayment of this
         Note, and any and all lack of diligence or delays in the collection or
         enforcement hereof. Borrower further expressly consents to the release
         or substitution of any of the collateral securing this Note.

9.       Preservation of Holder Rights; Modifications. No failure on the part of
         Holder to exercise any right or remedy hereunder, whether before or
         after the occurrence of a default or Event of Default, shall constitute
         a waiver thereof, and no waiver of any past Event of Default shall
         constitute a waiver of any future default or Event of Default or of any
         other default or Event of Default. No failure to accelerate the
         indebtedness evidenced hereby by reason of any Event of Default
         hereunder, or indulgence granted from time to time, shall be construed
         to be a waiver of the right to insist upon prompt payment or as a
         waiver of any other right, or be construed so as to preclude the
         exercise of any right that Holder may have under applicable law, this
         Note, any other agreement or otherwise; and Borrower hereby expressly
         waives the benefit of any statute or rule of law or equity that would
         produce a result contrary to or in conflict with the foregoing. This
         Note may not be changed or any provision hereof




                                       5
<PAGE>

         waived or modified orally, but only by an agreement in writing signed
         by the party against whom such agreement is sought to be enforced.

10.      Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
         ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS (EXCLUDING THE CHOICE OF
         LAW PROVISIONS THEREOF THAT WOULD PROVIDE FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE
         LAWS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION).

11.      VENUE; JURISDICTION; JURY TRIAL WAIVER. THE HOLDER AND THE BORROWER
         HEREBY:

         (a)      CONSENT TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT
                  LOCATED IN TEXAS;

         (b)      AGREE THAT THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF ANY PROCEEDING RESPECTING
                  THIS NOTE, THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER
                  THIS NOTE, AND ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THE HOLDER, ON THE ONE
                  HAND, AND THE BORROWER, ON THE OTHER, SHALL BE A COURT OF

12.      Notices. Any notice or demand required or permitted by or in connection
         with this Note shall be in writing and shall be made as provided in
         Section 10.01 of the Settlement Agreement.

13.      Severability. In case any provision (or any part of any provision)
         contained in this Note shall for any reason be held to be invalid,
         illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or
         unenforceability shall not affect any other provision (or remaining
         part of the affected provision) of this Note, but this Note shall be
         construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision (or
         part thereof) had never been contained herein but only to the extent
         such provision (or part thereof) is invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

14.      Successors and Assigns. This Note shall be binding on the parties
         hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided that,
         except for an assignment by Holder to an affiliate, no assignment of
         this Note may be made without the consent of the other party hereto.

15.      Section Headings; Interpretation. The section and subsection headings
         contained herein are for reference purposes only and shall not in any
         way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Note. The parties
         hereto are sophisticated and have been represented by lawyers
         throughout this transaction who have carefully negotiated the
         provisions hereof. As a consequence, the parties agree that any
         presumptions relating to the interpretation of contracts against the
         drafter of any particular clause should not be applied in this case and
         therefore waive its effects.

16.      Entire Agreement. This Note, the Security Agreement, the amended and
         Restated Note between the parties hereto and dated of even date
         herewith and the Settlement Agreement, together with the other
         agreements contemplated thereby, shall constitute the complete
         agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matters
         referred to herein and supersede all prior or contemporaneous
         negotiations, promises, covenants, agreements or representations of
         every kind or nature whatsoever with respect thereto, all of which have
         become merged and finally integrated into this Note and such
         agreements. Each of the parties understands that in the event of any
         subsequent litigation, controversy or dispute concerning any terms,
         conditions or provisions of this Note, no party shall be permitted to
         offer or introduce any oral evidence concerning any other oral promises
         or oral agreements between the parties relating to the subject matter
         of this Note not included or referred to herein and not reflected by a
         writing.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Borrower
executes this Note under seal as of the date first written above.
