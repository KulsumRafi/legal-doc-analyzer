               and (d) of said paragraph 2.5 of Article 2. are added to read as
               follows:

               "(c) The stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete
                    liquidation of the Company; or

               (d)  The consummation of: (i) the sale or disposition of all or
                    substantially all of the Company's assets; or (ii) a merger,
                    consolidation, or reorganization of the Company with or
                    involving any other corporation or entity, other than a
                    merger, consolidation, or reorganization that would result
                    in the voting securities of the Company outstanding
                    immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by
                    remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting
                    securities of the surviving entity) at least fifty percent
                    (50%) of the combined voting power of the voting securities
                    of the Company (or such surviving entity) outstanding
                    immediately after such merger, consolidation, or
                    reorganization."

         2. The changes made by this Amendment shall not apply to any Award (as
defined in the Plan) outstanding under the Plan prior to the date this Amendment
was adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company.

                    The above Amendment was duly adopted by resolutions passed
                    by the Board of Directors of the Company at its meeting held
                    on December 4, 2002
