Attn: Mr. Peter Havens
      Chairman

Gentlemen:


         According to Section 6.01(a) of the Merger Agreement, once comments on
the Proxy Statement are provided by the SEC to the Company, the Company and
Socrates Acquisition Corporation each have obligations to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments
received and to proceed to a mailing of a final Proxy Statement to the Company's
shareholders. These obligations continue so long as the Merger Agreement is in
effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligations, in order to accommodate your
recent request, we agree that subject to the terms set forth herein, until such
time as Socrates Acquisition Corporation notifies you in writing otherwise, the
parties shall not be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to respond
as promptly as practicable to any comments received and to proceed to a mailing
of a final Proxy Statement to the Company's shareholders. Subject only to the
prior sentence, the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement shall remain
unmodified and the Merger Agreement is hereby confirmed as being in full force
and effect. The provisions of this paragraph should be strictly construed and
may not be relied upon to imply any additional waiver of obligations or
establish a course of dialing.

         If the terms of this Letter are acceptable to you, please sign, date
and return it to Socrates Acquisition Corporation at which such time, the
foregoing shall take effect as a legally-binding agreement between the Company
and Socrates Acquisition Corporation on the basis set forth above.
