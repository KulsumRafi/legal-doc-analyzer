publicly held. Under such Treasury Regulation, this exemption is available to the Plan for the duration of the period that lasts until the earlier of (i) the expiration or material modification of the Plan, (ii) the exhaustion of the maximum number
of shares of Stock available for Awards under the Plan, as set forth in Section 5(a), or (iii) the first meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected that occurs after the close of the third calendar year following the calendar year
