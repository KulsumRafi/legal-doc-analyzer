               surviving entity, the "Seacor Shares"), and

               (2) Seller will have the opportunity to receive additional
               consideration (the "Earnout") based upon certain performance
               standards of the Company during the 24 month period after Closing
               (the "Earnout Period"). The Earnout shall be based on the
               improvement in performance from a base EBITDA and shall be equal
               to 50% of the excess of "Earnout EBITDA" (as hereinafter defined)

               defined) for the Earnout Period, subject to a minimum payment of
               $250,000 and a maximum payment of $900,000, as adjusted pursuant
               to the provisions of subparagraph (c) below. "Earnout EBITDA"

               Earnout EBITDA on a mutually agreeable basis. "Base EBITDA" shall
               mean $5,600,000 and shall be calculated in the same manner as
               Earnout EBITDA. Within 45 days following the end of the Earnout

               to the Seller and will provide any supporting documentation

               from receipt thereof to review the calculations and approve the
               Earnout calculations. In the event that the Seller does not agree
               with the calculations, then the parties shall hire
               PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to compute the Earnout. and that
               computation shall be binding, final and not subject to appeal or
               further review by either party. The payment of the Earnout will



                                       9
<PAGE>
               be delayed until such computation is complete. For the purposes
               of calculating the Earnout, in the event of a change in the
               Company's accounting policies, EBITDA will be calculated using
               the historical accounting policies.

          (b)  The Seacor Shares shall be registered shares from Buyer's
               parent's current acquisition shelf Registration Statement and
               trading of such shares shall not be subject to holding or notice
               periods other than those which may be applicable by operation of
               law, or as a result of the application of SEACOR SMIT Inc.'s
               insider trading policy.

          (c)  No Earnout shall be payable by Buyer in the event the value of
               the Seacor Shares issued to Seller under subparagraph (a) (1)
               above appreciates, by means of the calculations described herein
               (the "Share Appreciation Value"), by $900,000. The maximum
               Earnout payment of $900,000 shall be reduced by any such Share
               Appreciation Value. In the event that the Share Appreciation
               Value exceeds $650,000, the minimum Earnout payment shall also be
               reduced. The Share Appreciation Value shall be calculated by
               adding the sum of (i) the Maximum Value (as hereinafter defined)
               of 42,683 Seacor Shares; (ii) the Realized Value (as defined
               below) of any Seacor Shares, up to a maximum of 10,243 Seacor
               Shares, that may be sold by the Seller; and (iii) the Maximum
               Value of any remaining Seacor Shares issued pursuant to this
               transaction and not included in (i) or (ii) above. Realized Value
               shall be defined as the number of Seacor Shares sold by Seller
               multiplied by their actual gross selling price, assuming an arms'
               length transaction with a registered broker/dealer. Maximum Value
               shall be defined as the number of shares multiplied by the
               difference of the lowest closing price of the ten highest closing
               prices within the Earnout Period, less $41.00.

          (d)  Any Earnout payable under this Section will be paid to Seller
               annually, in one-third increments, commencing on the third
               anniversary date of the Closing. Any such Earnout payable will be
               calculated in dollars, but paid to Seller in whole shares of
               Seacor common stock, at a share price equal to the average Seacor
               common stock price at the close of trading for the 20 calendar
               days immediately preceding payment, with any necessary adjustment

standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, with full
corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is now being
conducted, to own or use the properties and assets that it purports to own or

execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and each of the other
agreements required to be entered into by the Seller pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement including without limitation the Escrow Agreement
and the Employment Agreement ("Other Agreements"), said Other Agreements will

       (iii)  contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation or breach of
              any provision of, or give any Person the right to declare a
              default or exercise any remedy under, or to accelerate the
              maturity or performance of, or to cancel, terminate, or modify,
              any Applicable Contract; or

connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation
or performance of any of the Contemplated Transactions.

3.3        CAPITALIZATION AND FINANCIAL STRUCTURE

           The authorized equity securities of the Company consist of One
Hundred Thousand (100,000) shares of common stock, no par value per share (the

there are no warrants, options, or other Securities of the Company which are in
effect. Seller is and will be on the Closing Date, the record and beneficial
owner and holder of Eight Hundred (800) shares of the Issued Shares, free and
clear of all Encumbrances. No legend or other reference to any purported
Encumbrance appears upon any certificate representing equity securities of the

of the Company, and no meeting of any such stockholders, Board of Directors, or
committee has been held for which minutes have not been prepared and are not
contained in such minute books. At the Closing, all of such books and records
will be in the possession of the Company.

3.5        TITLE TO PROPERTIES; ENCUMBRANCES

           Schedule 3.5 contains a complete and accurate list of all real
property, leaseholds, or other interests therein owned by the Company. Seller
has delivered or made available to Buyer copies of the deeds and other
instruments (as recorded) by which the Company acquired such real property and
interests, and copies of all title insurance policies, opinions, abstracts, and
surveys in the possession of Seller or the Company and relating to such property
or interests. The Company owns (with good and marketable title in the case of
real property, subject only to the matters permitted by the following sentence)
all the properties and assets (whether real, personal, or mixed and whether
tangible or intangible) that they purport to own located in the Facilities owned
or operated by the Company or reflected as owned in the books and records of the
Company, including all of the properties and assets reflected in the balance
sheet of the Company attached to Schedule 3.5 (the "Balance Sheet") (except for
assets held under capitalized leases disclosed or not required to be disclosed
in Schedule 3.5, and personal property sold since the date of the Balance Sheet
in the Ordinary Course of Business), and all of the properties and assets
purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company since the date of the Balance
Sheet (except for personal property acquired and sold since the date of the
Balance Sheet in the Ordinary Course of Business and consistent with past
practice), which subsequently purchased or acquired properties and assets (other
than inventory and short-term investments) are listed in Schedule 3.6. All
material properties and assets reflected in the Balance Sheet are free and clear
of all Encumbrances and are not, in the case of real property, subject to any
rights of way, building use restrictions, exceptions, variances, reservations,
or limitations of any nature except, with respect to all such properties and
assets, (a) mortgages or security interests shown on the Balance Sheet as
securing specified liabilities or obligations, with respect to which no default
(or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default) exists, (b) mortgages or security interests incurred in connection with
the purchase of property or assets after the date of the Balance Sheet (such
mortgages and security interests being limited to the property or assets so
acquired), with respect to which no default (or event that, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default) exists, (c) liens for current taxes
not yet due, and (d) with respect to real property, (i) minor imperfections of
title, if any, none of which is substantial in amount, materially detracts from
the value or impairs the use of the property subject thereto, or impairs the
operations of the Company, and (ii) zoning laws and other land use restrictions
that do not impair the present or anticipated use of the property subject

within the boundaries of the real property owned by the Company and do not
encroach upon the property of, or otherwise conflict with the property rights
of, any other Person.

3.6        NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES

           Except as set forth in Schedule 3.6, to the knowledge of Seller, the
Company has no liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether known or



                                       14
<PAGE>
unknown and whether absolute, accrued, contingent, or otherwise) except for
liabilities or obligations reflected or reserved against in the Balance Sheet
and current liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business since the
respective dates thereof.

3.7        TAXES

(a) The Company has filed or caused to be filed (on a timely basis since January

applicable Legal Requirements. Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer
copies of, and Schedule 3.7 contains a complete and accurate list of, all such
Tax Returns relating to income or franchise taxes filed since January 1, 1998.
The Company has paid, or made provision for the payment of, all Taxes that have
or may have become due pursuant to those Tax Returns or otherwise, or pursuant
to any assessment received by Seller or the Company, except such Taxes, if any,
as are listed in Schedule 3.7 and are being contested in good faith and as to
which adequate reserves (determined in accordance with GAAP) have been provided
in the Balance Sheet.

(b) The United States federal and state income Tax Returns of the Company
subject to such Taxes have been audited by the IRS or relevant state tax
authorities or are closed by the applicable statute of limitations for all
taxable years through 1998. Schedule 3.7 contains a complete and accurate list
of all audits of all such Tax Returns, including a reasonably detailed
description of the nature and outcome of each audit. All deficiencies proposed
as a result of such audits have been paid, reserved against, settled, or, as
described in Schedule 3.7, are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings. Schedule 3.7 describes all adjustments to the United States federal
income Tax Returns filed by the Company for all taxable years since 1998, and
the resulting deficiencies proposed by the IRS. Except as described in Schedule
3.7, no Seller or the Company has given or been requested to give waivers or
extensions (or is or would be subject to a waiver or extension given by any
other Person) of any statute of limitations relating to the payment of Taxes for
which the Company may be liable.

(c) The charges, accruals, and reserves with respect to Taxes on the respective
books of the Company are adequate (determined in accordance with GAAP) and are
at least equal to the Company's liability for Taxes. There exists no proposed
tax assessment against the Company except as disclosed in the Balance Sheet or
in Schedule 3.7. No consent to the application of Section 341(f)(2) of the IRC
has been filed with respect to any property or assets held, acquired, or to be
acquired by the Company. All Taxes that the Company is or was required by Legal
Requirements to withhold or collect have been duly withheld or collected and, to
the extent required, have been paid to the proper Governmental Body or other
Person.

 (d) All Tax Returns filed by (or that include on a consolidated basis) the
Company are true, correct, and complete. There is no tax sharing agreement that
will require any payment by the Company after the date of this Agreement. The
Company is not, or within the five-year period preceding the Closing Date has
been, an "S" corporation. During the consistency period (as defined in Section
338(h)(4) of the IRC with respect to the sale of the Shares to Buyer), neither
the Company or target affiliate (as defined in Section 338(h)(6) of the IRC with



                                       15

or assets to Buyer or to any member of the affiliated group (as defined in
Section 338(h)(5) of the IRC) that includes Buyer. Schedule 3.7 lists all such
target affiliates.

3.8        NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE

           The Balance Sheet fairly and accurately shows the financial condition
of the Company as of the date of the Balance Sheet. Except as disclosed in
Schedule 3.8 hereto, since the date of the Balance Sheet, there has not been any

accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Damages, or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations.

10.2       INDEMNIFICATION AND PAYMENT OF DAMAGES BY SELLER

           Seller will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, the Company, and their
respective Representatives, stockholders, controlling persons, and affiliates
(collectively the "Indemnified Persons") for, and will pay to the Indemnified
Persons the amount of, any loss, liability, claim, damage, expense (including
costs of investigation and defense and reasonable attorneys' fees) or diminution
of value, whether or not involving a third-party claim (collectively "Damages"),
arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with:

(a) any Breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this
Agreement as of the date hereof (without giving effect to any supplement to the
Disclosure Schedules), the Disclosure Schedules, the supplements to the
Disclosure Schedules, or any other certificate or document delivered by Seller
pursuant to this Agreement other than any such Breach that is disclosed in a
supplement to the Disclosure Schedule accepted by Buyer and is expressly
identified in the certificate delivered pursuant to Sections 2.4(a)(viii), as
having caused the condition specified in Section 7.1 not to be satisfied;

(b) any Breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this
Agreement as if such representation or warranty were made on and as of the
Closing Date without giving effect to any supplement to the Disclosure
Schedules;

(c) any Breach by Seller of any covenant or obligation of Seller in this
Agreement;

(d) any claim by any Person for brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or
similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have been
made by any such Person with either Seller or the Company (or any Person acting
on their behalf) in connection with any of the Contemplated Transactions.

The remedies provided in this Section 10.2 will not be exclusive of or limit any
other remedies that may be available to Buyer or the other Indemnified Persons.

10.3       INDEMNIFICATION AND PAYMENT OF DAMAGES BY BUYER

           Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless Seller, and will pay to Seller
the amount of any Damages arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection
with (a) any Breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement,
(b) any Breach by Buyer of any covenant or obligation of Buyer in this
Agreement, or (c) any claim by any Person for brokerage or finder's fees or
commissions or similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding
alleged to have been made by such Person with Buyer (or any Person acting on its
behalf) in connection with any of the Contemplated Transactions.

10.4       PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION--THIRD PARTY CLAIMS

 (a) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 10.2 or 10.3
of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding against it, such indemnified
party will, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party under such
Section, give notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such
claim, but the failure to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the
indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party,
except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that the defense
of such action is prejudiced by the indemnifying party's failure to give such
notice.

(b) If any Proceeding referred to in Section 10.4(a) is brought against an
indemnified party and it gives notice to the indemnifying party of the
commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will, unless the claim
involves Taxes, be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent
that it wishes (unless (i) the indemnifying party is also a party to such
Proceeding and the indemnified party determines in good faith that joint
representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party fails to
provide reasonable assurance to the indemnified party of its financial capacity
to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to such
Proceeding), to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel satisfactory
to the indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to the
indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the
indemnifying party will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be
liable to the indemnified party under this Section 10 for any fees of other
counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Proceeding, in
each case subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the
defense of such Proceeding, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Proceeding, (i) it will be
conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in
that Proceeding are within the scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no
compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the indemnifying
party without the indemnified party's consent unless (A) there is no finding or
admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or any violation of the rights
of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the
indemnified party, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are
paid in full by the indemnifying party; and (iii) the indemnified party will
have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims
effected without its consent. If notice is given to an indemnifying party of the




                                       40
<PAGE>
commencement of any Proceeding and the indemnifying party does not, within ten
days after the indemnified party's notice is given, give notice to the
indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the
indemnifying party will be bound by any determination made in such Proceeding or
any compromise or settlement effected by the indemnified party.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Proceeding may adversely
affect it or its affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for which
it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the indemnified
party may, by notice to the indemnifying party, assume the exclusive right to
defend, compromise, or settle such Proceeding, but the indemnifying party will
not be bound by any determination of a Proceeding so defended or any compromise
or settlement effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably
withheld).

10.5       PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION--OTHER CLAIMS

           A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a
third-party claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom
indemnification is sought.

                             11.0 GENERAL PROVISIONS

11.1       POST CLOSING COVENANTS

Schedule 11.1 contains (a) a complete and accurate description of the Ranch
Property, including location and legal description, (b) a complete and accurate
list of any and all deeds of trust, liens, security interests, promissory notes
and guaranties on the Ranch Property, (c) a complete and accurate list of
improvements, incidental equipment and vehicles regularly kept on the property,
and a complete and accurate description of any outstanding taxes. At such time
as Seller refinances the existing debt on the Ranch Property, including, but not
limited to, the release and satisfaction of all deeds of trust, liens and/or
other security interests on the Ranch Property granted by the Company and
repayment of any and all promissory notes and/or releases of any and all
guaranties made by the Company in connection therewith, including, without
limitation, the deeds of trust and notes listed in Schedule 11.1, and Seller
furnishes Buyer with proof thereof satisfactory to Buyer and its counsel, Buyer
will cause the Company to execute and deliver to Seller a deed and bill of sale
for the Ranch Property, substantially in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit
11.1. Until such refinancing is accomplished, Seller shall pay and perform, as
and when due, in place of the Company, any and all obligations, taxes and/or
liabilities of the Company in connection with the Ranch Property and/or such
deeds of trust, liens, security interests, notes, and guaranties, and shall
defend and indemnify and hold harmless the Company from any such loss or
liability therefore.

                                ESCROW AGREEMENT

                                 (Exhibit 2.5)


           THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), made this 31st day of
December, 2002, by and between OFFSHORE AVIATION INC., a Delaware corporation
(the "Purchaser"), EDWARD L. BEHNE, an individual resident of Houston, Harris
County, Texas (the "Seller"), and BELL, RYNIKER, LETOURNEAU & NORK, P.C. (the
"Escrow Agent"),


                                   WITNESSETH,

           WHEREAS, The Escrow Agent has agreed to act as an Escrow Agent for
Purchaser and Seller and has agreed to hold in escrow on the terms and
conditions set forth herein 6097 shares of common stock of SEACOR Smit Inc., a
Delaware corporation, represented by certificate numbers ____________ (the
"Shares") and any cash proceeds from the Shares realized in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, which cash proceeds will be maintained in Escrow Agents
IOLTA Trust Account (the "Proceeds") (the "Shares" and "Proceeds" being
collectively referred to herein as the "Escrowed Property");

           WHEREAS, the parties hereto do hereby appoint Escrow Agent to act as
escrow agent to receive, hold, and release the Escrowed Property in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Escrow Agent accepts that
appointment. Escrow Agent will not charge the parties a fee for acting solely in
the capacity of escrow agent.

           IT IS HEREBY understood and agreed and Purchaser and Seller do hereby
direct Escrow Agent, upon receipt of the Escrowed Property, to maintain the same
in escrow until released in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.

           IT IS HEREBY understood and agreed that the Escrowed Property will be
released to Seller and deemed delivered to Seller by Purchaser only on the
express terms and conditions hereof. On the 18-month anniversary of this
Agreement, Escrow Agent shall release all of the Shares or the Proceeds from
such Shares to Seller upon receipt by Escrow Agent of a statement signed by the
President or any Vice President of Purchaser in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit "A" certifying that Seller has complied with his obligations and paid in
full any of his liabilities under that certain Securities Purchase Agreement
between Seller and Purchaser of even date herewith (the "SPA") and that certain
Employment Agreement between Seller and Tex-Air Helicopters, Inc., a Texas
corporation (the "Company") of even date herewith (the "Employment Agreement")
(the "SPA" and "Employment Agreement" being collectively referred to herein as
the "Operative Agreements"). Upon Escrow Agent's release of the Escrowed
Property, the escrow created under this Agreement will terminate and Escrow
Agent will be released from all further responsibility.

           IT IS FURTHER understood and agreed that in the event the conditions
for release of the Escrowed Property are not met, the Escrow Agent, in its sole
discretion, may continue to hold said Escrowed Property or may invoke a
concursus or interpleader proceeding in any state or federal court located in

<PAGE>
Houston, Harris County, Texas, and tender into the registry of the court the
Escrowed Property.

           FURTHER, Seller shall have the right to instruct Escrow Agent in
writing to release to Seller's broker Comerica Securities (the "Broker") all or
any of the Shares for sale at any time that the trading price of the Shares
exceeds $50.00 per Share; provided, however, (i) such Shares shall only be sold
for cash in an amount in excess of $50.00 per Share and (ii) the cash purchase
price of the Shares less commissions and taxes which must be paid or withheld by
Seller (the "Proceeds") shall be promptly wire transferred by the Broker to
Escrow Agent's IOLTA trust account, banking details to be provided by Escrow
Agent at such time.

           FURTHER, that in consideration of the Escrow Agent acting for the
benefit of and at the request of Purchaser and Seller, the Purchaser and the
Seller shall and do at all times hereafter well and sufficiently save, defend,
keep harmless and indemnify the Escrow Agent, from all loss, damage, cost,
charge, liability or expense (excepting therefrom any loss, damage, costs,
charge, liability or expense resulting from Escrow Agent's willful misconduct or
gross negligence), including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney's
fees, which may result from the obligation and duty as Escrow Agent accepted by
the said Escrow Agent, including, but not limited to, situations in which
disputes arise concerning release of the Escrowed Property. Purchaser and Seller
shall be jointly and severally bound to Escrow Agent for all such amounts, but
Purchaser and Seller will have a right of contribution against each other based
on their comparative fault. If neither is at fault, their liability to Escrow
Agent shall be equally apportioned between them, and each may recover from the
other any amount paid in excess of that amount.

           FURTHER, we, the undersigned understand that Escrow Agent executes
this Agreement solely for the purpose of accepting the escrow created by this
Agreement, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
undertakes to perform the duties, but only the duties, specifically set forth in
this Agreement. Escrow Agent is not required to secure the performance of its
duties by bond or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the responsibilities of Escrow Agent are further defined, limited, and qualified
by the following:

                     (a) The duties and obligations of Escrow Agent shall be
determined by the express provisions of this Agreement, and this
Agreement is not to be interpreted or construed to impose on Escrow Agent any
implied duties, covenants, or obligations of any kind whatsoever;

                     (b) Escrow Agent shall receive, hold, and release the
Escrowed Property in accordance with this Agreement;

                     (c) Escrow Agent may execute any of its rights, powers or
responsibilities under this Agreement either directly or by or through
its agents, partners, employees, or attorneys, and it shall not be liable for
any error of judgment made in good faith by an authorized agent, partner,
employee or attorney of it, unless it is proven that Escrow Agent was guilty of


                                       2
<PAGE>
gross negligence or deliberate and willful misconduct in ascertaining the
pertinent facts or in employing or supervising the agent, partner, employee, or
attorney;

                     (d) Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any person with
respect to any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in accordance with
this Agreement, a written decision of an arbitrator or arbitration panel,
written joint or concurring instructions signed by Purchaser and Seller or an
order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction;

                     (e) Escrow Agent may rely on any document given to it
pursuant to this Agreement without verifying the authenticity of it, the
genuineness of any signature on it or the authority of the person signing the
document or purporting to give it to Escrow Agent, and Escrow Agent is not
obligated to examine or pass upon the validity, execution, binding effect or
sufficiency of this Agreement or any amendment or supplement to either of them;

                     (f) Escrow Agent shall be free from any liability when
acting in good faith in accordance with any written advice or opinion
received from legal counsel, an independent certified public accountant or other
expert rendering advice or an opinion within his area of expertise, and the
expenses thereof shall be joint and several obligations of the Parties;

                     (g) Escrow Agent does not have any duty to make any
inquiry, determination, or verification with respect to the performance by
Seller, Purchaser or any other party of any provision of this Agreement or the
Operative Agreements;

                     (h) Escrow Agent does not have any duty to give the
property held in escrow by it under this Agreement any greater degree of care
than it gives its own similar property, and Escrow Agent makes no representation
as to the value, validity, genuineness, or collectibility of any security or
other document or instrument delivered to it; and

                     (i) Seller acknowledges that Escrow Agent is legal counsel
for Purchaser and represents it in connection with the transactions described in

                                (Exhibit 5.8(a))


           This Employment Agreement (this "Agreement") by and between, Tex-Air
Helicopters, Inc., a Texas corporation ("Company"), and Edward L. Behne
("Employee") is dated as of December 31, 2002.

           The Company and the Employee agree as follows:

           1. Employment. Subject to the provisions for termination as
hereinafter provided, Employee's employment with company shall be pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement and shall be for the period commencing on January 1,
2003 and expiring on the third anniversary thereof. Such period of employment,
as may be continued under the provisions of Section 2 if applicable, is referred
to as the "Employment Term".

           2. Continuation. If Employee continues to serve as an employee of the
Company after the third anniversary hereof, employee's continued employment
shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement but shall be terminable at will
by either Company or Employee and such continued period of employment shall be
included in the Employment Term.

           3. Duties. The Employee shall serve as President of the Company and
shall perform, faithfully and diligently, such duties, and shall have such
responsibilities appropriate to such position, as shall be assigned to him from
time to time by the Chairman of the Company or his designee, to whom he shall
report. The employee shall devote his full time and attention to his employment
with the Company.

           4. Compensation and Benefits.

           (a) Salary. During the Employment Term, the Company will provide
Employee an annual base salary of $175,000 per year, less state and federal
withholding, social security, and other standard payroll deductions as shall be
required to be withheld by applicable law or regulations, payable to Employee in
accordance with the policies of the Company as from time to time in effect, but
in no event less than twice each month.

           (b) Other Benefits. Employee shall be permitted, during the
Employment Term, if and to the extent eligible, to participate in any vacation
benefits, group life, hospitalization or disability insurance plans, health
programs, pension plans, 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans or similar benefit
plans or other so-called "fringe benefits" offered by Company (collectively,
"Benefits"), which may be available to other employees of the Company on terms
no less favorable to the Employee than the terms offered to other such Company
employees.

           (c) Incentive Compensation.

                     (i) Stock. Subject to the provisions contained in Paragraph
           5 hereof, Employee shall receive as a bonus for the continued
           performance of this Agreement 1000 shares of restricted stock in
           SEACOR Smit Inc., 333 of such shares on the first and second
           anniversary dates of this agreement, plus one day, and 334 of such
           shares on the third anniversary date of this Agreement plus one day,
           and be subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Seacor
           Restricted Stock Agreement, attached as Exhibit A hereto.


<PAGE>
           (d) General Business Expenses. The Company shall pay or reimburse the
Employee for all authorized reasonable expenses authorized under Company's
reimbursement policies that are necessarily incurred by the Employee during the
Employment Term in the performance of the Employee's service under this
Agreement. Such payment shall be made upon presentation of such documents as the
Company customarily requires of its employees prior to making such payments or
reimbursements.

           5. Termination of Employment.

           (a) During the Employment Term, the Employee's status as an employee
will terminate immediately and automatically upon the earliest to occur of: (i)
the death or "Disability" (as defined below) of the Employee; (ii) the discharge
of the Employee by the Company "For Cause" (as defined below); or (iii) the
expiration of the Employment Term.

The Employee hereby accepts such employment subject to the terms and conditions
hereof.

           (b) As used herein, "For Cause" shall mean any one or more of the
following: (i) material or repeated violations by the Employee (after notice
thereof from the Company) of the terms of this Agreement or the Employee's
material or repeated failure (after notice thereof from the Company) to perform
the Employee's duties in a manner consistent with the Employee's position; (ii)
excessive absenteeism on the part of the Employee not related to illness or
disability; (iii) the Employee's indictment for a felony or conviction of a
misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; (iv) the Employee's commission of fraud,
embezzlement, theft or other acts involving dishonesty, or crimes constituting
moral turpitude, in any case whether or not involving the Company, that in the
opinion of the President, renders the Employee's continued employment harmful to
the Company; (v) substance abuse on the part of the Employee; or (vi) knowing
and material failure by the Employee to comply with applicable laws and
regulations relating to the business of the Company or its Affiliates; or (vii)
the Employee acting in bad faith relative to the Company's business interests.
In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company For Cause, Employee
shall be entitled to receive only that Salary earned and Benefits accrued
through the date of termination, and without limitation, will not be entitled to
receive any Stock, referred to in sub-paragraph 4 (c) (ii) of this Agreement,
not then vested.

          (c) As used herein, "Disability" shall mean a physical or mental
incapacity of the Employee that, in the good faith determination of the Company
has prevented the Employee from performing the duties assigned the Employee by
the Company for 30 consecutive days or for a period of more than 60 days in the
aggregate in any 12-month period and that, in the determination of the Company
after consultation with a medical doctor appointed by the Company, may be
expected to prevent the Employee for any period of time thereafter from devoting
the Employee's full time and energies (or such lesser time and energies as may
be acceptable to the Company in its sole discretion) to the Employee's duties as
provided hereunder. The Employee's employment hereunder, except as otherwise
agreed to in writing between the Company and the Employee, shall cease as of the
date of such determination. The Employee agrees to submit to medical
examinations, at the Company's sole cost and expense, to determine whether a
Disability exists pursuant to reasonable requests that the Company may make from
time to time. In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company under
sub-paragraph 5 (a) (i) hereof, Employee or his legal representatives, as
applicable, shall be entitled to receive all Salary earned, plus any Stock,


                                       2
<PAGE>
referred to in sub-paragraph 4 (c) (i) of this Agreement, shall vest
immediately, plus any and all Benefits then accrued, up to the date of the
employee's death, or the date of termination in the event of disability, as
applicable, except that to the extent that Employee remains employed during the
period of any such physical or mental incapacity as provided above, the Salary
otherwise payable to the Employee may, in the absolute discretion of the
Company, be reduced by the amount of any disability benefits or payments
received by the Employee from the Company or any disability or health plan
funded in whole or in part by the Company (excluding health insurance benefits
or other reimbursement of medical expenses attributable to insurance policies
that have not been funded in any part by the Company).

          (d) Additional Grounds for Termination by Company. The Company may
terminate Employee's employment: (a) at will, at any time, without cause; (b)
upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of Company; or (c) in connection with the
dissolution or liquidation of the Company. In event of termination by the
company under this Section 5(d), the Company shall be obligated (but shall only
be obligated) to Employee for the payment, at the times and upon the terms
provided for herein, of the Employee's Salary for the number of full months
remaining in the Term of this Agreement, together with all unpaid Benefits
awarded or accrued up to the date of termination, plus any Stock, referred to in
sub-paragraph 4 (c) (i) of this Agreement, shall vest immediately.

          (e) Termination by Employee. Any termination of this Agreement by the
Employee shall entitle the Company to discontinue payment of all Compensation
and Benefits, described in Paragraph 4 of this Agreement, accruing from and
after the date of termination, and without limitation, the Employee will not be
entitled to receive any Stock, referred to in sub-paragraph 4 (c) (i) of this
Agreement, not then vested.


           6. Confidential Information. The Employee shall hold, both during the
Employment Term and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, in a fiduciary
capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret or confidential information,
knowledge or data relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
corporate affiliates and their respective businesses and operations, including,
without limitation, customer lists, pricing, bid strategy, business strategies,
computer files and addresses, and corporate planning, which shall have been
obtained by the Employee during the Employee's employment (whether prior to or
after the date hereof) and which shall not have become public knowledge (other
than by acts of the Employee or his representatives in violation of this
Agreement or by third parties in violation of an obligation of confidentiality
to Company). The Employee agrees (i) that, without the prior written consent of
the Company or as may be otherwise required by law or legal process, he will not
communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to any party
other than the Company and (ii) to deliver promptly to the Company upon its
written request any confidential information, knowledge or data in his
possession, whether produced by the Company or any of its subsidiaries and
corporate and joint ventures or any past, current or prospective activity of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries and joint ventures. The obligations of the
Employee set forth in this Section 6 shall apply during the Employment Term and
shall survive termination of this Agreement and/or the termination of the
Employee's services for a period of three (3) years thereafter, regardless of
the reason for such termination.

           7. No Tampering. While Employee is employed by the Company and for
three (3) years following the termination of Employee's employment with the
Company, the Employee shall not request, induce or attempt to influence any


                                       3
<PAGE>
customers of the Company that have done business with or potential customers
which have been in contact with the Company to curtail or cancel any business
they may transact with the Company or request, induce or attempt to influence
any employee of the Company to terminate his or her employment with the Company.
The obligations of the Employee set forth in this Section 7 shall apply during
the Employment Term and shall survive termination of this Agreement and/or the
termination of the Employee's services under this Agreement for a period of
three (3) years thereafter, regardless of the reason for such termination.

           8. Limited Covenant Not to Compete.

           (a) While Employee is employed by the Company and for a period of two
(2) years following the Employment Term, but in no event less than the five (5)
years from the date of this Agreement, the Employee will not, directly or
indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, be employed by, participate in, or be
connected in any manner with the ownership, management, operation or control of
any company or other business enterprise engaged, directly or indirectly, in the
providing of helicopter transportation services for the offshore oil and gas
exploration and production industry in the Gulf of Mexico, so long as the
Company and its Parent or any of its Affiliates or joint ventures is engaged in
such business; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prohibit
the Employee from making investments in any publicly held company which do not
exceed in the aggregate two (2) percent of the equity interest of such company.

           (b) As part of the consideration for the compensation and benefits to
be paid to the Employee hereunder; to protect the trade secrets and confidential
information of Company and its affiliates that have been and will in the future
be disclosed or entrusted to the Employee, the business goodwill of the Company
and its affiliates that has been and will in the future be developed in the
Employee, or the business opportunities that have been and will in the future be
disclosed or entrusted to the Employee by the Company and its affiliates; and,
as an additional incentive for the Company to enter in this Agreement, the
Company and the Employee agree to the non-competition obligations hereunder. The
obligations of the Employee set forth in this Section 8 shall apply during the
Employment Term and shall survive termination of this Agreement and/or the
termination of the Employee's services under this Agreement for a period of two
(2) years, but in no event less than the five (5) years from the date of this
Agreement, regardless of the reason for such termination.


           9. Statements Concerning the Company. The Employee shall refrain,
both during the Employment Term and following the termination of Employee's
employment by the Company for any reason, from publishing any oral or written
statement about the Company, any of its affiliates, or any of such entities'
officers, employees, agents or representatives that are slanderous, libelous or
defamatory; or that disclose private or confidential information about the
Company, any of its affiliates, or any of such entities' business affairs,
officers, employees, agents or representatives; or that constitute an intrusion
into the seclusion or private lives of the Company, any of its affiliates, or
any of such entities' officers, employees, agents or representative or that give
rise to unreasonable publicity about the private lives of the Company, any of
its affiliates, or any of such entities' officers, employees, agents or
representatives; or that place the Company, any of its affiliates, or any of
such entities' officers, employees, agents or representatives in a false light
before the public; or that constitute a misappropriation of the name or likeness


                                       4
<PAGE>
of the Company, any of its affiliates, or any of such entities, officers,
employees, agents or representatives. A violation or threatened violation of
this prohibition may be enjoined by the courts. The rights afforded the Company
and its affiliates under this provision are in addition to any and all rights
and remedies otherwise afforded by law. The obligations of the Employee set
forth in this Section 9 shall apply during the Employment Term and shall survive
termination of this Agreement and/or the termination of the Employee's services,
regardless of the reason for such termination.

           10. Property of the Company. All memoranda, lists, notes, records,
manuals and related documents and other documents or papers (and all copies
thereof) relating to the Company or its Affiliates, including such items stored
in computer memories, microfiche or by any other means, made or compiled by or
on behalf of Employee, or made available to the Employee relating to the Company
and its Affiliates, shall be the property of the Company and its Affiliates, and
shall be delivered to the Company and its Affiliates promptly upon termination
of the Employee's employment with the Company and its Affiliates or at any other
time upon request; provided, however, that Employee's address books, diaries,
and rolodex files shall be deemed to be property of Employee.

           11. Injunctive Relief. In the event of a breach or threatened breach
by the Employee of the provisions of Sections 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 (the "Restrictive
Covenants") of this Agreement during or after the term of this Agreement, the
Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief restraining the Employee from
violation of such sections. Employee agrees not to contest same. Employee
further agrees that Company shall not be required to post any bond in any amount
as a condition to the granting of injunctive relief to Company. Nothing herein
shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any other remedy at
law or in equity it may have in the event of breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement by the Employee.

           12. Binding Effect.

           (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Company and any of its successors and assigns.

           (b) This Agreement is personal to the Employee and shall not be

           (c) The Company will require any successor or assign (whether direct
or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the assets or business of the Company (i) to assume
unconditionally and expressly this Agreement and (ii) to agree to perform all of
its obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
as would have been required of the Company had no assignment or succession
occurred, such assumption to be set forth in a writing reasonably satisfactory
to the Employee. In the event of any such assignment or succession, the term
"Company" as used in this Agreement shall refer also to such successor or
assign.

Agreement shall be in writing, shall be deemed to have been given and received

herein, contain or refer to the entire arrangement or understanding between the
Employee and the Company relating to the employment of the Employee by the
Company, and all prior negotiations, communications, commitments, agreements,
and understandings, written or verbal, are merged and incorporated herein. This

scope and in all other respects. If any court determines that any of the
Restrictive Covenants, or any part thereof, is unenforceable because of the
duration or geographical scope of such provision, such court shall have the
power to reduce the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, to
the extent necessary to bring such provision in compliance with the maximum
duration or geographical limitation permitted under the applicable law, and, in
its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable. If any court
determines that any Restrictive Covenant, or any part thereof, is invalid or
unenforceable, and not subject to reformation as provided above, the remainder
of the restrictive Covenants shall not thereby be affected and shall be given
full effect without regard to the invalid portions. Further, if any term or
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or
circumstance, shall at any time or to any extent be invalid or unenforceable,
the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such term or provision to
persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or
unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby and each term and provision of this
Agreement shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

           17. Waiver of Breach. The waiver by either party of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach thereof.

           18. Remedies Not Exclusive. No remedy specified herein shall be
deemed to be such party's exclusive remedy, and accordingly, in addition to all
of the rights and remedies provided for in this Agreement, the parties shall
have all other rights and remedies provided to them by applicable law, rule or
regulation.

           19. Beneficiaries. Whenever this Agreement provides for any payment
to be made to the Employee or his estate, such payment may be made instead to

and filed with the Company. The Employee shall have the right to revoke any such
designation from time to time and to redesignate any beneficiary or
beneficiaries by written notice to the Company.
