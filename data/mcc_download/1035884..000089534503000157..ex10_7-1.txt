Optional Termination:
--------------------

Either party may elect to terminate this Transaction on the following
dates, subject to the Modified Following Business Day Convention:

January 24, 2003

by oral telephonic notice of that date (the "Optional Termination Date")
given to the other party by 4:00pm. (New York time), and confirmed in
writing by facsimile transmission by 5:00pm. (New York time), 2 New York
Business Days prior to the Optional Termination Date, provided that an
Event of Default or Potential Event of Default does not exist with respect
to the party making the election, and provided further that this
Transaction does not otherwise become a Terminated Transaction under
Section 6(e) of the Agreement on or before the Optional Termination Date.

Unless prior to the Optional Termination Date the parties otherwise agree
on the termination date and the amount, due date and payor of the
termination payment to be made, then upon such election this Transaction
will terminate on the Optional Termination Date and be replaced by an
obligation of one party to make a payment under Section 6(e) of the
Agreement for this Transaction ("Cash Settlement Amount"). For that
purpose, (i) the Early Termination Date is the Optional Termination Date,
(ii) the Terminated Transaction is this Transaction, (iii) the Affected
Party is the Counterparty, and (iv) Wachovia will determine the Settlement
Amount for this Transaction. The Cash Settlement Amount will be due on the
New York Business Day following the Optional Termination Date by the party
obligated to pay that amount under section (6)(e) of the Agreement.

For any such election, Wachovia agrees to receive oral telephonic notice at
(704) 374-3471 and facsimile confirmation thereof at (704) 383-0575, and
Counterparty agrees to receive oral telephonic notice at 828-315-2991 and
facsimile confirmation thereof at 828-315-2958.

Additional Terms:
----------------
It is hereby acknowledged that, in lieu of Counterparty paying to Wachovia
a termination fee as consideration for the early termination of that
certain Transaction evidenced by a Confirmation dated March 10, 1999
between Wachovia and Counterparty, the terms of this Transaction have been
adjusted to reflect the value to Wachovia on the Trade Date of forgoing the
receipt of any such termination fee.

Documentation
-------------

If at any time there exists a master agreement (however described) between
the parties governing this Transaction ("Master Agreement"), this
Confirmation supplements, forms part of and will be governed by the Master
Agreement.

In the absence of such Master Agreement, this Confirmation shall
supplement, form a part of, and be subject to an agreement in the form of
the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) version
published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.
("ISDA Master") as if the parties had executed an agreement in such form,
but without any Schedule except for the election of New York law (without
regard to conflicts of law principles), and this Confirmation together with
the ISDA Master shall form a binding and complete contract between the
parties. Neither party is acting as the other party's financial advisor for
this Transaction nor is it relying on the other party for any evaluation of
the present or future results, consequences, risks, and benefits of this
transaction, whether financial, accounting, tax, legal, or otherwise.
