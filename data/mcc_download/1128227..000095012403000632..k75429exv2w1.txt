                            STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT


         THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made effective on
February 28, 2003, among Ralph M. Stepaniak, Kathleen M. Stepaniak (each a
"Shareholder" and collectively, the "Shareholders"), InsuranCenter Corp. of
Alpena ("ICA") and First Federal of Northern Michigan, a federally chartered
savings association ("FFNM"). Shareholders and ICA are sometimes collectively
referred to as the "Seller Parties."

                                   BACKGROUND

         A. Shareholders own all of ICA's issued and outstanding capital stock.

         B. ICA is a licensed insurance agency engaged in the business of
property and casualty and group health insurance (the "Business") at 123 S.
Second Avenue, Alpena, Michigan, 49707 (the "Premises").

         C. FFNM wishes to acquire ownership of ICA.

         D. FFNM will purchase from Shareholders and Shareholders will sell
their entire stock interest in ICA.

         E. To induce FFNM to enter into this Agreement, Shareholders are
entering into this Agreement to provide the representations, warranties,
covenants, and indemnities set forth in Article IV and VI of this Agreement. As
a further condition to FFNM's willingness to enter into this Agreement,
Shareholders have agreed not to compete with ICA and FFNM in the conduct of the
Business as provided in the covenant not to compete agreements in substantially
the form attached as Exhibit A (the "Noncompetition Agreements").

                                   AGREEMENTS

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Background and the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the Seller Parties and FFNM
hereby agrees as follows:

                           ARTICLE I - SALE OF SHARES

         1.1 Shares. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, Shareholders agree to sell and transfer to FFNM, and FFNM agrees to
purchase from Shareholders on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.5
hereof) a total of Four Hundred, Twenty-Four (424) shares of ICA common stock
(the "Shares") representing all of the issued and outstanding common stock of
ICA.

         1.2 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Shares (the "Purchase

<PAGE>

                  (a) Two Million, Three Hundred Fifty-Six Thousand, Seven
Hundred Seventy-Two and 65/100 Dollars ($2,356,772.65).

                  (b) Up to Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($900,000) shall be
paid pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section 1.7 hereof (each such
payment shall be referred to as an "Earn-Out Payment").

                  (c) Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000) per year for ten (10)
years pursuant to the Covenant Not to Compete Agreements in Exhibit A.

         1.3 Payment of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price will be paid by FFNM
to the Shareholders as follows:

                  (a) On the Closing Date, One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) as
adjusted pursuant to Section 1.8, in cash, certified check or wire transfer.

                  (b) Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000) at Closing representing
the first payment on the Covenant Not to Compete Agreements, and a like amount
annually on the anniversary date of Closing for nine (9) years.

                  (c) Ten (10) equal annual installment payments of principal
and interest of One Hundred Eighty Thousand Dollars ($180,000) (including
interest at a rate of 5.5% compounded monthly) payable in cash, certified check
or wire transfer, with the first such payment due on the first anniversary date
of the Closing.

                  (d) After the Closing Date, any portion of the Purchase Price
that has not yet been paid to Shareholder under Section 1.3(c) shall be subject
to the claims of FFNM and ICA for any indemnification obligation of Shareholders
under this Agreement; provided, however, the foregoing remedy is in addition to
any other rights and remedies FFNM and/or ICA may have under this Agreement or
by law or in equity.

         1.4 Transfer of Shares. On the Closing Date, the Shareholders shall
transfer all of their right, title and interest in and to the Shares to FFNM by
either properly endorsing the appropriate stock certificates, or by properly
assigning said stock certificates by signing appropriate stock assignments, and
then delivering all of said certificates and assignments to FFNM.

         1.5 Closing and Closing Date. The closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall occur at 10:00 a.m. on a
Business Day selected by FFNM that is a Business Day as soon as is practical
under the circumstances after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to occur of
the conditions specified in Article III (the "Closing Date"). In no event shall
Closing occur prior to January 1, 2003 or later than May 1, 2003, unless
Shareholders and FFNM agree in writing to an earlier or later date. The Closing
shall occur at



                                        2


<PAGE>

the offices of FFNM in Alpena, Michigan, or such other place on which
Shareholders and FFNM may mutually agree. All transactions and all documents
executed and delivered at the Closing shall be deemed to have occurred
simultaneously, and no transaction shall be deemed to have occurred and no
document shall be deemed to have been executed or delivered unless all
transactions have occurred and all documents have been executed and delivered.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Business Day" means a day on which
FFNM is open for business in Alpena, Michigan, and a day that is not a Saturday
or Sunday.

         1.6 Excluded Assets. The sale contemplated by this Agreement shall not
include the following ICA assets (and, if applicable, the related debt) which
shall be transferred out of ICA at or prior to Closing:

                  (a) Automobiles: See attached Schedule 1.6(a).

                  (b) Paid-up Life Insurance Policies: See attached Schedule
1.6(b).

         1.7 Earn-Out Payments.

                  (a) FFNM shall pay to the Shareholders up to an aggregate
amount of Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($900,000) in cash, payable by check or
wire transfer, in three annual payments, based upon the achievement of certain
revenue goals for calendar year 2003, 2004 and 2005, as follows:

                           (i) To the extent ICA's Net Revenue equals or exceeds
One Million, Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($1,250,000) for the
period March 1, 2003 to December 31, 2003 (the "2003 Period"), the Earn-Out
Payment for 2003 shall be Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000). To the
extent ICA's Net Revenue for the 2003 Period does not equal or exceed One
Million, Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($1,250,000), the
Earn-Out Payment shall be equal to: [$300,000 less the amount Net Revenue is
below $1,250,000], but in no event shall the Earn-Out Payment be less than zero.
Consequently, if Net Revenue is equal to or less than Nine Hundred Fifty
Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($950,000) there will be no Earn-Out Payment for the
year.

                           (ii) To the extent ICA's Net Revenue equals or
exceeds One Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) for calendar
year 2004, the Earn-Out Payment for 2004 shall be Three Hundred Thousand Dollars
($300,000). To the extent ICA's Net Revenue for calendar year 2004 does not
equal or exceed One Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000), the
Earn-Out Payment shall be equal to: [$300,000 less the amount Net Revenue is
below $1,500,000], but in no event shall the Earn-Out Payment be less than zero.
Consequently, if Net Revenue is equal to or less than One Million, Two Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($1,200,000) there will be no Earn-Out Payment for the year.



                                        3

<PAGE>

                           (iii) To the extent ICA's Net Revenue equals or
exceeds One Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) for calendar
year 2005, the Earn-Out Payment for 2005 shall be Three Hundred Thousand Dollars
($300,000). To the extent ICA's Net Revenue for calendar year 2005 does not
equal or exceed One Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000), the
Earn-Out Payment shall be equal to: [$300,000 less the amount Net Revenue is
below $1,500,000], but in no event shall the Earn-Out Payment be less than zero.
Consequently, if Net Revenue is equal to or less than One Million, Two Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($1,200,000) there will be no Earn-Out Payment for the year.

                  (b) For purposes of this Section 1.7, "Net Revenue" shall mean
the sum of: (i) commission income, contingency income and interest income; less
(ii) all commission paid to outside salespersons calculated in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.

                  (c) For purposes of computing Earn-Out Payments, Net Revenue
shall not be carried over from year-to-year.

                  (d) Each Earn-Out Payment (if any) shall be paid by FFNM to
the Shareholders within a reasonable period of time after the end of the
applicable calendar year.

         1.8 Equity Capital Adjustment. The Purchase Price shall be reduced
dollar-for-dollar for the amount that ICA's equity capital at February 28, 2003
is less than Four Hundred and Twenty Thousand Dollars ($420,000). Conversely,
the Purchase Price shall be increased dollar-for-dollar for the amount that
ICA's equity capital at February 28, 2003 exceeds Four Hundred Twenty Thousand
and no/100 Dollars ($420,000). Assets excluded from this transaction under
Section 1.6(a) and (b) shall be included, for calculation purposes only, in this
equity capital calculation as of February 28, 2003. ICA's equity capital shall
be determined by FFNM and a copy of the calculation thereof (the "Equity Capital
Statement") shall be delivered by FFNM to the Shareholders as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, but not later than 60 days thereafter.
The Shareholders shall give FFNM access to the data necessary to prepare the
Equity Capital Statement. Representatives of the Shareholders shall have the
right to participate with FFNM in the process of preparing the Equity Capital
Statement and shall have access to all data, schedules and work papers used by
FFNM in preparing the Equity Capital Statement. Equity capital shall be computed
as set forth in Section 4.9 based upon the monthly financial statements of ICA.

                         ARTICLE II - PRECLOSING ACTIONS

         Prior to the Closing Date:

         2.1 Conduct of Business. Seller Parties shall carry on and conduct the
Business only in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, without any
change in the policies, practices, and methods ICA pursued before the date of
this Agreement. Seller Parties will use

                                       4

<PAGE>


their best efforts to preserve the Business organization intact; to preserve the
business relationships with ICA's customers and insurers and others having
business dealings with ICA; and to preserve the services of ICA's employees,
agents, and representatives. Without limitation of the foregoing, (a) Seller
Parties will not undertake any action without FFNM's prior written consent that,
if taken prior to the date of this Agreement, would be required to be disclosed
on Schedule 4.11, and (b) Seller Parties will not take action or refrain from
taking action that would result in any material adverse change in ICA's assets
or liabilities other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practices.

         2.2 Access to FFNM. From the date of this Agreement through the
Closing, Seller Parties will permit FFNM and their representatives to make a
full business, financial, accounting, and legal audit of ICA. Seller Parties
will take all reasonable steps necessary to cooperate with FFNM in conducting
this audit. No such investigation by FFNM, or their representatives shall affect
Seller Parties' representations and warranties or FFNM's reliance on them.

         2.3 Accuracy of Representations and Warranties and Satisfaction of
Conditions. Seller Parties will immediately advise FFNM in writing if (a) any of
Seller Parties' representations or warranties are untrue or incorrect in any
material respect; or (b) Seller Parties become aware of the occurrence of any
event or state of facts that results in any of Seller Parties' representations
and warranties being untrue or incorrect in any material respect as if Seller
Parties were then being made. Seller Parties will not take any action, or omit
to take any action, that would result in any of the representations and
warranties of Seller Parties set forth in this Agreement being untrue or
incorrect in any material respect as of the Closing Date. Seller Parties will
use their best efforts to cause all conditions within any of their control that
are set forth in Article III to be satisfied as promptly as practicable under
the circumstances.

         4.29 Insurance. All insurance policies covering ICA's real and personal
property or providing for business interruption, liability coverage, and other

claims). Such insurance is in amounts ICA deems sufficient with respect to its
assets, properties, business, operations, and services as the same are presently
owned or conducted, and all such policies are in full force and effect and the
premiums have been paid. There are no claims, actions, suits, or proceedings
arising out of or based on any of these insurance policies, and no basis for any
such claim, action, suit, or proceeding exists. ICA is not in default with
respect to any provisions contained in any such insurance policies and has not
failed to give any notice or present any claim under any such insurance policy
in due and timely fashion.

         4.30 Real Property.

                  (a) Schedule 4.30 sets forth a complete list of each parcel of

Property except as set forth on Schedule 4.30. There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Shareholders, threatened proceedings in eminent domain
involving any such Real Property or any portion thereof, or for a sale in lieu
thereof, or of any plans for a possible widening of the streets abutting any
such Real Property or the imposition of any special taxes or assessments against
any such Real Property or any portion thereof.

                  (b) ICA does not lease any real property.

                  (c) To the knowledge of the Shareholders, the Real Property

Shareholders, no notice of violation of any applicable federal, state or local
statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, order or requirement, or of any
covenant, condition, restriction or easement currently affecting the Real
Property or with respect to the use or occupancy of the Real Property, has been
given to ICA by any governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Real
Property or by any other person entitled to enforce the same. To the knowledge
of the Shareholders, except as set forth on Schedule 4.30, there are no unpaid
taxes, assessments (special, general or otherwise) or bonds of any nature
affecting the Real Property or any portion thereof.

                  (d) To the knowledge of the Shareholders, ICA has not
subjected, and will not hereafter subject, the Real Property or any portion
thereof to any lease, sublease, tenancy, concession, license, occupancy
agreement or similar right, mortgage, deed of trust, lien, encumbrance, claim,
charge, equity, covenant, condition, restriction, easement, right of way or
other matter affecting the Real Property or any portion thereof except as set
forth in Schedule 4.30.

                  (a) To the knowledge of the Shareholders, except as set forth

or administrative proceeding, order, judgment, decree or settlement alleging or
addressing a violation of or liability under any requirements of law derived
from or relating to all federal, state and local laws relating to or addressing
the environment, health or safety (including, without limitation, the

sometimes herein collectively referred to as the "Environmental Laws".

                  (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.31, the Shareholders
have no knowledge of a "Release" nor have they or to Shareholders' knowledge,
ICA, filed any notice under any applicable Environmental Laws reporting such
"Release" (defined as any spill, emission, leaking, deposit, discharge,
dispersal or other release) into the indoor or outdoor environment or into or
out of any of the Real Property (including movement in or through the air, soil,
surface water, groundwater or property) of a "Contaminant" (defined as any
hazardous substance, toxic substance, hazardous waste, special waste, petroleum
or petroleum-derived substance or waste, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, or
any constituent of any of the foregoing, including such items as are defined

material violation of any applicable Environmental Laws.

                  (c) To the knowledge of the Shareholders, except as set forth
on Schedule 4.31, neither the Shareholders nor ICA have received any written
notice, claim or report from any governmental authority or third party to the
effect that ICA is or may be liable to any other person or entity as a result of
a Release or threatened Release of a Contaminant into the environment.

         4.32 Materiality. No statement in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered to FFNM pursuant to this Agreement contains or will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact, or fails or will fail to contain any material fact
necessary to make the statements not misleading.

                ARTICLE V - FFNM'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         FFNM represents and warrants to Seller Parties that:

         5.1 Organization and Standing. FFNM is a federally chartered savings
association duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the United
States of America, and has all the requisite power and authority (corporate and
otherwise) to own its properties and conduct its business as it is now being
conducted.

                                       18

<PAGE>

         5.2 Authorization. FFNM has taken all necessary action to approve the
execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by it. FFNM has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement. This Agreement is the legal, valid, and binding obligation of FFNM,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, or similar laws relating
to the enforcement of creditors' rights and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law
or in equity).

         5.3 Existing Agreements and Governmental Approvals.

                  (a) The execution, delivery, and performance of this
Agreement, the Covenant Not To Compete Agreements, and the Employment Agreements
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by them (i) do not and
will not violate any provisions of law applicable to FFNM; and (ii) do not and
will not conflict with, result in the breach or termination of any provision of,
or constitute a default under (in each case whether with or without the giving
of notice or the lapse of time) FFNM's Charter or Bylaws, or any indenture,
mortgage, lease, deed of trust, or other instrument, contract, or agreement or
any order, judgment, arbitration award, or decree to which FFNM is a party or by
which FFNM or any of FFNM's respective assets and properties are bound.

                  (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.3, no approval,
authority, or consent of, or filing by, FFNM with, or notification to, any
federal, state, or local court, authority, or governmental or regulatory body or
agency or any other corporation, partnership, individual, or other entity is
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Covenant Not To Compete Agreements, and the Employment Agreements or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by them.

                          ARTICLE VI - INDEMNIFICATION

         6.1 Indemnification Obligation. Shareholders shall jointly and
severally defend, indemnify, and hold harmless FFNM and ICA and their respective
directors, officers, shareholders, successors, and assigns from and against any
and all costs, losses, claims, liabilities, fines, expenses, penalties, and
damages (including reasonable legal fees) in connection with or resulting from:

                  (a) Operation or conduct of the Business prior to the Closing
Date that are not set forth on the Financial Statements or disclosed pursuant to
Article IV.

                  (b) Any material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
of any of the Seller Parties contained in this Agreement.



                                       19

<PAGE>

                  (c) Any failure by any of Seller Parties to perform or observe
in full, or to have performed or observed in full, any covenant, agreement, or
condition to be performed or observed by any of them under this Agreement or any
related agreement.

         6.2 Waiver. The Shareholders irrevocably waive and agree that they will
make no claim against ICA of any kind or character, whether by way of
subrogation, indemnification, contribution, breach of contract or any other
theory regarding any claim made by FFNM, or any other person under this Article
VI or otherwise, and the Shareholders irrevocably release and discharge ICA from
any such claim.

         6.3 Notice. FFNM or ICA (each, the "Indemnitee") will give prompt
written notice to the Shareholders (the "Indemnitors") of any claim ("Claim")
which it discovers or of which it receives notice after the Closing Date and
which might give rise to a Claim by it against Indemnitors under Article VI
hereof, stating the nature, basis and (to the extent known) amount thereof;
provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not jeopardize Indemnitee's
right to indemnification unless such failure shall have materially prejudiced
the ability of Indemnitor to defend such Claim.

         6.4 Defense by Indemnitors. In case of any Claim, suit or proceeding by
a third party or by any government body, or any legal, administrative or
arbitration proceedings with respect to which Indemnitors may have liability
under the indemnity agreement contained in Article VI, Indemnitors shall be
entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent desired by Indemnitors, to
assume the defense thereof at their own expense and through counsel of their own
choosing, and after notice from Indemnitors to Indemnitee of the election to
assume the defense thereof, Indemnitors will not be liable to Indemnitee for any
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with
the defense thereof, other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless
Indemnitors do not actually assume the defense thereof following notice of such
election. The parties will render each other such assistance as may reasonably
be required of each other in order to insure proper and adequate defense of any
such suit, Claim or proceeding. Indemnitee will not make any settlement of any
suit, Claim or proceeding which might give rise to liability of Indemnitors
under the indemnity agreements contained in Article VI without the written
consent of Indemnitors, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If
Indemnitors shall desire and be able to effect, a bona fide compromise or
settlement of any such suit, Claim, or proceeding and Indemnitee shall
unreasonably refuse to consent to such compromise or settlement, then
Indemnitors' liability under Article VI with respect to such suit, Claim or
proceeding shall be limited to the amount so offered in compromise or settlement
together with all legal and other expenses which may have been incurred prior to
the date on which Indemnitee refused to consent to such compromise or
settlement.

         6.5 Accounts Receivable. Attached as Schedule 6.5 is a listing of ICA's
accounts receivables of more than $1,000 that are more than thirty (30) days
delinquent as of the date hereof (which listing shall be updated as of the
Closing Date.) The Indemnitors shall

                                       20

<PAGE>

reimburse the Indemnitees the amount (the "Reimbursement Amount") by which the
sum of the accounts receivable which are disclosed on Schedule 6.5 on the
Closing Date (the "Closing Date Receivables") exceeds the sum of the amounts
collected by ICA in satisfaction of the Closing Date Receivables by one hundred
and fifty (150) days after the Closing Date. Amounts paid "on account" and not
designated by the payor to be paid in satisfaction of specific invoices or
clearly identifiable to specific invoices shall be presumed to have been paid in
satisfaction of the payor's oldest obligation to ICA and shall be so applied on
the books of ICA.

         6.6 Maximum Indemnification. There shall be no recovery under any
indemnification under this Article VI after the total recovery from Shareholders
on all claims under this Article VI has equaled Three Million Dollars
($3,000,000.00).

         6.7 Price Adjustment. All amounts paid by Shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, to the extent
permitted by law.

                             ARTICLE VII - EXPENSES

         Neither the ICA nor FFNM shall pay or be liable for any of the
following fees, expenses, taxes or liabilities incurred by the Shareholders or
ICA, all of which shall be borne and paid by the Shareholders:

         (a) the fees and expenses, if any, of any person retained by the
Shareholders or ICA for brokerage, financial advisory or investment banking
services or services as a finder rendered to the Shareholders or ICA in

or

         (c) any income, capital gains or other tax incurred by the Shareholders
or otherwise payable as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         If ICA shall pay or be liable for or accrue any fee, expense, tax or
liability described in this Article VII, the sum of all such payments or
liabilities shall be paid by the Shareholders to FFNM upon demand or FFNM may
reduce the Purchase Price accordingly.

the enforcement of the award, order, or judgment. Each party agrees to submit to
the jurisdiction of any such court for purposes of the enforcement of any such
award, order, or judgment.

                  (d) The arbitration shall be held before one arbitrator
knowledgeable in the general subject matter of the dispute, controversy, or
claim and selected by AAA in accordance with the Arbitration Rules, except that
any arbitration in which the disputed, controverted, or claimed amount (as
reflected on the demand for arbitration, as the same may be amended) exceeds
$10,000 shall be held before three arbitrators, one arbitrator being selected by
FFNM, one by the Shareholders, and the third by the other two arbitrators from a
panel of persons identified by AAA who are knowledgeable in the general subject
matter of the dispute, controversy, or claim.

                  (e) The arbitration shall be held in Alpena, Michigan.

                  (f) In any arbitration proceeding under this Section 10.12,
subject to the award of the arbitrator(s), each of the parties shall pay all its
own expenses, the fees and expenses of its own appointed arbitrator, and, if a
third arbitrator is required to be appointed pursuant to Section 10.12(d), an
equal share of the fees and expenses of the third arbitrator. The arbitrator(s)
shall have the power to award recovery of costs and fees (including reasonable
attorney fees, administrative and AAA fees, and arbitrators' fees) among the
parties as the arbitrator(s) determine to be equitable under the circumstances.

         10.13 Further Assurances. Each party hereto, at his or its sole cost
and expense and without expense to the other party hereto, will do such further
acts and execute and deliver such further documents regarding his or its
obligations hereunder as may be required solely for the purpose of (i)
accomplishing the purposes of this Agreement or (ii) assuring and confirming the
validity of any documents of conveyance to be delivered at Closing.
