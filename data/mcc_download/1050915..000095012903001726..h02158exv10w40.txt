         NOW, THEREFORE, in order to induce the Noteholders to amend the
Existing Note Purchase Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration
(the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged), the Company
agrees with the Noteholders as follows:

SECTION 1.        DEFINED TERMS.

         All capitalized terms used, but not specifically defined, in this
Amendment have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Existing Note
Purchase Agreement.

SECTION 2.        WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS.

         The Company warrants and represents to each Noteholder that as of the
date of this Amendment and as of the Second Amendment Effective Date (as defined
in Section 3):

         2.1      CORPORATE ORGANIZATION AND AUTHORITY. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has the corporate power and authority to transact the business it transacts and
proposes to transact, to execute and deliver this Amendment and to perform the
provisions hereof.

         2.2      NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. Since December 31, 2001, except as
disclosed in writing to the Noteholders, there has been no change in the
business, operations, affairs, financial condition, assets or properties of the
Company except for

                  (a)      changes in general, economic, market and industry
         conditions that are generally applicable to the Company and all other
         Persons that are in the same or similar businesses as the Company and
         are similarly situated, and

                  (b)      changes in the ordinary course of business,

that in the aggregate for all such changes, could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         2.3      FULL DISCLOSURE. Each written statement and all written
materials furnished by, or on behalf of, the Company to the Noteholders pursuant
to Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the Existing Note Purchase Agreement, taken as a
whole, and each written statement and all written materials furnished by, or on
behalf of, the Company to the Noteholders in connection with this Amendment,
taken as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances made. There is no fact known to the
Company which the Company has not disclosed to the Noteholders in writing which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         2.4      TRANSACTION IS LEGAL AND AUTHORIZED. The execution and
delivery of this Amendment by the Company, the consummation of each of the
transactions contemplated by this Amendment and the compliance by the Company
with all the provisions of this Amendment:

         duplication, Non-Cash Charges, all calculated on a consolidated basis
         for the Company and its Subsidiaries and as determined in accordance
         with GAAP. Upon the consummation of any Acquisition after the Second
         Amendment Effective Date, EBITDA may be calculated, subject to the
         immediately following sentence, using a calculation which (y) includes
         the historical financial results of the acquired business on a pro
         forma trailing four fiscal quarter basis (consistent with SEC
         regulations), and (z) assumes that the consummation of such Acquisition
         (and the incurrence, refinancing, or assumption of any Debt in
         connection with such Acquisition) occurred on the first day of the
         trailing four fiscal quarter period. The foregoing adjustment to EBITDA
         to take into account an Acquisition may only be made if the balance
         sheet and statements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows of
         the acquired Person (or the Person from whom the assets, securities or
         other equity interests were acquired), are in compliance with SEC
         regulations and requirements regarding the preparation and presentation
         of historical financial information and pro forma financial
         information."

                  "MINIMUM INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO" means, for any period, on a
         trailing four fiscal quarter basis, the ratio of (a) EBIT, to (b) the
         sum of Consolidated Interest Expense (excluding any Make-Whole Amount
         paid in connection with asset sales which result in a mandatory
         prepayment on the Senior Notes), plus the amount of any dividend or
         distribution recognized in respect of the Preferred Stock, determined
         in accordance with GAAP during such period."

                  "PERMITTED CHARGES" means, for any period, on a trailing four
         fiscal quarter basis, expenses, write-offs or losses, which in each
         case have been (a) paid, incurred or realized on or before June 30,
         2003, (b) disclosed to the Required Holders in such detail as the
         Required Holders deem acceptable, and (c) determined in accordance with
         GAAP, and which relate to:

                  operating lease termination expenses, and real estate lease
                  terminations (including related clean-up and moving charges)
                  which, in the aggregate do not exceed $29,000,000, provided
                  that, cash payments in connection with the items under this
                  clause (a), may not, in the aggregate, exceed $20,000,000,

                           (b)      accounts receivable, notes receivable,
                  retainage, costs and earnings in excess of billing, and other
                  amounts which (i) are either (A) set out in the consolidated
                  balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
                  fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2002 as net of allowances or (B)
