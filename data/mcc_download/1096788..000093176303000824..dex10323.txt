"Reaffirmation"), dated as of October 22, 2002 and effective as of November    ,
                                                                           ----

                              STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

     The Guarantor, the Borrowers, certain financial institutions (the "Prior
Lenders") and the Administrative Agent are party to that certain Credit
Agreement dated as of December 22, 1998 (as amended, restated or otherwise
modified prior to the date hereof the "Original Credit Agreement") under the
terms of which the Prior Lenders provided the Borrowers with a secured
$50,000,000 revolving credit facility. The Borrowers' obligations under the
Original Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor and
secured by Liens granted and assignments made to the Administrative Agent by the
Borrowers and the Guarantor, for the ratable benefit of itself and the Prior
Lenders, in each case pursuant to the Security Documents (as defined in the
Original Credit Agreement).

     The Guarantor, the Borrowers, the Lenders (including certain Prior Lenders)
and the Administrative Agent now desire to amend and restate the provisions of
the Original Credit Agreement pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement of even date herewith (as amended, restated or otherwise modified, the
"Credit Agreement") by and among the Guarantor, the Borrower, the Lenders and
the Administrative Agent.

     Certain of the Security Documents are being amended and restated pursuant
to the terms of a Collateral Agreement dated as of the date hereof among
Borrowers, Guarantor and the Administrative Agent.

     The Borrowers and the Guarantor have entered into the agreements listed on
Schedule 1 hereto (the "Reaffirmed Documents"). Copies of the agreements listed
on Schedule 1 are attached hereto as Exhibit A.

     In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement
and as a condition precedent thereto, the Lenders have requested that the
Borrowers and the Guarantor execute and deliver this Reaffirmation and the
Borrowers and the Guarantor have agreed to execute and deliver this
Reaffirmation pursuant to the terms hereof.

Administrative Agent, any investigation or inquiry by the Administrative Agent
or the Lenders or the making of any Loan under the Credit Agreement.
