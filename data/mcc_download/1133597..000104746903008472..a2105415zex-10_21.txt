Dear Mr. Gunter:

     We have been advised that Refocus Group, Inc. ("Refocus") intends to enter
a merger transaction with Presby Corp ("Presby") resulting in Refocus adopting
the business operations of Presby. As you are aware, we are owed $1,800 for
services provided to Refocus in connection with the maintenance of the "Grade
The Web" website (the "Website"). We propose that, in the event you consummate
the merger transaction with Presby, we acquire all rights, title and interest in
and to the Website in consideration of our forgiveness of the $1,800 presently
owed to our firm for services provided during calendar 2002 and through the date
of this letter. In addition, the website agreement and office lease between
Insite Productions, L.L.C. and Refocus shall be terminated as of the effective
date of the merger transaction. We acknowledge that upon consummation of this
transaction, we will have no further claims against Refocus.

     By executing this Letter Agreement in the designated space below, you
acknowledge and agree to transfer all rights, title and interest in and to the
Website immediately subsequent to the closing of the above-referenced merger
transaction in consideration for our release of Refocus of any and all
obligations due and owing to us, including the amount of $1,800 payable under
that certain invoice dated December 31, 2002. Furthermore, we will be
responsible for properly evidencing the transfer of ownership in the Website.

                                              Sincerely yours,
                                              Insite Productions, L.L.C.


                                              /s/ Adrienne Beam
