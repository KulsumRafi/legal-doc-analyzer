shall have the right to appoint a fourth  NYFIX  Designee as a Voting  Director,

                        (c)  The  Voting  Directors  may  appoint  a  number  of

discussions  regarding the management of the Company and make recommendations to

available  on  commercially  reasonable  terms  as  determined  by the  Board of
Directors.

            6.3  MEETINGS.  (a) The Board of Directors  shall meet at least once

waiver of notice,  signed by the director entitled to notice,  whether before or

equivalent to notice.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose
of any meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in any written waiver
of  notice  thereof.  Attendance  of a  director  at a  meeting  of the Board of
Directors shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting.

                        (d) The Board of Directors may hold its meetings at such
place or  places  within or  without  the State of  Delaware  as the  Designated

case may be) in order to constitute a quorum for the  transaction of business at

such committee),  except as otherwise  expressly required by this Agreement.  In
the  absence  of a quorum for any such  meeting,  a  majority  of the  directors
present  thereat may adjourn such meeting from time to time until a quorum shall

permitted  to be taken  at any  meeting  of the  Board  of  Directors  or of any
committee  thereof  may be taken  without a meeting,  without  prior  notice and
without a vote,  if a consent  in  writing,  setting  forth the action so taken,

and such  consent is filed with the minutes of the  proceedings  of the Board of
Directors or such committee.

however,  any cash distribution to be paid to any Member pursuant to this clause
may be  reduced  by the  amount of any cash  distributions  paid to such  Member

50% shall go to the Company.  The party that is  responsible  for collecting the
revenues  shall  remit 50% to the  other  party  within  five  business  days of
receipt.  This revenue sharing arrangement shall remain in effect for thirty-six
months   following  the  Original   Effective  Date  and   thereafter   will  be

                        (a) For purposes of determining the Profits,  Losses, or
any other item  allocable  to any  period  (including  allocations  to take into
account any changes in any Member's Membership Interest during a Fiscal Year and
any  transfer of any interest in the  Company),  Profits,  Losses,  and any such
other  item  shall  be  determined  on a daily,  monthly,  or  other  basis,  as

and  substance  to counsel for the Company,  that such  transfer  complies  with
applicable  federal and state  securities  laws and the  Agreement and that such
transfer, for federal income tax purposes, will not cause the termination of the
Company under Section 708(b) of the Code,  cause the Company to be treated as an
association  taxable  as a  corporation  for income tax  purposes  or  otherwise
adversely affect the Company or the Members; and

                        (d) The transferor shall have complied with such other
conditions as the Board of Directors may reasonably require from
time to time.

Transfers  will be recognized by the Company as effective only upon the close of

                           AGREEMENT,  A  COPY  OF  WHICH  IS  ON  FILE  AT  THE
                           PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE COMPANY. THE UNITS MAY NOT BE
                           SOLD, TRANSFERRED,  ASSIGNED, PLEDGED,  HYPOTHECATED,
                           OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED

                                   ARTICLE XI
                              ADMISSION OF MEMBERS

            11.1  ADMISSION  OF  MEMBERS.  The  Board  of  Directors  may  admit
Additional Members to the Company with the Required Approval,  and may determine
the Capital  Contributions and Membership Interests of such Additional Member or
Members;  provided,  however,  that the aggregate number of Membership Interests
held by Additional  Members shall not equal greater than 40% of all  outstanding
Membership Interests; and provided, further, that no Person shall be admitted as


<PAGE>


an  Additional  Member  without  the prior  written  consent  of the  Designated
Directors. To the extent that a NYFIX Designee does not consent to the admission
of an  Additional  Member,  NYFIX shall have 30 business  days to match (or find
someone else to match) the  consideration  and proposed terms of such investment
at which time if NYFIX does not match (or find  someone else to match) the offer
then the NYFIX  Designee  shall  consent  to the  admission  of such  Additional
Member; provided, however, that if such consideration and proposed terms are not
on  financially  reasonable  terms,  then the NYFIX  Designee  may  withhold its
consent to the admission of such  Additional  Member and need not match (or find
someone  else to match) the offer.  A person so  approved  to be  admitted as an
Additional Member shall be so admitted upon making a Capital Contribution to the
Company,  executing a counterpart to this Agreement, and furnishing to the Board
of Directors an acceptance,  in form satisfactory to the Board, of all the terms
and  conditions of this  Agreement  and such other  documents as the Board shall
require.  Such admission shall become  effective on the date that the Designated
Directors  determine that such conditions  have been satisfied.  With respect to
any such  Additional  Member  admitted to the Company,  the Capital  Accounts of
Members other than such Additional Member shall be adjusted, i.e. "booked up" or
"booked   down"   as   the   case   may   be,   in   accordance   with   Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)  of the Tax Regulations to reflect the Capital Contribution
of the  Additional  Member,  except as otherwise  determined  by the  Designated
Directors.

                                   ARTICLE XII
                           DISSOLUTION AND WINDING UP

            12.1  DISSOLUTION.  The Company  shall be dissolved  and its affairs
wound up upon receipt of Required Approval.

            12.2 EFFECT OF DISSOLUTION.  Upon dissolution, the Company shall not
be  terminated  and shall  continue  until the  winding up of the affairs of the
Company is completed and a certificate of  cancellation  has been filed with the
Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

            12.3 DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS ON DISSOLUTION.  Subject to Section 12.5
below,  upon the winding up of the Company,  the  Designated  Directors (or such
Person(s)  designated by such  directors)  shall take full account of the assets
and  liabilities  of the  Company,  shall  liquidate  the  assets  (unless  such
directors determine that a distribution of any Company Property in-kind would be
more  advantageous  to the  Members  than the sale  thereof,  in which  case the
adjustments to the Members'  respective  Capital Account pursuant to Section 7.2
shall  be  made  immediately  prior  to such  distribution)  as  promptly  as is
consistent with obtaining the fair value thereof, and shall apply and distribute
the proceeds therefrom in the following order:

                        (a) first,  to the payment of the debts and  liabilities
of the Company to creditors,  including Members who are creditors, to the extent
permitted  by law, in  satisfaction  of such debts and  liabilities,  and to the
payment of necessary expenses of liquidation;

                        (b) second, to the setting up of any reserves which the
Designated  Directors  may deem  necessary or  appropriate  for any  anticipated
obligations or contingencies of the Company arising out of or in connection with
the operation or business of the Company.  Such reserves may be paid over by the
Board to an escrow agent or trustee  selected by the Designated  Directors to be
disbursed   by  such  escrow   agent  or  trustee  in  payment  of  any  of  the
aforementioned  obligations or contingencies  and, if any balance remains at the
expiration  of  such  period  as  the  Board  shall  deem  advisable,  shall  be
distributed by such escrow agent or trustee in the manner hereinafter provided;

                        (c) third,  to the Members pro rata in  accordance  with
and to the extent of their positive capital account balances, if any; and

                        (d)  then,  to the  Members  in  accordance  with  their
Membership Interests.

            Liquidation  proceeds shall be paid within 60 days of the end of the
Company's taxable year in which the liquidation occurs. Such distributions shall
be in cash or Property (which need not be distributed proportionately) or partly
in both, as determined by the Board.  In the case of a distribution of Property,
the Board shall endeavor,  to the extent feasible,  to distribute to each Member
the Property which such Member had previously contributed to the Company.

            If at the time of  liquidation  the Designated  Directors  determine
that an immediate sale of some or all Company Property would cause undue loss to
the Members, the Board may, in order to avoid such loss, defer liquidation.

            12.4 WINDING UP AND FILING  CERTIFICATE  OF  CANCELLATION.  Upon the
commencement  of the winding up of the Company,  a certificate  of  cancellation
shall be  delivered  by the  Company to the  Secretary  of State of the State of
Delaware  for  filing.  The  certificate  of  cancellation  shall  set forth the
information  required  by the  Act.  The  winding  up of the  Company  shall  be
completed when all debts,  liabilities  and obligations of the Company have been
paid and discharged or reasonably adequate provision therefor has been made, and
all of the  remaining  Property  of the  Company  has  been  distributed  to the
Members.

            12.5 PREFERENCE.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Article XII, upon dissolution and winding up of the Company, NYFIX shall
receive,  in  preference to all other  Members,  (i) a cash amount equal to $1.0
million and (ii) all of the rights to the Intellectual Property.

                                  ARTICLE XIII
                              NYFIX PURCHASE OPTION

            13.1 NYFIX  PURCHASE  OPTION.  (a) NYFIX  shall have the option (the
"NYFIX Option"), but not the obligation,  to purchase Units of the other Members
as follows:

                                    (i)   Between   the  24th  and  30th  months
            following the Original  Effective Date,  NYFIX may purchase from the
            other Members,  on a pro rata basis, a minimum of 20%, and a maximum
            of  40%  of  all  of the  outstanding  Units,  based  on an  implied
            valuation for the Company of $48 million;

                                    (ii)   Between  the  31st  and  36th  months
            following the Original Effective Date, NYFIX may purchase additional
            Units  from the  other  Members,  on a pro rata  basis,  based on an
            implied valuation for the Company of $60 million; provided, however,
            that if the NYFIX  Option was not  exercised  pursuant to clause (i)
            above and NYFIX elects to exercise the NYFIX Option pursuant to this
            clause (ii), then NYFIX must purchase a minimum of 20% of all of the
            outstanding Units; and

                                    (iii)  Between  the  37th  and  48th  months
            following the Original Effective Date, NYFIX may purchase additional
            Units  from the  other  Members,  on a pro rata  basis,  based on an
            implied valuation for the Company of $72 million; provided, however,
            that if the NYFIX Option was not  exercised  pursuant to clauses (i)
            or (ii) above and NYFIX elects to exercise the NYFIX Option pursuant
            to this clause  (iii),  then NYFIX must purchase a minimum of 20% of
            all of the outstanding Units.

Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Section 13.1(a),  in
no event may NYFIX  exercise  the NYFIX Option for more than an aggregate of 40%
of all of the outstanding Units; provided,  however, that if NYFIX has exercised
the NYFIX  Option for the entire  40%,  then it may  negotiate  with  individual
Members for  additional  Units of such Members.  Upon the expiration of the 48th
month   following  the  Original   Effective   Date,   the  NYFIX  Option  shall
automatically  lapse and expire and shall not thereafter afford NYFIX any rights
whatsoever.

                        (b) Upon the exercise of the NYFIX Option, a pro rata
portion of the  outstanding  Company  Options (as defined in Section 14.1 below)
shall be deemed to have been  exercised for Units and therefore  will be subject
to the NYFIX Option.

                        (c) NYFIX may exercise the NYFIX Option by delivering
written  notice (the "Exercise  Notice") to the Company and the Members  stating
NYFIX's election to exercise the NYFIX Option. The Exercise Notice shall include
the following: (i) the aggregate number of Units NYFIX intends to purchase; (ii)
the  calculation  of the  aggregate  amount of  consideration  to be paid to the
Members  (the  "Exercise  Price");  (iii)  whether  the  exercise is through the
exchange  of cash or Shares;  and (iv) the  proposed  Exercise  Date (as defined
below).  NYFIX shall deliver the Exercise  Notice to the Company and the Members
at least three  business  days prior to the date of the closing of the  purchase
and sale of the Units  pursuant to this Section 13.1 (the "Exercise  Date").  On
the Exercise Date, NYFIX shall pay the Exercise Price in cash or shares of NYFIX
Common Stock (the "Shares").  The fair market value of the Shares shall be based
on the  five-day  trading  average  ending on the day  immediately  prior to the
Exercise Date. Except as set forth in the proviso of the penultimate sentence of
Section 13.1(a) above, any Units purchased pursuant to the NYFIX Option shall be
purchased pro rata from all of the other Members  according to their  Membership
Interests.  In connection  with any purchase of Units by NYFIX  pursuant to this


<PAGE>


Section 13.1 using  Shares,  NYFIX agrees to grant to each Member  receiving the
Shares, registration and indemnification rights on the following terms:

                                    (i)  NYFIX  agrees  to  file a  registration
statement  pursuant to the  Securities  Act,  covering  the resale of all of the
Shares  (the  "Registration  Statement")  as soon as  possible  but in any event
within 60 days following the Exercise  Date.  NYFIX agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the
Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (the "SEC") as soon as  practicable  after
filing it and will  notify  each Member  when such  Registration  Statement  has
become  effective.  NYFIX agrees to use its reasonable  best efforts to keep the
Registration  Statement  effective  (including the preparation and filing of any
amendments and  supplements  necessary for that purpose)  during the period from
the date that the Registration  Statement is declared effective by the SEC until
the  earlier  of (i) the date on which the  Members  shall  have sold all of the
Shares and (ii) the date on which all of the Shares are  eligible  to be sold or
transferred  under Rule 144 without holding period or volume  limitations  (such
period,  the  "Effective  Period").  Upon  seeking  to offer and sell its Shares
pursuant to the Registration Statement, each Member agrees to provide in writing
in a timely  manner,  information  regarding the proposed  distribution  by such
Member of the Shares and such other information reasonably requested by NYFIX in
connection  with the  preparation  of and for the inclusion in the  Registration
Statement.  NYFIX  agrees to provide to each  Member the number of copies of the
final  prospectus and any  amendments or  supplements  thereto as are reasonably
requested  by such  Member.  NYFIX  shall  promptly  notify  the  Member  of any
threatened stop order by the SEC or if the  Registration  Statement ceases to be
effective  for any reason at any time  during the  Effective  Period,  and NYFIX
shall use its reasonable best efforts and take all reasonable  actions  required
to prevent  the entry of such stop order or to obtain the prompt  withdrawal  of
any order suspending the effectiveness thereof.

                                    (ii) NYFIX agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless,  to the  extent  permitted  by law and  subject  to the  terms of this
Agreement, each Member, its directors,  officers,  employees and agents and each
person who  controls  such Member  (within the  meaning of the  Securities  Act)
against  any  losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities  and  expenses  (including
reasonable  attorneys' fees and disbursements)  arising out of or based upon any
untrue  or  alleged  untrue  statement  of a  material  fact  contained  in  the
Registration  Statement (or any  amendment  thereto) or the  prospectus  (or any
amendment or  supplement  thereto) or any omission or alleged  omission to state
therein a material fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein in the light of the circumstances  under which they were
made not misleading;  provided,  however,  that NYFIX shall not be liable to any
Member to the extent that any such loss,  claim,  damage,  liability  or expense
arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue or alleged  untrue  statement or any
omission,  if such  statement or omission  shall have been made in reliance upon
and in conformity with information  relating to such Member furnished in writing
to  NYFIX  by any  such  Member  expressly  for  use in the  preparation  of the
Registration  Statement (or any  amendment  thereto) or the  prospectus  (or any
amendment or supplement thereto).


<PAGE>


                                    (iii) In  connection  with the  Registration
Statement,  each Member agrees to indemnify,  to the extent permitted by law and
subject  to the  terms  of  this  Agreement,  NYFIX,  its  directors,  officers,
employees  and agents and each person who controls  NYFIX (within the meaning of
the  Securities  Act)  against  any losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities  and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) arising out of
or based  upon any  untrue  or  alleged  untrue  statement  of a  material  fact
contained  in the  Registration  Statement  (or any  amendment  thereto)  or the
prospectus  (or any amendment or supplement  thereto) or any omission or alleged
omission  to state  therein a material  fact  required  to be stated  therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein in the light of the  circumstances
under  which  they were made not  misleading,  to the  extent  that such  untrue
statement  or  omission  was  made  in  reliance  upon  and in  conformity  with
information furnished in writing to NYFIX by such Member (in his or her capacity
as a  shareholder  of  NYFIX)  expressly  for  use  in  the  preparation  of the
Registration  Statement (or any  amendment  thereto) or the  prospectus  (or any
amendment or supplement thereto). The liability of any Member under this Section
13.1(c)(iii)  shall not in any event  exceed the net  proceeds  received by such
Member from the sale of Shares covered by the Registration Statement.

                                    (iv) Each party entitled to  indemnification
under this Section  13.1(c)  shall give notice to the party  required to provide
indemnification  promptly after such  indemnified  party has actual knowledge of
any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the indemnifying
party to  assume  the  defense  of any such  claim or any  litigation  resulting
therefrom;  provided that counsel for the indemnifying  party, who shall conduct
the defense of such claim or  litigation,  shall be approved by the  indemnified
party  (whose  approval  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or  delayed);  and
provided,  further,  that the delay or failure of any indemnified  party to give
notice as  provided  herein  shall not  relieve  the  indemnifying  party of its
obligations  under  this  Section  13.1(c),   except  to  the  extent  that  the
indemnifying  party shall have been materially  adversely affected by such delay
or  failure.  The  indemnified  party may  participate  in such  defense at such
party's expense;  provided,  however, that the indemnifying party shall pay such
expense if the indemnified party shall have reasonably  concluded that there may
be  a  conflict  between  the  positions  of  the  indemnifying  party  and  the
indemnified  party in  conducting  the  defense of any such claim or  litigation
resulting therefrom. No indemnified party shall consent to entry of any judgment
or settle  any claim or  litigation  without  the prior  written  consent of the
indemnifying party. If the indemnification  provided for in this Section 13.1(c)
from the indemnifying  party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in
respect of any losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities  or expenses  referred to
therein as a result of a judicial  determination that such  indemnification  may
not be enforced in such case  notwithstanding  this Agreement,  the indemnifying
party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified  party,  shall contribute to the
amount  paid or payable by such  indemnified  party as a result of such  losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified  parties in
connection  with the actions  which  resulted in such losses,  claims,  damages,
liabilities or expense, as well as any other relevant equitable  considerations.
The relative fault of such indemnifying  party and indemnified  parties shall be
determined by reference to, among other things,  whether any action in question,
including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact or omission or
alleged  omission  to state a  material  fact,  has been made by, or  relates to


<PAGE>


information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified parties, and the
parties'  relative intent,  knowledge,  access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such action. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution   from  any  person   who  was  not   guilty  of  such   fraudulent
misrepresentation.


                                   ARTICLE XIV
                                 MISCELLANEOUS

            14.1 COMPANY  OPTION PLAN.  (a) The Company  shall adopt an employee
incentive  plan  approved  by the  Designated  Directors,  pursuant to which the
Company can issue to its employees  options to purchase Units,  restricted Units
or other  instruments  to acquire  Units or  participate  in the  profits of the
Company,  up to an  aggregate  of 10% of the  outstanding  Units  (the  "Company
Options") as follows:

                                    (i) up to 2% prior  to  December  31,  2002;
            provided  that they may only be issued to  employees  who joined the
            Company after the Original Effective Date;

                                    (ii) up to an additional 4% between  January
            1, 2003 and December 31, 2003;  provided that they may not be issued
            to Renaissance Members until their annual reviews;

                                    (iii) up to an additional 4% between January
            1, 2004 and December 31, 2004; and

                                    (iv)  all  remaining  options  up to the 10%
            maximum after December 31, 2004.

Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained  in this  Section  14.1(a),
under no  circumstance  shall Company  Options be issued to the Management  Team
without the prior written consent of the NYFIX Designees.

                           (b) Each Company Option shall have an exercise price
equal to the fair market value of a Unit on the date of grant,  as determined by
the Designated Directors.

                           (c) Each Company Option shall vest in equal amounts
on the first four anniversaries of the date of grant; provided, however, that if
a holder of a Company  Option has his  employment  with the Company  terminated,
then such holder shall be credited with one additional vesting period.

            14.2  EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENTS.  Each  Renaissance  Member  agrees  to
execute an Employment Agreement as well as a Non-Competition, Non-Disclosure and
Non-Solicitation  Agreement,  in forms  reasonably  acceptable to the Management
Team.


<PAGE>


            14.3  REPURCHASE  OF UNITS.  To the  extent a  Renaissance  Member's
employment with the Company is terminated,  for any reason,  prior to the fourth
anniversary  of the  Original  Effective  Date,  such  Renaissance  Member shall
forfeit  a  portion  of his  Units to the  Company,  pursuant  to the  following
schedule:

             Date of Termination                         % of Units Forfeited
             -------------------                         --------------------
 Prior to the first anniversary                            100%
 Between the first and second anniversaries                 80%
 Between the second and third anniversaries                 50%
 Between the third and fourth anniversaries                 20%
 After the fourth anniversary                                0%

Such  forfeited  Units  shall be  automatically  cancelled.  At the time of such
forfeiture,  the  Company  shall  have the right  (the  "Company's  Option")  to
repurchase  such  Member's  Units that were not  forfeited,  at their book value
(defined as the Members  Equity as  determined  in  accordance  with  accounting
principles  generally  accepted in the United  States of America  divided by the
number  of  Units   outstanding)  as  of  the  end  of  the  Company's  previous
quarter-end.  In addition,  NYFIX shall have the option (at its sole discretion)
to require the Company to exercise the  Company's  Option,  provided  that NYFIX
purchases an equal number of Units from the Company for the book value.

            14.4 NOTICES.  Notices to the Company shall be sent to the Principal
Office of the Company.  Notices to the Members shall be sent to their  addresses
set forth on their signature pages hereto.  Any Member may require notices to be
sent to a different  address by giving notice to the other Members in accordance
with this Section 14.4. Any notice or other communication  required or permitted
hereunder  shall be in  writing,  and shall be deemed  to have been  given  with
receipt confirmed if and when delivered personally,  mailed first class (postage
prepaid),  delivered to a nationally  recognized  overnight courier,  or sent by
facsimile, to such addresses.

            14.5 ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement,  together with the Schedules
attached  hereto,  constitute  the entire  agreement  between  the  parties  and
supersedes  any prior  agreement or  understanding  between them  respecting the
subject matter hereof.

            14.6 SAVING  CLAUSE.  If any  provision  of this  Agreement,  or the
application  of such  provision  to any  person or  circumstance,  shall be held
invalid,  the remainder of this Agreement,  or the application of such provision
to persons  or  circumstances  other than those as to which it is held  invalid,
shall not be affected thereby.

            14.7  COUNTERPARTS.  This  Agreement  may be  executed  in  multiple
counterparts,  each of  which  shall be  deemed  an  original,  but all of which
together  shall  constitute one and the same  instrument.  A facsimile copy of a
signature shall be deemed an original signature.


<PAGE>


            14.8 GOVERNING LAW. The Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

            14.9 NO RIGHTS OF CREDITORS AND THIRD PARTIES UNDER  AGREEMENT.  The
Agreement  is entered  into among the Company and the Members for the  exclusive
benefit of the Company,  its Members and their  successors  and  assignees.  The
Agreement  is  expressly  not  intended  for the benefit of any  creditor of the
Company  or any  other  person.  Except  and  only  to the  extent  provided  by
applicable  statute,  no such  creditor or any third party shall have any rights
under the  Agreement  or any  agreement  between the Company and any Member with
respect to any Capital Contribution or otherwise.

            14.10 AMENDMENTS. All amendments to this Agreement shall require the
approval of the Members holding at least a majority of the Membership Interests.
After an amendment under this Section 14.10 becomes effective, the Company shall
mail to the Members a notice briefly describing such amendment.

            14.11  GENERAL  INTERPRETIVE   PRINCIPLES.   For  purposes  of  this
Agreement,  except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided  or  unless  the  context
otherwise requires:

                        (a) the terms  defined  in this  Agreement  include  the
plural as well as the singular, and the use of any gender herein shall be deemed
to include the other gender;

                        (b) accounting  terms not otherwise  defined herein have
the meanings  given to them in the United  States in accordance  with  generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied;

                        (c) references  herein to "Sections,"  "paragraphs"  and
other subdivisions  without reference to a document are to designated  Sections,
paragraphs and other subdivisions of this Agreement;

                        (d) a reference to a paragraph without further reference
to a Section is a reference  to such  paragraph as contained in the same Section
in  which  the  reference  appears,  and this  rule  shall  also  apply to other
subdivisions;

                        (e) the words "herein," "hereof,"  "hereunder" and other
words of  similar  import  refer  to this  Agreement  as a whole  and not to any
particular provision; and

                        (f) the term "include" or "including" shall mean without
limitation by reason of enumeration.

     Section  1.704-2(g)  of the Tax  Regulations.  Allocations  pursuant to the
     previous  sentence  shall be made in proportion to the  respective  amounts
     required to be allocated to each Member pursuant  thereto.  The items to be
     so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Sections  1.704-2(f)(6)
     and  1.704-2(j)(2)  of the Tax  Regulations.  This paragraph is intended to
     comply with the minimum gain chargeback  requirement in Section  1.704-2(f)
     of the Tax Regulations and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

2.   PARTNER MINIMUM GAIN  CHARGEBACK.  Except as otherwise  provided in Section
     1.704-2(i)(4) of the Tax Regulations, if there is a net decrease in Partner
     Nonrecourse  Debt Minimum Gain  attributable to a Partner  Nonrecourse Debt
     during  any  Fiscal  Year,  each  Member  who  has a share  of the  Partner
     Nonrecourse  Debt Minimum  Gain  attributable  to such Partner  Nonrecourse
     Debt,  determined  in  accordance  with  Section  1.704-2(i)(5)  of the Tax
     Regulations,  shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain
     for such Fiscal Year (and,  if  necessary,  subsequent  Fiscal Years) in an
     amount  equal  to such  Member's  share  of the  net  decrease  in  Partner
     Nonrecourse  Debt Minimum  Gain  attributable  to such Partner  Nonrecourse
     Debt,  determined  in  accordance  with  Section  1.704-2(i)(4)  of the Tax
     Regulations. Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in
     proportion  to the  respective  amounts  required to be  allocated  to each
     Member pursuant  thereto.  The items to be so allocated shall be determined
     in accordance  with Sections  1.704-2(i)(4)  and  1.704-2(j)(2)  of the Tax
     Regulations. This paragraph (2) is intended to comply with the minimum gain
     chargeback  requirement in Section 1.704-2(i)(4) of the Tax Regulations and
     shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

3.   QUALIFIED INCOME OFFSET. In the event any Member unexpectedly  receives any
     adjustments,   allocations,   or   distributions   described   in   Section
     1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4),   Section   1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5),   or  Section
     1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6) of the Tax Regulations, items of Company income and
     gain  shall be  specially  allocated  to the Member in an amount and manner
     sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Tax Regulations, the
     Adjusted  Capital  Account  Deficit of the  Member as quickly as  possible,
     provided  that an allocation  pursuant to this  paragraph (3) shall be made
     only if and to the extent that the Member  would have an  Adjusted  Capital

     Account Deficit after all other  allocations  provided for in this schedule
     have  been  tentatively  made as if this  paragraph  (3)  were  not in this
     schedule.

4.   GROSS  INCOME  ALLOCATION.  In the event any Member  has a deficit  Capital
     Account at the end of any Fiscal  Year which is in excess of the sum of the
     amounts such Member is  obligated  to restore  pursuant to the terms of the
     Agreement  or  is  deemed  to be  obligated  to  restore  pursuant  to  the
     penultimate  sentences of Sections  1.704-2(g)(1)  and 1.704-2(i)(5) of the
     Tax  Regulations,  each such Member shall be specially  allocated  items of
     Company  income  and  gain in the  amount  of such  excess  as  quickly  as
     possible,  provided that an allocation pursuant to this paragraph (4) shall
     be made only if and to the  extent  that such  Member  would have a deficit
     Capital Account in excess of such sum after all other allocations  provided
     for in this schedule have been made as if paragraph (3) and this  paragraph
     (4) were not in this Agreement.

5.   NONRECOURSE DEDUCTIONS. Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Year shall be
     specially  allocated  among the Members in proportion  to their  Membership
     Interests.

6.   PARTNER NONRECOURSE DEDUCTIONS.  Any Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any
     Fiscal  Year  shall be  specially  allocated  to the  Member  who bears the
     economic risk of loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which
     such Partner  Nonrecourse  Deductions are  attributable  in accordance with
     Section 1.704-2(i)(1) of the Tax Regulations.

7.   MANDATORY  ALLOCATIONS  UNDER  SECTION  704(C)  OF THE  CODE.  In the event
     Section  704(c)  of the  Code or  Section  704(c)  of the  Code  principles
     applicable under Section  1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)  of the Tax Regulations require
     allocations of Profits or Losses in a manner  different than that set forth
     above, the provisions of Section 704(c) of the Code and the Tax Regulations
     thereunder  shall control such allocations  among the Members.  Any item of
     Company  income,  gain,  loss and  deduction  with  respect to any property
     (other than cash) that has been  contributed  by a Member to the capital of
     the  Company  or which  has been  revalued  for  Capital  Account  purposes
     pursuant to Section  1.704-l(b)(2)(iv) of the Tax Regulations) and which is
     required  or  permitted  to be  allocated  to such  Member  for  income tax
     purposes  under  Section  704(c) of the Code so as to take into account the
     variation  between the tax basis of such property and its fair market value
     at the time of its  contribution  shall be allocated  solely for income tax
     purposes in a manner so required or permitted  under Section  704(c) of the
     Code;  provided,   however,  that  curative  allocations  --------  -------
     consisting of the special allocation of gain or loss upon the sale or other
     disposition of the  contributed  property shall be made in accordance  with
     Section  1.704-3(c)  of the Tax  Regulations  to the  extent  necessary  to
     eliminate any disparity, to the extent possible,  between the Members' book
     and tax  Capital  Accounts  attributable  to  such  property.

8.   CURATIVE  ALLOCATIONS.  The  allocations  set forth above (the  "Regulatory
     Allocations")  are intended to comply with certain  requirements of the Tax
     Regulations  and it is  the  intent  of the  Members  that,  to the  extent
     possible,  all Regulatory Allocations shall be offset with other Regulatory
     Allocations.  Furthermore,  notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of this
     Schedule A, the Members shall make such offsetting  special  allocations of
     Company income,  gain,  loss, or deduction in whatever manner it determines
     appropriate  so that,  after such  offsetting  allocations  are made,  each
     Member's Capital Account balance is, to the extent  possible,  equal to the
     Capital  Account  balance  such  Member  would  have had if the  Regulatory
     Allocations  were not part of this  Agreement  and all  Company  items were
     allocated pursuant to Article VIII. The Company (i) shall take into account
     future Regulatory  Allocations  that,  although not yet made, are likely to
     offset  other  Regulatory   Allocations   previously  made,  and  (ii)  may
     reallocate  Profits  and  Losses  for prior  open  years (or items of gross
     income and  deduction  of the Company for such years)  among the Members to
     the extent it is not  possible to achieve such result with  allocations  of
     items of income (including gross income) and deduction for the current year
     and future  years.  This  paragraph  8 shall  control  notwithstanding  any
     reallocation  or  adjustment  of taxable  income,  taxable  loss,  or items
     thereof by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

9.   DEFINITIONS:

                        a. ADJUSTED  CAPITAL  ACCOUNT  DEFICIT shall mean,  with
                        respect to any Member,  the deficit balance,  if any, in
                        such  Member's  Capital  Account  as of  the  end of the
                        relevant  Fiscal  Year,   after  giving  effect  to  the
                        following adjustments:

                        Sections  1.704-2(g)(1)  and  1.704-2(i)(5)  of the  Tax
                        Regulations; and

                        Sections                        1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4),
                        1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5),  and 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6) of
                        the Tax Regulations.

               The foregoing  definition of Adjusted  Capital Account Deficit is
               intended   to   comply   with   the    provisions    of   Section
               1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)   of  the  Tax   Regulations  and  shall  be

                        if such  Partner  Nonrecourse  Debt  were  treated  as a
                        Nonrecourse  Liability,  determined in  accordance  with
                        Section 1.704-2(i)(3) of the Tax Regulations.

                        f. PARTNER  NONRECOURSE  DEDUCTIONS  has the meaning set
