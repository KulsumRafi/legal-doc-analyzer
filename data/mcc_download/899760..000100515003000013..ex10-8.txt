                  Independent Designee shall be appointed by a majority of the
                  remaining directors), and one of whom shall be designated by


                                       2
<PAGE>


                  the WCAS Holders (so long as such holders are entitled to
                  appoint at least one WCAS Designee, and thereafter, such
                  Independent Designee shall be appointed by a majority of the
                  remaining directors); provided that the Independent Designees
                  designated by the Carlyle Holders and WCAS Holders shall be
                  reasonably acceptable to the WCAS Holders and Carlyle Holders,
                  respectively; provided, further, with respect to the initial
                  designation of the Independent Designees, the Carlyle Holders
                  and WCAS Holders shall use their reasonable best efforts to
                  coordinate the timing for their respective searches for
                  Independent Designees following the Closing Date.

all of which designees shall hold office, subject to their earlier removal in
accordance with clause (a)(iii) below, the Amended and Restated LLC Agreement
and applicable law, until their respective successors shall have been elected
and shall have qualified;

                  (iii) the removal from the Board (with or without cause) of
          (x) any director upon the written request of the Equityholders that
          designated such director or (y) in the case of any director not so
          designated by such Equityholders (including any director which shall
          no longer be a "Designee" of either the Carlyle Holders or the WCAS
          Holders as a result of a reduction in the number of such Holder's
          Designees pursuant to clause (a)(ii) above), by duly adopted action of
          the Board;

                  (iv) upon any vacancy in the Board as a result of any
          individual (x) designated by Equityholders pursuant to clause (ii)
          above ceasing to be a member of the Board, whether by resignation or
          otherwise, the election to the Board of an individual designated by
          such Equityholders, or (y) not so designated by such Equityholders
          ceasing to be a member of the Board, whether by resignation or
          otherwise, the election to the Board of an individual appointed by a
          majority of the remaining directors; and

                  (v) one Carlyle Designee to hold the position of Co-Chairman
          of the Board, who shall initially be James A Attwood, Jr., and one
          WCAS Designee to hold the position of Co-Chairman of the Board, who
          shall initially be Anthony J. de Nicola; provided, however, this
          clause (v) shall be applicable with respect to the Carlyle Holders or
          WCAS Holders, as applicable, only if such holders have the ability to
          designate at least one director in accordance with Section 1(a)(ii)(A)
          and (B), respectively.

          (b) No action may be taken at a meeting of the Board unless a quorum
consisting of at least two Carlyle Designees (or, if applicable, the single
remaining Carlyle Designee) and at least two WCAS Designees (or, if applicable,
the single remaining WCAS Designee) is present in person or by proxy, unless, in
either case, such Equityholders no longer have a designee on the Board, provided
that, neither the Carlyle Designees nor the WCAS Designees, respectively, shall
be entitled to assert the foregoing quorum right in respect of a duly called
meeting if all of its designees have failed to attend the two immediately prior
duly called Board meetings. The act of a majority of the Directors present at
any meeting, including in any event at least one of the Carlyle Designees and
one of the WCAS Designees (provided that, neither the Carlyle Designees nor the
WCAS Designees, respectively, shall be entitled to assert the foregoing approval
right in respect of a duly called meeting if all of its designees have failed to
attend the two immediately prior duly called Board meetings), shall be the act
of the Board, provided that if, at any time, the Carlyle Holders or the WCAS
Holders, as the case may be, Transfer more than 80% of their original Percentage


                                       3
<PAGE>


Interests, then the act of a majority of the directors shall no longer require a
Carlyle Designee or a WCAS Designee, as the case may be.

          (c) The Board may, by duly adopted action of the Board, designate one
or more committees of one or more of the directors, including alternates who may
replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee;
provided that at least one Carlyle Director and one WCAS Director shall be
designated on each sitting committee of the Board. In addition, each
Equityholder agrees to take all necessary and desirable actions within its
control to cause its designees to the Board to vote or otherwise give such
director's consent to the creation and maintenance of:

                  (i) a Compensation Committee of the Board, consisting of an
          equal number of Carlyle Designees and WCAS Designees and any
          additional directors as the Board may determine, which Compensation
          Committee shall approve all grants of stock options to employees of
          the Company, changes to compensation of officers of the Company, all
          annual bonuses granted to officers of the Company and all other
          employee benefits (including, without limitation, vacation policy,
          benefit plans, company automobiles and insurance) granted to officers
          of the Company; and

                  (ii) an Audit Committee of the Board, consisting of an equal
          number of Carlyle Designees and WCAS Designees and any additional
          directors as the Board may determine, which Audit Committee shall
          review and approve the financial statements of the Company as audited
          by the Company's independent certified public accountants.

          (d) Without obtaining the approval of each of (x) a majority of the
Interests owned by the Carlyle Holders and (y) a majority of the Interests owned
by the WCAS Holders, the Company shall not and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to:

                  (i) appoint, dismiss or replace the Chief Executive Officer or
          any of the other members of the Senior Management of the Company or
          any of its Subsidiaries;

                  (ii) enter into any material agreement for obtaining credit or
          financing from a third-party lender, including any public issuance or
          private placement, in excess of $25 million in aggregate;

                  (iii) merge or consolidate with or into another Person;

                  (iv) sell, transfer or dispose of all of its assets or assets
          with a value in excess of $25 million in any twelve-month period;

                  (v) issue any securities or register common stock (or common
          stock equivalents) in an initial public offering, recapitalize or
          reclassify existing securities, or undertake a tender offer or
          exchange offer (in accordance with the Securities Act and the Exchange
          Act, respectively);

                  (vi) in one or more related transactions, acquire, purchase or
          invest in any assets, other than in the ordinary course of business,


                                       4
<PAGE>


          or dispose of any assets, other than in the ordinary course of
          business, with a value in excess of $25 million in aggregate in any
          twelve-month period;

                  (vii) approve its annual operating budget (including its
          expected capital expenditure budget), or any material amendment or
          modification thereof, including, but not limited to, entering into any
          new or materially different line of business;

                  (viii) settle any material claims or litigation;

                  (ix) engage in any transactions between the Company and any
          Affiliate of the Company;

                  (x) declare, pay or accrue any dividends on, or repurchase,
          any Interests or class of capital stock;

                  (xi) amend its certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or
          comparable governance documents);

                  (xii) enter into any other material contracts or arrangements
          with payment obligations or payment receipts in excess of (A) $5
          million individually, or (B) $25 million in aggregate with respect to
          related contracts or arrangements;

                  (xiii) appoint, create or maintain any committees of the
          Board, other than as contemplated herein;

                  (xiv) voluntarily liquidate, dissolve or windup the Company or

          Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and

                  (xvi) adopt or amend any stock option plan or other employee
          benefit plan, or issue any capital stock or other securities under any
          such plan, other than capital stock or other securities which it is
          obligated to issue under the terms of any existing or approved option
          or any existing or approved plan;

provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the approval of
the Carlyle Holders or the WCAS Holders, as the case may be, pursuant to this
Section 1(d) shall not be required with respect to any actions by the Company
(other than to the extent required under applicable law) at any time after the
Carlyle Holders or the WCAS Holders, as the case may be, Transfer more than 80%
of their original Percentage Interest.

          (e) The Parties agree to take all necessary action to cause Dex Media
East LLC (f/k/a SGN LLC), a Delaware limited liability company ("DEX MEDIA EAST
LLC"), to have at all times an Office of the Chairman, which shall have such
powers as the Board assigns to it from time to time, including, but not limiting
to, general supervision of the affairs of Dex Media East LLC, and shall keep the
Board fully informed about the activities of Dex Media East LLC. The authorized
number of Persons on the Office of the Chairman shall initially be established


                                       5
<PAGE>


at five (5), consisting of (i) one designee from CP III, who shall initially be
James A. Attwood, (ii) one designee from Welsh Carson IX, who shall initially be
Anthony J. de Nicola, and (iii) the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Dex Media East LLC; provided,
however, if either the Carlyle Holders or WCAS Holders do not have the right to
designate at least one director in accordance with Section 1(a)(ii)(A) and (B),
such Party will not have the right to designate a member of the Office of the
Chairman, with such vacancy to be filled by the Board. A meeting of the Office
of the Chairman may be called by any member upon three (3) Business Days' notice
to each other member. No action may be taken at a meeting of the Office of the
Chairman unless a quorum consisting of a majority of members, including the CP
III and Welsh Carson IX designees, is present in person or by proxy, unless, in
either case, the Carlyle Holders or WCAS Holders no longer have a designee on
the Board, provided that, neither of the CP III and Welsh Carson IX designees,
respectively, shall be entitled to assert the foregoing quorum right in respect
of a duly called meeting if its designee has failed to attend the two
immediately prior duly called meetings. The act of a majority of the members of
the Office of the Chairman present at any meeting, including the CP III and
Welsh Carson IX designees (provided that, neither designee, respectively, shall
be entitled to assert the foregoing approval right in respect of a duly called
meeting if such designee has failed to attend the two immediately prior duly
called meetings), shall be the act of the Office of the Chairman, provided that
if, at any time, the Carlyle Holders or the WCAS Holders, as the case may be,
Transfer more than 80% of their original Percentage Interests, then the act of a
majority of the directors shall no longer require such CP III and Welsh Carson
IX designees, as the case may be.

          (f) The Parties agree to take all necessary action, either directly
through the Company or indirectly through one of its Subsidiaries (as
applicable), to cause the board of directors of each of the Company's
Subsidiaries to have at all times a board composition that is the same as the
Company's Board, unless otherwise determined by the Company's Board, and the
Parties further agree that the other board and voting rights set forth in this
Section 1 shall be granted, mutatis mutandis, to each of the Equityholders in
respect of such Subsidiaries' boards of directors.

SECTION 2. TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

          Each of the Equityholders agrees and acknowledges that it will not,
directly or indirectly, during a period equal to the lesser of (a) four years
from the date hereof and (b) the period from date hereof until the IPO Date
(such period, the "BLOCKOUT PERIOD"), Transfer any Interests, unless such
Transfer complies with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company and each of the Equityholders acknowledges and agrees that any of the
following Transfers by any Equityholder are deemed to be in compliance with this
Agreement (each of which Transfers shall be accompanied by concurrent notice to
the Company): (w) a Transfer approved by each of CP III and Welsh Carson IX, (x)
a Transfer to an Affiliate of such Equityholder; (y) a Transfer made as part of
a distribution by an Equityholder to its respective general or limited partners
or members, as the case may be, following the IPO Date; or (z) a Transfer made
in connection with an offering of securities pursuant to the exercise of an
Equityholder's registration rights (together with Transfers pursuant to clauses
(w), (x) and (y), "PERMITTED TRANSFERS"); provided, however, that no Transfers
shall be made under this Agreement when the Company is "in registration" or for
a period of 180 days, or such shorter period required by the underwriters, after
the IPO Date. Any transferee of such Transfer (other than a transferee acquiring


                                       6
<PAGE>


such Interests pursuant to a registered offering, Public Sale or distribution
contemplated by clause (y) above) shall agree in writing with the Parties to be
bound by, and to comply with, all applicable provisions of and to be deemed to
be an Equityholder for purposes of this Agreement.

SECTION 3. NOTICE OF PROPOSED TRANSFER

          (a) Prior to any proposed Transfer of any Interests (other than under
the circumstances described in clause (w), (x), (y) or (z) of Section 2), the
holder thereof shall give written notice to the Company of its intention to
effect such Transfer. Each such notice shall describe the manner of the proposed
Transfer and, if requested by the Company, shall be accompanied by an opinion of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company to the effect that the proposed
Transfer of the Interests may be effected without registration under the
Securities Act, whereupon, subject to Sections 2, 4, 5 and 6, the holder of such
Interests shall be entitled to Transfer such Interests in accordance with the
terms of its notice. To the extent applicable, each certificate for Interests
Transferred as above provided shall bear a legend to the effect that such
Interests are unregistered under the Securities Act and may not be Transferred
unless the Interests have been registered under the Securities Act or an
exemption from registration is available, unless (i) such Transfer is in
accordance with the provisions of Rule 144 (or any other rule permitting public
sale without registration under the Securities Act) or (ii) the opinion of
counsel referred to above is to the further effect that the transferee and any
subsequent transferee (other than an Affiliate of the Company) would be entitled
to Transfer such securities in a public sale without registration under the
Securities Act.

          (b) The foregoing restrictions on Transfer of Interests shall
terminate as to any particular Interests when (i) such Interests shall have been
effectively registered under the Securities Act and sold or otherwise disposed
of in accordance with the intended method of disposition by the seller or
sellers thereof set forth in the registration statement concerning such
Interests or (ii) an Equityholder of such Interests is able to demonstrate to
the Company (and its counsel) that the provisions of Rule 144(k) (or other
equivalent rule) of the Securities Act are available to such holder without
limitation. In either case, such holder of Interests shall be entitled to
receive from the Company, without expense, a new certificate not bearing a
restrictive legend, to the extent such Interests are generally available in
certificated form by the Company.

SECTION 4. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL

          (a) At any time after the end of the Blockout Period, an Equityholder
(a "SELLING HOLDER" for the purposes of this Section 4) receives a bona fide
offer from a Person (the "OFFEROR") to purchase any Interests, such Selling
Holder shall provide written notice ("ROFR NOTICE") to the Carlyle Holders and
WCAS Holders (as applicable) and the Company, which ROFR Notice shall set forth
(i) confirmation that such Selling Holder intends to Transfer all or certain of
its Interests to such Offeror, (ii) the number of Interests proposed to be
Transferred (the "OFFERED INTERESTS"), (iii) the proposed amount and form of
consideration to be paid for the Offered Interests and (iv) all other material
terms of the proposed Transfer. In the event that the terms and/or conditions
set forth in the ROFR Notice are thereafter amended in any material respect, the
Selling Holder(s) shall give written notice (an "AMENDED ROFR NOTICE") of the
amended terms and conditions of the proposed Transfer to the Carlyle Holders and


                                       7
<PAGE>


WCAS Holders (as applicable) and the Company. Within ten (10) Business Days of
receipt of the ROFR Notice, or, if later, within five (5) Business Days of the
Amended ROFR Notice (the "ELECTION PERIOD"), the Carlyle Holders and the WCAS
Holders (as applicable) will have an irrevocable right to elect to purchase all,
but not less than all (unless the Selling Holder otherwise agrees to in
writing), of the Offered Interests at the price and on the terms and conditions
set forth in the ROFR Notice or, if applicable, Amended ROFR Notice, by delivery
of a written notice to the Selling Holder (the "ELECTION NOTICE"). During such
Election Period, such Selling Holder will provide the Carlyle Holders and WCAS
Holders with any additional information as is reasonably requested with respect
to such ROFR Notice and the Offered Interests. The Election Notice shall
constitute the binding agreement of each electing Carlyle Holder and WCAS Holder
(each, an "ELECTING PARTY") with the Selling Holder to purchase and sell,
respectively, all of such Offered Interests at the price and on the terms and
conditions set forth in the ROFR Notice or Amended ROFR Notice, as applicable;
provided that if either the Carlyle Holders or the WCAS Holders are the Selling
Holders and the Offeror identified by such holders is not reasonably acceptable
to the WCAS Holders or the Carlyle Holders, as applicable, receiving the ROFR
Notice, then the holders receiving such ROFR Notice shall be permitted to assign
their respective rights and obligations under this Section 4 to another Person,
who shall in any event be reasonably acceptable to the Selling Holders, for
purposes of acquiring the Offered Interests and such other Person, upon
acceptance of the assignment, shall be deemed to be the "Electing Party" for all
purposes of this Section 4. If there is more than one Electing Party, such
Election Notice shall constitute the binding agreement of the Electing Parties
and Selling Holder to purchase and sell, respectively, all of such Offered
Interests to such Electing Parties (on a pro rata basis according to the
Percentage Interests owned by such Electing Parties or as otherwise agreed by
them) at the price and on the terms and conditions set forth in the ROFR Notice
or Amended ROFR Notice, as applicable.

          (b) Within thirty (30) days of delivery of the Election Notice, each
Electing Party shall deliver to the Selling Holder (by certified check or wire
transfer in immediately available funds) the purchase price of such Offered
Interests to be purchased by such Electing Party, and the Selling Holder shall
deliver certificates duly endorsed for Transfer or with duly executed stock
powers or similar instruments, or such other instrument of Transfer of such
Transferred Interests as may be reasonably requested by each Electing Party and
the Company, with all stock transfer taxes paid and stamps affixed, and the each
Electing Party shall comply with any other conditions to closing generally
applicable to such Selling Holder(s) and the Electing Parties in such
transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Governmental Approval is
required in connection with any such purchase of Offered Interests and such
Governmental Approval has not been completed or obtained on or prior to the date
scheduled for closing, the closing of the purchase of all Offered Interests
shall take place on the fifth (5th) Business Day after such Governmental
Approval has been completed or obtained. The Parties shall use reasonable
efforts to complete or obtain any such required Governmental Approval; provided,
however, that no Party shall be required to agree to any divestiture or
operational constraint or pay any material amount of money (other than the
filing fee payable in connection with any notification required under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended ("HSR"), which
shall be paid by such Electing Party) as a condition of obtaining such
Governmental Approval. If each of the Parties has acted in good faith to
complete or obtain any such required Governmental Approval and such Governmental
Approval has not been completed or obtained on or before the date which is
ninety (90) days after the delivery to the Selling Holder of the Election


                                       8
<PAGE>


Notice, the proposed sale of Offered Interests subject to such required
Governmental Approval shall be cancelled with respect to such Electing Party
and, for all purposes, such Electing Party shall be deemed to have elected not
to purchase such Offered Interests pursuant to this Section 4, and the Selling
Holder shall be free to Transfer the Offered Interests to (i) the remaining
Electing Parties in accordance with this Section 4 or (ii) if no such Electing
Parties remain, the Offeror.

          (c) If the Election Notice is not received by such Selling Holder from
any Carlyle Holder or WCAS Holder within the period specified in Section 4(a),
the Selling Holder shall have the right to Transfer the Offered Interests
specified in the ROFR Notice or Amended ROFR Notice, as applicable, to the
Offeror in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, but only at a price and
upon terms and conditions no less favorable to the Selling Holder than those
stated in the ROFR Notice or Amended ROFR Notice, as applicable, and only if the
consummation of sale occurs on a date within ninety (90) days from the end of
the Election Period.

          (d) For purposes of calculating the purchase price of any such
Transfer, if any portion of the consideration consists of other than cash, the
Fair Market Value of any non-cash consideration shall be determined in
accordance with Section 14(k) herein.

          (e) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Section 4
shall occur at the principal place of business of the Company unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by the parties to such transaction.

          (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) prior to any Transfer of
Interests by a Selling Holder pursuant to this Section 4, the Selling Holder
shall, after complying with the provisions of this Section 4, comply with the
provisions of Section 6 hereof, if applicable; (ii) nothing in this Section 4
shall prevent a Permitted Transfer of any Interests by any Equityholder; and
(iii) the Carlyle Holders and the WCAS Holders, as applicable, shall not be
entitled to the ROFR rights under this Section 4 at any time that the Carlyle
Holders or the WCAS Holders, as applicable, have Transferred more than 80% of
their respective original Percentage Interests.

SECTION 5. DRAG-ALONG RIGHTS

          (a) If the Carlyle Holders and the WCAS Holders collectively (the
"SELLING HOLDERS" for the purposes of this Section 5) propose a Transfer to any
Person (collectively, a "DRAG-ALONG TRANSFEREE") in a bona fide arm's-length
transaction or series of transactions (including by way of a purchase agreement,
tender offer, merger or other business combination transaction or otherwise) of
an amount of Interests equal to 51% or more in the aggregate of the then
outstanding Interests on the date thereof (an "EXIT SALE" for the purposes of
this Section 5), then the Selling Holders may elect to require each (but not
fewer than each) Other Equityholder to Transfer, as a part of the Exit Sale to
such Drag-Along Transferee at the purchase price and upon the other terms and
subject to the conditions of the Exit Sale (all of which shall be set forth in
the Drag-Along Notice), that number of Interests as is equal to the product of
(i) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Interests proposed to be
sold by the Selling Holders and the denominator of which is the aggregate number
of Interests owned as of the date of the Drag-Along Notice by the Selling
Holders and (ii) the number of Interests owned by such Other Equityholder as of
the date of the Drag-Along Notice.


                                       9
<PAGE>


          (b) The rights set forth in Section 5(a) shall be exercised by giving
written notice (the "DRAG-ALONG NOTICE") to each Other Equityholder, at least
twenty (20) Business Days prior to the date on which the Selling Holders expect
to consummate the Transfer giving rise to such Drag-Along Right. In the event
that the terms and/or conditions set forth in the Drag-Along Notice are
thereafter amended in any respect, the Selling Holders shall give written notice
(an "AMENDED DRAG-ALONG NOTICE") of the amended terms and conditions of the
proposed Transfer to each Other Equityholder. Each Drag-Along Notice and Amended
Drag-Along Notice shall set forth: (i) the name of the Drag-Along Transferee and
the amount of Interests proposed to be purchased by such Drag-Along Transferee,
(ii) the proposed amount and form of consideration and terms and conditions of
payment offered by the Drag-Along Transferee and a summary of any other material
terms pertaining to the Transfer, (iii) the number of Interests that such Other
Equityholder is required to sell in such Transfer and (iv) all other material
terms of the proposed Transfer. After the delivery of such Drag-Along Notice,
such Selling Holder will provide each of the Other Equityholders with any
additional information as is reasonably requested with respect to such Transfer.

          (c) All Transfers of Interests to the Drag-Along Transferee pursuant
to this Section 5 shall be consummated contemporaneously at the offices of the
Company, unless the Selling Holder(s) elect otherwise, on the later of (i) a
Business Day not less than twenty (20) or more than sixty (60) days after the
Drag-Along Notice is delivered to the Parties or (ii) the fifth (5th) Business
Day following receipt of all material Governmental Approvals, or at such other
time and/or place as the parties to such Transfers may agree. The delivery of
certificates (if any) or other instruments evidencing such Interests shall be
made on such date, against payment of the purchase price for such Interests,
duly endorsed for Transfer or with duly executed stock powers or similar
instruments, or such other instrument of Transfer of such Interests as may be
reasonably requested by the Selling Holders and the Company, with all stock
transfer taxes paid and stamps affixed. Additionally, each Equityholder shall
comply with any other conditions to closing generally applicable to such Selling
Holders and all Other Equityholders selling Interests in such transaction. Each
Other Equityholder shall receive the same amount and form of consideration
received by the Selling Holder per each Interest. To the extent that the Parties
are to provide any indemnification or otherwise assume any other post-closing
liabilities, the Selling Holders and all Other Equityholders selling Interests
in a transaction under this Section 5 shall do so severally and not jointly (and
on a pro rata basis in accordance with their Interests being sold) and their
respective potential liability thereunder shall not exceed the proceeds
received, subject to customary exceptions in excess of such limits. Furthermore,
each Other Equityholder shall only be required to give customary representations
and warranties, including, but not limited to, title to interests conveyed,
legal authority and capacity and non-contravention of other agreements.

          (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no drag-along rights under this
Section 5 shall apply with respect to any Permitted Transfer.

SECTION 6. TAG-ALONG RIGHTS

          (a) If any Carlyle Holder or WCAS Holder (for purposes of this Section
6, a "SELLING HOLDER") proposes to Transfer Interests held by such Selling
Holder(s), whether in one transaction or in a series of related transactions,
then such Selling Holder(s) shall give written notice (a "TAG-ALONG NOTICE") to


                                       10
<PAGE>


each Other Equityholder setting forth in reasonable detail the terms and
conditions of such proposed Transfer, including the proposed amount and form of
consideration, terms and conditions of payment and a summary of any other
material terms pertaining to the Transfer. In the event that the terms and/or
conditions set forth in the Tag-Along Notice are thereafter amended in any
respect, the Selling Holder(s) shall give written notice (an "AMENDED TAG-ALONG
NOTICE") of the amended terms and conditions of the proposed Transfer to each
Other Equityholder. The Selling Holder(s) shall provide additional information
with respect to the proposed Transfer as reasonably requested by the Other
Equityholders.

          (b) The Other Equityholders shall have the right, exercisable upon
written notice to the Selling Holder(s) within twenty (20) days after receipt of
any Tag-Along Notice, or, if later, within seven (7) days of such receipt of the
most recent Amended Tag-Along Notice, to participate in the proposed Transfer by
the Selling Holder(s) to the proposed purchaser (the "TAG-ALONG TRANSFEREE") on
the terms and conditions set forth in such Tag-Along Notice or the most recent
Amended Tag-Along Notice, as the case may be (such participation rights being
hereinafter referred to as "TAG-ALONG RIGHTS"). Any Other Equityholders that has
not notified the Selling Holder(s) of its intent to exercise Tag-Along Rights
within twenty (20) days of receipt of a Tag-Along Notice (or, if applicable,
within seven (7) days of receipt of an Amended Tag-Along Notice) shall be deemed
to have elected not to exercise such Tag-Along Rights with respect to the
Transfer contemplated by such Notice. Each Other Equityholder may participate
with respect to the Interests owned by such Party in an amount equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of Interests owned by
such Other Equityholder on the date of the Transfer by (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is equal to the number of Interests proposed to be
Transferred by the Selling Holder(s) and the denominator of which is the
aggregate number of Interests owned by the Selling Holder(s) and any other
participating Other Equityholders. If one or more Other Equityholders hereunder
elect not to include the maximum number of Interests in a proposed Transfer, the
participating Equityholders (including the Selling Holder) may sell in the
proposed Transfer a number of additional Interests owned by any of them equal to
their pro rata portion of the number of Interests eligible to be included in the
proposed Transfer and not so elected to be included (the "ELIGIBLE SHARES"),
based on the relative number of Interests then held by each such Equityholder,
and such additional Interests which any such Equityholder(s) propose to sell
shall not be included in any calculation made pursuant to the second sentence of
this Section 6(b) for the purpose of determining the number of Interests which
the Equityholder will be permitted to include in a proposed Transfer.

          (c) At the closing of the Transfer to any Tag-Along Transferee
pursuant to this Section 6, the Tag-Along Transferee shall remit to each Selling
Holder the consideration for the Interests of such Selling Holder sold pursuant
hereto against delivery by such Selling Holder of certificates (if any) or other
instruments evidencing such Interests, duly endorsed for Transfer or with duly
executed stock powers or similar instruments, or such other instrument of
Transfer of such Interests as may be reasonably requested by the Tag-Along
Transferee and the Company, with all stock transfer taxes paid and stamps
affixed. Additionally, each Equityholder shall comply with any other conditions
to closing generally applicable to such Selling Holder(s) and all Other
Equityholders selling Interests in such transaction. The consummation of such
proposed Transfer shall be subject to the sole discretion of the Selling
Holder(s), who shall have no liability or obligation whatsoever to any Other
Equityholder participating therein other than to obtain for such Other
Equityholder the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the Tag-Along


                                       11
<PAGE>


Notice or any Amended Tag-Along Notice. Each Other Equityholder shall receive
the same amount and form of consideration received by the Selling Holder per
each Interest. To the extent that the Parties are to provide any indemnification
or otherwise assume any other post-closing liabilities, the Selling Holders and
all Other Equityholders selling Interests in a transaction under this Section 6
shall do so severally and not jointly (and on a pro rata basis in accordance
with their Interests being sold), and their respective potential liability
thereunder shall not exceed the proceeds received, subject to customary
exceptions in excess of such limits.

          (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Tag-Along Rights of any
Equityholder shall apply hereunder with respect to (i) any Permitted Transfer or
(ii) any Transfers occurring following the IPO Date in which the Interests to be
sold equal less than 5% of the aggregate Interests of the Company then
outstanding.

SECTION 7. EXIT RIGHTS

          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, at any time
after the eighth (8th) anniversary of the date hereof and prior, in any event,
to the IPO Date, either of the Carlyle Holders or the WCAS Holders (a "SELLING
HOLDER" for the purposes of this Section 7, and the Carlyle Holders or the WCAS
Holders (as applicable) that are not electing to sell, a "NON-SELLING HOLDER"
for the purposes of this Section 7) may elect to cause either (x) a sale of all
or substantially all of the Company (including by way of an asset sale, stock
sale, tender offer, merger or other business combination transaction or
otherwise) (an "EXIT SALE" for purposes of this Section 7) or (y) a Public Sale
of the Interests (an "EXIT IPO" for purposes of this Section 7), provided that
no such rights shall be available, at any date, to a Selling Holder that either
(i) has Transferred more than 50% of its original Percentage Interests or (ii)
owns aggregate Interests equal to less than 80% of the aggregate Interests owned
by the Non-Selling Holder. The rights set forth in this Section 7 shall be
exercised by giving written notice (the "EXIT SALE NOTICE") to each Other
Equityholder which shall set forth: (i) the proposed manner of exit, either Exit
Sale or Exit IPO; (ii) the proposed number of Interests that the Selling Holder
is selling in the sale; and (iii) all other material terms of the proposed sale.
If an Exit Sale is elected by the Selling Holder, the Selling Holder, the
Non-Selling Holder, each Other Equityholder and the Company each agree to treat
such Exit Sale as a drag-along sale in accordance with Section 5 and all of the
terms and conditions shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the Exit Sale so elected
pursuant to this Section 7. If an Exit IPO is elected by the Selling Holder, the
Selling Holder, the Non-Selling Holder, each Other Equityholder and the Company
each agree to treat such Exit IPO as a Demand Registration in accordance with
Section 8 and all of the terms and conditions shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to
the Exit IPO so elected pursuant to this Section 7. In addition, upon receipt of
an Exit Sale Notice pursuant to this Section 7, the Non-Selling Holder shall be
entitled to elect by written notice to the Selling Holder to have the Company
receive, as a condition to the consummation of such Exit Sale, a fairness
opinion from a nationally recognized appraisal or investment banking firm
stating that the consideration to be paid in such transaction is fair, from a
financial standpoint, to the Equityholders. The Selling Holder and the
Non-Selling Holder will reasonably and in good faith mutually select such
appraisal or investment banking firm, provided that, if such parties are unable
to mutually agree upon a single firm within 10 days of the receipt by the
Selling Holder of the Non-Selling Holder's notice referenced above, the Selling
Holder and the Non-Selling Holder shall within three days thereafter each select
a nationally recognized appraisal or investment banking firm and the firms so
selected by them shall then select within three days thereafter a third


                                       12
<PAGE>


nationally recognized appraisal or investment banking firm to deliver the
fairness opinion. The costs of such firm shall be borne by the Company.

SECTION 8. REGISTRATION RIGHTS

          (a) Demand Registrations.

                  (i) Right to Demand Registration. The Carlyle Holders and WCAS
          Holders shall each have the right at any time following the IPO Date
          to make a written request of the Company for registration with the
          Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), under and in
          accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act, of all or part
          of the Registrable Interests held of record and beneficially by such
          Carlyle Holders and WCAS Holders, as applicable (each a "DEMAND
          REGISTRATION" and such Carlyle Holders and WCAS Holders, as
          applicable, the "DEMANDING HOLDER"); provided, that (x) the Company
          need not effect a Demand Registration of less than $75 million of
          gross proceeds, and (y) the Company may defer such Demand Registration
          for a single period not to exceed 120 days during any one year period
          if the Board determines in the exercise of its reasonable judgment
          that to effect such Demand Registration at such time would have a
          material adverse effect on the Company, including interfering with any
          pending or potential acquisition, disposition or securities offering
          of the Company. Within ten (10) days after receipt of the request for
          a Demand Registration, the Company will send written notice (the
          "DEMAND NOTICE") of such registration request and its intention to
          comply therewith to all holders of Registrable Interests and, subject
          to subsection (iii) below, the Company will include in such
          registration all the Registrable Interests with respect to which the
          Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within
          twenty (20) Business Days after the date such Demand Notice is given.
          All requests made pursuant to this subsection (i) will specify the
          aggregate number of Registrable Interests requested to be registered
          and will also specify the intended methods of disposition thereof.
          Upon receipt of a Demand Notice, the Company shall use its
          commercially reasonable efforts to effect registration of the
          Registrable Interests to be registered in accordance with the intended
          method of distribution specified in writing by the Demanding Holder as
          soon as practicable and to maintain the effectiveness of such
          registration for a period of ninety (90) days. If available to the
          Company, the Company will effect such registration on Form S-3 or an
          equivalent form in which event it shall use its commercially
          reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
          for a period of one-hundred and eighty (180) days; provided, however,
          that the Company shall not effect a registration on Form S-3 or an
          equivalent form if the managing underwriter or underwriters determine
          that using a different registration form is in the best interests of
          the Company and/or the Demanding Holder and other holders.

                  (ii) Number of Demand Registrations. Subject to the
          restrictions herein, each Carlyle Holder and each WCAS Holder shall
          have an unlimited right to demand registration of its respective
          Registrable Interests. The Company shall not be required to cause a
          registration pursuant to Section 8(a)(i) to be declared effective
          within a period of 90 days after the date of any other Company
          registration statement was declared effective pursuant to a Demand
          Registration request or a filing for the Company's own behalf.


                                       13
<PAGE>


                  (iii) Priority on Demand Registrations. If in any Demand
          Registration the managing underwriter or underwriters thereof (or in
          the case of a Demand Registration not being underwritten, the
          Demanding Holder after consultation with an investment banker of
          nationally recognized standing), advise the Company in writing that in
          its or their reasonable opinion the number of securities proposed to
          be sold in such Demand Registration exceeds the number that can be
          sold in such offering without having a material adverse effect on the
          success of the offering (including, without limitation, an impact on
          the selling price), the Company will include in such registration only
          the number of securities that, in the reasonable opinion of such
          underwriter or underwriters (or the Demanding Holder, as the case may
          be) can be sold without having a material adverse effect on the
          success of the offering, as follows: first, the securities which the
          Equityholders, including the Demanding Holder(s) (pro rata among all
          such Equityholders on the basis of the relative percentage of
          Registrable Interests owned by all Equityholders who have requested
          that securities owned by them be so included), propose to sell, and
          second, the securities of any additional holders of the Company's
          securities eligible to participate in such offering, pro rata among
          all such Persons on the basis of the relative percentage of such
          securities held by each of them. In the event that the managing
          underwriter or Demanding Holder determines that additional Registrable
          Interests may be sold in any Demand Registration without having a
          material adverse effect on the success of the offering, the Company
          may include Comparable Securities to be issued and sold by the Company
          or comparable securities held by Persons other than the Parties.

                  (iv) Selection of Underwriters. If a Demand Registration is to
          be an underwritten offering, the holders of a majority of the
          Registrable Interests to be included in such Demand Registration will
          select a managing underwriter or underwriters of recognized national
          standing to administer the offering, which managing underwriter or
          underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company.

          (b) Piggyback Registrations. If the Company at any time proposes to
register under the Securities Act any Interests or any security convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for Interests, whether or not for sale for its
own account and other than pursuant to a Demand Registration, on a form and in a
manner which would permit registration of the Registrable Interests held by a
Equityholder for sale to the public under the Securities Act, the Company shall
give written notice of the proposed registration to each Equityholder not later
than thirty (30) days prior to the filing thereof. Each Equityholder shall have
the right to request that all or any part of its Registrable Interests be
included in such registration. Each Equityholder can make such a request by
giving written notice to the Company within ten (10) Business Days after the
giving of such notice by the Company; provided, however, that if the
registration is an underwritten registration and the managing underwriters of
such offering determine that the aggregate amount of securities of the Company
which the Company and all Equityholders propose to include in such Registration
Statement exceeds the maximum amount of securities that may be sold without
having a material adverse effect on the success of the offering, including
without limitation the selling price and other terms of such offering, the
Company will include in such registration, first, the securities which the
Company proposes to sell, second, the Registrable Interests of such
Equityholders, pro rata among all such Equityholders on the basis of the
relative percentage of Registrable Interests owned by all Equityholders who have


                                       14
<PAGE>


requested that securities owned by them be so included (it being further agreed
and understood, however, that such underwriters shall have the right to
eliminate entirely the participation of the Equityholders), and third, the
comparable securities of any additional holders of the Company's securities, pro
rata among all such holders on the basis of the relative percentage of such
securities held by each of them. Registrable Interests proposed to be registered
and sold pursuant to an underwritten offering for the account of any
Equityholder shall be sold to the prospective underwriters selected or approved
by the Company and on the terms and subject to the conditions of one or more
underwriting agreements negotiated between the Company and the prospective
underwriters. Any Equityholder who holds Registrable Interests being registered
in any offering shall have the right to receive a copy of the form of
underwriting agreement and shall have an opportunity to hold discussions with
the lead underwriter of the terms of such underwriting agreement. The Company
may withdraw any Registration Statement at any time before it becomes effective,
or postpone or terminate the offering of securities, without obligation or
liability to any Equityholder.

          (c) Holdback Agreements. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 8, each Equityholder agrees that (if so required by the underwriters in
an underwritten offering and provided that such condition is applicable to all
Equityholders) it will not (and it shall be a condition to the rights of each
Equityholder under this Section 8 that such Equityholder does not) offer for
Public Sale any Interests during a period not to exceed sixty (60) days prior to
and one-hundred and eighty (180) days after the effective date of any
Registration Statement filed by the Company in connection with an underwritten
public offering (except as part of such underwritten registration or as
otherwise permitted by such underwriters); provided, however, no Equityholder
shall object to shortening such period if the underwriter agrees that shortening
such period would not materially and adversely effect the success of the
