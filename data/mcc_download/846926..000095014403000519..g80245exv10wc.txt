timely manner and will make reasonable efforts to continually prosecute the work

building and zoning codes and all other applicable legal requirements and
restrictions. The Borrower will keep the Secured Properties free from all liens
for services, labor and materials other than Permitted Encumbrances and as
permitted by Section 9.01 (a).

      3.08 The Bank shall have the right, during construction, to inspect the
Approved Project or to cause the construction to be inspected by an independent
inspecting representative. Should there occur any discrepancy in quantity or
quality of workmanship in connection with the construction of the Approved
Project, the Bank shall be relieved of the obligation to make an Advance of
Project Funds until such time as the discrepancy shall have been corrected to
the satisfaction of the Bank (and any independent inspecting representative
appointed by the Bank pursuant to this Section). The reasonable costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the use of any independent inspecting
representative shall be paid by the Borrower.

      3.09 Prior to any disbursement of Project Funds, the Bank must have

statutes and regulations to which the Approved Project is subject.

            (e) A current survey prepared, certified and sealed by a surveyor
satisfactory to the Bank showing, among other things, the location of any
existing or proposed improvements, any setback lines or building lines, the
location of all easements and rights-of-way and all matters affecting title, to
the extent such matters can be shown, and any jurisdictional wetlands area. The

respects to the Bank.

      3.10 Notwithstanding the foregoing relating to the disbursement of Project
Funds for construction purposes, the Bank reserves the right based on the
complexity or scope of each Approved Project to require additional matters in
order to monitor construction of the Approved Project and/or to waive compliance
with, or reduce the extent of, the aforesaid provisions should circumstances so
warrant.

      3.11 Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Bank may, at its
option and in lieu of resorting to any other remedy available to it and without
the appointment of a receiver for the Approved Project or the Borrower, take
possession of the Approved Project and all materials, tools, machinery and other
equipment used for said project or in possession of the Borrower being used in
connection with and in the construction of the project, and, in the name of and
for the account of the Borrower, may complete the improvements either in
accordance with the Plans and Specifications or in accordance with such change
or changes in the Plans and Specifications as may be considered necessary or
desirable by the Bank and may take such other and further action as may be
required to achieve completion of the Approved Project. For such purposes, the
Bank may use any funds of the Borrower at any time in the hands of the Bank by
deposit or otherwise, including the undisbursed proceeds of the Revolving Line
of Credit Facility. Any money advanced by the Bank for such purposes shall be
payable by the Borrower upon demand, shall bear interest at the rate set forth
in the Revolving Line of Credit Note, and its payment shall be secured by the
Mortgages and other Documents. The Bank, however, shall be under no obligation

additional security instruments, mortgages and assignments to be executed as the
Bank may from time to time request and the Borrower agrees said assets shall be

<PAGE>
      8.02 For the term of this Agreement:

            (a) (i)The Borrower shall not allow the amount of its Total
Liabilities at the end of each fiscal year (October 31) to exceed Three Hundred
Percent (300%) of the amount of its Tangible Net Worth, as defined below (the
"Net Worth Ratio"); The Borrower shall provide, upon request of the Bank, such
information, in addition to other information required hereby, as may be
necessary to verify compliance therewith on any fiscal year end, commencing with
the fiscal year ending October 31,2003. "Tangible Net Worth" means the remainder
after subtracting Total Liabilities from the book value of total tangible assets
(total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets) based upon GAAP. "Total
Liabilities" means the book value of total liabilities based upon GAAP plus the
amount of indebtedness for which the Borrower is liable on a contingent or
conditional basis, including guarantees.

            (b) The Borrower shall maintain a debt service coverage ratio ("DSC
Ratio") of at least 1.25 to be measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter on
a rolling four-quarter basis. The DSC ratio will be calculated as the quotient
of Cash Flow divided by Debt Service with "Cash Flow" equaling the sum of net
income, depreciation and amortization and "Debt Service" equaling the sum of
current maturities of long term debt, current portion of capital leases and
dividends paid, all based upon GAAP; and

            (c) In the event the Borrower fails to meet either the Net Worth or
DSC Ratios and such failure is not waived by the Bank, the Borrower shall have
thirty (30) days from the date when the Borrower's executive management knew or
should have known of such a failure in which to cure any such failure. During
such cure period, the Bank shall have no obligation to make any Advance
hereunder to the Borrower. Upon the Borrower's cure of any such default, the
Borrower shall provide the Bank with satisfactory written evidence thereof prior
to the end of the cure period.

                                       28
<PAGE>
Failure to cure any such default within the time period described herein shall
constitute an Event of Default under of this Agreement; provided, however, that
there shall be no requirement that the Bank give written notice of such default
and there shall be no additional thirty (30) day cure period pursuant to this
Agreement.

      8.03 The Borrower shall protect, defend, indemnify and save harmless the
Bank and its employees, officers and agents from and against all liabilities,
obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees and expenses) imposed upon or incurred by the Bank or
its employees, officers or agents by reason of (a) any claim for brokerage fees
or other such commissions relating to the Collateral, the Notes or the
Obligations, or (b) the condition of the Collateral, including, without
limitation, any Hazardous Materials which are currently on or affecting the
Secured Properties (including Secured Properties owned by any Subsidiary), which
come on, from or affect such Secured Properties or which are hereafter placed
upon or under such Secured Properties, or (c) failure to pay recording,
mortgage, intangibles or similar taxes, roll back taxes, fees or charges
relating to the Obligations or any one or more of the Documents, or (d) the
Documents or any claim or demand whatsoever which may be asserted against the
Bank or its employees, officers or agents by reason of any alleged action,
obligation or undertaking of the Bank or its employees, officers or agents
relating in any way to the Obligations or matter contemplated by the Documents,
or (e) any and all liability arising from any of the Collateral or any
negligence (other than the Bank's gross negligence or wilful misconduct) in the
management, operation, upkeep, repair or control of the Collateral resulting in
loss or injury or death to any tenant, occupant, licensee, employee or stranger.
In the event the Bank or its employees, officers or agents incurs any liability,
loss or damage arising out of or in any way relating to the transactions
contemplated by the Documents (including any of the matters referred to

                                       29
<PAGE>
in this section but not the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Bank or
its employees, officers or agents), the amounts of such liability, loss or
damage shall be added to the Obligations, shall bear interest at the Interest
Rate specified in the appropriate Note from the date incurred until paid and
shall be payable on demand.

            (a) The Bank shall be under no obligation to make any further
Advances hereunder and may terminate the Facilities;

            (b) The Bank may, at its option, without presentment, demand, notice
of dishonor, or protest, declare one or more or all of the Obligations and all
amounts advanced hereunder immediately due and payable in full;

            (c) The Bank shall have the right from time to time to sue for all
or any part of the Obligations, whether interest, principal or any installment
of either or both, taxes, fees, penalties or any other sums required to be paid
under the terms of the Documents, without regard to whether all of the
Obligations shall be then due and without prejudice to the right of the Bank
thereafter to enforce any appropriate remedy against the Borrower, including
actions for a default or defaults by the Borrower existing at the time such
earlier action was commenced; or

                                       36
<PAGE>
            (d) The Bank may, at its option, pursue any and all rights and
remedies under the Notes, and/or the Mortgages or other Documents as to any or
all of the Collateral, including but not limited to any or all of the Secured
Properties or the Secured Personalty.

      11.02 The rights of the Bank, granted and arising under the Documents
shall be separate, distinct and cumulative of other rights and powers herein
granted and all other rights which the Bank may have at law or in equity, and
none of them shall be in exclusion of the others; and all of them are cumulative
to the remedies for collection of the security provided by law. Any foreclosure
or other sale of less than all of the Collateral or any defective or irregular
sale made in connection herewith shall not exhaust the power of foreclosure or
of sale provided for in the Documents; and subsequent sales may be made until
all of the Obligations have been satisfied or all of the Collateral has been
sold. No act of the Bank shall be construed as an election to proceed under any
one provision of any of the Documents to the exclusion of any other provision or
an election of remedies to the bar of any other remedy allowed at law or in
equity, anything herein or otherwise to the contrary notwithstanding.

      11.03 The Borrower hereby waives, in the event of the foreclosure of as to
any of the Collateral or the enforcement by the Bank of any rights and remedies
hereunder, any right otherwise available in respect to marshalling of assets
which secure the Obligations or to require the Bank to pursue or delay the
pursuit of its remedies against any such assets. Further, the Borrower agrees
that neither the Borrower nor anyone claiming through or under the Borrower
shall or will set up, claim or seek an advantage of any exemption (including
homestead exemptions), stay, extension or redemption laws now or hereafter in
force, in order to prevent or hinder the enforcement or foreclosure of any
Collateral, or the absolute sale of the Collateral, or the final and absolute
putting into possession thereof, immediately after such sale, of the purchasers
thereat and

                                       37
<PAGE>
the Borrower does hereby waive the benefit of all such laws or right of
redemption, exemption or stay.


                      ARTICLE XII MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

      12.01 In no event shall the Bank be liable to the Borrower for indirect,
special or consequential damages, or the loss of anticipated profits, which may

warranties or the right of the Bank to rely upon and enforce them.

      12.03 Regardless of the amount of the Obligations outstanding at any time
and regardless of whether there is any indebtedness outstanding at all, it is
the intention of the Bank and the Borrower that this Agreement and all of the
Documents shall remain in full force and effect until the last to occur of the
following events: (a) the Obligations have been fully paid; (b) all covenants in
the Documents have been fully and adequately performed; and (c) the Bank has not
agreed to make and is not obligated to make any further Advance to or on behalf
of the Borrower.

remaining parts of said provision or the remaining provisions of said Document.

      12.08 The Borrower agrees that where, by the terms of the Documents a day
is named or a time fixed for the payment of any of the Obligations or the
performance of any of the covenants, the time stated enters into the
consideration and is of the essence of the whole contract.

      12.09 To the extent permitted by applicable law, if the Bank shall refuse

required to do so, the Bank shall not be liable to the Borrower for any
consequential damages resulting therefrom.

venturers by reason of the transactions contemplated in the Documents.

Documents which authority is intended only to preserve and protect the
Obligations and any security therefor.

      12.11 The Obligations, the covenants and the Documents are made under and
governed by the laws of the State of South Carolina and the Borrower hereby
consents to the jurisdiction of all courts in said State.

      12.12 This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of
which shall be an original and all collectively shall constitute but one
instrument.

                                    SCHEDULE

      Certain of the Collateral, as hereinafter described, shall be released
from the lien of the Assignments, Mortgages or other Documents upon request of
the Borrower and payment or delivery of the consideration described herein (the
"Release Price") in accordance with the following terms and conditions.

      The Bank shall not be obligated to release any Collateral if (i) an Event
of Default has occurred under the Agreement, (ii) an event has occurred which
with the passage of time or the giving of notice the Bank reasonably anticipates
would constitute an Event of Default under the Agreement, or (iii) the Bank
reasonably anticipates that the requested release may result in an Event of
Default or cause a Material Adverse Effect under the Agreement.

      The Bank reserves the right to apply all Release Price payments to any
Note or Notes, in its sole discretion, and, notwithstanding any provision in the
Notes, such payments will be applied to the principal balances outstanding under
any such Note(s) (and to pay any applicable prepayment charge) unless the Bank
chooses, in its sole discretion, to apply such payments to accrued interest or
other Obligations. Any payments attributable to Major Groups of Collateral as
described in Section I below may also result in a reduction of funds available
under the Facilities in the Bank's sole discretion.

      The term "Gross Proceeds" as used in this Asset Release Schedule shall
mean the amount equal to the gross sales price payable to the Borrower as stated
in the Contract (as defined below) from or in connection with any sale or
transfer of all or any part of any of the Collateral, including, without
limitation, the proceeds of any reserves or escrows (other than those reserves
or escrows established by the Borrower).

      The term "Current Obligations" as used in this Asset Release Schedule
shall mean the then-current principal amount outstanding and any unfunded
commitments under the Obligations (as defined in the Agreement) of the Borrower,
including, without limitation, in the Bank's sole discretion, estimates of the
potential exposure, if any, of the Borrower to the Bank for contingent,
conditional and indirect liabilities constituting a portion of said Obligations.

      The term "Contract" as used in this Asset Release Schedule shall mean the
applicable contract of sale or purchase agreement including any and all
amendments and other related documents pertaining to a sale or other transfer of
any Collateral as submitted to the Bank for its review.

      The property references below are abbreviated commonly used descriptions,
and the legal descriptions for said parcels are contained in the Mortgages,
which descriptions shall be controlling as to actual acreage and location.
Certain legal descriptions are indicated by reference to specific exhibits of
the Mortgages.
