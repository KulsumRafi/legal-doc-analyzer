5)     ARTICLE C.l. STATEMENT OF WORK, PHASE I: Preclinical Studies/Test
       Refinement, paragraph 1., subparagraphs a. and b. are revised to read as
       follows:

        PHASE I: Preclinical Studies/Test Refinement

        1.     Refine a procedure for screening of organ donors for blood-borne
               viruses including a procedure for screening of blood donors for
               the West Nile Virus (WNV). The contractor must:

               "a.   Demonstrate that the organ donor assay detects minimal
                     amounts of viral nucleic acids (RNA and/or other viral
                     nucleic acids that appear at the same time or before the
                     earliest appearance of viral KNA circulating in plasma)
                     specific for HIV-l, HCV, HBV and West Nile Virus (WNV).
                     Demonstrate that the blood donor assay detects minimal
                     amounts of viral nucleic acids (RNA and/or other viral
                     nucleic acids that appear at the same time or before the
                     earliest appearance of viral RNA circulating in plasma)
                     specific for WNV. If specimens other than blood are to be
                     used, determine the best tissue to use as a test material
                     source.

               b.    Have and describe plans to develop an amplification and
                     detection system that will identify the presence of West
                     Nile Virus nucleic acid. Due to the urgent need to develop
                     this system, the testing method proposed will be in a
                     single assay format.

                     Have and describe plans to adapt the test methods to a
                     multiplexing format

                     that will detect multiple blood-borne viruses (two or more
                     viruses) in the same test. The three highest priority
                     viruses to be detected are HIV-l, HCV, and HBV. The testing
                     method(s) proposed must be able to detect each of these
                     viruses, in multiplexing format. If additional viruses are
                     included in the test system (e.g., HIV-2, etc.), they are
                     also to be incorporated into a multiplex format."

    standardized and approved by a lead agency Federal Official; must be renewed
    every three years and contractor must provide copy of lead agency approval.

[ ] COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS/SERVICE PLAN This plan is used when the contractor sells
    products and services customarily used for non-government purposes.
    Plan/goals are negotiated with the initial agency on a company-wide basis
    rather than for individual contracts. The plan is effective only during the
    year approved. The contractor must provide a copy of the initial agency
    approval, and must submit an annual SF 295 to HHS with a breakout of
    subcontracting prorated for HHS (with OPDIV breakdown, if possible.)

j.  Provide a description of the method used to develop the subcontracting goals
    for SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, and VOSB concerns. Address efforts made to
    ensure that maximum practicable subcontracting opportunities have been made
    available for those concerns and explain the method used to identify
    potential sources for solicitation purposes. Explain the method and state
    the quantitative basis (in dollars) used to establish the percentage goals.
    Also, explain how the areas to be subcontracted to SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone,
    and VOSB concerns were determined, how the capabilities of these concerns
    were considered contract opportunities and how such data comports with the
    cost proposal. Identify any source lists or other resources used in the
    determination process.

THE SINGLE LARGEST EXPENSE IS FOR KIT REAGENTS, WHOSE QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
DICTATE THE MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS THAT CAN BE UTILIZED. UNFORTUNATELY, IN
SPITE OF EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY AND UTILIZE SMALL DISADVANTAGED OR WOMAN OWNED
BUSINESSES THAT CAN MEET STRICT FDA REQUIREMENTS, WE HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL. WE
WILL CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS THAT CAN PROVIDE THESE
CONTROLLED MATERIALS UNDER SPECIALIZED GMP REQUIREMENTS FOR CBER LICENSED
PRODUCTS. LAB MATERIALS ARE ALSO UNIQUE WITH QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS AND
REQUIREMENTS THAT LIMIT THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS. SPECIMEN COLLECTION
FOR WEST NILE AND OTHER INFECTIOUS AGENTS ARE UNIQUE -- ONLY 4 SUPPLIES THAT WE
ARE AWARE OF; IN SOME CASES ONLY ONE. NONE OF THESE VENDORS ARE DISADVANTAGED,
WOMAN OWNED OR VETERAN BUSINESSES.

GOALS FOR UNCONTROLLED MATERIALS AND SERVICES WERE BASED ON USE OF CURRENT AND
PROJECTED SUPPLIERS. WE ARE ACTIVELY PURSUING NEW SUPPLIERS THAT MEET THE
NECESSARY REQUIREMENTS. WE ROUTINELY CHECK SMALL BUSINESS WEB SITES, SUCH AS
PRONET, TO ACCESS THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS. THE LOCAL SAN DIEGO
BLOTECH ORGANIZATION, BIOTECH, IS ALSO ROUTINELY CONTACTED FOR POSSIBLE LEADS.

IN ADDITION, WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF UPDATING OUR SUPPLIER FILES TO BETTER
CATEGORIZE THEIR SMALL BUSINESS STATUS. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE MOVED FROM A
STAND-ALONE DATABASE TO OUR ON-LINE MRP SYSTEM, WHICH WILL AUTOMATE THE
COLLECTION OF DATA AND PROVIDE REAL-TIME INFORMATION TO THE BUYERS, HELPING THEM
TO IDENTIFY AND USE SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.


k.  indirect costs [] have, [X] have not been included in the dollar and
    percentage subcontracting goals above (check one).

l.  if indirect costs have been included, explain the method used to determine
    the proportionate share of such costs to be allocated as subcontracts to SB,
    SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB concerns.

8. TIMELY PAYMENTS TO SUBCONTRACTORS

FAR 19.702 requires your company to establish and use procedures to ensure the
timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of your subcontracts with
small business concerns, small disadvantaged small business concerns,
women-owned small business concerns, HUBZone small business concerns,
veteran-owned small business concerns, and service-disabled veteran-owned small
business concerns. Your company has established and uses such procedures:
[X] yes [ ] no

G. DESCRIPTION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT

Maximum practicable utilization of small, small disadvantaged, women-owned,
HUBZone, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business
concerns as subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of national
interest with both social and economic benefits. When a contractor fails to make
a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan, these objectives are
not achieved, and 15 U.S.C. 637(d) (4) (F) directs that liquidated damages shall
be paid by the contractor. In order to demonstrate your compliance with a good
faith effort to achieve the small, small disadvantaged, womenowned, HUBZone,
veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business subcontracting
goals, outline the steps your company plans to take. These steps will be
negotiated with the contracting officer prior to approval of the plan.
