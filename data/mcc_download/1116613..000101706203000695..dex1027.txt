New Castle County dated December 24, 2002 or (ii) breaches, or would result in
Ribapharm breaching, in any material respect, any existing agreement between ICN

          settlement with the debtor.

the discovery of facts or circumstances that are in addition to or different
from those that the Parties presently believe to be true, the Parties hereby
specifically waive the effect and provision of Section 1542 of the California
Civil Code and any similar federal or state statute, to the extent it may be
applicable.

Dear Sir:

          Reference is made to the Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release to be
entered into by and among, inter alia, you and Ribapharm Inc. (the "Company"),
dated as of the date hereof (the "Settlement Agreement"). Pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement, your employment with the Company shall terminate
immediately upon the execution of the Settlement Agreement. Capitalized terms
not defined in this letter (this "Letter") shall have the meanings set forth in
the Settlement Agreement.

          In consideration for payment by the Company of the cash amount set
forth in Schedule 1 hereto (the "Consideration"), you hereby knowingly and
voluntarily waive all rights or claims arising under the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1967 ("ADEA"). This waiver is given in exchange for
consideration in addition to anything of value to which you would have been
entitled absent this Letter. Such waiver does not waive rights or claims that
may arise after the date of execution of this Letter. Pursuant to the
requirements set forth under ADEA, the Company hereby discloses that there are
no individuals in the same job classification that are not eligible for the
termination program.

          You hereby acknowledge that: (i) this Letter is written in a manner
calculated to be understood by you; (ii) you have been advised to consult with
an attorney before executing this Letter; (iii) you were given a period of
forty-five (45) days within which to consider this Letter; and (iv) to the
extent you execute this Letter before the expiration of the forty-five-day
period, you do so knowingly and voluntarily and only after consulting your
attorney.

          You shall have the right to cancel and revoke this Letter during a
period of seven (7) days following your execution of this Letter, and this
Letter shall not become effective, and no money shall be paid hereunder, until
the day after the expiration of such seven-day period (the "Effective Date").
The seven-day period of revocation shall commence upon the date of your
execution of this Letter. In order to revoke this Letter, you must deliver to
Ribapharm, prior to the expiration of said

                                       B-1

seven-day period, a written notice of revocation. Upon such revocation, this
Letter shall be null and void and of no further force or effect.

          The Company shall furnish payment of the Consideration to you on the
Effective Date.

          Please sign below and return a copy of this Letter to the Company,
Attn: Secretary so as to acknowledge your receipt of this Letter and your
agreement to waive the rights contemplated herein.

                                                     Very truly yours,

                                                     RIBAPHARM INC.
