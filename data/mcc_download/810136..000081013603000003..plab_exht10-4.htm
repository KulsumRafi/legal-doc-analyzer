<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;Those matters are set forth in <b><u>Schedule

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;TITLE.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;TITLE DEFECT.&nbsp;&nbsp;If because of a defect in the
title to the Premises Seller shall be unable on the date of closing to convey title as required hereunder, the closing date shall
be extended for a period of not more than thirty (30) days to permit Seller to perfect title.&nbsp; If at the end of said thirty
(30) day period Seller, after using its best efforts, shall not have perfected title, then the Buyer may elect to accept such title
as Seller can convey upon payment of the purchase price or Buyer, on that ground, may reject acceptance of the deed of
conveyance.&nbsp; Upon such rejection all sums paid hereunder by Buyer shall be repaid by Seller to Buyer.&nbsp; Upon receipt of
such payment by Buyer or Buyer's attorney, this Agreement shall terminate and become null and void and the parties hereto shall be
released and discharged of all further claims and obligations each to the other hereunder.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that no matter shall be considered to be a defect in
title if under applicable provisions of the Standards of Title of the Connecticut Bar Association such matter is not considered to
be a defect in title without curative action or if a title insurance company licensed to do business in Connecticut will issue a
commitment to provide an owner's and mortgagee's policy at standard rates without exception for such item or insuring against loss
or damage arising therefrom.</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;TITLE SEARCH AND CERTIFICATION; SURVEY.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buyer
shall procure at its expense any title search, title certification, or survey desired by it or any lender providing mortgage
financing for this transaction.&nbsp; The Buyer shall deliver to Seller a copy of said title search or certification within thirty
(30) days after the date of this Agreement and shall simultaneously give Seller written notice of any title defect or any
encumbrance which is unsatisfactory to Buyer.&nbsp; The Buyer shall be deemed to have waived objection to any title defect not
specified in such notice that is either set forth in such title search or certification, or is otherwise known to Buyer.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;SELLER'S AFFIDAVIT.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seller agrees to execute, at the time of closing
of title, an affidavit (a) verifying the non&#8209;existence of mechanics' and materialmen's liens (or Waiver of Mechanic's Lien as
provided in the following section), (b) verifying the non&#8209;existence of any tenants' rights, except as set forth herein, (c)
verifying the non&#8209;existence of any security interests in personal property and fixtures being sold with the Premises, (d)
that the Seller has no notice of any facts or circumstances not of record which could give rise to the claim of any third party to
rights of adverse possession or use over the Premises or any part thereof in derogation of Seller's title, and (e) to the extent of
Seller's knowledge, updating any available survey, which survey Seller agrees to provide to Buyer on or before closing.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;&nbsp;WAIVER OF MECHANIC'S LIEN.&nbsp;&nbsp;If any work has been done or material
furnished on the Premises within ninety (90) days prior to closing on behalf of Seller for which a lien could be filed, the Seller
agrees to deliver to the Buyer at the closing evidence of payment of such claims or absolute waivers of mechanic's liens.&nbsp;
Failure to do so shall constitute a representation that no such work has been done nor any materials furnished.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;&nbsp;TAX DEFERRED EXCHANGE.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buyer hereby acknowledges that it is the
intention of one or both of the Sellers to complete an I.R.C. Section 1031 exchange in a manner which will not delay the closing or
cause additional expense to the Buyer.&nbsp; The Seller&rsquo;s rights and obligations under this agreement may be assigned to an
Intermediary of the Seller&rsquo;s choice for the purpose of completing such an exchange.&nbsp; Buyer agrees to cooperate with the
Seller and the Intermediary in the implementation of the exchange.&nbsp; Cooperation means that Buyer will consent to an assignment
of this agreement by Seller to the Intermediary, agree to release the Intermediary from any claim made by Buyer, and agree to any
other appropriate action or execution of any other document which does not create additional liability or expense, but such
cooperation shall not require Buyer to take title to any other property or to assume additional liabilities.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.&nbsp;&nbsp;RISK OF LOSS.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a condemnation proceeding is instituted against the
Premises or any portion thereof, or if all or a portion of the Premises is substantially damaged by fire or other casualty, prior
to closing, and if the Seller does not at its option agree to repair or replace any such loss or damage, the Buyer may terminate
this Agreement upon written notice to the Seller, whereupon the Seller shall return the deposit monies to the Buyer and the parties
shall have no further liabilities or obligations hereunder.&nbsp; If the Buyer does not so terminate this Agreement, this Agreement
shall continue to be effective, and the Seller shall assign to the Buyer at closing all of the Seller's right to receive any award
for such condemnation or insurance proceeds as a result of such damage (as the case may be), together with all of the Seller's
rights to litigate such claim and to negotiate a settlement with the condemning authority or the insurance carrier.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFAULTS.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Seller materially breaches this Agreement prior to
closing, the sole liability of the Seller shall be (and the remedies of the Buyer shall be limited to) either, at the option of the
Buyer, (i) the return by the Seller of the Buyer of the deposit monies (in which case this Agreement shall become null and void,
and the parties shall have no further liabilities or obligations hereunder), or (ii) a suit by the Buyer against the Seller for
specific performance only.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Buyer materially breaches this Agreement prior
to closing, the deposit monies shall be paid in full to the Seller either, at the option of the Seller, (i) as liquidated damages
for such breach, in which event this Agreement shall become null and void, and the parties shall have no further liabilities or
obligations hereunder; or (ii) as monies to be applied to the Seller's damages to be sought by Seller in a suit against Buyer.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.&nbsp;&nbsp;BROKERAGE.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buyer represents that no agent or broker has called its
attention to said Premises, showed them to it or any representative of it or in any manner dealt with it or them or been
instrumental in effecting this transaction.&nbsp; The Buyer agrees to save the Seller harmless from any loss, expense or liability
from any commission claim by any broker or agent by virtue of alleged dealings had by such claimant with the Buyer or a
representative of the Buyer, provided the Buyer shall be notified immediately of any such claim and may undertake the defense
thereof.&nbsp; The Seller represents to the Buyer that it has not entered into any listing agreement with any agent or broker which
would entitle such agent or broker to a commission in connection with this transaction.&nbsp; The Seller agrees to save the Buyer
harmless from any loss, expense or liability from any commission claim by any broker or agent by virtue of any such listing
agreement.</p>

behalf by their respective counsel.&nbsp; Notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the date of delivery, if personally
delivered, or one (1) business day after the date of deposit if sent by private overnight express carrier, such as Federal Express,
next business day delivery.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.&nbsp; NON&#8209;FOREIGN PERSON.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seller represents that Seller is not a foreign
person as that term is used in Section 1445(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and Seller agrees to execute an
