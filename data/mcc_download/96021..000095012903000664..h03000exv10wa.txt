         WHEREAS, the Plan hereby established is intended to constitute an

compensation plan providing alternative settlements under and as contemplated by
the Stock Plans in respect of nonqualified stock options granted thereunder.
This Plan also contemplates the grant of Deferred Shares under and as
contemplated by the Stock Plans. This Plan and all rights under it are provided
and shall be subject to and construed consistently with the other terms of the

                                  PARTICIPATION

         3.1 General Participation Requirements. An Eligible Individual may
elect to exercise all or a portion of a Qualifying Option under and subject to
the Alternative Exercise provisions set forth herein and to receive a credit of
Deferred Shares under this Plan. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the
contrary, a Participant in this Plan who is no longer an Eligible Individual may
not make an Alternative Exercise election.

         3.2 Manner and Timing of Election. An Alternative Exercise election may
only be made by an Eligible Individual completing and executing a form of
Alternative Exercise Agreement which meets the requirements of Article IV and
submitting such form to the Committee after the Effective Date. Notwithstanding

effective until the Eligible Individual's Alternative Exercise Agreement has
been executed by the Committee in accordance with Section 3.3.

         3.3 Execution of Alternative Exercise Agreement by the Company. Upon
receipt of an Eligible Individual's Alternative Exercise Agreement, the
Committee shall review the Agreement to determine whether each option subject to
the Eligible Individual's Alternative Exercise election is a Qualifying Stock
Option, and whether the Eligible Individual's Alternative Exercise election
complies with the terms of the Plan and applicable laws. If the option is not a

treat the option as a "Qualifying Stock Option" for purposes of this Plan in
accordance with Section 2.34. The Committee shall not execute any Alternative
Exercise Agreement if the option subject to the Eligible Individual's
Alternative Exercise election is not a Qualifying Stock Option (or treated as a
Qualifying Stock Option by exercise of Committee discretion pursuant to Section
2.34), or if the Eligible Individual's Alternative Exercise election fails in
any way to comply with the terms of the Plan and/or applicable laws. The
Committee shall have 30 days following its receipt of such Alternative Exercise
Agreement to conduct its review of the Eligible Individual's Alternative
Exercise Agreement. The Committee may require that the Eligible Individual
provide proof, in such form as is satisfactory to the Committee, that the stock
option subject to the Alternative Exercise Agreement is a Qualifying Stock
Option for purposes of this Plan, and that the Alternative Exercise election
complies with the terms of the Plan and applicable laws. Provided that the
Committee determines that the stock option subject to the Alternative Exercise
election is a Qualifying Stock Option, or elects to treat the option as a
Qualifying Stock Option by exercise of Committee discretion pursuant to Section
2.34, and that the







                                      -8-
<PAGE>

Eligible Individual's Alternative Exercise election complies with the terms of
the Plan and applicable laws, the Company, acting through any of its officers,
shall execute the Alternative Exercise Agreement form submitted by such Eligible
Individual and deliver a copy of such fully-executed Alternative Exercise
Agreement to him or her as soon as administratively practicable after the end of
the Committee's 30-day review period.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                         ALTERNATIVE EXERCISE OF OPTIONS

         4.1 Form of Agreement. Each Alternative Exercise Agreement with respect
to a Qualifying Stock Option shall be in such form approved by the Committee for
this purpose and shall comply with the requirements of this Section 4.1.

                  (a) Deferral Election. Each such Alternative Exercise
Agreement shall specify the portion of the Qualifying Stock Option or Qualifying
Stock Options that the Eligible Individual elects to exercise under this Plan
and shall provide that (i) the Eligible Individual will exercise all or the
specified portion of such Qualifying Stock Option(s) with Already-Owned Shares
having an aggregate fair market value (as defined in the applicable Stock Plan)
equal to the exercise price, which Already-Owned Shares shall be tendered via
attestation, for the number of Shares with respect to which the Qualifying Stock
Option is exercised and (ii), upon exercise, the Company will credit to a
Deferred Share Account established for the Eligible Individual Deferred Shares
equal to (A) the number of Shares with respect to which the Qualifying Stock
Option is exercised, reduced by (B) the number of Shares tendered to pay the
exercise price of the Qualifying Stock Option (the "Gain Shares").

                  (b) Other Elections and Designations. An Eligible Individual
may elect or designate on his or her Alternative Exercise Agreement, or on one
or more separate forms approved by the Committee, the following: (i) the FICA
Withholding Election, in accordance with Section 4.4, (ii) the manner of
distribution, consistent with Section 7.3, (iii) the Specified Date Election,
consistent with Section 7.4, if any such election is to be made by the
Participant, and (iii) his or her Beneficiary or Beneficiaries, consistent with
Section 11.2. The FICA Withholding Election shall only apply with respect to the
Qualifying Stock Options subject to such Alternative Exercise Agreement. An
Eligible Individual's manner of distribution election, Specified Date Election
and Beneficiary designation shall apply with respect to all Deferred Shares
(together with Dividend Equivalents thereon) credited to such Individual's
Deferred Share Account.

                  (c) Changes to Certain Elections. An Alternative Exercise
Agreement is irrevocable by the Eligible Individual once it is received by the
Committee; provided, however, that an Eligible Individual may change his or her
(i) Beneficiaries at any time in accordance with the requirements of Section
11.2, and (ii) manner of distribution election in accordance with the
requirements of Section 7.3.





                                      -10-
<PAGE>

         4.2 Limited Ability to Exercise Option. Any Qualifying Option (or
portion thereof) which is subject to an Alternative Exercise Agreement may not
be exercised at all during the six-month period following the date on which the
Committee receives the Eligible Individual's Alternative Exercise Agreement.

         4.3 Termination of Alternative Exercise Agreements. An Eligible
Individual's Alternative Exercise Agreement shall terminate and the related
Qualifying Option may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the
Qualifying Option without regard to the Alternative Exercise Agreement or the
restriction set forth in Section 4.2 if an Eligible Individual dies prior to
exercise or, unless the Committee otherwise provides, a Change of Control
occurs.

         4.4 FICA Withholding Election. Each Eligible Individual who, as
determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, would be subject to FICA
taxes as a result of the Alternative Exercise of a Qualifying Stock Option, may
elect on his or her Alternative Exercise Agreement to pay the FICA taxes the
Company is required to withhold as a result of the Alternative Exercise of a
Qualifying Stock Option by making a cash payment to the Company in an amount
equal to such FICA withholding taxes (such election, a "FICA Withholding
Election"). If no FICA Withholding Election is made on an Eligible Individual's
Alternative Exercise Agreement, such Eligible Individual shall be deemed to have
elected to pay FICA withholding taxes by having the Company withhold Gain Shares
having a Fair Market Value equal to such FICA withholding taxes. The appropriate
number of Gain Shares required to satisfy such FICA withholding tax obligation
will be based on the Fair Market Value of a Share on the day prior to the
Conversion Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, a FICA
Withholding Election is irrevocable once the Alternative Exercise Agreement has
been received by the Committee. However, the FICA Withholding Election shall
only apply with respect to the Qualifying Stock Options subject to such
Alternative Exercise Agreement.

         4.5 Other Terms of Alternative Exercise Agreements. No Alternative
Exercise Agreement shall have the effect of extending the term or otherwise
changing the terms of any Qualifying Option (except as expressly contemplated
hereby in respect of the consequences of an Alternative Exercise). No
Alternative Exercise Agreement may be amended or terminated except as
specifically provided in this Plan.

                             DEFERRED SHARE ACCOUNTS

         5.1 Crediting of Deferred Shares.

                  (a) Crediting of Deferred Shares. As of the applicable
Conversion Date of a Qualifying Stock Option, an Eligible Individual's Deferred
Share Account shall be credited with the number of Deferred Shares attributable
to the Gain Shares, as described in Section 4.1.

                  (b) Limitations on Rights Associated with Deferred Shares. A
Participant's Deferred Share Account shall be a memorandum account on the books
of the Company. The Deferred Shares credited to a Participant's Deferred Share
Account shall be used solely as a device for determining the number of Shares
and cash amounts to be eventually distributed to such Participant in accordance
with this Plan. The Deferred Shares shall not be treated as property or as a
trust fund of any kind. No Participant shall be entitled to any voting or other
shareholder rights with respect to any Deferred Shares credited under this Plan.
The number of Deferred Shares credited (and the Shares to which the Participant
is entitled under this Plan) shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with
Section 5.3 of this Plan.

         5.2 Dividend Equivalent Credits to Deferred Share Accounts. As of any
applicable dividend or distribution payment date, a Participant's Deferred Share
Account shall be credited with additional Deferred Shares in an amount equal to
the amount of the Dividend Equivalents divided by the Fair Market Value of a
Share as of the applicable dividend payment date. Dividend Equivalents will
ultimately be settled in cash.

         5.3 Adjustments in Case of Changes in Common Stock.

                  (a) If the outstanding Shares are increased, decreased, or
exchanged for a different number or kind of securities, or if additional shares
or new or different shares or other securities are distributed with respect to
such Shares or other securities, through merger, consolidation, sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company, reorganization,
recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar
change in capitalization or any other distribution with respect to such Shares
or other securities, proportionate and equitable adjustments consistent with the
effect of such event on stockholders generally (but without duplication of
benefits if Dividend Equivalents are credited) shall be made in the number and
type of Shares or other securities, property and/or rights contemplated
hereunder and of rights in respect of Deferred Shares and Deferred Share
Accounts credited under this Plan so as to preserve the benefits intended.

                  (b) If an event described in Section 5.3(a) results in any
rights of shareholders to receive cash (other than cash dividends and cash
distributions), a corresponding amount of cash shall be credited to each
Participant's Deferred Share Account as of the date on which cash is paid in
respect of outstanding Shares. The Participant's Deferred Share Account shall be
credited with earnings on the cash balance credited to such Deferred Share
Account on a daily basis at a rate equal to the Interest Rate through the last
day of the month in which distribution payments commence. The amount of cash
credited to a Participant's Deferred Share Account shall be distributed in cash
at such time (or times) and in such manner as otherwise provided under this Plan
and/or the applicable election made by the Participant in accordance with the
terms of this Plan. In the event any portion of such cash is distributed in
installments, interest shall be credited on the unpaid balance at the following
rate: the monthly average of the Moody's Average Corporate Bond Yield for the
last calendar year ending prior to the event giving rise to the distribution,
plus 1%.

         All Deferred Shares (including Deferred Shares credited as Dividend
Equivalents) and cash credited to a Participant's Deferred Share Account shall
be at all times fully vested.

                                  DISTRIBUTIONS

         7.1 Form of Distributions. Deferred Shares credited to a Participant's
Deferred Share Account, other than Dividend Equivalents, shall be distributed in
an equivalent whole number of Shares. Dividend Equivalents, any cash credited to
a Participant's Deferred Share Account, and fractional share interests shall be
settled in cash.

         7.2 Timing of Distributions. Distribution of Deferred Shares and cash
credited to a Participant's Deferred Share Account shall commence as soon as
administratively feasible following the first to occur of the following events,
but not later than 90 days following the occurrence of such event: (i) the
Deferral Date with respect to such Deferred Shares, or (ii) the Participant's
death (the "Distribution Event"), provided that in the case of the Participant's
death, distributions shall not commence within the 30-day period following the
Participant's death.

         7.3 Manner of Distribution.

                  (a) Election of Manner of Distribution. Each Eligible
Individual shall elect on an Alternative Exercise Agreement the manner in which
to have the Deferred Shares (together with Dividend Equivalents thereon) in his
or her Deferred Share Account distributed. An Eligible Individual may elect a
different distribution option for each Distribution Event. The distribution
options that may be elected are as follows:

                           (i)      a single distribution;

                           (ii)     an installment distribution; or

                           (iii)    a combination of (i) and (ii) above.

                  If no valid election is made, the Participant's Deferred Share
Account shall be distributed in a single distribution. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Committee may, in its sole discretion: (x) distribute the
benefits in a single distribution if the sum of Shares to be distributed is less
than or equal to 1,000, or (y) reduce the number of installments elected by the
Participant to produce an annual distribution of at least 100 Shares. A
Participant shall be entitled to change the Participant's designation of
distribution option by written notice to the Committee delivered at any time
which is no less than one year prior to the Distribution Event. Any notice of
change which is given less than one year prior to the Distribution Event shall
be of no force and effect.

                  (b) Installment Distribution Option. Under the installment
distribution option, a Participant's Deferred Shares (including Dividend
Equivalents thereon) shall be distributed in quarterly or annual installments
for up to 20 years as elected by the Eligible Individual. The number of Shares
in any one installment shall be





                                      -15-
<PAGE>

determined by dividing the total number of Shares in the Deferred Share Account
at that time by the remaining number of installments. A similar declining
balance method shall be used to determine installment distributions of Dividend
Equivalents settled in cash, any cash credited to a Participant's Deferred Share
Account and fractional share interests settled in cash.

                  (c) Dividend Equivalent Shares. In the case of a single
distribution, the Fair Market Value of the Dividend Equivalent Shares shall be
determined on the date of the Distribution Event for purposes of determining the
amount of cash that is to be distributed to the Participant or the Participant's
Beneficiaries. In the case of an installment distribution, the Fair Market Value
of the Dividend Equivalent Shares shall be determined on the date of the
Distribution Event, and on each anniversary of the Distribution Event, for
purposes of determining each installment due during the 12-month period
following the Distribution Event or anniversary thereof, as the case may be.

         7.4 Specified Date Election. Each Participant may elect on his or her
Alternative Exercise Agreement to commence distribution of the Deferred Shares
credited with respect to such Agreement (including Dividend Equivalents thereon)
at a date specified following the date of Alternative Exercise, which date shall
be at least one year and no greater than five years following the date of
Alternative Exercise (such date chosen by a Participant, a "Deferral Date"). The
Deferred Shares and Dividend Equivalents subject to the Specified Date Election
shall be distributed to the Participant in accordance with Section 7.3. The
Deferral Date designated by the Participant pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall
be irrevocable.

         7.5 Death. Upon the death of a Participant, the Committee shall
distribute or commence to distribute to the Participant's Beneficiary or
Beneficiaries the Shares and cash credited to the Participant's Deferred Share
Account in accordance with the Participant's form of distribution election;
provided, however, that with respect to those Deferred Shares (together with
Dividend Equivalents thereon) for which distributions have commenced, the
Committee shall continue to distribute to the Participant's Beneficiary or
Beneficiaries the remaining Shares and any cash distributable to the Participant
under this Plan over the same period that the Shares would have been distributed
to the Participant had the Participant not died.

         7.6 Hardship Withdrawals. Any Participant may request a hardship
withdrawal. No hardship withdrawal can exceed the lesser of the amount credited
to the Participant's Deferred Share Account or the amount reasonably needed to
satisfy the emergency need. Whether a hardship exists and the amount reasonably
needed to





                                      -16-
<PAGE>

satisfy the emergency need will be determined by the Committee based upon the
evidence presented by the Participant and the rules established in this Section.
If a hardship withdrawal is approved by the Committee it will be paid within 10
days of the Committee's determination. A hardship for this purpose is a severe
financial hardship to the Participant resulting from a sudden and unexpected
illness or accident of the Participant or of a dependent (as defined in Section
152(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of the Participant,
loss of the Participant's property due to casualty, or any similar extraordinary
and unforeseeable circumstance arising as a result of events beyond the control
of the Participant. The circumstances that will constitute a hardship will
depend upon the facts of each case, but, in any case, payment may not be made to
the extent that the hardship is or may be relieved: (a) through reimbursement or
compensation by insurance or otherwise, or (b) by liquidation of the
Participant's assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets will not
itself cause severe financial hardship. Such foreseeable needs for funds as the
need to send a Participant's child to college or the desire to purchase a home
will not be considered to be a hardship.

         7.7 Expenses Incurred in Enforcing the Plan. The Company will pay a
Participant or a Participant's Beneficiary for all legal fees and expenses
incurred by him in seeking to obtain or enforce any benefit provided by this
Plan if the Participant's Distribution Event occurs during a Plan Year in which
a Change of Control occurs or during the next three succeeding Plan Years
following the Plan Year in which a Change of Control occurs.

         7.8 Withholding of Taxes. Subject to a Participant's FICA Withholding
Election pursuant to Section 4.4, state or federal tax withholding obligations
arising from the Alternative Exercise of a Qualifying Option and the
distribution of Shares and any cash with respect to a Participant's Deferred
Share Account may be satisfied in such manner as the Committee determines in its
sole and absolute discretion, including (a) reducing the number of Shares or
cash otherwise credited to a Participant's Deferred Share Account, and (b)
requiring the Participant to pay or provide for payment of such withholding
taxes in cash to the Company.

         7.9 Effect of a Change of Control. In the event of a Change of Control
of Sysco, the following rules shall apply:

                  (a) All Participants shall continue to have a fully-vested,
nonforfeitable interest in their Deferred Share Accounts.

                  (b) Unless the Committee otherwise provides, Alternative
Exercise Agreements shall terminate in accordance with Section 4.3.





                                      -17-
<PAGE>

                  (c) All payments in respect of Deferred Share Accounts
following a Change of Control shall be made as follows:

                           (i) Subject to a Participant's or Beneficiary's
rights pursuant to Section 7.9(d), payments that have already commenced shall
continue to be made no less rapidly than under the schedule in effect just prior
to the Change of Control.

                           (ii) Subject to a Participant's or Beneficiary's
rights pursuant to Section 7.9(d), payments that have not commenced shall be
made (unless the Committee provides otherwise) in the form of Shares (except for
Dividend Equivalents which shall be settled in cash) at the earliest possible
payment date under the normal rules for benefit commencement and in the manner
of distribution selected by the Participant pursuant to Section 7.3, as both
such provisions are in effect on the day before the Change of Control.

                  (d) Any Participant or, if the Participant is deceased, the
Participant's Beneficiary, shall be entitled to make an election (a "Change of
Control Payout Election") to receive a single payment of Shares credited to a
Participant's Deferred Share Account in full satisfaction of all benefits to
which the Participant or Beneficiary would otherwise be entitled under the Plan.
A Change of Control Payout Election shall be made by written notice to the
Committee by the electing person at any time after the Change of Control of
Sysco. The payment (the "Change of Control Payout Benefit") shall be made as
soon as administratively feasible after receipt of the Change of Control Payout
Election but no later than 90 days from the date of receipt of the Change of
Control Payout Election. If a Participant or Beneficiary makes a Change of
Control Payout Election, the Change of Control Payout Benefit shall be the
exclusive payment to which the Participant, the Participant's spouse and/or the
Beneficiary will be eligible under the Plan and no benefit payments shall be
made to the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary pursuant to any other
provision of this Plan following a Change of Control Payout Election. A
Participant's Change of Control Payout Benefit shall equal 90% of the balance of
the Participant's Deferred Share Account (including Dividend Equivalents and any
cash credited to a Participant's Deferred Share Account) credited through the
date of the payment of the Change of Control Benefit.

                                 ADMINISTRATION

         8.1 Committee Appointment. The Committee will be appointed by the Board
of Directors. Each Committee member will serve until his or her resignation or
removal. The Board of Directors will have the sole discretion to remove any one
or more Committee members and appoint one or more replacement or additional
Committee members from time to time.

         8.2 Committee Organization and Voting. The Committee will select from
among its members a chairman who will preside at all of its meetings and will
elect a secretary without regard to whether that person is a member of the
Committee. The secretary will keep all records, documents and data pertaining to
the Committee's supervision and administration of the Plan. A majority of the
members of the Committee will constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business and the vote of a majority of the members present at any meeting will
decide any questions brought before the meeting. In addition, the Committee may
decide any question by vote, taken without a meeting, of a majority of its
members. A member of the Committee who is also a Participant will not vote or
act on any matter relating solely to himself.

         8.3 Powers of the Committee. The Committee will have the exclusive
responsibility for the general administration of the Plan according to the terms
and provisions of the Plan and will have all powers necessary to accomplish
those purposes, including but not by way of limitation the right, power and
authority:

                  (a) to make rules and regulations for the administration of
the Plan;

                  (b) to construe all terms, provisions, conditions and
limitations of the Plan;

                  (c) to correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile
any inconsistency that may appear in the Plan in the manner and to the extent it
deems expedient to carry the Plan into effect for the greatest benefit of all
parties at interest;

                  (d) to designate the persons eligible to become Participants
and to establish the maximum and minimum amounts that may be elected to be
deferred;

                  (e) to determine all controversies relating to the
administration of the Plan, including but not limited to:





                                      -19-
<PAGE>

                           (1) differences of opinion arising between the
Company and a Participant except when the difference of opinion relates to the
entitlement to, the amount of or the method or timing of payment of a benefit
affected by a Change of Control, in which event it shall be decided by judicial
action; and

                           (2) any question it deems advisable to determine in
order to promote the uniform administration of the Plan for the benefit of all
parties at interest; and

                  (f) to delegate by written notice those clerical and
recordation duties of the Committee, as it deems necessary or advisable for the
proper and efficient administration of the Plan.

         8.4 Committee Discretion. The Committee in exercising any power or
authority granted under this Plan or in making any determination under this Plan
shall perform or refrain from performing those acts using its sole discretion
and judgment. By way of amplification and without limiting the foregoing, the
Company specifically intends that the Committee have the greatest possible
discretion to construe the terms of the Plan and to determine all questions
concerning eligibility, participation and benefits. Any decision made by the
Committee or any refraining to act or any act taken by the Committee in good
faith shall be final and binding on all parties. The Committee's decision shall
never be subject to de novo review. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Committee's decisions, refraining to act or acting is to be subject to judicial
review for those incidents occurring during the Plan Year in which a Change of
Control occurs and during the next three succeeding Plan Years. For purposes of
this Plan, the Committee's exercise of discretionary authority pursuant to
Section 2.34 shall not be effective until the Committee has executed the
Alternative Exercise Agreement in accordance with Section 3.3.

         8.5 Reimbursement of Expenses. The Committee will serve without
compensation for its services but will be reimbursed by Sysco for all expenses
properly and actually incurred in the performance of its duties under the Plan.

                          AMENDMENT AND/OR TERMINATION

         9.1 Amendment or Termination of the Plan. The Board of Directors may
amend or terminate this Plan at any time by an instrument in writing without the
consent of any Subsidiary. However, adjustments pursuant to Section 5.3 shall
not be deemed amendments to the Plan, the Deferred Share Accounts or the rights
of Participants.

         9.2 No Retroactive Effect on Benefits. No amendment will affect the
rights of any Participant with respect to Deferred Shares and Dividend
Equivalents (and any cash credited pursuant to Section 5.3(b)) credited to his
or her Deferred Share Account prior to the date of the amendment or to change a
Participant's right under any provision relating to a Change of Control after a
Change of Control has occurred without the Participant's consent.

         9.3 Effect of Termination. In connection with the termination of this
Plan, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, elect to accelerate the
distribution date for all Deferred Share Accounts (including Deferred Share
Accounts being paid in or otherwise to be paid in the form of installments) and
make single distributions in respect thereof.

                                     FUNDING

         10.1 Payments Under This Agreement are the Obligation of the Company.
The Company will pay the benefits due the Participants under this Plan; however
should it fail to do so when a benefit is due, the benefit will be paid by the
trustee of any trust established pursuant to Section 10.2 hereof. In any event,
if the trust fails to pay for any reason, the Company still remains liable for
the payment of all benefits provided by this Plan.

         10.2 Agreement May be Funded Through Rabbi Trust. It is specifically
recognized by both the Company and the Participants that the Company may, but is
not required to, contribute Shares and/or cash in any amount it finds desirable
to a trust established to accumulate assets sufficient to fund the obligations
of the Company and Subsidiaries that employ Participants in the Plan. However,
under all circumstances, the Participants will have no rights to any of the
Shares or cash contributed to the trust; and likewise, under all circumstances,
the rights of the Participants to the assets held in the trust will be no
greater than the rights expressed in this agreement. Nothing contained in the
trust agreement which creates the funding trust will constitute a guarantee by
any Company that assets of the Company transferred to the trust will be
sufficient to pay any benefits under this Plan or would place the Participant in
a secured position ahead of general creditors should the Company become
insolvent or bankrupt. Any trust agreement prepared to fund the Company's
obligations under this agreement must specifically set out these principles so
it is clear in that trust agreement that the Participants in this Plan are only
unsecured general creditors of the Company in relation to their benefits under
this Plan.

         10.3 Participants Must Rely Only on General Credit of the Company. It
is also specifically recognized by both the Company and the Participants that
this Plan is only a general corporate commitment and that each Participant must
rely upon the general credit of a Company for the fulfillment of its obligations
hereunder. Under all circumstances the rights of Participants to any asset held
by the Company will be no greater than the rights expressed in this agreement.
Nothing contained in this agreement will constitute a guarantee by the Company
that the assets of the Company will be sufficient to pay any benefits under this
Plan or would place the Participant in a secured position ahead of general
creditors of the Company. Though the Company may establish or become a signatory
to a Rabbi Trust, as indicated in Section 10.2, to accumulate assets to fulfill
its obligations, the Plan and any such trust will not create any lien, claim,
encumbrance, right, title or other interest of any kind whatsoever in any
Participant in any asset held by the Company, contributed to any such trust or
otherwise designated to be used






                                      -22-
<PAGE>

for payment of any of its obligations created in this agreement. No specific
assets of the Company have been or will be set aside, or will in any way be
transferred to the trust or will be pledged in any way for the performance of
the Company's obligations under this Plan which would remove such assets from
being subject to the general creditors of the Company.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         11.1 Limitation of Rights. Nothing in this Plan will be construed:

                  (a) to give any person any right to be designated a
Participant in the Plan;

                  (b) to give a Participant any right with respect to Deferred
Shares and Dividend Equivalents credited to the Participant's Deferred Share
Account, and cash credited to the Participant's Deferred Share Account pursuant
to Section 5.3(b), except in accordance with the terms of this Plan;

                  (c) to give a Participant or any other person claiming through
him any interest or right under this Plan other than that of any unsecured
general creditor of the Company.

         11.2 Beneficiary Designation. Each Eligible Individual, upon completing
his or her Alternative Exercise Agreement, will file with the Committee a
designation of one or more Beneficiaries to whom distributions will be made in
the event of his or her death prior to the complete distribution of the Shares
credited to his or her Deferred Share Account. The designation will be effective
upon receipt by the Committee of a properly executed form which the Committee
has approved for that purpose. An Eligible Individual and/or Participant may
from time to time revoke or change any designation of Beneficiary by filing
another approved Beneficiary designation form with the Committee. If there is no
valid designation of Beneficiary on file with the Committee at the time of the
Participant's death, or if all of the Beneficiaries designated in the last
Beneficiary designation have predeceased the Participant or, in the case of an
entity, otherwise ceased to exist, the Beneficiary will be the Participant's
spouse, if the spouse survives the Participant, or otherwise the Participant's
estate. A Beneficiary who is an individual will be deemed to have predeceased
the Participant if the Beneficiary dies within 30 days of the date of the
Participant's death. If any Beneficiary survives the Participant but dies or, in
the case of an entity, otherwise ceases to exist before receiving all amounts
due the Beneficiary from the Participant's Deferred Share Account, the balance
of the amount which would have been paid to that Beneficiary will, unless the
Participant's designation provides otherwise, be distributed to the individual
deceased Beneficiary's estate or, in the case of an entity, to the Participant's
spouse, if the spouse survives the Participant, or otherwise to the
Participant's estate. Any Beneficiary designation which designates any person or
entity other than the Eligible Individual's/Participant's spouse must be
consented to in writing in a form acceptable to the Committee in order to be
effective.

         11.3 Distributions to Incompetents or Minors. Should a Participant
become incompetent or should a Participant designate a Beneficiary who is a
minor or incompetent, the Committee is authorized to pay the funds due to the
parent of the minor or to the guardian of the minor or incompetent or directly
to the minor or to apply those funds for the benefit of the minor or incompetent
in any manner the Committee determines in its sole discretion.

         11.4 Receipt and Release. Any payment to a Participant or the
Participant's Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of this Plan shall,
to the extent thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims against the Board,
the Committee, and the Company. The Committee may require such Participant or
Beneficiary, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt and
release to such effect.

         11.5 Nonalienation of Benefits. No right or benefit provided in this
Plan will be transferable by the Participant except, upon his death, to a named
Beneficiary as provided in this Plan. No right or benefit under this Plan will
be subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or
charge, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, pledge, encumber,
or charge the same will be void. No right or benefit under this Plan will in any
manner be liable for or subject to any debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of
the person entitled to such benefits. If any Participant or any Beneficiary
becomes bankrupt or attempts to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, pledge,
encumber or charge any right or benefit under this Plan, that right or benefit
will, in the discretion of the Committee, cease. In that event, the Committee
may have the Company hold or apply the right or benefit or any part of it to the
benefit of the Participant or Beneficiary, his or her spouse, children or other
dependents or any of them in any manner and in any proportion the Committee
believes to be proper in its sole and absolute discretion, but is not required
to do so.

         11.6 Reliance Upon Information. The Committee will not be liable for
any decision or action taken in good faith in connection with the administration
of this Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any decision or
action taken by the Committee when it relies upon information supplied it by any
officer of the Company, the Company's legal counsel, the Company's independent
accountants or other advisors in connection with the administration of this Plan
will be deemed to have been taken in good faith.

         11.7 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or condition of the
Plan is held to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, the rest of the
Plan will remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated.

         11.8 Compliance with Laws. This Plan, the Company's acceptance of the
exercise price of a Qualifying Option in the form of Shares, the Company's
issuance of Deferred Shares, and the offer, issuance and delivery of Shares
and/or the payment in Shares through the deferral of compensation under this
Plan are subject to compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, rules
and regulations (including, without limitation, state and federal securities
law) and to such approvals by any listing, agency or any regulatory or
governmental authority as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, be
necessary or advisable in connection therewith. Any securities delivered under
this Plan shall be subject to such restrictions, and the person acquiring such
securities shall, if requested by the Company, provide such assurances and
representations to the Company as the Company may deem necessary or desirable to
assure compliance with all applicable legal requirements. If the Company in its
sole discretion determines that an Alternative Exercise of a Qualifying Option
would violate any law, rule or regulation, the Company may refuse to honor such
Alternative Exercise.

         11.9 Notice. Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to
the Committee or a Participant will be sufficient if submitted in writing and
hand-delivered or sent by U.S. mail to the principal office of the Company or to
the residential mailing address of the Participant. Notice will be deemed to be
given as of the date of hand-delivery, or if delivery is by mail, as of the date
shown on the postmark.

         11.10 Gender and Number. If the context requires it, words of one
gender when used in this Plan will include the other genders, and words used in
the singular or plural will include the other.

         11.11 Governing Law. The Plan will be construed, administered and
governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Texas.
