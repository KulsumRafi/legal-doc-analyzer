         This RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT (as amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, this "Agreement") is entered into as of
January 16, 2003, by and among HARRISON STREET FUNDING, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, as seller (the "Seller"), CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC., a
Delaware corporation ("Church & Dwight"), as initial servicer (in such capacity,
together with its successors and permitted assigns in such capacity, the
"Servicer"), MARKET STREET FUNDING CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (together
with its successors and permitted assigns, the "Issuer"), and PNC BANK, NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION, a national banking association ("PNC"), as administrator (in such
capacity, together with its successors and assigns in such capacity, the
"Administrator").

         PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS. Certain terms that are capitalized and used
throughout this Agreement are defined in Exhibit I. References in the Exhibits
hereto to the "Agreement" refer to this Agreement, as amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time.

         The Seller desires to sell, transfer and assign an undivided variable
percentage interest in a pool of receivables, and the Issuer desires to acquire
such undivided variable percentage interest, as such percentage interest shall
be adjusted from time to time based upon, in part, reinvestment payments that
are made by the Issuer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto
acknowledge and intend that the transactions contemplated hereby will be treated
for accounting and tax purposes as secured loans from the Issuer to the Seller
and not as a sale of assets from the Seller to the Issuer.

         In consideration of the mutual agreements, provisions and covenants
contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I
                       AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE PURCHASES

Section 1.1 Purchase Facility.

         (a) On the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the Issuer
hereby agrees to purchase, and make reinvestments of, the Purchased Interest
from the Seller from time to time from the date hereof to the Facility
Termination Date. Under no circumstances shall the Issuer make any such purchase
or reinvestment if, after giving effect to such purchase or reinvestment, the
aggregate outstanding Capital of the Purchased Interest would exceed the
Purchase Limit.

         (b) The Seller may, upon at least 30 days' written notice to the
Administrator, terminate the purchase facility provided in this Section in whole
or, upon at least 10 days' written notice to the Administrator, from time to
time, irrevocably reduce in part the unused portion of the Purchase Limit;
provided, that each partial reduction shall be in the amount of at least
$5,000,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and that,
unless terminated in whole, the Purchase Limit shall in no event be reduced
below $20,000,000.

         Section 1.2 Making Purchases.

         (a) Each purchase (but not reinvestment) of undivided percentage
ownership interests with regard to the Purchased Interest hereunder shall be
made upon the Seller's irrevocable written notice in the form of Annex B (the
"Purchase Notice") delivered to the Administrator in accordance with Section 5.2
(which notice must be received by the Administrator before 11:00 a.m.,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time) at least two Business Days before the requested
purchase date, which notice shall specify: (A) the amount requested to be paid
to the Seller (such amount, which shall not be less than $1,000,000 and shall be
in integral multiples of $100,000, being the Capital relating to the undivided
percentage ownership interest then being purchased), (B) the date of such
purchase (which shall be a Business Day), and (C) the pro forma calculation of
the Purchased Interest after giving effect to the increase in Capital.

         (b) On the date of each purchase (but not reinvestment) of the
Purchased Interest hereunder, the Issuer shall, upon satisfaction of the
applicable conditions set forth in Exhibit II, make available to the Seller in
same day funds, at JPMorgan Chase Bank, account number 808013629, ABA 021000021,
an amount, which is the Capital relating to the undivided percentage ownership
interest then being purchased, equal to the lesser of (i) the amount requested
by the Seller, (ii) the Purchase Limit minus the aggregate outstanding Capital
immediately prior to such purchase, and (iii) the maximum amount which would
cause the Purchased Interest to equal 100% immediately after such purchase.

         (c) Effective on the date of each purchase pursuant to this Section and
each reinvestment pursuant to Section 1.4, the Seller hereby sells and assigns
to the Issuer, in the aggregate, the Purchased Interest.

         (d) To secure all of the Seller's obligations (monetary or otherwise)
under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party,
whether now or hereafter existing or arising, due or to become due, direct or
indirect, absolute or contingent, the Seller hereby grants to the Issuer a
security interest in all of the Seller's right, title and interest (including
any undivided interest of the Seller) in, to and under all of the following,
whether now or hereafter owned, existing or arising: (i) all Pool Receivables,
(ii) all Related Security with respect to such Pool Receivables, (iii) all
Collections with respect to such Pool Receivables, (iv) the Lock-Box Accounts
and all amounts on deposit therein, and all certificates and instruments, if
any, from time to time evidencing such Lock-Box Accounts and amounts on deposit
therein, (v) all rights (but none of the obligations) of the Seller under the
Sale Agreement, and (vi) all proceeds of, and all amounts received or receivable
under any or all of, the foregoing (collectively, the "Pool Assets"). The Issuer
shall have, with respect to the Pool Assets, and in addition to all the other
rights and remedies available to the Issuer, all the rights and remedies of a
secured party under any applicable UCC.

         Section 1.3 Purchased Interest Computation.

         The Purchased Interest shall be initially computed on the date of the
initial purchase hereunder. Thereafter, until the Facility Termination Date, the
Purchased Interest shall be automatically recomputed (or deemed to be
recomputed) on each Business Day other than a Termination Day. The Purchased
Interest as computed (or deemed recomputed) as of the day



                                      -2-
<PAGE>



before the Facility Termination Date shall thereafter remain constant. From and
after the occurrence of any Termination Day (other than any Termination Day
occurring solely under clause (a) of the definition of Facility Termination Date
or on which the Purchase Limit reduces to zero pursuant to Section 1.1(b) of
this Agreement), the Purchased Interest shall (until the events giving rise to
such Termination Day are satisfied or are waived by the Administrator) be deemed
to be 100%. The Purchased Interest shall become zero when the Capital thereof
and Discount thereon shall have been paid in full, all the amounts owed by the
Seller and the Servicer hereunder to the Issuer, the Administrator and any other
Indemnified Party or Affected Person are paid in full, and the Servicer shall
have received the accrued Servicing Fee thereon.

         Section 1.4 Settlement Procedures.

         (a) The collection of the Pool Receivables shall be administered by the
Servicer in accordance with this Agreement. The Seller shall provide to the
Servicer on a timely basis all information needed for such administration,
including notice of the occurrence of any Termination Day and current
computations of the Purchased Interest.

         (b) The Servicer shall, on each day on which Collections of Pool
Receivables are received (or deemed received) by the Seller or the Servicer:

                  (i) hold in trust (and, at the request of the Administrator,
set aside and segregate in a separate account approved by the Administrator,
provided that prior to such Administrator's request, no such setting aside or
segregation shall be required) for the Issuer, out of the Issuer's Share of such
Collections, first, an amount equal to the Discount accrued through such day for
each Portion of Capital and not previously held in trust, second, an amount
equal to the fees set forth in the Fee Letter accrued and unpaid through such
day, and third, to the extent funds are available therefor, an amount equal to
the Issuer's Share of the Servicing Fee accrued through such day and not
previously held in trust,

                  (ii) subject to Section 1.4(f), if such day is not a
Termination Day, remit to the Seller, on behalf of the Issuer, the remainder of
the Issuer's Share of such Collections. Such remainder shall be automatically
reinvested in Pool Receivables, and in the Related Security, Collections and
other proceeds with respect thereto; provided, however, that if the Purchased
Interest would exceed 100%, then the Servicer shall not reinvest, but shall hold
in trust for the Issuer (and, at the request of the Administrator, set aside and
segregate in a separate account approved by the Administrator, provided that
prior to Administrator's request, no such setting aside or segregation shall be
required) a portion of such Collections that, together with the other
Collections held in trust pursuant to this paragraph, shall equal the amount
necessary to reduce the Purchased Interest to 100%,

                  (iii) if such day is a Termination Day, hold in trust (and, at
the request of the Administrator, set aside and segregate in a separate account
approved by the Administrator, provided that prior to Administrator's request,
no such segregation shall be required) for the Issuer the entire remainder of
the Issuer's Share of the Collections; provided, that if amounts are held in
trust on any Termination Day of the type described in clause (a) of the
definition of "Termination Day" and, thereafter, the conditions set forth in
Section 2 of Exhibit II are satisfied or waived by the Administrator, such
previously set-aside amounts shall be



                                      -3-
<PAGE>



reinvested in accordance with clause (ii) on the day of such subsequent
satisfaction or waiver of conditions, and

                  (iv) release to the Seller (subject to Section 1.4(f)) for its
own account any Collections in excess of: (x) amounts required to be reinvested
in accordance with clause (ii) or the proviso to clause (iii) plus (y) the
amounts that are required to be held in trust pursuant to clause (i), the
proviso to clause (ii) and clause (iii) plus (z) an amount equal to the Seller's
Share of the Servicing Fee accrued and unpaid through such day and all
reasonable and appropriate out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Servicer for
servicing, collecting and administering the Pool Receivables.

         (c) The Servicer shall deposit into the Administration Account (or such
other account designated by the Administrator), on each Settlement Date,
Collections held for the Issuer pursuant to clause (b)(i) or (f) plus the amount
of Collections then held for the Issuer pursuant to clauses (b)(ii) and (iii) of
Section 1.4; provided, that if Church & Dwight or an Affiliate thereof is the
Servicer, such day is not a Termination Day and the Administrator has not
notified Church & Dwight (or such Affiliate) that such right is revoked, Church
& Dwight (or such Affiliate) may retain the portion of the Collections held in
trust pursuant to clause (b)(i) that represents the Issuer's Share of the
Servicing Fee. On the last day of each Settlement Period, the Administrator will
notify the Servicer by facsimile of the amount of Discount accrued with respect
to each Portion of Capital during such Settlement Period or portion thereof.

         (d) Upon receipt of funds deposited into the Administration Account
pursuant to clause (c), the Administrator shall cause such funds to be
distributed as follows:

                  (i) if such distribution occurs on a day that is not a
Termination Day and the Purchased Interest does not exceed 100%, first to the
Issuer in payment in full of all accrued Discount and fees (other than Servicing
Fees) with respect to each Portion of Capital, and second, if the Servicer has
held in trust amounts in respect of the Servicing Fee pursuant to clause (b)(i)
and has not retained such amounts pursuant to clause (c), to the Servicer
(payable in arrears on each Settlement Date) in payment in full of the Issuer's
Share of accrued Servicing Fees so held in trust, and

                  (ii) if such distribution occurs on a Termination Day or on a
day when the Purchased Interest exceeds 100%, first to the Issuer in payment in
full of all accrued Discount with respect to each Portion of Capital, second to
the Issuer in payment in full of Capital (or, if such day is not a Termination
Day, the amount necessary to reduce the Purchased Interest to 100%), third, to
the Servicer in payment in full of all accrued Servicing Fees, and fourth, if
the Capital and accrued Discount with respect to each Portion of Capital have
been reduced to zero, and all accrued Servicing Fees payable to the Servicer
have been paid in full, to the Issuer, the Administrator and any other
Indemnified Party or Affected Person in payment in full of any other amounts
owed thereto by the Seller hereunder.

After the Capital, Discount, fees payable pursuant to the Fee Letter and
Servicing Fees with respect to the Purchased Interest, and any other amounts
payable by the Seller and the Servicer to the Issuer, the Administrator or any
other Indemnified Party or Affected Person hereunder, have



                                      -4-
<PAGE>



been paid in full, all additional Collections with respect to the Purchased
Interest shall be paid to the Seller for its own account.

         (e) For the purposes of this Section 1.4:

                  (i) if on any day the Outstanding Balance of any Pool
Receivable is reduced or adjusted as a result of any defective, rejected,
returned, repossessed or foreclosed goods or services, or any revision,
cancellation, allowance, rebate, discount or other adjustment made by the Seller
or any Affiliate of the Seller, or any setoff or dispute between the Seller or
any Affiliate of the Seller and an Obligor, the Seller shall be deemed to have
received on such day a Collection of such Pool Receivable in the amount of such
reduction or adjustment;

                  (ii) if on any day any of the representations or warranties in
Section l(g) or (m) of Exhibit III is not true with respect to any Pool
Receivable, the Seller shall be deemed to have received on such day a Collection
of such Pool Receivable in full;

                  (iii) except as provided in clause (i) or (ii), or as
otherwise required by applicable law or the relevant Contract, all Collections
received from an Obligor of any Receivable shall be applied to the Receivables
of such Obligor in the order of the age of such Receivables, starting with the
oldest such Receivable, unless such Obligor designates in writing its payment
for application to specific Receivables; and

                  (iv) if and to the extent the Administrator or the Issuer
shall be required for any reason to pay over to an Obligor (or any trustee,
receiver, custodian or similar official in any Insolvency Proceeding) any amount
received by it hereunder, such amount shall be deemed not to have been so
received by the Administrator or the Issuer but rather to have been retained by
the Seller and, accordingly, the Administrator or the Issuer, as the case may
be, shall have a claim against the Seller for such amount, payable when and to
the extent that any distribution from or on behalf of such Obligor is made in
respect thereof

         (f) If at any time the Seller shall wish to cause the reduction of
Capital (but not to commence the liquidation, or reduction to zero, of the
entire Capital of the Purchased Interest), the Seller may do so as follows:

                  (i) the Seller shall give the Administrator and the Servicer
written notice in the form of Annex C (the "Paydown Notice") (which notice must
be received by the Administrator before 2:00 p.m., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
time) (A) at least one Business Day prior to the date of such reduction for any
reduction of Capital less than or equal to $10,000,000 and (B) at least three
(3) Business Days' prior to the date of such reduction for any reduction of
Capital greater than $10,000,000;

                  (ii) On the proposed date of the commencement of such
reduction and on each day thereafter, the Servicer shall cause Collections not
to be reinvested until the amount thereof not so reinvested shall equal the
desired amount of reduction; and

                  (iii) the Servicer shall hold such Collections in trust (but
shall still not be required to segregate and set aside) for the Issuer, for
payment to the Administrator on the



                                      -5-
<PAGE>



next Settlement Date immediately following the current Settlement Period, and
Capital shall be deemed reduced in the amount to be paid to the Administrator
only when in fact finally so paid;

provided, that (a) the amount of any such reduction shall be not less than
$1,000,000 and shall be an integral multiple of $100,000, and the entire Capital
of the Purchased Interest after giving effect to such reduction shall be not
less than $1,000,000 and shall be in an integral multiple of $100,000 and (b)
the Seller shall choose a reduction amount, and the date of commencement
thereof, so that to the extent practicable such reduction shall commence and
conclude in the same Settlement Period.

         Section 1.5 Fees.

         The Seller shall pay to the Administrator certain fees in the amounts
and on the dates set forth in a letter, dated the date hereof, between the
Seller and the Administrator (as such letter agreement may be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Fee Letter").

         Section 1.6 Payments and Computations, Etc.

         (a) All amounts to be paid or deposited by the Seller or the Servicer
hereunder shall be made without reduction for offset or counterclaim and shall
be paid or deposited no later than noon, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time on the
day when due in same day funds to the Administration Account. All amounts
received after noon, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania will be deemed to have been
received on the next Business Day.

         (b) The Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, shall, to the
extent permitted by law, pay interest on any amount not paid or deposited by the
Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, when due hereunder, at an interest
rate equal to 2.0% per annum above the Base Rate, payable on demand.

         (c) All computations of interest under clause (b) and all computations
of Discount, fees and other amounts hereunder shall be made on the basis of a
year of 360 (or 365 or 366, as applicable, with respect to Discount or other
amounts calculated by reference to the Base Rate) days for the actual number of
days elapsed. Whenever any payment or deposit to be made hereunder shall be due
on a day other than a Business Day, such payment or deposit shall be made on the
next Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in the
computation of such payment or deposit.

         Section 1.7 Increased Costs.

         (a) If the Administrator, the Issuer, any Purchaser, any other Program
Support Provider or any of their respective Affiliates (each an "Affected
Person") reasonably determines that the existence of or compliance with: (i) any
law or regulation or any change therein or in the interpretation or application
thereof, in each case adopted, issued or occurring after the date hereof, or
(ii) any request, guideline or directive from any central bank or other
Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) issued or
occurring after the date of this Agreement, increases or would increase the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Affected Person
(taking into consideration such Affected Person's policies



                                      -6-
<PAGE>



regarding capital), and such Affected Person determines that the amount of such
capital is increased by or based upon the existence of any commitment to make
purchases of (or otherwise to maintain the investment in) Pool Receivables
related to this Agreement or any related liquidity facility, credit enhancement
facility and other commitments of the same type, then, within ten (10) days
after delivery to the Seller of a certificate by such Affected Person (with a
copy to the Administrator) containing the relevant facts, set forth in
reasonable detail, relating to such occurrence and calculations of amounts due
as a result thereof (an "Affected Person's Certificate"), the Seller shall pay
to the Administrator, for the account of such Affected Person, from time to time
as specified by such Affected Person, additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Affected Person in the light of such circumstances, to the
extent that such Affected Person reasonably determines such increase in capital
to be allocable to the existence of any of such commitments. The certificate as
to such amounts submitted to the Seller and the Administrator by such Affected
Person shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
For avoidance of doubt, any interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No.
51 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board shall constitute an adoption,
change, request or directive subject to this Section 1.7(a).

         (b) If, due to either: (i) the introduction of or any change in or in
the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) compliance with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
(whether or not having the force of law), which introduction, guideline or
request commences or is made after the date hereof, in each case excluding the
maximum effective percentage in effect on any day as prescribed by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for determining
reserve requirements with respect to eurocurrency funding (currently referred to
as "Eurocurrency Liabilities") and compliance therewith, there shall be any
increase in the cost to any Affected Person of agreeing to purchase or
purchasing, or maintaining the ownership of, the Purchased Interest in respect
of which Discount is computed by reference to the Euro-Rate, then, within ten
(10) days after delivery to the Seller of an Affected Person's Certificate by
such Affected Person, the Seller shall pay to such Affected Person, from time to
time as specified by such Affected Person, additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Affected Person for such increased costs. A certificate as to
such amounts submitted to the Seller and the Administrator by such Affected
Person shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         (c) If such increased costs affect the related Affected Person's
portfolio of financing transactions, such Affected Person shall use reasonable
averaging and attribution methods to allocate such increased costs to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Affected Person agrees that,
upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to a claim against the Seller under
Section 1.7 or 1.8 hereof , it will if requested by the Seller, use reasonable
efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Affected Person) to
designate another lending office for any credit extended by such Affected Person
that is affected by such event, provided that such designation is made on such
terms that such Affected Person and its lending office suffer no economic, legal
or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the
event giving rise to the operation of such Section. Nothing in this Section
shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Seller or the rights of
Administrator, Issuer, or any Program Support Provider provided in this
Agreement.

         (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Seller shall not be required to compensate an Affected Person pursuant to this
Section 1.7 or Section 1.8 hereof, for any amounts incurred more than six (6)
months prior to the date of delivery to Seller of an Affected Person's
Certificate; provided that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have
a retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include
the period of such retroactive effect.

         Section 1.8 Requirements of Law.

         If any Affected Person reasonably determines that the existence of or
compliance with: (a) any law or regulation or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, in each case adopted, issued or occurring
after the date hereof, or (b) any request, guideline or directive from any
central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of
law) issued or occurring after the date of this Agreement:

                  (i) does or shall subject such Affected Person to any tax of
any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any increase in the
Purchased Interest or in the amount of Capital relating thereto, or does or
shall change the basis of taxation of payments to such Affected Person on
account of Collections, Discount or any other amounts payable hereunder
(excluding taxes imposed on the overall or branch pre-tax net income of such
Affected Person, and franchise taxes imposed on such Affected Person, by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Affected Person is organized or
otherwise is considered doing business (unless the Affected Person would not be
considered doing business in such jurisdiction, but for having entered into, or
engaged in the transactions in connection with, this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or having entered into, or engaged in, any similar
transactions not in connection with this Agreement) or a political subdivision
thereof),

                  (ii) does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any
reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, purchases,
advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of
funds by, any office of such Affected Person that are not otherwise included in
the determination of the Euro-Rate or the Base Rate hereunder, or

                  (iii) does or shall impose on such Affected Person any other
condition, and the result of any of the foregoing is: (A) to increase the cost
to such Affected Person of acting as Administrator, or of agreeing to purchase
or purchasing or maintaining the ownership of undivided percentage ownership
interests with regard to the Purchased Interest (or interests therein) or any
Portion of Capital, or (B) to reduce any amount receivable hereunder (whether
directly or indirectly), then, in any such case, subject to the terms of Section
1.7(c) and Section 1.7(d) hereof, and within ten (10) days after delivery to the
Seller of an Affected Person's Certificate by such Affected Person, the Seller
shall pay to such Affected Person additional amounts necessary to compensate
such Affected Person for such additional cost or reduced amount receivable,
provided that there shall be no duplication for amounts payable under this
Section with amounts payable under Section 1.7. All such amounts shall be
payable as incurred. A certificate from such Affected Person to the Seller and
the Administrator certifying, in reasonably specific detail, the basis for,
calculation of, and amount of such additional costs or reduced amount receivable
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest



                                      -8-
<PAGE>



error; provided, however, that no Affected Person shall be required to disclose
any confidential or tax planning information in any such certificate.

         Section 1.9 Inability to Determine Euro-Rate.

         (a) If the Administrator determines before the first day of any
Settlement Period (which determination shall be final and conclusive, absent
manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank
eurodollar market generally, deposits in dollars (in the relevant amounts for
such Settlement Period) are not being offered to banks in the interbank
eurodollar market for such Settlement Period, or adequate means do not exist for
ascertaining the Euro-Rate for such Settlement Period, then the Administrator
shall give notice thereof to the Seller. Thereafter, until the Administrator
notifies the Seller that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no
longer exist, (a) no Portion of Capital shall be funded at the Alternate Rate
determined by reference to the Euro-Rate and (b) the Discount for any
outstanding Portions of Capital then funded at the Alternate Rate determined by
reference to the Euro-Rate shall, on the last day of the then current Settlement
Period, be converted to the Alternate Rate determined by reference to the Base
Rate.

         (b) If, on or before the first day of any Settlement Period, the
Administrator shall have been notified by any Purchaser that, such Purchaser has
determined (which determination shall be final and conclusive, absent manifest
error) that, any enactment, promulgation or adoption of or any change in any
applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by a governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by such Purchaser with any guideline, request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for such Purchaser to fund or
maintain any Portion of Capital at the Alternate Rate and based upon the
Euro-Rate, the Administrator shall notify the Seller thereof. Upon receipt of
such notice, until the Administrator notifies the Seller that the circumstances
giving rise to such determination no longer apply, (a) no Portion of Capital
shall be funded at the Alternate Rate determined by reference to the Euro-Rate
and (b) the Discount for any outstanding Portions of Capital then funded at the
Alternate Rate determined by reference to the Euro-Rate shall be converted to
the Alternate Rate determined by reference to the Base Rate either (i) on the
last day of the then current Settlement Period if such Purchaser may lawfully
continue to maintain such Portion of Capital at the Alternate Rate determined by
reference to the Euro-Rate to such day, or (ii) immediately, if such Purchaser
may not lawfully continue to maintain such Portion of Capital at the Alternate
Rate determined by reference to the Euro-Rate to such day.

         Section 2.2 Termination Events.

         If any of the Termination Events set forth in Exhibit V shall occur,
the Administrator may, by notice to the Seller, declare the Facility Termination
Date to have occurred (in which case the Facility Termination Date shall be
deemed to have occurred); provided, that automatically upon the occurrence of
any event (without any requirement for the passage of time or the giving of
notice) described in paragraph (f) of Exhibit V, the Facility Termination Date
shall occur. Upon any such declaration, occurrence or deemed occurrence of the
Facility Termination Date, the Issuer and the Administrator shall have, in
addition to the rights and remedies that they may have under this Agreement, all
other rights and remedies provided after default under the New York UCC and
under other applicable law, which rights and remedies shall be cumulative.

                                   ARTICLE III
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         Section 3.1 Indemnities by the Seller.

         Without limiting any other rights that the Administrator, the Issuer,
any Program Support Provider or any of their respective Affiliates, employees,
officers, directors, agents, counsel, successors, transferees or assigns (each,
an "Indemnified Party") may have hereunder or under applicable law, the Seller
hereby agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Party from and against any and all
claims, damages, expenses, costs, losses and liabilities (including Attorney
Costs) (all of the foregoing being collectively referred to as "Indemnified
Amounts") arising out of or resulting from this Agreement (whether directly or
indirectly), the use of proceeds of purchases or reinvestments, the ownership of
the Purchased Interest, or any interest therein, or in respect of any
Receivable, Related Security or Contract, excluding, however: (a) Indemnified
Amounts to the extent resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct on
the part of such Indemnified Party or its officers, directors, agents or
counsel, (b) any indemnification which has the effect of recourse for the
non-payment of the Receivables to any indemnitor (except as otherwise
specifically provided under Section 1.4 (e) and this Section 3.1) for
Receivables, or (c) (i) overall net income taxes or franchise taxes imposed on
such Indemnified Party by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such
Indemnified Party is organized or is otherwise considered doing business (unless
the Indemnified Party would not be considered to be doing business in such
jurisdiction but for having entered into or engaged in the transactions in
connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or having
entered into, or engaged in, any similar transactions not in connection with
this Agreement) or any political subdivision thereof; provided, however, that
the exception to indemnification in this (c)(1) shall apply if the Indemnified
Party is considered to be doing business in such jurisdiction due to the
quantity or volume of transactions such Indemnified Party has engaged in that
are either pursuant to this Agreement or are similar to transactions such party
has engaged in pursuant to this Agreement; or (ii) any taxes imposed as a result
of the failure to comply with Section 5.3(f) (other than a failure resulting
solely from a change in law occurring after the date hereof). Without limiting
or being limited by the foregoing, and subject to the exclusions set forth in
the preceding sentence, the Seller shall pay within ten (10) days after demand
(which demand shall be accompanied by documentation of the Indemnified Amounts,
in reasonable detail) to each Indemnified Party any and all amounts



                                      -10-

necessary to indemnify such Indemnified Party from and against any and all
Indemnified Amounts relating to or resulting from any of the following:

extent of the Purchased Interest, in the Receivables in, or purporting to be in,
the Receivables Pool and the other Pool Assets, or (B) first priority perfected
security interest in the Pool Assets, in each case, free and clear of any
Adverse Claim,

                  (v) the failure to have filed, or any delay in filing,

any applicable jurisdiction or other applicable laws with respect to any
Receivables in, or purporting to be in, the Receivables Pool and the other Pool
Assets, whether at the time of any purchase or reinvestment or at any subsequent
time,

                  (vi) any dispute, claim, offset or defense (other than
discharge in bankruptcy of the Obligor) of the Obligor to the payment of any
Receivable in, or purporting to be in, the Receivables Pool (including a defense
based on such Receivable or the related Contract not being a legal, valid and
binding obligation of such Obligor enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms), or any other claim resulting from the sale of the goods or services
related to such Receivable or the furnishing or failure to furnish such goods or
services or relating to collection activities with respect to such Receivable
(if such collection activities were performed by the Seller or any of its
Affiliates acting as Servicer or by any agent or independent contractor retained
by the Seller or any of its Affiliates),

                  (vii) any failure of the Seller (or any of its Affiliates
acting as the Servicer) to perform its duties or obligations in accordance with
the provisions hereof or under the Contracts,

                  (viii) any products liability or other claim, investigation,
litigation or proceeding arising out of or in connection with merchandise,

distributions shall thereafter be rescinded or otherwise must be returned for
any reason.

         Section 3.2 Indemnities by the Servicer.

         Without limiting any other rights that the Administrator, the Issuer or
any other Indemnified Party may have hereunder or under applicable law, the
Servicer hereby agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Party from and against any
and all Indemnified Amounts arising out of or resulting from (whether directly
or indirectly): (a) the failure of any information contained in an Information
Package to be true and correct, or the failure of any other information provided
to the Issuer or the Administrator by, or on behalf of, the Servicer to be true
and correct in all material respects, (b) the failure of any representation,
warranty or statement made or deemed made by the Servicer (or any of its
officers) under or in connection with this Agreement to have been true and
correct as of the date made or deemed made in all respects when made, (c) the
failure by the Servicer to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation
with respect to any Pool Receivable or the related Contract, (d) any dispute,
claim, offset or defense of the Obligor to the payment of any Receivable in, or

collection activities with respect to such Receivable, (e) the commingling of
Collections at any time with other funds, or (f) any failure of the Servicer to
perform its duties or obligations in accordance with the provisions hereof.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                         ADMINISTRATION AND COLLECTIONS

         Section 4.1 Appointment of the Servicer.

         (a) The servicing, administering and collection of the Pool Receivables
shall be conducted by the Person so designated from time to time as the Servicer
in accordance with this Section. Until the Administrator gives notice to Church
& Dwight (in accordance with this Section) of the designation of a new Servicer,
Church & Dwight is hereby designated as, and hereby agrees to perform the duties
and obligations of, the Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof. Upon the
occurrence of a Termination Event, the Administrator may designate as Servicer
any Person (including itself) to succeed Church & Dwight or any successor
Servicer, on the condition in each case that any such Person so designated shall
agree to perform the duties and obligations of the Servicer pursuant to the
terms hereof.

         (b) Upon the designation of a successor Servicer as set forth in clause
(a), Church & Dwight agrees that it will terminate its activities as Servicer
hereunder in a manner that the Administrator determines will facilitate the
transition of the performance of such activities to the new Servicer, and Church
& Dwight shall cooperate with and assist such new Servicer. Such cooperation
shall include, to the extent permitted by law and the terms of the written
agreements between Church & Dwight and the relevant third party providers of the
licenses, hardware, software, access to and transfer of related records, and
software and use by the new Servicer of



                                      -12-
<PAGE>



all licenses, hardware or software necessary or desirable to collect the Pool
Receivables and the Related Security.

         (c) Church & Dwight acknowledges that, in making their decision to
execute and deliver this Agreement, the Administrator and the Issuer have relied
on Church & Dwight's agreement to act as Servicer hereunder. Accordingly, Church
& Dwight agrees that it will not voluntarily resign as Servicer.

         (d) The Servicer may delegate its duties and obligations hereunder to
any subservicer (each a "Sub-Servicer"); provided, that, in each such
delegation: (i) such Sub-Servicer shall agree in writing to perform the duties
and obligations of the Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof, (ii) the Servicer
shall remain primarily liable for the performance of the duties and obligations
so delegated, (iii) the Seller, the Administrator and the Issuer shall have the
right to look solely to the Servicer for performance, and (iv) the terms of any
agreement with any Sub-Servicer shall provide that the Administrator may
terminate such agreement upon the termination of the Servicer hereunder by
giving notice of its desire to terminate such agreement to the Servicer (and the
Servicer shall provide appropriate notice to each such Sub-Servicer); provided,
however, that if any such delegation is to any Person other than any Originator,
the Administrator shall have consented in writing in advance to such delegation.

         Section 4.2 Duties of the Servicer.

         (a) The Servicer shall take or cause to be taken all such action as may
be necessary or advisable to administer and collect each Pool Receivable from
time to time, all in accordance with this Agreement and all applicable laws,
rules and regulations, with reasonable care and diligence, and in accordance
with the Credit and Collection Policy The Servicer shall hold in trust (but
shall not be required to set aside or segregate), for the accounts of the Seller
and the Issuer, the amount of the Collections to which each is entitled in
accordance with Article I. The Servicer may, in accordance with the applicable
Credit and Collection Policy, extend the maturity of any Pool Receivable and
extend the maturity or adjust the Outstanding Balance of any Defaulted
Receivable as the Servicer may determine to be appropriate to maximize
Collections thereof (and take any other actions with respect to a Receivable in
accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy or make or issue credit memos,
non-cash adjustments, other reductions or adjustments on the Servicer's books
and records in order to accomplish the items listed in subclauses (i) through
(v) of clause (a) of the definition of Specific Dilution Ratio) ; provided,
however, that: for the purposes of this Agreement, (i) such extension shall not
change the number of days such Pool Receivable has remained unpaid from the
original due date related to such Pool Receivable, (ii) such extension or
adjustment shall not alter the status of such Pool Receivable as a Delinquent
Receivable or a Defaulted Receivable or limit the rights of the Issuer or the
Administrator under this Agreement and (iii) if a Termination Event has occurred
and Church & Dwight or an Affiliate thereof is serving as the Servicer, Church &
Dwight or such Affiliate may make such extension or adjustment only upon the
prior approval of the Administrator. The Seller shall deliver to the Servicer
and the Servicer shall hold for the benefit of the Seller and the Administrator
(individually and for the benefit of the Issuer), in accordance with their
respective interests, all records and documents (including computer tapes or
disks) with respect to each Pool Receivable. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Administrator may in its reasonable discretion,
subject, if no Termination Event exists



                                      -13-
<PAGE>



and is continuing, to the consent of the Servicer, not to be unreasonably
withheld, direct the Servicer (whether the Servicer is Church & Dwight or any
other Person) to commence or settle any legal action to enforce collection of
any Pool Receivable or to foreclose upon or repossess any Related Security.

         (b) The Servicer shall, as soon as practicable following actual receipt
of collected funds, turn over to the Seller the collections of any indebtedness
of the Seller that is not a Pool Receivable, less, if Church & Dwight or an
Affiliate thereof is not the Servicer, all reasonable and appropriate
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of such Servicer of servicing, collecting and
administering such collections. The Servicer, if other than Church & Dwight or
an Affiliate thereof, shall, as soon as practicable upon demand, deliver to the
Seller all records in its possession that evidence or relate to any indebtedness
of the Seller that is not a Pool Receivable, and copies of records in its
possession that evidence or relate to any indebtedness that is a Pool
Receivable.

         (c) The Servicer's obligations hereunder shall terminate on the later
of: (i) the Facility Termination Date and (ii) the date on which all amounts
required to be paid to the Issuer, the Administrator and any other Indemnified
Party or Affected Person hereunder shall have been paid in full.

         After such termination, if Church & Dwight or an Affiliate thereof was
not the Servicer on the date of such termination, the Servicer shall promptly
deliver to the Seller all books, records and related materials that the Seller
previously provided to the Servicer, or that have been obtained by the Servicer,
in connection with this Agreement.

         Section 4.3 Lock-Box Arrangements.

         Prior to the initial purchase hereunder, the Seller shall enter into
Lock-Box Agreements with all of the Lock-Box Banks and deliver original
counterparts thereof to the Administrator. Upon the occurrence of a Termination
Event, the Administrator may at any time thereafter give notice to each Lock-Box
Bank that the Administrator is exercising its rights under the Lock-Box
Agreements to do any or all of the following: (a) to have the exclusive
ownership and control of the Lock-Box Accounts transferred to the Administrator
and to exercise exclusive dominion and control over the funds deposited therein,
(b) to have the proceeds that are sent to the respective Lock-Box Accounts
redirected pursuant to the Administrator's instructions rather than deposited in
the applicable Lock-Box Account, and (c) to take any or all other actions
permitted under the applicable Lock-Box Agreement. The Seller hereby agrees that
if the Administrator at any time takes any action set forth in the preceding
sentence, the Administrator shall have exclusive control of the proceeds
(including Collections) of all Pool Receivables and the Seller hereby further
agrees to take any other action that the Administrator may reasonably request to
transfer such control. Any proceeds of Pool Receivables received by the Seller
or the Servicer thereafter shall be sent immediately to the Administrator. The
parties hereto hereby acknowledge that if at any time the Administrator takes
control of any Lock-Box Account, the Administrator shall not have any rights to
the funds therein in excess of the unpaid amounts due to the Administrator, the
Issuer or any other Person hereunder, and the Administrator shall distribute or
cause to be distributed such funds in accordance with Section 4.2(b) and Article
I (in each case as if such funds were held by the Servicer thereunder).

         Section 4.4 Enforcement Rights.

         (a) At any time following the occurrence of a Termination Event:

                  (i) the Administrator may direct the Obligors that payment of
all amounts payable under any Pool Receivable is to be made directly to the
Administrator or its designee,

                  (ii) the Administrator may instruct the Seller or the Servicer
to give notice of the Issuer's interest in Pool Receivables to each Obligor,
which notice shall direct that payments be made directly to the Administrator or
its designee, and the Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, shall give
such notice at the expense of the Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be;
provided, that if the Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, fails to so
notify each Obligor, the Administrator (at the Seller's or the Servicer's, as
the case may be, expense) may so notify the Obligors, and

                  (iii) the Administrator may request the Servicer to, and upon
such request the Servicer shall: (A) assemble all of the records necessary or
desirable to collect the Pool Receivables and the Related Security, and transfer
or license, to the extent permitted by law and the relevant licenses, to a
successor Servicer the use of all software necessary or desirable to collect the
Pool Receivables and the Related Security, and make the same available to the
Administrator or its designee at a place selected by the Administrator, and (B)
segregate all cash, checks and other instruments received by it from time to
time constituting Collections in a manner acceptable to the Administrator and,
promptly upon receipt, remit all such cash, checks and instruments, duly
endorsed or with duly executed instruments of transfer, to the Administrator or
its designee.

         (b) The Seller hereby authorizes the Administrator, and irrevocably
appoints the Administrator as its attorney-in-fact with full power of
substitution and with full authority in the place and stead of the Seller, which
appointment is coupled with an interest, to, following the occurrence of a
Termination Event, take any and all steps in the name of the Seller and on
behalf of the Seller necessary or desirable, in the determination of the
Administrator, to collect any and all amounts or portions thereof due under any
and all Pool Assets, including endorsing the name of the Seller on checks and
other instruments representing Collections and enforcing such Pool Assets.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subsection, none of
the powers conferred upon such attorney-in-fact pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall subject such attorney-in-fact to any liability if any action
taken by it, which action was not out of gross negligence or willful misconduct,
shall prove to be inadequate or invalid, nor shall they confer any obligations
upon such attorney-in-fact in any manner whatsoever.

         Section 4.5 Responsibilities of the Seller.

         (a) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Seller shall:
(i) perform all of its obligations, if any, under the Contracts related to the
Pool Receivables to the same extent as if interests in such Pool Receivables had
not been transferred hereunder, and the exercise by the Administrator or the
Issuer of their respective rights hereunder shall not relieve the Seller from
such obligations, and (ii) pay, or cause to be paid, when due any taxes,
including any sales



                                      -15-
<PAGE>



taxes payable in connection with the Pool Receivables and their creation and
satisfaction. The Administrator and the Issuer shall not have any obligation or
liability with respect to any Pool Asset, nor shall either of them be obligated
to perform any of the obligations of the Seller, Church & Dwight or any
Originator thereunder.

         (b) Church & Dwight hereby irrevocably agrees that if at any time it
shall cease to be the Servicer hereunder, it shall provide (if the then-current
Servicer so requests) data-processing functions in connection with the
administration of the Receivables and the Collections thereon in substantially
the same way that Church & Dwight conducted such data-processing functions while
it acted as the Servicer.

         Section 4.6 Servicing Fee.

         (a) Subject to clause (b), the Servicer shall be paid a fee equal to
1.00% per annum (the "Servicing Fee Rate") of the daily average aggregate
Outstanding Balance of the Pool Receivables. The Issuer's Share of such fee
shall be paid through the distributions contemplated by Section 1.4(d), and the
Seller's Share of such fee shall be paid by the Seller on each Monthly
Settlement Date.

         (b) If the Servicer ceases to be Church & Dwight or an Affiliate
thereof, the servicing fee shall be the greater of: (i) the amount calculated
pursuant to clause (a), and (ii) an alternative amount specified by the
successor Servicer not to exceed 110% of the aggregate reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by such successor Servicer in connection with the performance
of its obligations as Servicer.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         Section 5.1 Amendments, Etc.

         No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, or consent to any departure by the Seller or the Servicer
therefrom, shall be effective unless in a writing signed by the Administrator,
and, in the case of any amendment, by the other parties thereto; and then such
amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which given. No failure on the part of the
Issuer or the Administrator to exercise, and no delay in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right.

         Section 5.2 Notices, Etc.

         All notices and other communications hereunder shall, unless otherwise
stated herein, be in writing (which shall include facsimile communication ) and
be sent or delivered to each party hereto at its address set forth under its
name on the signature pages hereof or at such other address as shall he
designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties hereto.
Notices and communications by facsimile shall be effective when sent (and shall
be followed by hard copy sent by first class mail), and notices and
communications sent by other means shall be effective when received.

         Section 5.3 Assignability.

         (a) This Agreement and the Issuer's rights and obligations herein
(including ownership of the Purchased Interest or an interest therein) shall be
assignable, in whole or in part, by the Issuer and its successors and assigns
with the prior written consent of the Seller; provided, however, that such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and provided further, that no such
consent shall be required if the assignment is made to (1) PNC, (2) any
Affiliate of PNC (other than a director or officer of PNC), or (3) any Person
that is: (i) in the business of issuing Notes and (ii) associated with or
administered by PNC or any Affiliate of PNC. Each assignor may, in connection
with the assignment, disclose to the applicable assignee (that shall have agreed
to be bound by Section 5.6) any information relating to the Servicer, the Seller
or the Pool Receivables furnished to such assignor by or on behalf of the
Servicer, the Seller, the Issuer or the Administrator. The Administrator shall
give prior written notice of any assignment of the Issuer's rights and
obligations (including ownership of the Purchased Interest to any Person other
than a Program Support Provider).

         (b) The Issuer may at any time grant to one or more banks or other
institutions (each a "Purchaser") party to the Liquidity Agreement, or to any
other Program Support Provider, participating interests in the Purchased
Interest. In the event of any such grant by the Issuer of a participating
interest to a Purchaser or other Program Support Provider, the Issuer shall
remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder. The Seller
agrees that each Purchaser or other Program Support Provider shall be entitled
to the benefits of Sections 1.7 and 1.8.

         (c) This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Administrator
hereunder shall be assignable, in whole or in part, by the Administrator and its
successors and assigns; provided, that unless: (i) such assignment is to an
Affiliate of PNC, (ii) it becomes unlawful for PNC to serve as the Administrator
or (iii) a Termination Event exists, the Seller has consented to such
assignment, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         (d) Except as provided in Section 4.1 (d), none of the Seller, Church &
Dwight or the Servicer may assign its rights or delegate its obligations
hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the
Administrator.

         (e) Without limiting any other rights that may be available under
applicable law, the rights of the Issuer may be enforced through it or by its
agents.

         (f) Each assignee pursuant to clause (a) or Purchaser that is not a
"U.S. Person" as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Non-U.S.
Purchaser") shall deliver to the Seller two copies of either U.S. Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI as relevant to such party's status,
or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Purchaser claiming exemption from U.S. federal
withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to
payments of "portfolio interest", a statement to that effect and a Form W-8BEN,
or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and
duly executed by such Non-U.S. Purchaser claiming exemption from U.S. federal
withholding tax on the relevant payments made by the Seller under this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each
Non-U.S. Purchaser on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement



                                      -17-
<PAGE>



(or, in the case of any Purchaser, on or before the date such Purchaser
purchases the related participation). In addition, each Non-U.S. Purchaser shall
deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form
previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Purchaser. Each Non-U.S. Purchaser shall
promptly notify the Seller at any time it determines that it is no longer in a
position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Seller (or any
other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such
purpose).

         Section 5.4 Costs, Expenses and Taxes.

         (a) In addition to the rights of indemnification granted under Section
3.1, the Seller agrees to pay within ten (10) days after demand (which demand
shall be accompanied by documentation thereof in reasonable detail) all
reasonable costs and expenses in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery and administration (including periodic internal audits by the
Administrator of Pool Receivables) of this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents and the other documents and agreements to be delivered hereunder (and
all reasonable costs and expenses in connection with any amendment, waiver or
modification of any thereof), including: (i) Attorney Costs for the
Administrator, the Issuer and their respective Affiliates and agents with
respect thereto and with respect to advising the Administrator, the Issuer and
their respective Affiliates and agents as to their rights and remedies under
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents , and (ii) all reasonable
costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs), if any, of the Administrator, the
Issuer and their respective Affiliates and agents in connection with the
enforcement of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

         (b) In addition, the Seller shall pay within ten (10) days after demand
any and all stamp and other taxes and fees payable in connection with the
execution, delivery, filing and recording of this Agreement or the other
documents or agreements to be delivered hereunder, and agrees to save each
Indemnified Party harmless from and against any liabilities with respect to or
resulting from any delay in paying or omission to pay such taxes and fees.

         Section 5.5 No Proceedings; Limitation on Payments.

         To the maximum extent permissible by applicable law, each of the
Seller, Church & Dwight, the Servicer, the Administrator, each assignee of the
Purchased Interest or any interest therein, and each Person that enters into a
commitment to purchase the Purchased Interest or interests therein, hereby
covenants and agrees that it will not institute against, or join any other
Person in instituting against, the Issuer any bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding, or other proceeding under any
federal or state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day after the
latest maturing Note issued by the Issuer is paid in full. The provision of this
Section 5.5 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

         Section 5.6 Confidentiality.

         Each of the Seller and the Servicer agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (and all
drafts thereof) in communications with third parties and otherwise; provided,
that this Agreement may be disclosed to: (a) third parties to the extent such
disclosure is made pursuant to a written agreement of confidentiality in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrator, (b) the Seller's
legal counsel and




                                      -18-

auditors if they agree to hold it confidential, (c) to the Securities and
Exchange Commission in connection with the filings of the Servicer, (d) the
Administrative Agent and the lenders under the Credit Agreement, dated as of
September 28, 2001, among Church & Dwight Co., Inc., the lenders party thereto,
PNC Bank, National Association, Fleet National Bank, The Bank of Nova Scotia,
and National City Bank, each as syndication agent, and The Chase Manhattan Bank,
as administrative agent, provided, however, that the Fee Letter may not be
disclosed pursuant to this clause (d), and (e) as otherwise required by
applicable law; provided, however, that upon filing of any Transaction Documents
with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to clause (c), such
Transaction Documents (but not any other Transaction Documents not so filed)
shall cease to be subject to the confidentiality provisions of this sentence.
Unless otherwise required by applicable law, each of the Administrator and the
Issuer agrees to maintain the confidentiality of non-public financial
information regarding Church & Dwight and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates;
provided, that such information may be disclosed to: (i) third parties to the
extent such disclosure is considered reasonably necessary by the Administrator
or the Issuer and made pursuant to a written agreement of confidentiality in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Church & Dwight, (ii) legal
counsel and auditors of the Issuer or the Administrator if they agree to hold it
confidential, (iii) the rating agencies rating the Notes to the extent such
information relates to the Receivables Pool or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or if not so related, upon obtaining the consent of the
Servicer, not to be unreasonably withheld, (iv) any Program Support Provider or
potential Program Support Provider (if they agree to hold it confidential), (v)
any placement agent placing the Notes and (vi) any regulatory authorities having
jurisdiction over PNC, the Issuer, any Program Support Provider or any
Purchaser.

         Section 5.7 GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION.

         (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A CONTRACT MADE UNDER AND
GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING FOR SUCH

OF NEW YORK) EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE VALIDITY OR PERFECTION OF A SECURITY

         Section 5.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

         EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVES THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY

         Section 5.13 Issuer's Liabilities.

         The obligations of the Issuer under the Transaction Documents are
solely the corporate obligations of the Issuer. No recourse shall be had for any
obligation or claim arising out of or based upon any Transaction Document
against any stockholder, employee, officer, director or incorporator of the
Issuer; provided, however, that this Section shall not relieve any such Person
of any liability it might otherwise have for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

         Section 5.14 Call Option.

         The Seller shall have the right to repurchase the Purchased Interest
from the Issuer on any Settlement Date on the terms hereinafter set forth in
this Section 5.14. The Seller shall give the Administrator at least five (5)
Business Days prior written notice of such repurchase and upon payment of the
repurchase price for the Purchased Interest, as hereinafter provided, the Issuer
shall be deemed to have reconveyed the Purchased Interest to the Seller without
recourse, representation or warranty except for a representation from the Issuer
that the Purchased Interest assigned is (or concurrently with the Issuer's
receipt of such repurchase price shall become) free of any Adverse Claim created
by the Issuer. The Seller shall pay such repurchase price for the Purchased
Interest in immediately available funds to the Administrator (for the benefit of
the Issuer or the Administrator, as the case may be) in an amount equal to the
sum of (i) the Discount on the Capital related to the Purchased Interest accrued
to and including the repurchase date, (ii) the Capital in the Purchased
Interest, (iii) amounts payable pursuant to Sections 1.7 and 1.8 (of which the
Seller has notice) related to the Purchased Interest accrued to and including
the repurchase date, (iv) all other obligations that are then due and payable
and (v) if Church & Dwight is not the Servicer, the Servicing Fee allocated to
the Purchased Interest that has accrued to and including the repurchase date.

         Section 5.15 Secured Lending.

         Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto intend that this Agreement constitutes a security agreement and the
transactions effected hereby constitute secured loans by the Issuer to the
Seller under applicable laws and not a sale of the Purchased Interest.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         1. Representations and Warranties of the Seller. The Seller represents
and warrants as follows:

         (a) The Seller is a limited liability company duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and is
duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign entity in
every jurisdiction where the nature of its business requires it to be so
qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         (b) The execution, delivery and performance by the Seller of the
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, including
its use of the proceeds of purchases and reinvestments: (i) are within its
organizational powers; (ii) have been duly authorized by all necessary
organizational action; (iii) do not contravene or result in a default under or
conflict with: (A) its certificate of incorporation, formation, limited
liability company agreement or any other organizational document of the Seller,
(B) any material law, rule or regulation applicable to it, (C) any indenture,
loan agreement, mortgage, deed of trust or other material agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or by which it is bound, or (D) any material
order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree binding on or affecting it or
any of its property; and (iv) do not result in or require the creation of any
Adverse Claim upon or with respect to any of its properties. The Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party have been duly executed
and delivered by the Seller.

         (c) No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or
filing with, any Governmental Authority or other Person is required for its due
execution, delivery and performance by the Seller of the Agreement or any other
Transaction Document to which it is a party, other than the Uniform Commercial
Code filings referred to in Exhibit II to the Agreement, all of which shall be
filed within ten days after the date of the first purchase hereunder.

         (d) Each of the Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which
the Seller is a party constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation
enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other
similar laws from time to time in effect affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and by general principles of equity, regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

         (e) Except as set forth in Schedule V, there is no action, suit,
proceeding or investigation pending before any court, regulatory body,
arbitrator, administrative agency, or other tribunal or governmental
instrumentality (a) asserting the invalidity of any Transaction Document, (b)
seeking to prevent the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by

any equity security of a class that is registered pursuant to Section 12 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

         (g) The Seller is the legal and beneficial owner of, and has good title
to, the Pool Receivables, the Lock-Box Accounts (and related lock-boxes) and
Related Security, free and clear of any Adverse Claim. Upon each purchase or
reinvestment, the Issuer shall acquire a valid and enforceable perfected
undivided percentage ownership or security interest, to the extent of the
Purchased Interest, in each Pool Receivable then existing or thereafter arising
and in the Related Security, Collections and other proceeds with respect
thereto, free and clear of any Adverse Claim. The Agreement creates a valid and
continuing security interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in favor of the
Issuer in the Pool Assets and the Lock-Box Accounts (and related lock-boxes),
which security interest is prior to all other Adverse Claims, and is enforceable
as such against creditors of and purchasers from the Seller. The Receivables
constitute "accounts", "general intangibles" or "tangible chattel paper" within
the meaning of the applicable UCC. Each Lock-Box Account constitutes a "deposit
account" within the meaning of the applicable UCC. The Seller has caused or will
have caused, within ten (10) days after the first purchase hereunder, the filing
of all appropriate UCC financing statements in the proper filing offices in the
appropriate jurisdictions under applicable laws in order to perfect the security
interest in the Pool Assets and the Lock-Box Accounts (and related lock-boxes)
granted to the Issuer hereunder. Other than the security interest granted to the
Issuer pursuant to this Agreement, Seller has not pledged, assigned, sold,
granted a security interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the Pool Assets or
the Lock-Box Accounts (and related lock-boxes). Seller has not authorized the
filing of and is not aware of any UCC financing statements against Seller that
include a description of collateral covering the Pool Assets, other than any UCC
financing statement relating to the security interest granted to the Issuer
hereunder or that has been terminated. Seller is not aware of any judgment,
ERISA or tax lien filings against the Seller. With respect to any Pool
Receivable that constitutes "tangible chattel paper", the Servicer is in
possession of the original copies of the tangible chattel paper that constitutes
or evidences such Pool Receivables, and the Seller has filed or will cause to be
filed within ten (10) days after the date hereof the financing statements
described in this section above, each of which will contain a statement that "A
purchase of or a grant of a security interest in any property described in this
financing statement will violate the rights of the Issuer." The Pool Receivables
to the extent they are evidenced by "tangible chattel paper" do not have any
marks or notations indicating that they have been pledged, assigned or otherwise
conveyed to any Person other than the Seller or the Issuer.

         (h) Each Information Package (if prepared by the Seller or one of its
Affiliates, or to the extent that information contained therein is supplied by
the Seller or an Affiliate), information, exhibit, financial statement,
document, book, record or report furnished or to be furnished at any time by or

Lock-Box Bank has agreed, following the occurrence and continuation of a
Termination Event, to comply with all instructions given by the Administrator
with respect to all funds on deposit in such Lock-Box Account (and all funds

into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents in reliance upon the Seller's identity as a legal entity separate from
Church & Dwight and its Affiliates. Therefore, from and after the date hereof,
each of the Seller and Church & Dwight shall take all steps specifically
required by the Agreement or reasonably required by the Administrator to
continue the Seller's identity as a separate legal entity and to make it
apparent to third Persons that the Seller is an entity with assets and
liabilities distinct from those of Church & Dwight and any other Person, and is
not a division of Church & Dwight, its Affiliates or any other Person. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and in addition to and consistent with
the other covenants set forth herein, each of the Seller and Church & Dwight
shall take such actions as shall be required in order that:

         (a) The Seller will be a limited purpose entity whose primary
activities are restricted in its operating agreement to: (i) purchasing or
otherwise acquiring from the Originator (or their Affiliates), owning, holding,
granting security interests or selling interests in Pool Assets (or other
receivables originated by the Originator or their Affiliates, and certain
related assets), (ii) entering into agreements for the selling and servicing of
the Receivables Pool (or other receivables pools originated by the Originator or
their Affiliates), and (iii) conducting such other activities as it deems
necessary or appropriate to carry out its primary activities;

         (b) The Seller shall not engage in any business or activity, or incur
any indebtedness or liability, other than as expressly permitted by the
Transaction Documents;

         (c) Not less than one member of the Seller's Directors (the
"Independent Director") shall be an individual who is not a direct, indirect or
beneficial stockholder, officer, director, employee, affiliate, associate or
supplier of Church & Dwight or any of its Affiliates. The operating agreement of
the Seller shall provide that: (i) the Seller's Board of Directors shall not
approve, or take any other action to cause the filing of, a voluntary bankruptcy
petition with respect to the Seller unless the Independent Director shall
approve the taking of such action in writing before the taking of such action,
and (ii) such provision cannot be amended without the prior written consent of
the Independent Director;

         (d) The Independent Director shall not at any time serve as a trustee
in bankruptcy for the Seller, Church & Dwight or any Affiliate thereof;


                                      IV-9
<PAGE>


         (e) Any employee, consultant or agent of the Seller will be compensated
from the Seller's funds for services provided to the Seller. The Seller will not
engage any agents other than its attorneys, auditors and other professionals,
and a servicer and any other agent contemplated by the Transaction Documents for
the Receivables Pool, which servicer will be fully compensated for its services
by payment of the Servicing Fee, and a manager, which manager will be fully
compensated from the Seller's funds. Church & Dwight shall not enter into, or be
a party to, any transaction with the Seller, except in the ordinary course of
its business and on terms which are intrinsically fair and not less favorable to
it than would be obtained in a comparable arm's-length transaction with an
unrelated third party;

         (f) The Seller will contract with the Servicer to perform for the
Seller all operations required on a daily basis to service the Receivables Pool.
The Seller will pay the Servicer the Servicing Fee pursuant hereto. To the
extent, if any, that the Seller (or any Affiliate thereof) shares items of
expenses not reflected in the Servicing Fee or the manager's fee, such as legal,
auditing and other professional services, such expenses will be allocated to the
extent practical on the basis of actual use or the value of services rendered,
and otherwise on a basis reasonably related to the actual use or the value of
services rendered; it being understood that Church & Dwight shall pay all
expenses relating to the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of the
Transaction Documents, including legal, agency and other fees;

         (g) The Seller's operating expenses will not be paid by Church & Dwight
or any other Affiliate thereof;

         (h) All of the Seller's business correspondence and other
communications shall be conducted in the Seller's own name and on its own
separate stationery;

         (i) The Seller's books and records will be maintained separately from
those of Church & Dwight and any other Affiliate thereof;

         (j) All financial statements of Church & Dwight or any Affiliate
thereof that are consolidated to include Seller will contain detailed notes
clearly stating that: (i) a special purpose entity exists as a Subsidiary of
Church & Dwight, and (ii) the Originator have sold receivables and other related
assets to such special purpose Subsidiary that, in turn, has sold undivided
interests therein to certain financial institutions and other entities;

         (k) The Seller's assets will be maintained in a manner that facilitates
their identification and segregation from those of Church & Dwight or any
Affiliate thereof;

         (l) The Seller will strictly observe organizational formalities in its
dealings with Church & Dwight or any Affiliate thereof, and funds or other
assets of the Seller will not be commingled with those of Church & Dwight or any
Affiliate thereof except as permitted by the Agreement in connection with
servicing the Pool Receivables. The Seller shall not maintain joint bank
accounts or other depository accounts to which Church & Dwight or any Affiliate
thereof has independent access. The Seller is not named, and has not entered
into any agreement to be named, directly or indirectly, as a direct or
contingent beneficiary or loss payee on any insurance policy with respect to any
loss relating to the property of Church & Dwight or any Subsidiary or other
Affiliate of Church & Dwight. The Seller will pay to the appropriate


                                     IV-10
<PAGE>


Affiliate the marginal increase or, in the absence of such increase, the market
amount of its portion of the premium payable with respect to any insurance
policy that covers the Seller and such Affiliate;

         (m) The Seller will maintain arm's-length relationships with Church &
Dwight (and any Affiliate thereof). Any Person that renders or otherwise
furnishes services to the Seller will be compensated by the Seller at market
rates for such services it renders or otherwise furnishes to the Seller. Neither
the Seller nor Church & Dwight will be or will hold itself out to be responsible
for the debts of the other or the decisions or actions respecting the daily
business and affairs of the other. The Seller and Church & Dwight will
immediately correct any known misrepresentation with respect to the foregoing,
and they will not operate or purport to operate as an integrated single economic
unit with respect to each other or in their dealing with any other entity; and

         (n) Church & Dwight shall not pay the salaries of Seller's employees,
if any.

unstayed for a period of 60 days, or


                                       V-1
<PAGE>


any of the actions sought in such proceeding (including the entry of an order
for relief against, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or
other similar official for, it or for any substantial part of its property)

                                      V-2

condition, together with all other such events or conditions, if any, would, in
