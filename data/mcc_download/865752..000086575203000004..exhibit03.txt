Dear Pat:

I refer to our  discussions  regarding  the  proposed  installation  by you of a

equipment  that will be  installed  and  utilized in that line,  whilst you have
agreed to acquire,  install and utilize the minimum equipment necessary for that
line  and  have  to  undertaken   responsibility   for  the   installation   and
