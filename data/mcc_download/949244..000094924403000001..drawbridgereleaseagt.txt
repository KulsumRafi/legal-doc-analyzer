agree as follows:

(a)	Until Drawbridge shall have received the Target Value or
shall own less than five percent (5%) of the shares of outstanding ALTM
Stock, Drawbridge shall have the right, but not the obligation, to have
one representative present (whether in person or by telephone) at all
meetings of the board of directors of ALTM.  ALTM shall send to such

efforts to identify potential purchasers of blocks of the Drawbridge
Shares at a price per share not less than 85% of Market Price and on
terms and conditions acceptable to Drawbridge in its sole and absolute
discretion and to introduce such potential purchasers to Drawbridge;
provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall require ALTM to

dealer (as such term is used in the Exchange Act) or obtain any
license(s) to act as a broker-dealer under any federal or state
securities law(s), rule(s), or regulation(s) or (ii) would otherwise
subject ALTM to any federal or state law(s), rule(s), or regulation(s)
applicable to broker-dealers (or similar term(s) having substantially
the same meaning as the term broker-dealer and/or describing Person(s)
functioning or acting in a capacity similar to a broker-dealer).

(c)	Until Drawbridge shall have received the Target Value or
sold all of the Drawbridge Shares, Drawbridge shall have the right to
exercise or refrain from exercising any and all voting rights incident

February 18, 2005 and February 18, 2006, Drawbridge shall be obligated
to sell and ALTM shall be obligated to purchase a number of the
Drawbridge Shares, so that the product of the number of Drawbridge
Shares to be purchased and sold multiplied by the Market Value of such
Drawbridge Shares equals $100,000; provided that if on the required
date of purchase the number of Drawbridge Shares to be purchased and
sold pursuant to this Section 5.02(d) is greater than the number of

number of Drawbridge Shares then held by Drawbridge.  Drawbridge shall
surrender the Drawbridge Shares to be purchased by ALTM to ALTM against
payment by ALTM by wire transfer to the account set forth on the

Shares are being repurchased by ALTM, ALTM shall cancel the Drawbridge
Shares and issue in the name of, and deliver to, Drawbridge a
replacement stock certificate for the portion of Drawbridge Shares not
being repurchased.  ALTM, by prior written notice to Drawbridge, may
designate one or more persons or entities to purchase the shares ALTM
is required to purchase under this clause (d) of Section 5.02, however,
such designation shall not release, amend, modify, compromise, alter or
terminate the duty and obligation of ALTM to purchase such shares or
its liability for failure to comply with this clause (d) of Section
5.02.

(e)	Until Drawbridge shall have received the Target Value or
sold all of the Drawbridge Shares, none of K2VC, Khan, nor any existing
or hereafter appointed or elected member of the board of directors nor
any Family Member or Affiliate of an appointed or elected member of the
board of directors of ALTM or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in
the Act) (other than Middlewest Ventures II, LP) (the "Restricted
Stockholders") shall sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise
dispose of (whether with or without consideration and whether
voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law) any interest in
any shares of ALTM Stock now or hereafter acquired by such Restricted
Stockholder ("Restricted Shares"); provided that K2VC shall be entitled
to transfer some or all of its shares of ALTM Stock to settle any
existing litigation indemnified by K2VC and/or Khan.  ALTM shall cause
each current member of the board of directors of ALTM to execute the
joinder agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A within
thirty (30) days of the date of this Agreement.  Promptly upon the
election or appointment of any person to serve as a director of ALTM
that is not a party to this Agreement, ALTM shall cause such person to
become a party to this Agreement by executing and delivering to
Drawbridge a joinder agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A
within thirty (30) days after such election or appointment.  Unless
specifically released in writing by Drawbridge, any person who becomes
a Restricted Stockholder shall remain a Restricted Stockholder and all
Restricted Shares shall remain Restricted Shares for all purposes of
this Agreement; provided, however, that if any such Restricted
Stockholder, for any reason, ceases to be a director of ALTM or any of
its Subsidiaries, then on the date that is 180 days after the date such
Restricted Stockholder ceases to be a director, such Restricted
Stockholder, and any and all Family Members and Affiliates of such
Restricted Stockholder, shall no longer be deemed to be a Restricted

sold all of the Drawbridge Shares, ALTM shall not issue any additional
ALTM Stock or any options, warrants or other securities convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for ALTM Stock without the prior
written consent of Drawbridge, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld; provided that this Section 5.02(f) shall not apply to (i) the
issuance of the Drawbridge Shares, (ii) shares of ALTM Stock issued by
ALTM to Khan pursuant to the stock option agreement, dated as of the
date hereof, as in effect on the date hereof, attached hereto as
Exhibit B, (iii) shares of ALTM Stock issued to directors or employees
of ALTM pursuant to the 1995 Long-Term Incentive and Stock Option Plan
as in effect on the date hereof or the Outside Directors and Advisors
Stock Option Plan as in effect on the date hereof, and (iv) shares of
ALTM Stock issued for cash consideration per share equal to or greater
than Market Value; provided that additional shares of ALTM Stock shall
be issued to Drawbridge in connection with any issuance of ALTM Stock
pursuant to this clause (iv), so that upon receipt of such additional
shares Drawbridge shall own the same percentage of outstanding shares
of ALTM Stock as it did immediately prior to such issuance.
