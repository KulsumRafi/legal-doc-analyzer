                                    GUARANTY

For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, and to induce you, at your option, to make loans engage in
any other transactions with borrower from time to time. I absolutely and
unconditionally guarantee the full payment of the following debts (as defined
herein) when due (whether at maturity or on acceleration):

PRESENT DEBT GUARANTY

__x_ I absolutely and unconditionally guarantee to you the payment and
performance of the following described debt (including all renewals, extensions,
refinancings and modifications) of the borrower: LOAN #27543768 DATED 08/23/00
FOR $296,138.75.

PRESENT AND FUTURE DEBT GUARANTY

____ I absolutely and unconditionally guarantee to you the payment and
performance of each and every debt, of every type and description, that the
borrower may now or at any time in the future owe you including, but not limited
to, the following described
debt(s):_______________________________________________________________________

____ I absolutely and unconditionally guarantee to you the payment and
performance of each and every debt, of every type and description, that the
borrower may now or at any time in the future owe to you, up to the principal
amount of $________ plus accrued interest, attorneys' fees and collection costs
referable thereto (when permitted by law), and all other amounts agreed to be
paid under all agreements evidencing the debt and securing the payment of the
debt. You may, without notice, apply this guaranty to such debts of the borrower
as you may select from time to time.

DEFINTIONS - As used in this agreement, the terms "I," "we," and "my" mean all
persons signing this guaranty agreement, individually and jointly, and their
heirs, executors, administrators and assigns.

         The term "debt" means all debts, liabilities, and obligation of the
borrower (including, but not limited to, all amounts agreed to be paid under the
terms of any notes or agreements securing the payment of any debt, liability or
obligation, overdrafts, letters of credit, guaranties, advances for taxes,
insurance, repairs and storage, and all extensions, renewals, refinancings and
modifications of these debts) whether now existing or created or incurred in the
future, due ro to become due, or absolute or contingent, except for any
obligations incurred by borrower after the date of this guaranty for which the
borrower meets your standard of creditworthiness based on the borrower's own
assets and income without the addition of a guaranty, or to which, although you
require the addition of a guaranty, the borrower chooses someone other than me
to guaranty the obligation.

APPLICABLE LAW - This agreement is governed by the law of the state in which you
are located. Any term of this agreement that does not comply with applicable law
will not be effective if that law does not expressly or impliedly permit
variations by agreement. If any part of this agreement cannot be enforced
according to its terms, this fact will not affect the balance of this agreement.

REVOCATION - I agree that this is an absolute and continuing guaranty. If this
guaranty is limited to the payment of a specific debt of the borrower described
above, this agreement cannot be revoked and will remain in effect until the debt
is paid in full. If this guaranty covers both the borrower's present and future
debts, I agree that this guaranty will remain binding on me, whether or not
there are any debts outstanding, until you have actually received written notice
of my revocation or written notice of my death or incompetence.

         Notice of revocation or notice of my death or incompetence will not
affect my obligations under this guaranty with respect to any debts incurred by
or for which you have made a commitment to borrower before you actually receive
such notice, and all renewals, extensions, refinancings and modifications of
such debts. I agree that if any other person signing this agreement provides a
notice of revocation to you, I will still be obligated under this agreement
until I provide a notice of revocation to you. If any other person signing this
agreement dies or is declared incompetent, such fact will not affect my
obligations under this agreement.

OBLIGATIONS INDEPENDENT _ I agree that I am obligated to pay according to the
terms of this guaranty even if any other person has agreed to pay the borrower's
debt. My obligation to pay according to the terms of this guaranty shall not be
affected by the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any notes or
agreements evidencing the debt, the violation of any applicable usury laws,
forgery or any other circumstances which make the indebtedness unenforceable
against the borrower.

         I will remain obligated to pay on this guaranty even if any other
person who is obligated to pay the borrower's debt, including the borrower, has
such obligation discharged in bankruptcy, foreclosure or otherwise discharged by
law. In such situations, my obligation shall include post-bankruptcy petition
interest and attorneys' fees and other amounts which borrower is discharged from
paying or which do not otherwise accrue to borrower's indebtedness due to
borrower's discharge. I will also be obligated to pay you, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any deficiency remaining after foreclosure of any mortgage or
security interest securing borrower's debt, whether or not the liability of
borrower or any other obligor for such deficiencies discharged by statute or
judicial decision, or are in any way recouped or recovered from you

<PAGE>

for any reason (including, without limitation, the bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization of borrower or any other obligor) then I am obligated to
reimburse or indemnify you for the full amount you so pay together with costs,
interest, attorneys' fees and all other expenses which you incur in connection
therewith. I also agree that if my liability is limited to a stated principal
amount (plus other agreed charges), you may allow the borrower to incur debt in
excess of the specified amount and apply to the payment of such excess any
amounts you received for payment of the debt from the borrower or any other
person, any amounts resulting from any collateral or amounts received from any
other source, without affecting my obligations under this agreement.

         No modification of this agreement is effective unless in writing and
signed by you and me, except that you may, without notice to me and without the
addition of a signed writing or my approval: (1) release any borrower or other
person who may be liable for borrower's debt, (2) release or substitute any
collateral, (3) fail to perfect any security interest or otherwise impair any
collateral, (4) waive or impair any right you may have against any borrower or
other person who may be liable for borrower's debt, (5) settle or compromise any
claim against the borrower or any person who may be liable for the borrower's
debt, (6) procure any additional security or persons who agree to be liable for
borrower's debt, (7) delay or fail to pursue enforcement of the debt, (8) apply
amounts you receive from the borrower or other persons to payment of the debt in
any order you select, (9) make any election with respect to the debt provided by
law or any agreement with any person liable for the debt, (10)exercise or fail
to exercise any rights you have with respect to the debt, (11) extend new credit
to the borrower, or (12) renew, extend, refinance or modify the borrower's debt
on any terms agreed to by you and the borrower (including, but not limited to,
changes in the interest rate or in the method, time, place or amount of payment)
without affecting my obligation to pay under this Guaranty.

WAIVER - I waive presentment, demand, protest notice of dishonor, and notice of
acceptance of this guaranty. I also waive, to the extent permitted by law, all
notices, all defenses and claims that the borrower could assert any right to
require you to pursue any remedy or seek payment from any other person before
seeking payment under this agreement, and all other defenses to the debt, except
payment in full. You may without notice to me and without my consent, enter into
agreements with the borrower from time to time for purposes of creating or
continuing the borrower's debt as allowed by this guaranty. I agree that I will
be liable, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, for any deficiency
remaining after foreclosure (or repossession) and sale of any collateral without
regard to whether borrower's obligation to pay such deficiency is discharged by
law. If any payments on the debt are set aside, recovered or required to be
returned in the event of the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the
borrower, my obligations under this agreement will continue as if such payments
had never been made.

         I also waive and relinquish all present and future claims, rights and
remedies against borrower or any other obligated party arising out of the
creation or my performance of this guaranty. My waiver includes, but is not
limited to, the right of contribution, reimbursement, indemnification,
subrogation, exoneration and any right to participate in any claim or remedy you
may have against the borrower, collateral or other party obligated for
borrower's debts, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity,
or under contract, statute or common law.

REMEDIES - If I fail to keep any promise contained in this agreement or any
agreement securing this agreement, you may make this agreement and the
borrower's debt immediately due and payable, you may set-off this obligation
against any right I have to receive money from you (however, you may not set-off
against any accounts in which my rights are only as a fiduciary or my IRA or
other tax-deferred retirement account), you may use any remedy you have under
state or federal law, and you may use any remedy given to you by any agreement
securing this agreement. If I die, am declared incompetent or become insolvent
(either because my liabilities exceed my assets or because I am unable to pay my
debts as they become due), you may make the debt immediately due and payable.

COLLECTION COSTS - Except when prohibited by law, I agree to pay the reasonable
costs and expenses you incur to enforce and collect this agreement, including
attorneys' fees and court costs.

SECURITY - This guaranty is ___ unsecured  ___ secured by ____________________.
