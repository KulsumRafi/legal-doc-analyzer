                               SECOND AMENDMENT TO
                      AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT

         THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT
("Amendment") is made and entered into this 31st day of October, 2002, but
effective as of September 10, 2002 (the "Amendment Date"), by and among XETA
Technologies, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation (the "Borrower"), Bank One,
Oklahoma, N.A., and U.S. Bank National Association, as Lenders under the Credit
Agreement referred to below (the "Lenders"), and Bank One, Oklahoma, N.A., as
Agent (in such capacity, the "Agent"), with reference to the following:

         A. The Borrower, the Lenders and the Agent are parties to that certain
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of October 31, 2001, as amended
by that certain First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated
effective as of June 1, 2002 (the "Credit Agreement").

         B. The Borrower has requested that the Lenders and the Agent (i) extend
the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and the maturities of the
Revolving Loans, the Term Loans and the R/E Term Loans, (ii) waive certain
Defaults arising by virtue of the Borrower's failure to comply with certain
financial covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement at July 31, 2002, (iii)
modify certain covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement, and (iv) agree to
certain other changes in the terms of the Credit Agreement and the Facilities
established thereunder. The Lenders and the Agent have agreed to the foregoing
requests, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Amendment.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants and agreements herein contained, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereby amend the Credit Agreement, effective as of the Amendment Date,
as follows:

1. DEFINITIONS. Capitalized terms used herein (including capitalized terms used
in the recitals above) but not otherwise defined have the respective meanings
assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.

2. WAIVERS. Effective as of the Amendment Date, and subject to the Borrower's
satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 6 of this
Amendment, the Lenders and the Agent agree to waive the Borrower's
non-compliance with Sections 6.24.2 (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) and 6.24.3
(Leverage Ratio) of the Credit Agreement at July 31, 2002, and any consequences
of such non-compliance (other than as set forth in this Amendment). The
foregoing waivers do not extend to any other existing Default or Unmatured
Default (whether or not known to the Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent) or to
any Default or Unmatured Default that may arise or occur after the Amendment
Date. Nothing contained in this Amendment shall be construed as waiving any
other term or condition of the Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents or as obligating the Lenders or the Agent to waive any future
noncompliance or Default.

3. MODIFICATION OF FACILITIES. Effective as of the Amendment Date, and subject
to the Borrower's satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in this
Amendment:

         A. Extension of Revolving Credit Facility. The availability of the
Revolving Credit Facility and the maturity of the Revolving Loans are hereby
extended to November 30, 2002. Accordingly, the definition of the term
"Revolving Credit Facility Termination Date" appearing in Section 1.1 of the
Credit Agreement is hereby amended by replacing the reference to the date
"October 31, 2002" with the date "November 30, 2002."

         B. Reduction in Revolving Credit Facility. The Aggregate Revolving
Credit Commitment (i.e., the aggregate amount available for borrowing under the
Revolving Credit Facility) is hereby reduced from $5,000,000.00 to
$2,000,000.00, and the Revolving Commitment of each of the Lenders is hereby
reduced to the amount set forth opposite its name on the signature pages hereto
directly underneath the caption "Revolving Credit Commitment."

         C. Extension of Maturities of Term Loans and R/E Term Loans. The
maturity dates of the Term Notes and the R/E Term Notes are hereby extended to
November 30, 2003. Accordingly, the reference to the date "October 31, 2003"

         D. No Obligation to Grant Further Extensions. The Borrower acknowledges
that, notwithstanding the references in the Credit Agreement and this Amendment
to dates or periods of time subsequent to November 30, 2002, (i) the Lenders
will not be obligated to further extend the availability of the Revolving Credit
Facility or the maturities of the Revolving Loans, the Term Loans or the R/E
Term Loans, (ii) the Lenders have given no assurances or commitment that any
extension request will be approved, (iii) the Lenders may refuse any extension
request in the exercise of their sole and absolute discretion, and (iv) if any
extension request is approved, the Lenders may condition such approval on the
Borrower's satisfaction of certain requirements, including the making of further

each Lender (i) a renewal Revolving Note (each, a "Renewal Revolving Note"),

of, the respective Notes delivered pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and from
and after the Amendment Date, unless the context otherwise requires, all
references to the "Revolving Notes," the "Term Notes" or the "R/E Term Notes"
appearing in the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Documents shall mean and
refer to the Renewal Revolving Notes, the Renewal Term Notes or the Renewal R/E

4. CALCULATION OF BORROWING BASE.

         A. Borrowing Base. Effective as of the Amendment Date, the definition
of term "Borrowing Base" appearing in Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is
amended to read in its entirety as follows:

                  "Borrowing Base" means, as of any determination date, an
         amount equal to (i) 80% of the Eligible Accounts Balance on such date,
         plus (ii) 40% of the Eligible Inventory Balance on such date, minus
         (iii) 25% of the aggregate outstanding principal balances of the Term
         Loans as of such date; provided, however, that the amount determined
         under clause (ii) shall be limited to one-fourth (1/4) of the amount
         determined under clause (i).

         B. Form of Borrowing Base Certificate. The form of Borrowing Base
Certificate attached hereto as Exhibit C-1 shall be substituted for Exhibit C to
the Credit Agreement.

5. AMENDMENTS TO CERTAIN COVENANTS. From and after the Amendment Date, the
covenants contained in the Credit Agreement shall be amended and modified as
follows:

         A. Definition of Capital Expenditures. The calculation of Consolidated
Capital Expenditures, both for purposes of Section 6.16 (Capital Expenditures)
and Section 6.24.2 (Debt Service Coverage Ratio), shall include all Capital
Expenditures incurred by the Borrower on or after September 1, 2002, relating to
the Oracle computer systems. Accordingly, the definition of the term
"Consolidated Capital Expenditures" appearing in Section 1.1 of the Credit
Agreement is amended in its entirety, effective from and after the Amendment
Date, to read as follows:

                  "Consolidated Capital Expenditures" means, with reference to
         any period, the Capital Expenditures of the Borrower and its
         Subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis for such period;
         provided, however, that the calculation of Consolidated Capital
         Expenditures shall exclude any Capital Expenditures relating to the
         Oracle computer systems incurred prior to September 1, 2002.

         B. Limitation on Capital Expenditures. Section 6.16 of the Credit
Agreement is amended in its entirety to read as follows:

                  6.16 Capital Expenditures. The Borrowers and its Subsidiaries
         will not expend, or become committed to expend, in any fiscal year,
         beginning with the fiscal year ended October 31, 2002, on a
         noncumulative basis, Consolidated Capital Expenditures in excess of
         $1,200,000.

         C. Debt Service Coverage Ratio. The calculation of Consolidated Debt
Service Coverage Ratio, and the determination of the Borrower's compliance with
Section 6.24.2 of the Credit Agreement, are modified as follows:




                                       3
<PAGE>

                  (i) The Borrower agrees to maintain a Consolidated Debt
         Service Coverage Ratio, determined as of October 31, 2002, for the four
         fiscal quarters then ending, of not less than 1.00 to 1.0. Thereafter,
         the Borrower agrees to maintain a Consolidated Debt Service Coverage
         Ratio, determined as of each Quarterly Calculation Date subsequent to
         October 31, 2002, for the then most-recently ended four fiscal
         quarters, of not less than 1.20 to 1.0.

                   (ii) In addition, for the calculations made at October 31,
         2002, January 31, 2003 and April 30, 2003, the Debt Service Coverage
         Ratio of the Borrower will be determined by annualizing the results of
         operations for the period beginning August 1, 2002, and ending on each
         of such determination dates, rather than by using the actual results of
         operations on a trailing 12-month basis. Accordingly, for the Quarterly
         Calculation Dates of October 31, 2002, January 31, 2003 and April 30,
         2003, the first sentence of the definition of "Consolidated Debt
         Service Coverage Ratio" appearing in Section 1.1 of the Credit
         Agreement will be modified to read as follows:

                           "Consolidated Debt Service Coverage Ratio" means, for
                  the Quarterly Calculation Dates of October 31, 2002, January
                  31, 2003 and April 30, 2003, respectively, the ratio of (i)
                  Consolidated EBIDA, calculated on a pro forma annualized
                  basis, for the period beginning August 1, 2002, and ending on
                  such Quarterly Calculation Date, minus unfunded Consolidated
                  Capital Expenditures for the same period, calculated on a pro
                  forma annualized basis, to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense,
                  calculated on a pro forma annualized basis for the same
                  period, plus the current maturities of long-term Consolidated
                  Funded Indebtedness for the immediately following 12-month
                  period, in each case calculated for the Borrower and its
                  Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

         Beginning with the calculation to be made at July 31, 2003, the
         Consolidated Debt Service Coverage Ratio shall be calculated in the
         manner as currently set forth in the Credit Agreement (except that the
         change in the definition of Consolidated Capital Expenditures, as set
         forth in Section 5.A above, shall be permanent).

         D. Net Income Requirement. Effective as of the Amendment Date, a new
Section 6.24.5 is hereby added to the Credit Agreement reading as follows:

                           6.24.5 Consolidated Net Income. The Borrower will not
                  permit the sum of (i) Consolidated Net Income for any fiscal
                  quarter plus (ii) non-cash writedowns of goodwill taken for
                  the same quarter in accordance with the applicable accounting
                  standards under GAAP, to be less than $1.00.

In addition, Section 7.3 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to include a
reference to the newly added Section 6.24.5.




                                       4

         E. Restriction on Dividends. The Borrower acknowledges that it is
prohibited by Section 6.10 of the Credit Agreement from declaring or paying any
dividends or making any distributions on its capital stock (other than dividends
payable in its own capital stock) or redeeming, repurchasing or otherwise
acquiring or retiring any of its capital stock. The Borrower further agrees that
such prohibition will remain in effect, notwithstanding proviso (ii) to Section
6.10 of the Credit Agreement, until further notice from the Lenders.

6. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT. This Amendment shall become effective as of the
Amendment Date, subject to the Borrower's satisfaction of the following

the execution and delivery of this Amendment. The Borrower further represents
and warrants as follows:

         A. Authority. The Borrower has all requisite power and authority and

Credit Commitment and to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Amendment, the Credit Agreement (as amended by this Amendment) and the Renewal

         B. Binding Obligations; Enforceability. This Amendment, the Credit

or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

         C. No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and delivery
by the Borrower of this Amendment and the Renewal Notes, nor the consummation of
the transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions
thereof, will violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
or (ii) the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's articles or certificate of

or constitute a default thereunder, or result in, or require, the creation or
imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of the Borrower or any of its

agreement. No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or
validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or
other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any
subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Amendment,

Agent and the Lenders), there has been no adverse change in the business,
Property, prospects, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

8. MISCELLANEOUS.

incorporated into and form a part of the Credit Agreement. Except as amended,
modified and supplemented by this Amendment, the Credit Agreement shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its original stated terms, all of
which are hereby reaffirmed in every respect as of the date hereof. In
