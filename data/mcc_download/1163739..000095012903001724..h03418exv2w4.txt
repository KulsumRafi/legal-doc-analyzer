                  issuable pursuant to the Arrangement, and (ii) Acquiror Shares
                  issuable upon exchange of the Exchangeable Shares from time to
                  time without qualification with, or approval of, or the filing
                  of any prospectus or similar document, or undertaking, from,
                  any Canadian Governmental Entity under any Canadian federal,
                  provincial or territorial securities or other laws or pursuant
                  to the rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity
                  administering such laws, or the fulfilment of any other legal
                  requirement in any such jurisdiction (other than, with respect
                  to such first resale being from the holdings of a "CONTROL
                  PERSON" for purposes of Canadian Securities Laws).

         (b)      Acquiror agrees to file a registration statement on Form S-3
                  (or other applicable form) (the "S-3 REGISTRATION STATEMENT")
                  with the SEC in order to register under the U.S. Securities
                  Act the Acquiror Shares issuable from time to time after the
                  Effective Time upon exchange of the Exchangeable Shares, and
                  shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the S-3
                  Registration Statement to become effective and to maintain the
                  effectiveness of such registration so long as any Exchangeable
                  Shares remain outstanding (other than those Exchangeable
                  Shares held by Acquiror or any of its affiliates).

2.9      PREPARATION OF FILINGS

         (a)      Acquiror and the Corporation shall, acting reasonably and
                  promptly in the circumstances, cooperate in:

                  (i)      the preparation of the Proxy Circular and any
                           application for the orders and the preparation of any
                           required registration statements and any other
                           documents reasonably deemed by Acquiror or the
                           Corporation to be necessary to discharge their
                           respective obligations under Securities Laws in
                           connection with the Arrangement and the other
                           transactions contemplated hereby;

                  (ii)     the taking of all such action as may be required
                           under any applicable Securities Laws (including "blue
                           sky laws") in connection with the issuance of the
                           Exchangeable Shares and Acquiror Shares in connection
                           with the Arrangement; provided, however, that with
                           respect to the United States "blue sky" and Canadian
                           provincial qualifications neither Acquiror nor the
                           Corporation shall be required to register or qualify
                           as a foreign corporation or to take any action that
                           would subject it to service of process in any
                           jurisdiction where such entity is not now so subject,
                           except as to matters and transactions arising solely
                           from the offer and sale of the Exchangeable Shares
                           and Acquiror Shares; and

                  (iii)    the taking of all such action as may be required
                           under the Act in connection with the transactions
                           contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan of
                           Arrangement.

         (b)      Each of Acquiror and the Corporation agree to promptly furnish
                  to the other all information concerning it, Canco, the
                  Shareholders and the Optionholders as may be required to give
                  effect to the actions described in Sections 2.7 and 2.8 and
                  the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.9, and each
                  covenants that no information furnished by it (to its
                  knowledge in the case of information concerning its
                  shareholders) in connection with such actions or otherwise in
                  connection with the consummation of the Arrangement and the
                  other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will contain
                  any misrepresentation or any untrue statement of a material
                  fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in
                  any such document or necessary in order to make any
                  information so furnished for use in any such document not
                  misleading in the light of the circumstances in which it is
                  furnished.

         (c)      Each of Acquiror and the Corporation agree to promptly notify
                  the other if at any time before or after the Effective Time it
                  becomes aware that the Proxy Circular or an application for an
                  order or a registration statement described in Section 2.8
                  contains any misrepresentation or any untrue statement of a
                  material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be
                  stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained
                  therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which
                  they are made, or that otherwise requires an amendment or
                  supplement to the Proxy Circular or such application or
                  registration statement. In any such event, Acquiror and the
                  Corporation agree to cooperate in the preparation of a
                  supplement or amendment to the Proxy Circular or such other
                  document, as required and as the case may be, and, if
                  required, shall cause the same to be distributed to the
                  Shareholders and Optionholders or filed with the relevant
                  securities regulatory authorities.

         (d)      The Corporation shall ensure that the Proxy Circular complies
                  with all applicable laws and, without limiting the generality
                  of the foregoing, that the Proxy Circular does not contain any
                  misrepresentation or any untrue statement of a material fact
                  or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
                  or necessary to make the statements contained there not
                  misleading in light of the circumstances in which they are
                  made (other than with respect to any information relating to
                  and provided by Acquiror). Without limiting the generality of
                  the foregoing, the Corporation shall ensure that the Proxy
                  Circular complies with OSC Rule 54-501 and the Interim Order
                  and provides Shareholders and Optionholders with information
                  in sufficient detail to permit them to form a reasoned
                  judgement concerning the matters to be placed before them at
                  the Shareholder Meeting. The Corporation shall ensure that
                  none of the information supplied or to be supplied by the
                  Corporation for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
                  S-3 Registration Statement will at the time such registration
                  statement is declared or becomes effective contain any untrue
                  statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact
                  required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
                  the statements made therein in light of the circumstances
                  under which they were made not misleading. The Corporation
                  will take all reasonable steps within its control to ensure
                  that the Proxy Circular is prepared as to form in all material


<PAGE>
                                      -14-


                  respects in compliance with the provisions of the Act and
                  Canadian Securities Laws.

         (e)      Acquiror shall ensure that the S-3 Registration Statement
                  complies with all U.S. Securities Laws and, without limiting
                  the generality of the foregoing, that such documents do not
                  contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
                  state a material fact required to be stated therein or
                  necessary to make the statements contained therein not
                  misleading in light of the circumstances in which they are
                  made (other than with respect to any information relating to
                  and provided by the Corporation).

                           consent except as required by applicable laws, or in
                           the case of adjournment, if a Material Adverse Change
                           or Material Adverse Effect occurs in the affairs of

                           otherwise eligible for such treatment.

                           efforts to cause such Acquiror Shares to be approved
                           for listing on the American Stock Exchange, subject

having jurisdiction over the Corporation.

2.12     OUTSTANDING RIGHTS TO ACQUIRE SHARES

         The Corporation agrees and represents that the Board of Directors has
unanimously resolved that:

         (a)      The Corporation shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
                  to provide that Persons holding Options who may do so under
                  Securities Laws and in accordance with the Stock Option Plan
                  or the relevant agreements governing such Options (or pursuant
                  to this Section 2.12) shall be entitled to exercise all of
                  their Options and vote all Shares issued in connection
                  therewith at the Shareholder Meeting. It is agreed by Acquiror
                  that all Options that are duly surrendered for exercise,
                  conditional on Closing and with appropriate instructions that
                  the Options are to be

                                      -18-


                  voted in favour of the Arrangement (the "CONDITIONAL OPTION
                  EXERCISE"), shall be exercised immediately prior to the
                  Effective Time. Furthermore, Acquiror shall accept as validly
                  issued all Shares that are to be issued pursuant to the
                  Conditional Option Exercise. The Corporation may make
                  arrangements to loan Optionholders who elect to receive cash
                  pursuant to the Arrangement, the exercise price thereof with
                  repayment of the loan to be made from the proceeds received
                  under the Arrangement for the Shares acquired on such
                  exercise.

         (b)      Prior to the Effective Time, the Corporation shall use all
                  commercially reasonable efforts to enter into releases, in a
                  form approved by Acquiror, acting reasonably, with each
                  Optionholder pursuant to which the parties thereto shall agree
                  that, upon Closing, each holder that has not previously
                  exercised such Options, as the case may be, will receive from
                  the Corporation, in consideration of the termination of all
                  such holder's unexercised Options, the greater of:

                  (i)      the positive difference, if any, between the Per
                           Share Price and the exercise price of the holder's
                           Options, as the case may be, per Share, regardless of
                           the vesting of any such Options under the Stock
                           Option Plan and the agreements governing such
                           Options, as applicable; and

                  (ii)     $0.10,

                  for each Share that is subject to such issuance.

                  The Corporation shall make appropriate withholdings of taxes
                  or other applicable source deductions from any such payments
                  made to any Optionholders as required by applicable law.

         (c)      The Corporation shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
                  to ensure that, at the Effective Time, all of the Options have
                  been exercised or surrendered for termination as contemplated
                  by this Section 2.12, and without limiting the generality of
                  the forgoing, the Corporation shall:

                  (i)      encourage and facilitate all persons holding Options
                           to exercise those Options and vote all Shares issued
                           in connection therewith in favour of the Arrangement
                           at the Shareholder Meeting pursuant to the
                           Conditional Option Exercise or otherwise or surrender
                           their Options in the manner provided for in this
                           Section 2.12; and

                  (ii)     cause the vesting of option entitlements under the
                           Stock Option Plan to accelerate prior to or
                           concurrently with the completion of the Arrangement,
                           such that all outstanding Options shall be
                           exercisable and fully vested prior to the Effective
                           Time.

                  Days advance notice of any action to be taken by the Board of
                  Directors to withdraw, modify or change any recommendation
                  regarding the Arrangement or to enter into any agreement to
                  implement the Superior Proposal, and provide to Acquiror the
                  right, during such three Business Days, to advise the Board of
                  Directors that Acquiror will, within such period, announce its
                  intention to, and, as soon as practicable in the circumstances
                  and, in any event, within three Business Days of such
                  announcement, amend the terms of the Arrangement to provide
                  that the holders of Shares shall, pursuant to the Arrangement
                  as amended, receive a value per Share equal to or greater than
                  the value per Share provided in the Superior Proposal. If
                  Acquiror so advises the Board of Directors and so amends the
                  Arrangement, the Board of Directors shall not withdraw, modify
                  or change any recommendation with respect to the Arrangement,
                  as so amended, and neither the Corporation nor the Board of
                  Directors shall take any action to accept, recommend, approve
                  or implement the Superior Proposal, including, without
                  limitation, any release of the party making the Superior
                  Proposal from any standstill or confidentiality obligation,
                  any further consideration or negotiation of the Superior
                  Proposal or entry into of any agreement regarding the Superior
                  Proposal and the Corporation agrees to amend this Agreement to
                  provide for the Arrangement as so amended.

         (e)      If the Board of Directors receives a request for non-public
                  information from a party who has made or is considering making
                  an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal and the Board of
                  Directors determines that such Acquisition Proposal
                  constitutes a Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 3.2(a),
                  then, and only in such case, the Corporation may, subject to
                  the execution of a confidentiality agreement substantially
                  similar to the Confidentiality Agreement, provide such party
                  with access to information regarding the Corporation provided

                  agreement to Acquiror immediately upon its execution and

                  such party (that has not been previously provided to Acquiror)
                  concurrently with its provision to such party.

                           pending or, to the knowledge of the Corporation,
                           threatened referred to in Section 7.1(n) or any basis
                           for any such claim, action, proceeding or
                           investigation; and

                  (v)      any claim under policies of insurance referred to in
                           Section 7.1(r).

                  The Corporation shall in good faith discuss with Acquiror any
                  change in circumstances (actual, anticipated, contemplated or,
                  to the knowledge of the Corporation, threatened), financial or
                  otherwise, which is of such a nature that there may be a
                  reasonable question as to whether notice is required to be
                  given pursuant to this Section.

         (b)      From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time
                  and the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to its
                  terms, Acquiror shall promptly notify the Corporation in
                  writing of any change in information relating to any
                  representation or warranty of Acquiror set forth in this
                  Agreement which is or may be of such a nature as to render any
                  such representation or warranty misleading or untrue in a
                  material respect. Acquiror shall in good faith discuss with
                  the Corporation any change in circumstances (actual,
                  anticipated, contemplated or, to the knowledge of Acquiror,
                  threatened), financial or otherwise, which is of such a nature
                  that there may be a reasonable question as to whether notice
                  is required to be given pursuant to this Section.

Corporation makes no representation) will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading and will comply in all material respects

consolidated financial statements of the Corporation issued by the Corporation
or to be included in such reports and statements (excluding any information
therein provided by Acquiror, as to which the Corporation makes no

position of the Corporation as of the dates thereof and for the periods

<PAGE>
                                      -30-


         (a)      Organization

                  The Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries has been duly
                  incorporated or formed under applicable law, is validly
                  existing and has full corporate or legal power and authority
                  to own its properties and conduct its business as presently

                  Subsidiaries is duly registered to do business and is in good
                  standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of its
                  properties, owned or leased, or the nature of its activities
                  makes such registration necessary, except where the failure to
                  be so registered or in good standing would not have a Material
                  Adverse Effect in respect of the Corporation. All of the
                  outstanding shares of capital stock and other ownership
                  interests of the Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully paid
                  and non-assessable and all such shares and other ownership
                  interests owned directly or indirectly by the Corporation are,

                  arrangements, owned free and clear of all material liens,
                  claims or encumbrances, and there are no outstanding options,
                  rights, entitlements, understandings or commitments
                  (contingent or otherwise) regarding the right to acquire any
                  shares of capital stock or other ownership interests in any of
                  its Subsidiaries. The Corporation has no Subsidiaries except
                  those Persons listed in the Disclosure Letter.

         (b)      Capitalization

                  As of the date hereof, the authorized capital of the
                  Corporation consists of an unlimited number of Shares; there
                  are only 22,716,848 Shares issued and outstanding; up to a
                  maximum of 565,566 Shares may be issued pursuant to
                  outstanding in-the-money Options; and up to a maximum of
                  1,731,450 Shares may be issued pursuant to outstanding Options

                  the immediately preceding sentence or as set forth in the
                  Disclosure Letter, there are no other issued or outstanding
                  securities of the Corporation or (other than those owned by
                  the Corporation and its Subsidiaries) its Subsidiaries and,
                  without limitation, there are no options, warrants, conversion
                  privileges or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
                  commitments obligating the Corporation or any of its
                  Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of any capital stock
                  of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or securities or
                  obligations of any kind convertible into or exchangeable for
                  any shares of capital stock of the Corporation or any of its
                  Subsidiaries, nor, is there outstanding any stock appreciation
                  rights, phantom equity or similar rights, agreements,
                  arrangements or commitments based upon the book value, income
                  or any other attribute of the Corporation or any of its
                  Subsidiaries.

                  the part of the Corporation are necessary to authorize this
                  Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby other than
                  the approval of the Shareholders and Optionholders and the
                  approval of the Court as provided in this Agreement. This
                  Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
                  Corporation and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
                  the Corporation, enforceable against the Corporation in
                  accordance with its terms subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
                  reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium and other laws
                  relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, to
                  general principles of equity and the qualifications that the
                  consummation of the Arrangement is subject to approval of
                  Shareholders and Optionholders and the Court as provided in
                  this Agreement. Except as disclosed in the Disclosure Letter,

                  Agreement and performance by it of its obligations hereunder
                  and the completion of the Arrangement and the transactions

                  Adverse Effect in respect of the Corporation.

         (e)      Public Record

                  As of their respective dates, the documents and materials

                  schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference
                  therein) did not contain any untrue statement of a material
                  fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
                  therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light
                  of the circumstances under which they were made, not
                  misleading, and complied in all material respects with all
                  applicable legal and stock exchange requirements.

         (f)      Books and Records

                  All financial transactions of the Corporation and its
                  Subsidiaries have been recorded in the financial books and
                  records of the Corporation and each Subsidiary, as applicable,
                  in accordance with good business practice, and such financial
                  books and records accurately reflect the basis for the
                  financial condition and the revenues, expenses and results of
                  operations of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries shown in

                  pertaining to the operation or administration of the business
                  of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries are in the possession
                  of, recorded, stored, maintained by or otherwise dependent
                  upon any Person other than the Corporation and its
                  Subsidiaries, other than information relating to payroll
                  services which are handled by a contractor and corporate

                  consolidated basis) has been incurred, and (iii) there has not
                  been any (alone or together with other adverse changes)
                  Material Adverse Change.

         (h)      Employment Agreements and Benefit Plans

                  Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter, neither the
                  Corporation nor any Subsidiary is a party to any written or
                  oral policy, agreement, obligation or understanding providing
                  for severance or termination payments to, or any



<PAGE>
                                      -33-


                  employment agreement or, without limitation, any Employee
                  Obligation, with, any Person; all benefit plans covering
                  active, former or retired employees, officers or Directors of
                  the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries are listed in the
                  Disclosure Letter; the Corporation has made available to
                  Acquiror true and complete copies of all of the respective
                  terms thereof and: each such plan has been maintained and
                  administered in material compliance with its terms and is, to
                  the extent required by applicable law or contract, fully
                  funded without any deficit or unfunded actuarial liability or
                  adequate provision therefor having been made; all such plans
                  are in compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and
                  policies (including those as to registration or other
                  qualification); to the knowledge of the Corporation there are
                  no pending, anticipated or threatened claims against or
                  involving any of the plans; and all contributions, reserves or
                  premium payments required or provided for have been made.

         (i)      Disclosure

                  There is no information known to the officers of the
                  Corporation regarding any event, circumstance or action taken
                  or failed to be taken which may reasonably be expected to
                  result in (alone or together with other adverse changes) a
                  Material Adverse Change.

         (j)      Material Contracts

                  The Corporation has provided Acquiror with access to true and
                  complete copies of all Material Contracts and all Material
                  Contracts are listed in the Disclosure Letter. Except as
                  disclosed in the Disclosure Letter, such agreements do not
                  contain any "change of control" provisions which would be
                  triggered or affected by the Arrangement. Each of the
                  Corporation and its Subsidiaries has performed in all material
                  respects the obligations required to be performed by it and is
                  entitled to all benefits under the Material Contracts. None of
                  the Corporation or its Subsidiaries has violated or breached,
                  in any material respect, any of the terms or conditions of the
                  Material Contracts and there exists no default or event of
                  default or event, occurrence, condition or act which, with the
                  giving of notice, the lapse of time or the happening of any
                  other event or condition, would become a default or event of
                  default by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries under
                  any of the Material Contracts. Except as disclosed in the
                  Disclosure Letter, none of the Corporation or the Subsidiaries
                  is a party to or bound by any agreement containing any
                  standstill, restrictive covenant or similar provision that
                  would restrict or limit its right to acquire or hold any
                  asset, carry on any business or activity, solicit business
                  from any Person or in any geographical area, or otherwise to
                  conduct its business as it may determine.

         (k)      Financial Statements

                  The Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with
                  generally accepted accounting principles in Canada
                  consistently applied, and fairly present the consolidated
                  financial condition of the Corporation at the respective dates


<PAGE>
                                      -34-


                  indicated and the results of operations of the Corporation (on
                  a consolidated basis) for the periods covered (subject, in the
                  case of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal
                  year-end adjustments). Except (a) as disclosed or reflected in
                  the Financial Statements or (b) liabilities and obligations
                  (i) incurred in the ordinary course of business and consistent
                  with past practice or (ii) pursuant to the terms of this
                  Agreement, neither the Corporation nor any of its Subsidiaries
                  has incurred any liabilities of any nature, whether accrued,
                  contingent or otherwise (or which would be required by
                  generally accepted accounting principles applicable in Canada
                  to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the
                  Corporation) that have constituted or would be reasonably
                  likely to constitute (alone or together with other adverse
                  changes) a Material Adverse Change. Without limiting the
                  generality of the foregoing provisions of this Section and
                  except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter, the Corporation
                  has not committed to make any capital expenditures, nor have
                  any capital expenditures been authorized by the Corporation at
                  any time since December 31, 2001, except for capital
                  expenditures, made in the ordinary and regular course of
                  business consistent with past practice and not exceeding
                  $50,000 individually and $150,000 in the aggregate.

         (l)      Employee Obligations, Etc.

                  The Employee Obligations (all of which are listed in the
                  Disclosure Letter) do not exceed the amounts set forth in the
                  Disclosure Letter in respect of each of the persons listed
                  therein in respect of this subsection nor exceed in aggregate
                  $1,800,000.

         (m)      Compliance with Law

                  Each of the Corporation, its Subsidiaries and the Predecessor
                  Corporations has complied with and is in compliance with all
                  laws and regulations applicable to the operation of its
                  business, except where such non-compliance, considered
                  individually or in the aggregate, would not constitute (alone
                  or together with other adverse changes) a Material Adverse
                  Change or have a Material Adverse Effect in respect of the
                  Corporation.

         (n)      Litigation, etc.

                  Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter, there is no
                  claim, action, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the
                  knowledge of the Corporation threatened against or relating to
                  the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affecting any of
                  their properties or assets before any court or governmental or
                  regulatory authority or body, for an amount in excess of
                  $150,000, nor is the Corporation aware of any basis for any
                  such claim, action, proceeding or investigation. Neither the
                  Corporation nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
                  outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree that has had or
                  is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect in
                  respect of the Corporation.

         (o)      Real Property

                  Except such property as is described in the Disclosure Letter
                  (the "REAL PROPERTY"), the Corporation does not own or lease
                  and has not agreed to acquire or lease any real property or
                  interest in real property other than the Real Property. The
                  Corporation has the exclusive right to possess, use and
                  occupy, and as applicable, has good and marketable title in
                  fee simple to, all the Real Property, free and clear of all
                  Encumbrances, easements or other restrictions of any kind
                  other than as set forth in the Disclosure Letter. All
                  buildings, structures, improvements and appurtenances situated
                  on the Real Property are in good operating condition and in a
                  state of good maintenance and repair, except as set out in the
                  Disclosure Letter, are adequate and suitable for the purposes
                  for which they are currently being used and the Corporation
                  has adequate rights of ingress and egress for the operation of
                  its business in the ordinary course with such exceptions as
                  would not have a Material Adverse Effect in respect of the
                  Corporation. None of the buildings, structures, improvements
                  or appurtenances located on the Real Property (or any
                  equipment therein), nor the operation or maintenance thereof,
                  violates any restrictive covenant or any provision of any
                  federal, provincial or municipal law, ordinance, rule or
                  regulation, or encroaches on any property owned by others,
                  other than violations or encroachments that do not,
                  individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
                  effect on the current use of such property or a Material
                  Adverse Effect in respect of the Corporation.

         (p)      Environmental

                  (i)      The operation of the business of each of the
                           Corporation and its Subsidiaries, the property and
                           assets owned or used by the Corporation and its
                           Subsidiaries and the use, maintenance and operation
                           thereof have been and are in compliance with all
                           Environmental Laws (except where non-compliance would
                           not have a Material Adverse Effect in respect of the
                           Corporation). Each of the Corporation and its
                           Subsidiaries have complied with all reporting and
                           monitoring requirements under all Environmental Laws
                           (except where non-compliance would not have a
                           Material Adverse Effect in respect of the
                           Corporation). None of the Corporation and its
                           Subsidiaries has received any notice of any
                           non-compliance with any Environmental Laws or
                           Environmental Permits, and none of the Corporation
                           and its Subsidiaries have been convicted of an
                           offence for non-compliance with any Environmental
                           Laws or Environmental Permits or been fined or
                           otherwise sentenced or settled such prosecution short
                           of conviction, (except where such non-compliance
                           would not have a Material Adverse Effect in respect
                           of the Corporation). There is no civil, criminal or
                           administrative action, suit, demand, claim, hearing,
                           notice of violation, investigation, proceeding,
                           notice or demand letter existing or pending, or to

                           the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, relating

                  (ii)     Each of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries has
                           obtained all Environmental Permits necessary to
                           conduct its business and to own, use and operate its
                           properties and assets (except where the failure to
                           obtain any such permit would not have a Material
                           Adverse Effect in respect of the Corporation), all
                           such Environmental Permits are in effect, no appeal
                           and no other action is pending to revoke any such
                           permit, license or authorization (except where
                           revocation of any such permit would not have a
                           Material Adverse Effect in respect of the
                           Corporation) and the operation of the business of
                           each of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, the
                           property and assets owned by each the Corporation and
                           its Subsidiaries and the use, maintenance and
                           operation thereof have been and are in compliance
                           with all Environmental Permits (except where such
                           non-compliance would not have a Material Adverse
                           Effect in respect of the Corporation). To the extent
                           required by applicable Environmental Laws, each of
                           the Corporation and its Subsidiaries has filed all
                           applications necessary to renew or obtain any
                           necessary permits, licenses, or authorizations in a
                           timely fashion so as to allow it to continue to
                           operate its business in compliance with applicable
                           Environmental Laws, and the Corporation does not
                           expect such new or renewed licenses, permits or other
                           authorizations to include any terms or conditions
                           that will have a Material Adverse Effect in respect
                           of the Corporation.

                  (iii)    Each of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries has, at
                           all times, used, generated, treated, stored,
                           transported, disposed of or otherwise handled its
                           Hazardous Substances in compliance with all
                           Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits (except
                           where such non-compliance would not have a Material
                           Adverse Effect in respect of the Corporation).

                  (iv)     None of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries is, and,
                           to the knowledge of the Corporation, there is no
                           reasonable basis upon which the Corporation or any of
                           its Subsidiaries could become, responsible for any
                           material clean-up or corrective action under any

                  As of their respective dates, the documents and materials
                  comprising the public record of Acquiror (including all
                  exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by

                  Acquiror and each Subsidiary, as applicable, in accordance
                  with good business practice, and such financial books and
                  records accurately reflect the basis for the financial

                  and its Subsidiaries have not entered into and are not parties

                  or obligation of any nature (whether absolute, accrued,

                  consolidated basis) has been incurred, and (iii) there has not
                  been any (alone or together with other adverse changes)
                  Material Adverse Change.

         (h)      Disclosure

                  There is no information known to the officers of Acquiror
                  regarding any event, circumstance or action taken or failed to
                  be taken which may reasonably be expected to result in (alone
                  or together with other adverse changes) a Material Adverse
                  Change.

         (i)      Acquiror Financial Statements

                  The Acquiror Financial Statements were prepared in accordance
                  with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
                  States consistently applied, and fairly present the
                  consolidated financial condition of Acquiror at the respective
                  dates indicated and the results of operations of Acquiror (on
                  a consolidated basis) for the periods covered. Except (a) as
                  disclosed or reflected in the Acquiror


<PAGE>
                                      -43-


                  Financial Statements and (b) liabilities and obligations (i)
                  incurred in the ordinary course of business and consistent
                  with past practice or (ii) pursuant to the terms of this
                  Agreement, neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries has
                  incurred any liabilities of any nature, whether accrued,
                  contingent or otherwise (or which would be required by
                  generally accepted accounting principles applicable in the
                  United States to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet
                  of Acquiror) that have constituted or would be reasonably
                  likely constitute (alone or together with other adverse
                  changes) a Material Adverse Change.

         (j)      Financing

                  facilities sufficient to fund all amounts that may be required
                  by it and Canco in connection with and pursuant to the
                  Arrangement.

         (k)      Compliance with Law

                  Each of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries has complied with and is
                  in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to the
                  operation of its business, except where such non-compliance,
                  considered individually or in the aggregate, would not
                  constitute (alone or together with other adverse changes) a
                  Material Adverse Change and would not materially affect the
                  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the
                  ability of Acquiror to perform its obligations hereunder.

         (l)      Information Supplied

                  None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Acquiror

                  correct any statement in any earlier communication with
                  respect to the solicitation of a proxy for the same meeting or
                  subject matter which has become false or misleading. None of
                  the information supplied or to be supplied by Acquiror for
                  inclusion or incorporation by reference in the S-3
                  Registration Statement will at the time such registration
                  statement is declared or becomes effective contain any untrue
                  statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
                  required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
                  the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances

                  giving of notice, the lapse of time or the happening of any

                  under the Support Agreement and Voting and Exchange Trust

                  such Share, free and clear of all liens, claims and
                  encumbrances, in exchange for, at the holder's election (or

                  all liens, claims and encumbrances, and the holder shall be
                  deemed to have elected to receive in exchange therefor the Per

                  obligation to return duly completed election forms which are
                  received by the Depositary within 90 days following the
                  Effective Date, within 30 days after the receipt thereof by
                  the Depositary, Canco will not be responsible for any taxes,
                  interest, penalties or any other costs or damages resulting
                  from the failure by a holder of Shares or Holdco Shares to
                  properly complete or file the election forms in the form and
                  manner and within the time prescribed by the ITA (or any
                  applicable provincial income tax law). In its sole discretion,
                  Canco may choose to sign and return an election form received
                  more than 90 days following the Effective Date, but Canco will
                  have no obligation to do so.

2.5      ADJUSTMENTS TO EXCHANGE RATIO

The Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately and appropriately adjusted to
reflect fully the effect of (a) any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Acquiror
Shares or Shares), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with
respect to Acquiror Shares or Shares, and (b) any extraordinary dividend or
distribution with respect to Acquiror Shares (other than a dividend or
distribution referenced in clause (a)); provided that the foregoing adjustments
shall not be made if the record date for the stock split, reverse split, stock
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, other like change or extraordinary
dividend or distribution referred to in clauses (a) and (b) above does not occur
after the date of the Arrangement Agreement and prior to the Effective Time. In
any case where the Exchange Ratio is adjusted in accordance with the foregoing,
a corresponding adjustment shall be made to the number of Exchangeable Shares
(and Ancillary Rights) that are acquired by holders of Shares or Holdco Shares
who have elected to receive a combination of cash and Exchangeable Shares (and
Ancillary Rights).

2.6      RESTRICTION ON REDEMPTION OF EXCHANGEABLE SHARES

Canco and its Board of Directors shall not establish a Redemption Date for any
Exchangeable Shares pursuant to subsection (a) of the definition of Redemption
Date prior to: (i) if holders of


<PAGE>
                                      B-10


Shares and Holdco Shares elect in accordance with Section 2.4 to receive, in
aggregate, not less than 300,000 Exchangeable Shares, January 1, 2004; or (ii)
otherwise, January 1, 2003.

                                RIGHTS OF DISSENT

3.1      RIGHTS OF DISSENT

Holders of Shares or Options may exercise rights of dissent with respect to such
Shares or Options, as the case may be, pursuant to and in the manner set forth
in Section 191 of the Act as modified by the Interim Order and this Section 3.1
in connection with the Arrangement; provided that, notwithstanding subsection
191(5) of the Act, the written objection to the Arrangement Resolution referred
to in subsection 191(5) of the Act must be received by the Corporation not later
than 2:00 p.m. (Calgary time) on the Business Day preceding the Shareholder
Meeting. Holders of Shares or Options, as the case may be, who duly exercise
such rights of dissent and who:

         (a)      are ultimately determined to be entitled to be paid fair value
                  for their Shares or Options, as the case may be, shall be
                  deemed to have transferred such Shares or Options, as the case
                  may be, as of the Effective Time, without any further act or
                  formality and free and clear of all liens, claims and
                  encumbrances, to Canco, in consideration for a payment of cash
                  from Canco equal to such fair value; or

         (b)      are ultimately determined not to be entitled, for any reason,
                  to be paid fair value for their Shares or Options, as the case
                  may be, shall be deemed to have participated in the
                  Arrangement, as of the Effective Time, on the same basis as a
                  non-dissenting holder of Shares or Options, as the case may
                  be, who did not make an election and shall receive cash on the
                  same basis as holders of Shares or Options in respect of which
                  no election has been made,

but in no case shall Acquiror, the Corporation, Canco, Callco or any other
person be required to recognize any holder of Shares or Options who exercises
rights of dissent as a holder of Shares or Options after the Effective Time and
the names of each such holder shall be deleted from the register of holders of
Shares or Options at the Effective Time.

                                    ARTICLE 4
                       CERTIFICATES AND FRACTIONAL SHARES

4.1      PAYMENT OF CASH

At or promptly after the Effective Time, Canco shall deposit with the
Depositary, for the benefit of the holders of Holdco Shares, Shares and Options
who will receive cash in connection with the Arrangement, cash in an amount
sufficient to satisfy all of the cash payment obligations to Holdco Shareholders
and Shareholders in connection with the acquisition of Holdco Shares and Shares
pursuant to the Arrangement (together with any unpaid dividends or distributions
declared on the Shares, if any, prior to the Effective Time) and to
Optionholders required pursuant to Section 2.2(d) or otherwise under this Plan
of Arrangement. Upon surrender to the


<PAGE>
                                      B-11


Depositary for transfer to Canco of a certificate which immediately prior to or
upon the Effective Time represented Holdco Shares or Shares in respect of which
the holder is entitled to receive cash under the Arrangement, together with (i)
a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and Election Form or Holdco Letter of
Transmittal and Election Form, (ii) such other documents and instruments as
would have been required to effect the transfer of the Holdco Shares or Shares
formerly represented by such certificate under the Act and the by-laws of the
Corporation, and (iii) such additional documents and instruments as the
Depositary may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and after the Effective Time
the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, the amount of cash such holder is
entitled to receive under the Arrangement (together with any unpaid dividends or
distributions declared on the surrendered Shares or Shares owned by the relevant
Holdco, if any, prior to the Effective Time), and any certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be transferred to Canco. No interest shall be paid or accrued on
unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of certificates
that formerly represented Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
such Shares or Holdco Shares that was not registered in the securities register
of the Corporation or Holdco, as the case may be, the amount of cash payable for
such Shares under the Arrangement may be delivered to the transferee if the
certificate representing such Shares or Holdco Shares is presented to the
Depositary as provided above, accompanied by all documents required to evidence
and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer
taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.1,
each certificate which immediately prior to or upon the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Shares or Holdco Shares that, under the
Arrangement, were exchanged or were deemed to be exchanged for cash pursuant to
Section 2.2 shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the cash payment contemplated by
this Section 4.1.

4.2      ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING EXCHANGEABLE SHARES

At or promptly after the Effective Time, Canco shall deposit with the
Depositary, for the benefit of the holders of Holdco Shares and Shares who will
receive Exchangeable Shares (and the Ancillary Rights) in connection with the
Arrangement, certificates representing the number of Exchangeable Shares
sufficient to satisfy all of the Exchangeable Share payment obligations to
Holdco Shareholders and Shareholders in connection with the acquisition of
Holdco Shares and Shares pursuant to the Arrangement (together with cash in an
amount equal to the sum of any unpaid dividends or distributions declared on the
surrendered Shares or Shares owned by the relevant Holdco, if any, prior to the
Effective Time, and any payments for fractional shares required by Section 4.4).
Upon surrender to the Depositary for transfer to Canco of a certificate which
immediately prior to or upon the Effective Time represented Holdco Shares or
Shares in respect of which the holder is entitled to receive Exchangeable Shares
under the Arrangement, together with (i) a duly completed Letter of Transmittal
and Election Form or Holdco Letter of Transmittal and Election Form, (ii) such
other documents and instruments as would have been required to effect the
transfer of the Holdco Shares or Shares formerly represented by such certificate
under the Act and the by-laws of the relevant Holdco or the Corporation, and
(iii) such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably
require, the holder of such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor, and after the Effective Time the Depositary shall deliver
to such holder, a certificate representing that number (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) of Exchangeable Shares which such holder has the right to
receive (together with any unpaid dividends or distributions declared on the
surrendered Shares or Shares owned by the relevant Holdco prior to the Effective
Time), and any certificate


<PAGE>
                                      B-12


so surrendered shall forthwith be transferred to Canco. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, or on unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of certificates that
formerly represented Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Holdco
Shares or Shares that was not registered in the securities register of the
relevant Holdco or the Corporation, as the case may be, a certificate
representing the proper number of Exchangeable Shares (together with any unpaid
dividends or distributions declared on the surrendered Shares prior to the
Effective Time) may be issued to the transferee if the certificate representing
such Holdco Shares or Shares is presented to the Depositary as provided above,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.2, each certificate which
immediately prior to or upon the Effective Time represented one or more Holdco
Shares or Shares that, under the Arrangement, were exchanged or were deemed to
be exchanged for Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Section 2.2 shall be deemed at
all times after the Effective Time, but subject to Section 4.3, to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender a certificate representing that
number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of Exchangeable Shares
(together with any unpaid dividends or distributions declared on the surrendered
Shares, or Shares owned by the relevant Holdco, prior to the Effective Time)
which such holder has the right to receive.

4.3      DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNSURRENDERED CERTIFICATES

No dividends or other distributions paid, declared or made with respect to
Exchangeable Shares, in each case with a record date after the Effective Time,
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Holdco Shares or Shares that
were exchanged for Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Section 2.2 unless and until
the holder of such certificate shall comply with the provisions of Section 4.2.
Subject to applicable law, at the time such holder shall have complied with the
provisions of Section 4.2 (or, in the case of clause (ii) below, at the
appropriate payment date), there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
formerly representing Holdco Shares or Shares, without interest, (i) the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
paid with respect to the Exchangeable Shares to which such holder is entitled
pursuant hereto, and (ii) on the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but
prior to the date of compliance by such holder with the provisions of Section
4.2 and a payment date subsequent to the date of such compliance and payable
with respect to such Exchangeable Shares.

4.4      NO FRACTIONAL SHARES

No certificates representing fractional Exchangeable Shares shall be issued upon
compliance with the provisions of Section 4.2 and no dividend, stock split or
other change in the capital structure of Canco shall relate to any such
fractional security and such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to exercise any rights as a security holder of Canco. In lieu of any
such fractional securities, each holder otherwise entitled to a fractional
interest in an Exchangeable Share will be entitled to receive a cash payment
from the Depositary equal to the product of such fractional interest and the
Acquiror Average Price, such amount to be provided to the Depositary by Canco,
upon request. Such payment with respect to fractional shares is merely intended
to provide a mechanical rounding off of, and is not separately bargained for,
consideration. If more than one certificate formerly representing Holdco Shares
or Shares is


<PAGE>
                                      B-13


surrendered for the account of the same holder, the number of Exchangeable
Shares for which such certificates have been surrendered shall be computed on
the basis of the aggregate number of Holdco Shares or Shares represented by the
certificates so surrendered. On the date of the notice referred to in Section
7.2 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, the aggregate number of Exchangeable
Shares for which no certificates were issued as a result of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 4.4 shall be deemed to have been surrendered by the
Depositary for no consideration to Canco.

4.5      LOST CERTIFICATES

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Holdco Shares or Shares that were exchanged
pursuant to Section 2.2 shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of Holdco Shares or Shares
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, any cash
pursuant to Section 4.1 and/or one or more certificates representing one or more
Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Section 4.2 (and any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) in each case deliverable in accordance with Section 2.2.
When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the holder to whom cash and/or certificates representing
Exchangeable Shares are to be issued shall, as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, give a bond satisfactory to the Corporation and Canco and
their respective transfer agents in such sum as any of them may direct or
otherwise indemnify the Corporation and Canco in a manner satisfactory to the
Corporation and Canco against any claim that may be made against any of them
with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

4.6      EXTINGUISHMENT OF RIGHTS

Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares that are not held by a Shareholder who has exercised its
right to dissent in accordance with Article 3 hereof and who is ultimately
entitled to be paid fair value of the Shares held by such Shareholder but was
exchanged or was deemed to have been exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2, that has
not been deposited with all other instruments required by Section 4.1 or Section
4.2, on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to
represent a claim or interest of any kind or nature to such cash payment and/or
as a holder of Exchangeable Shares or Acquiror Shares. On such date, the cash
payment and/or the Exchangeable Shares or Acquiror Shares (and any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) to which the former holder of the
certificate referred to in the preceding sentence was ultimately entitled shall
be deemed to have been surrendered for no consideration to Callco or Canco, as
the case may be, together with all entitlements to dividends, distributions,
cash and interest in respect thereof held for such former holder. None of
Acquiror, the Corporation, Canco, Callco or the Depositary shall be liable to
any person in respect of any cash payment or Exchangeable Shares or Acquiror
Shares (or dividends, distributions and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares)
delivered to a public official pursuant to and in compliance with any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

4.7      WITHHOLDING RIGHTS

Acquiror, the Corporation, Canco, Callco and the Depositary shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any dividend or consideration otherwise payable to any
holder of Shares or


<PAGE>
                                      B-14


Exchangeable Shares such amounts as the Corporation, Canco, Callco or the
Depositary is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under
the ITA, the Code or any provision of federal, provincial, territorial, state,
local or foreign tax law, in each case, as amended. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof
as having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are
actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the
amount so required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder
exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to the holder,
the Corporation, Canco, Callco and the Depositary are hereby authorized to sell
or otherwise dispose of such portion of the consideration as is necessary to
provide sufficient funds to the Corporation, Canco, Callco or the Depositary, as
the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding
requirement and the Corporation, Canco, Callco or the Depositary shall notify
the holder thereof and remit any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such
sale.

4.8      TERMINATION OF DEPOSITARY

Any Exchangeable Shares, together with any funds held by the Depositary, that
remain undistributed to former holders of Shares nine months after the Effective
Date shall be delivered to Canco or Callco upon demand therefor, and holders of
certificates previously representing Shares who have not theretofore complied
with Section 4.1 or Section 4.2 shall thereafter, subject to Section 4.6, look
only to Canco or Callco for payment of any claim to cash, Exchangeable Shares,
cash in lieu of fractional shares thereof, Acquiror Shares or dividends or
distributions, if any, in respect thereof.

                                    ARTICLE 5
             CERTAIN RIGHTS OF CALLCO TO ACQUIRE EXCHANGEABLE SHARES

5.1      CALLCO LIQUIDATION CALL RIGHT

         (a)      Callco shall have the overriding right (the "Liquidation Call
                  Right"), in the event of and notwithstanding the proposed
                  liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Canco or any other
                  distribution of the assets of Canco among its shareholders for
                  the purpose of winding-up its affairs, pursuant to Article 5
                  of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase from all but
                  not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other
                  than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is an affiliate
                  of Acquiror) on the Liquidation Date all but not less than all
                  of the Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder upon
                  payment by Callco to each such holder of the Exchangeable
                  Share Price applicable on the last Business Day prior to the
                  Liquidation Date (the "Liquidation Call Purchase Price") in
                  accordance with Section 5.1(c). In the event of the exercise
                  of the Liquidation Call Right by Callco, each holder shall be
                  obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by such
                  holder to Callco on the Liquidation Date upon payment by
                  Callco to such holder of the Liquidation Call Purchase Price
                  for each such Exchangeable Share, whereupon Canco shall have
                  no obligation to pay any Liquidation Amount to the holders of
                  such shares so purchased by Callco.


<PAGE>
                                      B-15


         (b)      To exercise the Liquidation Call Right, Callco must notify
                  Canco and the Transfer Agent of Callco's intention to exercise
                  such right at least 45 days before the Liquidation Date, in
                  the case of a voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
                  of Canco or any other voluntary distribution of the assets of
                  Canco among its shareholders for the purpose of winding-up its
                  affairs, and at least five Business Days before the
                  Liquidation Date, in the case of an involuntary liquidation,
                  dissolution or winding-up of Canco or any other involuntary
                  distribution of the assets of Canco among its shareholders for
                  the purpose of winding up its affairs. The Transfer Agent will
                  notify the holders of Exchangeable Shares as to whether Callco
                  has exercised the Liquidation Call Right forthwith after the
                  expiry of the period during which the same may be exercised by
                  Callco. If Callco exercises the Liquidation Call Right, then
                  on the Liquidation Date, Callco will purchase and the holders
                  of Exchangeable Shares will sell all of the Exchangeable
                  Shares then outstanding for a price per share equal to the
                  Liquidation Call Purchase Price.

         (c)      For the purposes of completing the purchase of the
                  Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Liquidation Call Right,
                  Callco shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
                  Transfer Agent, on or before the Liquidation Date, the
                  Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the total
                  Liquidation Call Purchase Price. Provided that such
                  Exchangeable Share Consideration has been so deposited with
                  the Transfer Agent, on and after the Liquidation Date, the
                  holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be holders
                  of the Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to
                  exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof
                  (including any rights under the Voting and Exchange Trust
                  Agreement ), other than the right to receive their
                  proportionate part of the total Liquidation Call Purchase
                  Price payable by Callco, without interest, upon presentation
                  and surrender by the holder of certificates representing the
                  Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall
                  on and after the Liquidation Date be considered and deemed for
                  all purposes to be the holder of Acquiror Shares to which such
                  holder is entitled. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a
                  certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares,
                  together with such other documents and instruments as may be
                  required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the
                  Act and the by-laws of Canco and such additional documents and
                  instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require, the
                  holder of such surrendered certificate or certificates shall
                  be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer
                  Agent on behalf of Callco shall deliver to such holder, the
                  Exchangeable Share Consideration to which such holder is
                  entitled. If Callco does not exercise the Liquidation Call
                  Right in the manner described above, on the Liquidation Date
                  the holders of the Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to
                  receive in exchange therefor the Liquidation Amount otherwise
                  payable by Canco in connection with the liquidation,
                  dissolution or winding-up of Canco pursuant to Article 5 of
                  the Exchangeable Share Provisions.

5.2      CALLCO REDEMPTION CALL RIGHT

In addition to Callco's rights contained in the Exchangeable Share Provisions,
including the Retraction Call Right (as defined in the Exchangeable Share
Provisions), Callco shall have the following rights in respect of the
Exchangeable Shares:


<PAGE>
                                      B-16


         (a)      Callco shall have the overriding right (the "Redemption Call
                  Right"), in the event of and notwithstanding the proposed
                  redemption of the Exchangeable Shares by Canco pursuant to
                  Article 7 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase
                  from all but not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable
                  Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is
                  an affiliate of Acquiror) on the Redemption Date all but not
                  less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by each such
                  holder upon payment by Callco to each such holder of the
                  Exchangeable Share Price applicable on the last Business Day
                  prior to the Redemption Date (the "Redemption Call Purchase
                  Price") in accordance with 5.2(c). In the event of the
                  exercise of the Redemption Call Right by Callco, each holder
                  of Exchangeable Shares shall be obligated to sell all the
                  Exchangeable Shares held by such holder to Callco on the
                  Redemption Date upon payment by Callco to such holder of the
                  Redemption Call Purchase Price for each such Exchangeable
                  Share, whereupon Canco shall have no obligation to redeem, or
                  to pay the Redemption Price in respect of, such shares so
                  purchased by Callco.

         (b)      To exercise the Redemption Call Right, Callco must notify the
                  Transfer Agent of Callco's intention to exercise such right at
                  least 60 days before the Redemption Date, except in the case
                  of a redemption occurring as a result of an Acquiror Control
                  Transaction, a Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an Exempt
                  Exchangeable Share Voting Event (each as defined in the
                  Exchangeable Share Provisions), in which case Callco shall so
                  notify the Transfer Agent and Canco on or before the
                  Redemption Date. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of
                  the Exchangeable Shares as to whether Callco has exercised the
                  Redemption Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period
                  during which the same may be exercised by Callco. If Callco
                  exercises the Redemption Call Right, then, on the Redemption
                  Date, Callco will purchase and the holders of Exchangeable
                  Shares will sell all of the Exchangeable Shares then
                  outstanding for a price per share equal to the Redemption Call
                  Purchase Price.

         (c)      For the purposes of completing the purchase of the
                  Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Redemption
                  Call Right, Callco shall deposit or cause to be deposited with
                  the Transfer Agent, on or before the Redemption Date, the
                  Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the total
                  Redemption Call Purchase Price. Provided that such
                  Exchangeable Share Consideration has been so deposited with
                  the Transfer Agent, on and after the Redemption Date the
                  holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be holders
                  of the Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to
                  exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof
                  (including any rights under the Voting and Exchange Trust
                  Agreement ), other than the right to receive their
                  proportionate part of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price
                  payable by Callco, without interest, upon presentation and
                  surrender by the holder of certificates representing the
                  Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall
                  on and after the Redemption Date be considered and deemed for
                  all purposes to be the holder of Acquiror Shares to which such
                  holder is entitled. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a
                  certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares,
                  together with such other documents and instruments as may be
                  required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the
                  Act and the by-laws of Canco and such additional


<PAGE>
                                      B-17


                  documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably
                  require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or
                  certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
                  therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of Callco shall
                  deliver to such holder, the Exchangeable Share Consideration
                  to which such holder is entitled. If Callco does not exercise
                  the Redemption Call Right in the manner described above, on
                  the Redemption Date the holders of the Exchangeable Shares
                  will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
                  Redemption Price otherwise payable by Canco in connection with
                  the redemption of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Article
                  7 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions.

5.3      CHANGE OF LAW CALL RIGHT

         (a)      Acquiror shall have the overriding right (the "Change of Law
                  Call Right"), in the event of a Change of Law, to purchase (or
                  to cause Callco to purchase) from all but not less than all of
                  the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of
                  Exchangeable Shares which is an affiliate of Acquiror) all but
                  not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by each such
                  holder upon payment by Acquiror or Callco, as the case may be,
                  of an amount per share (the "Change of Law Call Purchase
                  Price") equal to the Exchangeable Share Price applicable on
                  the last Business Day prior to the Change of Law Call Date, in
                  accordance with Section 5.3(c). In the event of the exercise
                  of the Change of Law Call Right by Acquiror or Callco, as the
                  case may be, each holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be
                  obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by such
                  holder to Acquiror or Callco, as the case may be, on the
                  Change of Law Call Date upon payment by Acquiror to such
                  holder of the Change of Law Call Purchase Price for each such
                  Exchangeable Share.

         (b)      To exercise the Change of Law Call Right, Acquiror or Callco
                  must notify the Transfer Agent of its intention to exercise
                  such right at least 45 days before the date on which Acquiror
                  or Callco intends to acquire the Exchangeable Shares (the
                  "Change of Law Call Date"). If Acquiror or Callco exercises
                  the Change of Law Call Right, then, on the Change of Law Call
                  Date, Acquiror or Callco, as the case may be, will purchase
                  and the holders of Exchangeable Shares will sell all of the
                  Exchangeable Shares then outstanding for a price per share
                  equal to the Change of Law Call Purchase Price.

         (c)      For the purposes of completing the purchase of the
                  Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Change of
                  Law Call Right, Acquiror or Callco, as the case may be, shall
                  deposit or cause to be deposited with the Transfer Agent, on
                  or before the Change of Law Call Date, the Exchangeable Share
                  Consideration representing the total Change of Law Call
                  Purchase Price. Provided that such Exchangeable Share
                  Consideration has been so deposited with the Transfer Agent,
                  on and after the Change of Law Call Date the holders of the
                  Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be holders of the
                  Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any
                  of the rights of holders in respect thereof (including any
                  rights under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement ), other
                  than the right to receive their proportionate part of the
                  total Change of Law Purchase Price payable by Acquiror or
                  Callco, as the case may be, without interest, upon
                  presentation and

                  surrender by the holder of certificates representing the
                  Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall
                  on and after the Change of Law Call Date be considered and
                  deemed for all purposes to be the holder of Acquiror Shares to
                  which such holder is entitled. Upon surrender to the Transfer
                  Agent of a certificate or certificates representing
                  Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and
                  instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of
                  Exchangeable Shares under the Act and the by-laws of Canco and
                  such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer
                  Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered
                  certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive in
                  exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of
                  Acquiror or Callco, as the case may be, shall deliver to such
                  holder, the Exchangeable Share Consideration to which such
                  holder is entitled.

                                    ARTICLE 6

                           would or could reasonably be expected to materially
                           reduce the benefits to Nabors under the Arrangement
                           (any such inquiry or proposal in respect of any of

                           the business, properties, operations, prospects or
                           conditions (financial or otherwise) of Ryan or any of
                           its subsidiaries or an Ryan Acquisition Proposal or

                  (iii)    take any action that might reasonably be expected to
                           reduce the likelihood of completion of the

                           to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and
                           provided that the Securityholder remains liable for
                           the performance by such affiliate of all terms and
                           obligations of the Securityholder hereunder); and

                  (iii)    it shall not exercise any statutory rights of dissent
                           or appraisal in respect of any resolution approving

                           not exercise any shareholder rights or remedies
                           available at common law or pursuant to applicable
                           securities or corporate laws to delay, hinder, upset
