                                 PROMISSORY NOTE


US$ $125,000.00

                                                                January 10, 2003

                                    ARTICLE I
                               PAYMENT OBLIGATION

         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned The UniMark Group, Inc., a Texas
corporation ("Maker"), unconditionally promises to pay to the order of M & M
Nominee, LLC or its assigns ("Payee"), the sum of One Hundred Twenty-Five
Thousand Dollars (US $125,000.00), together with interest on the unpaid
principal balance from time to time outstanding at a rate per annum equal to ten
percent (10%). The principal of and accrued interest on this Note shall be due
and payable in lawful money of the United States on the earlier of (a) July 9,
2003, (b) the occurrence of a Qualified Lemon Project Financing (as defined
below) or (c) upon demand following the occurrence of an Event of Default (as
defined in Article III) or as otherwise provided in Article III hereof. Interest
hereunder shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual
number of days elapsed. As used herein a "Qualified Lemon Project Financing"
shall mean (i) any debt or equity financing of Maker or its subsidiaries which
is secured, in whole or in part, by the approximately 2,572 prepared and planted
hectares lemon groves owned by Maker and/or its subsidiaries (as further
described in Maker's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission) (the
"Lemon Project"), or (ii) any other financing made by Maker or its subsidiaries
which is obtained in connection with the Lemon Project, in each case with
initial net cash proceeds in an amount at least equal to the outstanding
principal amount of this Note and including, but not limited to, any debt
financing obtained from Ixe Banco S.A. de C.V.

         Maker shall have the right to prepay the principal of this Note in full
or in part at any time and from time to time without premium or penalty,
provided, however, that accrued interest shall be due and payable
contemporaneously with such prepayment of principal.

                                   ARTICLE II
                       AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS

         So long as any of the principal of and accrued interest of this Note is
outstanding, or until the Payee consents to the contrary and the Maker receives
prior written approval to the contrary from the Payee, Maker will comply, or
cause compliance, with each of the following covenants:

         1. USE OF PROCEEDS. Maker will only use the net proceeds from this Note
to fund expenditures for the Lemon Project, as approved by the Maker's board of
directors (which expenditures may include contributions by the Maker of all or
part of the net proceeds of this Note to one or more of the Maker's
subsidiaries).

         2. LIMITATION ON LIENS AND ENCUMBRANCES. Maker will not incur, and will
ensure that none of its direct or indirect subsidiaries (including, without
limitation, Grupo Industrial Santa Engracia, S.A. de C.V.) incur, any lien on or
otherwise pledge or encumber any of the assets constituting the Lemon Project,
unless Maker first perfects a first priority lien security interest in favor of
Payee covering the assets of Maker with a fair market value of at least two
times the outstanding principal amount of this Note and which pledged assets are
reasonably acceptable to Payee.

                                   ARTICLE III
                                EVENTS OF DEFAULT

                  any action for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing;
                  or

         11.      a proceeding or case shall be commenced, without the
                  application or consent of the Company, in any court of
                  competent jurisdiction, seeking (i) Maker's liquidation,
