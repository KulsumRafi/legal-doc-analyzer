remain in the employ of the Employers, the parties desire to specify the severance benefits which shall be due the Executive in the event that the Executive's employment with the Employers is
terminated under specified circumstances detailed herein: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Average
Annual Compensation. The Executive's "Average Annual Compensation" for purposes of this Agreement shall be deemed to mean the average level of compensation paid
to the Executive by the Employers or any subsidiary thereof during the three consecutive calendar years preceding the Date of Termination which yield the highest such average. If the Executive has
worked for less than three consecutive calendar years, the "Average Annual Compensation" shall mean the sum of total compensation received, divided by the number of months worked, and multiplied by
12. Alternatively, at the Executive's election, the Executive's compensation for the 12 calendar months prior to the Change-In-Control may be used to constitute "Average Annual
Compensation." Compensation shall include base salary and bonuses under the Incentive Compensation Program originally adopted in 1996 and any other employee benefit plans of the Employers.
Compensation shall not include fringe benefits such as automobiles or other perquisites, but shall include any pre-tax reduction for contributions to any tax qualified retirement plan,
deferred compensation plan, or flexible benefits plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause.
Cause shall mean (i)&nbsp;the willful and continued failure by the Executive to substantially perform the Executive's duties with the Employers (other than any
such failure resulting from the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board of Directors of
F&amp;M Bancorp, which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the Board of Directors of F&amp;M Bancorp believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the Executive's duties or
(ii)&nbsp;the engaging by the Executive in conduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Employers or their subsidiaries, monetarily or otherwise. For purposes of clauses
(i)&nbsp;and (ii)&nbsp;of this definition, no act, or failure to act, on the Executive's part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive </FONT></P>
