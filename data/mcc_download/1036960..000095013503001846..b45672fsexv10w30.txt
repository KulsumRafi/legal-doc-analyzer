c/o Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation
82 Running Hill Road
South Portland, ME 04106

Dear John:

This letter sets forth an agreement between you and Fairchild Semiconductor
International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), regarding the
Company's grant to you of certain shares of restricted stock in connection with
your employment as Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer of the
Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation.

1. SHARES GRANTED

In partial consideration for your decision to accept employment with Fairchild
Semiconductor Corporation, the Company shall issue and grant to you on the date
hereof, at no cost to you, subject to the transfer restrictions, forfeiture
provisions and other terms and conditions described herein, 30,000 shares of the
Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Restricted
Shares"), which shares shall be duly authorized, validly issued and
non-assessable.

2. TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

For a period of two years following the date hereof, you shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Company, Transfer (as defined below) any Restricted
Shares except to a Permitted Transferee (as defined below). "Transfer" includes
the making of any sale, exchange, assignment, hypothecation, gift, security
interest, pledge or other encumbrance, or any agreement to do any of the
foregoing, any voting trust or other agreement or arrangement with respect to
the transfer of voting rights or any other beneficial interest in any of the
Restricted Shares, the creation of any other claim thereto or any other transfer
or disposition whatsoever, whether voluntary or involuntary, affecting the
right, title, interest or possession in or to the Restricted Shares. "Permitted
Transferee" means (1) your spouse, children or grandchildren (in each case,
natural or adopted), any trust for the sole benefit of such persons, any
charitable trust of which you are the grantor, or any corporation, limited
liability company or partnership in which you, your spouse and/or your children
or grandchildren (in each case, natural or adopted) directly and beneficially
own all the equity interests or (2) any person or entity who takes Vested Shares
(as defined in Section 3 below) in a sale made in reliance on Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
or any person who takes Vested Shares in a sale registered by the Company under
the Securities Act, provided that no person or

entity shall be a Permitted Transferee by virtue of clause (1) of this
definition unless such person or entity enters into an agreement with the
Company binding such person or entity to the same extent as you are bound
hereby. Any Permitted Transferee of Vested Shares by virtue of clause (2) of the
preceding sentence shall not be bound by any transfer or other restrictions or
limitations hereunder.

3. FORFEITURE PROVISIONS

In the event your employment with Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation is
terminated for any reason other than your death or your Permanent Disability (as
defined below) (including without limitation as a result of your voluntary
resignation or termination by the Company with or without cause), any and all
right, title and interest that you or any Permitted Transferee may have to or in
any Restricted Shares that are not Vested Shares shall be automatically and
immediately forfeited as of the date of such termination and all such forfeited
shares shall revert to the Company treasury as of such date without any action
by you or the Company. "Permanent Disability" shall mean a permanent and total
incapacity to perform services substantially similar to those provided to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the date of such
disability. Upon such event of forfeiture, you (or any Permitted Transferee(s))
shall surrender to the Company for cancellation stock certificates representing
at least the number of Restricted Shares that are not Vested Shares at the time
of forfeiture, provided that the Company shall promptly thereafter issue new
stock certificates representing any Vested Shares represented by such
surrendered certificates. In the event your employment with Fairchild
Semiconductor Corporation is terminated as a result of your death or your
Permanent Disability, then all Restricted Shares that were not Vested Shares as
of the date of such termination shall automatically become Vested Shares as of
such date. "Vested Shares" shall mean the number of Restricted Shares equal to
(1) 10,000 plus (2) 10,000 multiplied by the number of full years that have
elapsed after the date hereof plus (3) any shares deemed to be Vested Shares
pursuant to the preceding sentence. Vested Shares shall not be subject to the
forfeiture provisions hereunder but shall be subject to the restrictions on
Transfer described above (except following Transfer to a Permitted Transferee by
virtue of clause (2) of the definition of Permitted Transferee).

4. FILING OF SECTION 83(B) ELECTION

You shall timely file an appropriate form of Section 83(b) Election with respect
to Restricted Shares that are not Vested Shares as of the date hereof with the
Internal Revenue Service Center with which you file your federal tax return and
provide a copy to the Company, all within 30 days after the date hereof. In
addition, a copy of the election must be included with your federal tax return
for the 2000 tax year. A suggested form of Section 83(b) Election is attached.

5. TAX CONSEQUENCES; LOAN

You will incur certain federal and state income tax obligations upon receipt of
the Restricted Shares which the Company is obligated to withhold and remit to
the Internal Revenue Service on your behalf. The Company shall cause Fairchild
Semiconductor Corporation to lend you an

amount sufficient to pay such tax withholding obligations. The amount of the
loan will equal 34.5% of the fair market value of the Restricted Shares
(determined without regard to any restrictions) as of the date hereof. The loan
amount will not necessarily reflect the actual effect that receipt of the
Restricted Shares will have on your total 2000 federal and state tax
obligations. The loan will be evidenced by the attached promissory note. Please
sign the promissory note and return it with the signed copy of this letter
agreement. You agree that the loan shall be used to pay withholding taxes due as
a result of your receipt of the Restricted Shares. In addition, by signing this
letter you authorize and direct the Company to apply (or cause to be applied)
the proceeds of your loan directly to the payment of such withholding taxes.

6. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE BY YOU

By signing where indicated below, you represent and warrant to the Company that:

      (a)   you are receiving the Restricted Shares not with a view to

            applicable securities laws of any state, and that you will not
            distribute any Restricted Shares in violation of the Securities Act
            or any such state laws;

            under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state, and
            that the Restricted Shares must be held indefinitely unless
            subsequently registered under the Securities Act and any applicable
            state securities laws or unless an exemption (such as that currently
            provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act) from such
            registration is available;

      (c)   you understand that the exemption from registration provided by Rule
            144 under the Securities Act will not be available to you until one
            year has elapsed after your receipt of the Restricted Shares; and

      (d)   you understand and acknowledge that the Restricted Shares are
            subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as provided in Section 3
            above.

shall bear the following legends in addition to any other legend required under
applicable law:

            THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT

            THE SECURITIES ACT OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR AN OPINION
