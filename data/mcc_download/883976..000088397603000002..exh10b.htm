(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>"Acceleration  Event"</U>  means any event  which in the  opinion of the Board of  Directors  of the  Company is
          likely to lead to changes in control of the  beneficial  ownership of the equity  securities  of the  Company,  whether or not
         such change in control actually occurs.<br><br>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>"Board of Directors" or "Board"</U> means the Board of Directors of the Company.
<br><br>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>"Code"</U> means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.<br><br>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>"Committee"</U> means the committee referred to in Section 1.3.<br><br>

         by National  Quotation  Bureau,  Inc. or other  national  quotation  service.  If the shares of Common Stock are traded in the
         over-the-counter  market, "fair market value" means the closing "asked" price of the shares in the over-the-counter  market on
         the day on which such value is to be determined or, if such "asked" price is not  available,  the last sales price on such day

         determined  pursuant to the  methodologies  described  above or if shares of Common  Stock are not traded on an exchange or in
         the  over-the-counter  market,  Fair  Market  Value  shall be the value  determined  by the Board of  Directors  or  Committee

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Administration
of the Plan</U>.</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The
Plan shall be administered by a committee (the &#147;Committee&#148;) appointed
by the Board (which Committee shall consist of two or more directors) or, at the
discretion of the Board from time to time, the Plan may be administered by the
Board. It is intended that the directors appointed to serve on the Committee
shall be &#147;non-employee directors&#148; (within the meaning of Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the 1934 Act) and &#147;outside directors&#148; (within the
meaning of Code Section 162(m) and the regulations thereunder) to the extent
that Rule 16b-3 and, if necessary for relief from the limitation under Code
Section 162(m) and such relief is sought by the Company, Code Section 162(m),
respectively, are applicable. However, the mere fact that a Committee member
shall fail to qualify under either of the foregoing requirements shall not
invalidate any Award made by the Committee, which Award is otherwise validly
made under the Plan. The members of the Committee shall be appointed by, and may
be changed at any time and from time to time in the discretion of, the Board.
During any time that the Board is acting as administrator of the Plan, it shall
have all the powers of the Committee hereunder, and any reference herein to the
Committee (other than in this Section 1.3) shall include the Board. Subject to
the control of the Board, and without limiting the control over decisions
described in Section 1.7, the Committee shall have the power to interpret and
apply the Plan and to make regulations for carrying out its purpose. More
particularly, the Committee shall determine which Key Employees shall be granted
Options and the terms of such Options. When granting Options, the Committee
shall designate the Option as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonqualified
Stock Option. The Committee shall also designate whether the option is granted
with Stock Appreciation Rights. Determinations by the Committee under the Plan
(including, without limitation, determinations of the person to receive Options,
the form, amount and timing of such Options, and the terms and provisions of
such Options and the agreements evidencing same) need not be uniform and may be
made by it selectively among persons who receive, or are eligible to receive,
Options under the Plan, whether or not such persons are similarly situated. In
serving on the Committee, members thereof shall be considered to be acting in
their capacity as members of the Board of Directors and shall be entitled to all
rights of indemnification provided by the Bylaws of the Company or otherwise to
members of the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or
the Committee may expressly delegate to a special committee consisting of one or
more directors who are also officers of the Company some or all of the
Committee&#146;s authority listed in this Section 1.3, excluding the power to
make regulations for carrying out the purpose of the Plan, with respect to those
eligible Key Employees who, at the time of grant are not, and are not
anticipated to become, either (i) covered employees (as that term is defined in
Code Section 162(m)(3)) or (ii) persons subject to the insider trading
restrictions of Section 16 of the 1934 Act.</font></p>

Subject to the Plan</U>.</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The
total number of shares that may be purchased pursuant to Options or transferred
pursuant to the exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights under the Plan shall not
exceed One Million (1,000,000) shares of Common Stock. Shares subject to the
Options which terminate or expire prior to exercise shall be available for
future Options under the Plan without again being charged against the limitation
of One Million (1,000,000) shares set forth above. Shares represented by an
unexercised Option surrendered upon an exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights
including, without duplication, any shares issued in payment of any Stock
Appreciation Rights, shall be deducted from the aggregate and shall not be
available for further Options hereunder. Shares issued pursuant to the Plan may
be either unissued shares of Common Stock or reacquired shares of Common Stock
held in treasury.</font></p>
<BR>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Terms and
Conditions of Options</U>.</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
All
Options shall be evidenced by agreements in such form as the Committee shall
approve from time to time subject to the provisions of Article II and Article
III, as appropriate, and the following provisions:</font></p>
<BR>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Exercise Price</U>.    Except as provided in Section  3.1,  the  exercise  price of the Option shall not be less
 than the Fair Market Value (as determined by the Committee) of the Common Stock at the time the Option is granted.<BR><BR>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Exercise</U>.  The Committee shall determine  whether the Option shall be exercisable in full at any time during
the Term or in cumulative or noncumulative installments during the Term.<BR><BR>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Termination of Employment</U>.  An Optionee's  Option shall expire on the  expiration of the Term specified in
        Section  2.1 or 3.1 as the case may be, or upon the  occurrence  of such  events as are  specified  in the  agreement.  If the
         option  agreement  permits  exercise of the Option after  termination  of  employment or after  termination  of service on the
         Board,  the Optionee  may exercise the option only with respect to the shares which could have been  purchased by the Optionee
         at the date of  termination  of employment or  termination  of service on the Board.  However,  the Committee  may, but is not
         required to, waive any  requirements  made pursuant to Section  1.5(b) so that some or all of the shares subject to the Option
         may be exercised  within the time  limitation  described  in this  subsection.  An  Optionee's  employment  shall be deemed to
         terminate on the last date for which he receives a regular wage or salary  payment.  An Optionee's  service on the Board shall
         be deemed to  terminate  immediately  after the last  meeting  of the Board or any  committee  thereof  in which the  Optionee
         participates  as a director  or, if later,  upon the date of his  resignation,  removal  or the  election  of his  ;successor.
         Whether  military,  government or other service or other leave of absence shall  constitute a termination of employment  shall
         be determined in each case by the  Committee at its  discretion,  and any  determination  by the Committee  shall be final and
         conclusive.  A  termination  of  employment  shall not occur  where the  Optionee  transfers  from the  Company  to one of its
         Subsidiaries or transfers from a Subsidiary to the Company or transfers between Subsidiaries.<BR><BR>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Death or  Disability</U>.  Upon  termination  of an  Optionee's  employment or service on the Board by reason of
         death or disability (as determined by the Committee  consistent  with the  definition of Section  422(c)(6) of the Code),  the
         Option shall expire on the earlier of the  expiration  of (i) the date  specified  in the option  agreement  which in no event
         shall be later than 12 months  after the date of such  termination,  or (ii) the Term  specified  in Section 2.1 or 3.1 as the
         case may be. The  Optionee or his  successor  in  interest,  as the case maybe,  may exercise the Option only as to the shares
         that could have been  purchased by the Optionee at the date of his  termination  of  employment.  However,  the Committee may,
         but is not required to, waive any  requirements  made pursuant to Section  1.5(b) so that some or all of the shares subject to
         the Option may be  exercised  within the time  limitation  described  in this  subsection.  In the case of Options  granted to
         directors who are not employees of the Company or its Subsidiary,  the Committee  shall  establish such  provisions  regarding
         termination as it shall determine in its sole discretion.<BR><BR>
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Payment</U>.  Payment  for shares as to which an Option is  exercised  shall be made in such  manner and at such
         time or times as shall be provided in the option  agreement,  including cash, Common Stock of the Company which was previously
         acquired by the Optionee,  or any combination  thereof.  The Fair Market Value of the surrendered  Common Stock as of the date
         of exercise shall be determined in valuing Common Stock used in payment for Options.<BR><BR>
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Nontransferability</U>.  No Option granted under the plan shall be  transferable  other than by will or the laws
         of descent and distribution.  During the lifetime of the Optionee, an Option shall be exercisable only by the Optionee.<BR><BR>
(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Additional  Provisions</U>.  Each option  agreement may contain such other terms and conditions not inconsistent
         with the  provisions  of the Plan,  including the award of cash amounts,  as the Committee may deem  appropriate  from time to
         time.<BR><BR>
(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Limitations  on Grant of Options</U>.  No Optionee may receive grants of Options or Stock  Appreciation  Rights,
         or any combination thereof, under the Plan with respect to more than 250,000 shares of Common Stock in any calendar year.</FONT>

Adjustments; Mergers</U>.</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Generally</U>.  Notwithstanding  Section 1.4, in the event that after  February 17,  1992 the outstanding shares
         are  increased or decreased or changed into or exchanged for a different  number or kind of shares or other  securities of the
         Company or of any other  corporation by reason of any merger,  sale of stock,  consolidation,  liquidation,  recapitalization,
         reclassification,  stock split up,  combination of shares,  share  exchange,  stock  dividend,  or transaction  having similar
         effect,  the total  number of shares set forth in Section  1.4 shall be  proportionately  and  appropriately  adjusted  by the
         Committee.<br><br>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Options and Stock Appreciation Rights</U>.  Following a transaction  described in subsection (a) above occurring
         after  February 17, 1992,  if the Company  continues in  existence,  (i) the number and kind of shares that are subject to any
         Option  and the  option  price per share  shall be  proportionately  and  appropriately  adjusted  without  any  change in the
         aggregate  price to be paid  therefor upon exercise of the Option,  and (ii) the  Committee may make such  adjustments  in the
         number and kind of Stock  Appreciation  Rights as it shall deem  appropriate  in the  circumstances.  If the Company  will not
         remain in existence or  substantially  all of its Common Stock will be purchased by a single  purchaser or group of purchasers
         acting  together,  then the Committee may (i) declare that all options and Stock  Appreciation  Rights shall terminate 30 days
         after the  Committee  gives  written  notice to all  Optionees  of their  immediate  right to  exercise  all Options and Stock
         Appreciation Rights then outstanding  (without regard to limitations on exercise otherwise contained in the Options),  or (ii)
         notify all  Optionees  that all Options and Stock  Appreciation  Rights  granted  under the Plan shall apply with  appropriate
         adjustments as determined by the Committee to the  securities of the successor  corporation to which holders of the numbers of
         shares  subject to such  Options and Stock  Appreciation  Rights would have been  entitled,  or (iii) take action that is some
         combination  of  aspects  of (i) and  (ii).  The  determination  by the  Committee  as to the  terms  of any of the  foregoing
         adjustments  shall be conclusive and binding.  Any fractional  shares  resulting from any of the foregoing  adjustments  under
         this section shall be disregarded and eliminated.</FONT></p>

In

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
The
Company recognizes that certain persons who receive Nonqualified Stock Options
may be subject to restrictions regarding their right to trade Common Stock under
applicable securities laws. Such restrictions may cause Optionee&#146;s
exercising such Options not to be taxable under the provisions of Section 83(c)
of the Code. Accordingly, Optionees exercising such Nonqualified Stock Options
may consider making an election to be taxed upon exercise of the Option under
Section 83(b) of the Code and to effect such election will file such election
with the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days of exercise of the
Option and otherwise in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations.</FONT></p>
