unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of this Agreement, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Agreement. In addition, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically, as a part of
this Agreement, a provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and enforceable, to the extent such reformation is allowable
under applicable law.
