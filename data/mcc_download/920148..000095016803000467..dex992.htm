genuine and sufficient and in accepting any tender or effecting any transfer of Old Notes reasonably believed by you in good faith to be authorized, and in delaying or refusing in good faith to accept any tenders or effect any transfer of Old Notes;

act in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or upon the instructions of the Issuer. In no case shall the Issuer be liable under this indemnity with respect to any claim against you unless the Issuer shall be notified by you, by letter or by
facsimile confirmed by letter, of the written assertion of a claim against you or of any other action commenced against you, promptly after you shall have received any such written assertion or notice of commencement of action. The Issuer shall be
entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of any such claim or other action, and, if the Issuer so elects, the Issuer shall assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any such claim. In the event that the Issuer shall assume
the defense of any such suit, the Issuer shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of any additional counsel thereafter retained by you so long as the Issuer shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to you to defend such suit. You agree not
to settle any claim or litigation in connection with any claim or liability with respect to which you may seek indemnification from the Issuer without the prior written consent of the Issuer. </FONT></P><P
