of death (but in no event later than the expiration date of this Option as set
forth in the Notice of Grant), by the Optionee's estate or by a person who
acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to
the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise the Option at the date of
death. If, after death, the Optionee's estate or a person who acquired the right
to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance does not exercise the Option
within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate.

      10. Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution, Merger or
Asset Sale.

            (a) Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required action by the
stockholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by
this Option, as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by this
Option, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the
number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common
Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of
Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided,
however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not
be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such
adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall
be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no
issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities
convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment
by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares
of Common Stock subject to this Option.

            (b) Dissolution or Liquidation. Except as provided by the Change In
Control Severance Agreement between the Company and Optionee dated July 31, 2002
(the "Severance Agreement"), to the extent the Option has not been previously
exercised, the Option will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of
such proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company.

            (c) Merger or Asset Sale. In the event of a merger of the Company
with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets
of the Company, the Option shall be assumed or an equivalent option substituted
by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor
corporation; provided, however, that such assumed or equivalent option shall be
continue to be subject to the provisions of the Severance Agreement. In the
event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the
Option, the Optionee shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise the
Option as to all of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which it would
not otherwise be vested or exercisable. If the Option becomes fully vested and
exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or
sale of assets, the Board shall notify the Optionee in writing or electronically
that the Option shall be fully exercisable for a period of ten (10) days from
the date of such notice, and the Option shall terminate upon the expiration of
such period.

                                                                             -5-
<PAGE>

For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option shall be considered assumed if,
following the merger or sale of assets, the option confers the right to purchase
or receive, for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option immediately
prior to the merger or sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash,
or other securities or property) received in the merger or sale of assets by
holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the
transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of
consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares);
provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or sale of
assets is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent,
the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide
for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option, for each
Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option, to be solely common stock of the
successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share
consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of
assets.

      11. Notices. Any notice to be given to the Company hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be addressed to the Company. at its then current principal
executive office or to such other address as the Company may hereafter designate
to the Optionee by notice as provided in this Section. Any notice to be given to
the Optionee hereunder shall be addressed to the Optionee at the address set
forth beneath his signature hereto, or at such other address as the Optionee may
hereafter designate to the Company by notice as provided herein. A notice shall
be deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or mailed by
registered or certified mail to the party entitled to receive it.

      12. Tax Consequences. Some of the federal tax consequences relating to
this Option, as of the date of this Option, are set forth below. THIS SUMMARY IS
NECESSARILY INCOMPLETE, AND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
THE OPTIONEE SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER BEFORE EXERCISING THIS OPTION OR
DISPOSING OF THE SHARES.

            (a) Exercising the Option. The Optionee may incur regular federal
income tax liability upon exercise of a Nonstatutory Stock Option (an "NSO").
The Optionee will be treated as having received compensation income (taxable at
ordinary income tax rates) equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value
of the Exercised Shares on the date of exercise over their aggregate Exercise
Price. If the Optionee is an Employee or a former Employee, the Company will be
required to withhold from his or her compensation or collect from Optionee and
pay to the applicable taxing authorities an amount in cash equal to a percentage
of this compensation income at the time of exercise, and may refuse to honor the
exercise and refuse to deliver Shares if such withholding amounts are not
delivered at the time of exercise.

            (b) Disposition of Shares. If the Optionee holds NSO Shares for at
least one year, any gain realized on disposition of the Shares will be treated
as long-term capital gain for federal income tax purposes.

      13. Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This Agreement constitute the entire
agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede
in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and
Optionee with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be modified
adversely to the Optionee's interest except by means of a writing

                                                                             -6-

signed by the Company and Optionee. This agreement is governed by the internal
substantive laws, but not the choice of law rules, of Washington.

THAT THE VESTING OF SHARES PURSUANT TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS EARNED
ONLY BY CONTINUING AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY (AND NOT
THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED AN OPTION OR PURCHASING SHARES
HEREUNDER). OPTIONEE FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO
NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUES ENGAGEMENT AS A
SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND SHALL
NOT INTERFERE WITH OPTIONEE'S RIGHT OR THE COMPANY'S RIGHT TO TERMINATE
OPTIONEE'S RELATIONSHIP AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT
CAUSE.
