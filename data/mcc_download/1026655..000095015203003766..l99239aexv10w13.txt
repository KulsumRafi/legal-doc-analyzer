                         CORE MOLDING TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
                        INFORMAL CASH PROFIT SHARING PLAN

         Core Molding has an informal cash profit sharing plan for its
management and salaried employees which is calculated as follows:

         A profit sharing pool is created after a reasonable return is provided
to stockholders.

         The Company's Board of Directors established thresholds for Earnings
Before Taxes ("EBT") to provide such return to the stockholders for each fiscal
year ended December 31.

         A profit sharing pool will be created based upon percentages of EBT for
each fiscal year ended December 31, above the thresholds which will be shared
with the permanent salaried employees in the form of profit sharing.

         A total profit sharing pool is limited to a maximum percentage of EBT
as established by the Board of Directors.

         The salaried profit sharing pool is split into two groups, an
"executive" group and a "salary" group. The executive group consists of the
Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Vice President of
Sales and Marketing, the Vice President of Operations - Columbus, and each
locations' plant manager.

         The executive group shares in 20% of the pool while the remaining
salary group shares in 80% of the pool.

         Employees must have been employed as of December 31 of each year to be
eligible to participate. There is no pro-rating for terminated employees.

         The Board of Directors reserves the right to change the plan as deemed
necessary.
