No. 2 Effective Date, Section 4.12 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and
restated in its entirety as set forth below:

                  Section 4.12 Security/Joint and Several Creditor.

                  (a) Security. The Obligations of the Borrowers shall be
                  secured under the Collateral Security Documents on a pari
                  passu basis with the obligations of the Borrowers to Allfirst
                  Bank under the Overdraft Facility, not exceeding a principal
                  amount of $25,000,000.

                  (b) Administrative Agent as Joint and Several Creditor.

                       (i) For the purpose of the Deed of Pledge of Shares, each
                  of the Borrowers and each of the Lenders agree that the
                  Administrative Agent (other than in its capacity as a Lender)
                  shall be the joint and several creditor (hoofdelijk
                  schuldeiser) (together with the relevant Lender) of each and
                  every obligation of any Borrower towards each of the other
                  Lenders and any other secured party (including without
                  limitation all parties to Hedging Agreements with a Borrower
                  or Borrowers) under the Loan Documents (collectively, the
                  "Secured Parties") and that accordingly the Administrative
                  Agent will have its own independent right to demand
                  performance by the relevant Borrower of those obligations.
                  However, any discharge of any such obligation to one of the
                  Administrative Agent or the relevant Secured Party shall, to
                  the same extent, discharge the corresponding obligation owing
                  to the other.

                       (ii) Without limiting or affecting the Administrative
                  Agent's rights against any Borrower (whether under this
                  Section or under any other provision of the Loan Documents),
                  the Administrative Agent, under the terms of Section 12.4,
                  shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
                  action in the protection or preservation of rights under or to
                  enforce the Deed of Pledge of

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
                  Shares as contemplated by this Agreement and/or the Deed of
                  Pledge of Shares (or to do any act reasonably incidental to
                  any of the foregoing) unless it shall first receive such
                  advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, when
                  expressly required hereby or by the Deed of Pledge of Shares,
                  all the Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be
                  indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and
                  all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
                  reason of taking or continuing to take any such action except
                  for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                  (iii) It is agreed and understood that the expression "Lender"
                  includes any assignees of Lenders that become party to the
                  Loan Documents, whether such assignees become a party to the
                  Loan Documents by an assignment of rights in accordance with
                  Section 13.10(b) (Assignment by Lenders) or otherwise.

                  5. Amendment to Section 10.1(f) (Limitations on Debt and
Guaranty Obligations). As of the Amendment No. 2 Effective Date, Section 10.1(f)
of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to strike the reference to "Schedule
6.1(t)" and replace it with a reference to "Schedule 6.1(s)".

                  6. Amendment and Restatement of Section 10.4(a). As of the
Amendment No. 2 Effective Date, Section 10.4(a) to the Credit Agreement is

                  Monetization Assets between Borrowers in connection with
                  Customer Financing transactions or Monetization Transactions);
                  provided, however, that Investments in all non-Borrower
                  Subsidiaries, other than Monetization Subsidiaries, by
                  Borrowers (other than the European Borrowers) shall not exceed

                  7. New Section 12.10. As of the Amendment No. 2 Effective
Date, an additional Section 12.10 (Deed of Pledge of Shares) is hereby added to
the Credit Agreement in its entirety:

                  12.10.  Deed of Pledge of Shares.

                  (a) The Administrative Agent as a Lender and as joint and
                  several creditor with the relevant other Secured Parties or
                  otherwise shall accept without investigation, requisition or
                  objection such title as any Person may have to the
                  undertaking, property and assets which are subject to the Deed
                  of Pledge of Shares and shall not be bound or concerned to
                  examine or enquire into nor be liable for any defect or
                  failure in the title of any person whether such defect or
                  failure was known to the Administrative Agent or might have
                  been discovered upon examination or enquiry and whether
                  capable of remedy or not nor for any failure on the part of
                  the Administrative Agent to give notice to any third party of
                  the Deed of Pledge of Shares or otherwise perfect or register
                  the security thereby created.

                  (b) The Administrative Agent shall hold all rights, titles and
                  interests that may now or at any time be mortgaged, pledged,
                  charged, assigned or granted in favor of the Administrative
                  Agent by or pursuant to the Deed of Pledge of Shares and the
                  proceeds of any such security as agent for itself in its
                  capacity as Lender and as agent for the Secured Parties and
                  joint and several creditor with the relevant Secured Party
                  from time to time in accordance with their respective rights
                  under the Loan Documents. The obligations, rights and benefits
                  vested or to be vested in the Administrative Agent by the Loan
                  Documents or any document entered into in accordance with such
                  documents shall (as well before as after enforcement) be
                  performed (as the case may be) and exercised in accordance
                  with the provisions of this Agreement.

                  (c) Each Lender (other than the Administrative Agent in its
                  capacity as Lender) hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent
                  to execute the Deed of Pledge of Shares as joint and several
                  creditor.

                  8. Additional Section 13.26. As of the Amendment No. 2
Effective Date, an additional Section 13.26 is hereby added to the Credit
Agreement in its entirety:

                  Section 13.26.  Judgment Currency.

                  (a) The Borrowers' obligations under the Loan Documents to
                  make payments in U.S. Dollars or Alternate Currency, as
                  applicable (the "Obligation Currency"), shall not be
                  discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to
                  any judgment expressed in or converted into any currency other
                  than the Obligation Currency,

                                      -5-
<PAGE>
                  except to the extent that such tender or recovery results in
                  the effective receipt by the Lenders of the full amount of the
                  Obligation Currency expressed to be payable to the Lenders
                  under the Loan Documents. If for the purpose of obtaining or
                  enforcing judgment against any Borrower in any court or in any
                  jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into or from any
                  currency other than the Obligation Currency (such other
                  currency being hereinafter referred to as the "Judgment
                  Currency") an amount due in the Obligation Currency, the
                  conversion shall be made at the rate of exchange (as quoted by
                  the Administrative Agent or if the Administrative Agent does
                  not quote a rate of exchange on such currency, by a known
                  dealer in such currency designated by the Administrative
                  Agent) determined, in each case, as of the day immediately
                  preceding the day on which the judgment is given (such
                  business day being hereinafter referred to as the "Judgment
                  Currency Conversion Date").

                  (b) If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing
                  between the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date of
                  actual payment of the amount due, the Borrowers covenant and
                  agree to pay, or cause to be paid, such additional amounts, if
                  any (but in any event not a lesser amount), as may be
                  necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment
                  Currency, when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on
                  the date of payment, will produce the amount of the Obligation
                  Currency which could have been purchased with the amount of
                  Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial award
                  at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency
                  Conversion Date. If a payment (when converted into the
                  Obligation Currency) actually received by any Lender exceeds
                  the amount due to such Lender hereunder, such Lender shall
                  repay the excess to the Borrowers.

                  (c) For purposes of determining any rate of exchange for this
                  Section 13.26, such amounts shall include any premium and
                  costs payable in connection with the purchase of the
                  Obligation Currency.

                  9. Amendment to Section 13.5 (Consent to Jurisdiction). The
following language is hereby added at the end of Section 13.5 of the Credit
Agreement:

                  To the extent that any Borrower has or hereafter may: (i)
                  acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court of the
                  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any Federal court sitting in
                  Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania or from any legal process
                  out of any such court (whether through service or notice,
                  attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution
                  of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) with respect
                  to itself or its property, or (ii)

                                      -6-
<PAGE>
                  have any objection to the laying of the venue or of an
                  inconvenient forum or any suit, action or proceeding, if
                  brought in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any Federal
                  court sitting in any county in Philadelphia County,
                  Pennsylvania under process served in accordance with this
                  Credit Agreement or any Loan Document, each Borrower hereby
                  irrevocably waives such immunity or objection in respect of
                  any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
                  any Loan Document.

                  10. Representations and Warranties. As of the Amendment No. 2
