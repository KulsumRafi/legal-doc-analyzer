                 AGREEMENT OF MERGER AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

          THIS AGREEMENT OF MERGER AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION is made and
entered into on March 6, 2003, by and among REFOCUS GROUP, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), REFOCUS ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation
("Acquisition Corp."), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and PRESBY
CORP, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

                              W I T N E S S E T H :

          WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Acquisition Corp., Parent
and the Company have each determined that it is fair to and in the best
interests of their respective corporations and stockholders for Acquisition
Corp. to be merged with and into the Company upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein;

          WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Acquisition Corp. and the Board of
Directors of the Company have approved the merger of Acquisition Corp. with and
into the Company in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL"), and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein and in the Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
attached as EXHIBIT A hereto; and the Board of Directors of Parent also has
approved this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger;

          WHEREAS, the requisite Stockholders (as such term is defined in
Section 10 hereof) have approved by written consent pursuant to Section 228 of
the DGCL this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, and Parent, as the sole
stockholder of Acquisition Corp., has approved this Agreement, the Certificate
of Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the
Merger; and

          WHEREAS, simultaneously herewith, Parent (as it will exist as of the
closing of the Merger) is selling shares of its common stock, par value $.0001
per share ("Parent Stock"), and detachable warrants to purchase shares of Parent
Stock ("Parent Warrants"), in a private placement to accredited investors (the
"Private Placement"), for the purpose of expanding the business of the Surviving
Corporation following the Merger.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements and
covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1.   The Merger.

          1.1     MERGER. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Certificate of Merger, Acquisition Corp. shall be merged with and into
the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. At the
Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), the separate legal existence of
Acquisition Corp. shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving

<Page>

Corporation") and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the
State of Delaware under the name Presby Corp.

          1.2     EFFECTIVE TIME. The Merger shall become effective on the date
and at the time the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. The time at
which the Merger shall become effective as aforesaid is referred to hereinafter
as the "Effective Time," and the filing of the Certificate of Merger as set
forth in the first sentence of this Section 1.2 shall be the last action
required prior to the Closing as contemplated hereby and as described in
Section 11 hereof.

          1.3     CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, BY-LAWS, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

                          (a)   The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, attached as EXHIBIT B
hereto, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
from and after the Effective Time until further amended in accordance with
applicable law.

                          (b)   The By-laws of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, attached as EXHIBIT C hereto, shall be
the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time until
amended in accordance with applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation and
such By-laws.

                          (c)   The directors and officers listed in EXHIBIT D
hereto shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, and
each shall hold his respective office or offices from and after the Effective
Time until his successor shall have been elected and shall have qualified in
accordance with applicable law, or as otherwise provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

          1.4     ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. At the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall possess all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises of a
public as well as of a private nature, and be subject to all the restrictions,
disabilities and duties of each of the constituent corporations; and all and
singular, the rights, privileges, powers and franchises of each of the
constituent corporations, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all
debts due to any of the constituent corporations on whatever account, as well
for stock subscriptions as all other things in action or belonging to each of
the constituent corporations shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation; and
all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and all and every other
interest shall be thereafter as effectively the property of the Surviving
Corporation as they were of the several and respective constituent corporations,
and the title to any real estate vested by deed or otherwise in any of such
constituent corporations shall not revert or be in any way impaired by the
Merger; but all rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of any of
the constituent corporations shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the respective constituent corporations shall
thenceforth attach to the Surviving Corporation, and may be enforced against it
to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred or
contracted by it.

          1.5     MANNER AND BASIS OF CONVERTING SHARES.

                          (a)   At the Effective Time:

                  (i)     each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share,
of Acquisition Corp. that shall be outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive ten (10) shares of
common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, so that
at the Effective Time, Parent shall be the holder of all of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation;

                  (ii)    the shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share
(the "Common Stock"), Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per
share (the "Series B Preferred Stock"), and Series C Convertible Preferred
Stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Company (the "Series C Preferred
Stock") (the Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock
being referred to herein collectively as the "Company Stock") beneficially owned
by the Stockholders listed in SCHEDULE 2.5 (other than shares of Company Stock
as to which appraisal rights are perfected after the Effective Time pursuant to
the applicable provisions of the DGCL and not withdrawn or otherwise forfeited),
which shares constitute all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, be converted into the right to receive the
number of shares of Parent Stock specified in SCHEDULE 2.5 for each of the
Stockholders:

                  (iii)   each share of Company Stock held in the treasury of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled in the
Merger and cease to exist.

                          (b)   After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

          1.6     SURRENDER AND EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. Promptly after the
Effective Time and upon (i) surrender of a certificate or certificates
representing shares of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) delivery of a Letter of Transmittal (as described in
Section 4 hereof), Parent shall issue to the record holder of the Company Stock
surrendering such certificate or certificates and Letter of Transmittal, a
certificate or certificates registered in the name of such Stockholder
representing the number of shares of Parent Stock that such Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive as set forth in Section 1.5(a)(ii) hereof. Until the
certificate or certificates are surrendered together with the Letter of
Transmittal as contemplated by this Section 1.6 and Section 4 hereof, each
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be deemed at and after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender as aforesaid the
consideration specified in SCHEDULE 2.5 hereof for the holder thereof or to
perfect any rights of appraisal which such holder may have pursuant to the
applicable provisions of the DGCL.

          1.7     STOCK OPTIONS; OTHER OPTIONS AND WARRANTS.

                                       3
<Page>

                          (a)   At the Effective Time, the terms of each
outstanding employee stock option granted by the Company to purchase shares of
Common Stock (a "Company Stock Option") under the Amended and Restated 1997
Stock Option Plan of the Company (the "Company Option Plan"), whether vested or
unvested, shall be adjusted as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time,
each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be deemed to constitute and shall become an option to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option, the
same number of shares of Parent Stock as the holder of such Company Stock Option
would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder
exercised such Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective
Time at a price per share of Parent Stock equal to (i) the aggregate exercise
price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to
such Company Stock Option divided by (ii) the aggregate number of shares of
Parent Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that, after aggregating all the shares of a holder subject to Company
Stock Options, any fractional share of Parent Stock resulting from such
calculation for such holder shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share; and
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that in the case of any stock option to which Section 421 of
the Code applies by reason of its qualification under any of Sections 422
through 424 of the Code ("qualified stock options"), the option price, the
number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option, and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order to comply
with Section 424 of the Code. As of the date hereof, there are outstanding
Company Stock Options to purchase 1,539,688 shares of Common Stock, which are
exercisable into 719,486 shares of Parent Stock pursuant to this Section 1.7(a).

                          (b)   As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices
setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the Company Option Plan and the
agreements evidencing the grants of such Company Stock Options and that such
Company Stock Options and agreements shall be assumed by Parent and shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments
required by this Section 1.7 after giving effect to the Merger).

                          (c)   Other than the Company Stock Options, all
options, warrants and rights to purchase Company Stock outstanding as of the
Effective Date will be exercised or terminated prior to or effective upon the
Effective Time, and neither Parent nor Acquisition Corp. shall assume or have
any obligation with respect to such options, warrants or rights.

          1.8     PARENT STOCK. Parent agrees that it will cause the Parent
Stock into which the Company Stock is converted at the Effective Time pursuant
to Section 1.5(a)(ii) to be available for such purpose. Parent further agrees
that immediately prior to the Effective Time there will be 4,097,107 shares of
Parent Stock issued and outstanding not including the shares of Parent Stock to
be issued in the Private Placement.

          1.9     OPERATION OF ACQUISITION CORP. The Company acknowledges that
upon the effectiveness of the Merger, Parent shall have the absolute and
unqualified right to deal with the assets and business of the Surviving
Corporation as its own property without limitation on the disposition or use of
such assets or the conduct of such business.

                                        4

          1.10    FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time to time, from and after the
Effective Time, as and when requested by Parent, Acquisition Corp. or their
respective successors or assigns, the proper officers and directors of the
Company as of the Effective Time shall, for and on behalf and in the name of the
Company or otherwise, shall execute and deliver all such deeds, bills of sale,
assignments and other instruments and shall take or cause to be taken such
further actions as Parent, Acquisition Corp. or their respective successors or
assigns may deem necessary or desirable in order to confirm or record or
otherwise transfer to the Surviving Corporation title to and possession of all
of the properties, rights, privileges, powers, franchises and immunities of the
Company or otherwise to carry out fully the provisions and purposes of this
Agreement and the Certificate of Merger.

     2.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY. The Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition Corp. as follows:

stock or other equity securities of such Subsidiaries, other than the capital

          2.2     QUALIFICATION. The Company is duly qualified to conduct
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction

not have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise),
properties, assets, liabilities, business operations, results of operations or
prospects of the Company taken as a whole (the "Condition of the Company").

          2.3     CAPITAL STOCK. The authorized capital stock of the Company

of Common Stock issued and outstanding, 4,481,396 shares of Series B Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding, and 21,614 shares of Series C Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding, and such shares are duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and

                                       5

preemptive rights of any person. The offer, issuance and sale of such shares of
Company Stock were (a) exempt from the registration and prospectus delivery
requirements of the Securities Act, (b) registered or qualified (or were exempt
from registration or qualification) under the registration or qualification
requirements of all applicable state securities laws and (c) accomplished in

agreement or arrangement among any of the beneficial holders of Company Stock
affecting the nomination or election of directors or the exercise of the voting
rights of Company Stock.

          2.6     CORPORATE ACTS AND PROCEEDINGS. The execution, delivery and

                          (f)   The Company has furnished to Parent and

to the periods covered by such returns have been paid. The Company is not and
has not been delinquent in the payment of any Tax. The Company has not had a Tax
deficiency proposed or assessed against it and has not executed a waiver of any
statute of limitations on the assessment or collection of any Tax. None of the
Company's federal income tax returns nor any state or local income or franchise

from each payment made to each of its employees the amount of all taxes
(including, but not limited to, federal, state and local income taxes, Federal
Insurance Contribution Act taxes and Federal Unemployment Tax Act taxes)
required to be withheld or collected therefrom, and has paid the same to the
proper Tax receiving officers or authorized depositaries. There are no federal,
state, local or foreign audits, actions, suits, proceedings, investigations,
claims or administrative proceedings relating to Taxes or any Tax Returns of the
Company now pending, and the Company has not received any notice of any proposed
audits, investigations, claims or administrative proceedings relating to Taxes
or any Tax Returns. The Company is not obligated to make a payment, or is a
party to an agreement that under certain circumstances could obligate it to make
a payment, that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code. The
Company has not agreed or is required to make any adjustments under
section 481(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local and foreign
law) by reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise for any Tax period
for which the applicable statute of limitations has not yet expired. The Company
(i) is not a party to, is bound by or has any obligation under, any Tax sharing
agreement, Tax indemnification agreement or similar contract or arrangement,
whether written or unwritten (collectively, "Tax Sharing Agreements"), or (ii)
has any potential liability or obligation to any person as a result of, or
pursuant to, any such Tax Sharing Agreements.

          2.16    PATENTS AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. (a) Except as set forth
in SCHEDULE 2.16, the Company (i) owns or has the right to use, free and clear
of all Liens, claims and restrictions, all patents, trademarks, service marks,
trade names, copyrights, licenses and rights with respect to the foregoing used
in or necessary for the conduct of its business as now conducted or proposed to
be conducted without infringing upon or otherwise acting adversely to the right
or claimed right of any Person under or with respect to any of the foregoing and
(ii) is not obligated or under any liability to make any payments by way of
royalties, fees or otherwise to any owner

                                       11
<Page>

or licensor of, or other claimant to, any patent, trademark, service mark, trade
name, copyright or other intangible asset, with respect to the use thereof or in
connection with the conduct of its business or otherwise.

                          (b)   To the best knowledge of the Company, the
Company owns and has the unrestricted right to use all trade secrets, if any,
including know-how, negative know-how, formulas, patterns, programs, devices,
methods, techniques, inventions, designs, processes, computer programs and
technical data and all information that derives independent economic value,
actual or potential, from not being generally known or known by competitors
(collectively, "intellectual property") required for or incident to the
development, operation and sale of all products and services sold by the
Company, free and clear of any right, Lien or claim of others; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, the possibility exists that other Persons, completely independent of
the Company or its employees or agents, could have developed intellectual
property similar or identical to that of the Company. Except as set forth in
SCHEDULE 2.21 hereof, the Company is not aware of any such development of
substantially identical trade secrets or technical information by others. All
intellectual property can and will be transferred by the Company to the
Surviving Corporation as a result of the Merger and without the consent of any
Person other than the Company.

          2.17    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS; ERISA. (a) Except as disclosed in

of Section 3(3) of the ERISA) nor any other employee benefit or fringe benefit
arrangements, practices, contracts, policies or programs of every type other
than programs merely involving the regular payment of wages, commissions, or
bonuses established, maintained or contributed to by the Company, whether
written or unwritten and whether or not funded. The plans listed in SCHEDULE
2.17 hereto are hereinafter referred to as the "Employee Benefit Plans."

                          (b)   All current and prior material documents,

compliance with the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code

foreign law.

                          (d)   There are no pending claims or lawsuits which
have been asserted or instituted against any Employee Benefit Plan, the assets
of any of the trusts or funds under the Employee Benefit Plans, the plan sponsor
or the plan administrator of any of the Employee Benefit Plans or against any
fiduciary of an Employee Benefit Plan with respect to the operation of such
plan, nor does the Company have any knowledge of any incident, transaction,
occurrence or circumstance which might reasonably be expected to form the basis
of any such claim or lawsuit.

                          (e)   There is no pending or contemplated
investigation or pending or possible enforcement action by the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service or
any other government agency with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan and the
Company has no knowledge of any incident, transaction,

                                       12
<Page>

occurrence or circumstance which might reasonably be expected to trigger such an
investigation or enforcement action.

                          (f)   No actual or contingent liability exists with
respect to the funding of any Employee Benefit Plan or for any other expense or
obligation of any Employee Benefit Plan, except as disclosed on the financial
statements of the Company or the Schedules to this Agreement, and no contingent
liability exists under ERISA with respect to any "multi-employer plan," as
defined in Section 3(37) or Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.

                          (g)   No events have occurred or are expected to occur
with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan that would cause a material change in
the costs of providing benefits under such Employee Benefit Plan or would cause
a material change in the cost of providing for other liabilities of such
Employee Benefit Plan.

          2.18    TITLE TO PROPERTY AND ENCUMBRANCES. The Company has good,
valid and indefeasible marketable title to all properties and assets used in the
conduct of its business free of all Liens (except as set forth in SCHEDULE 2.16)
and other encumbrances, except Permitted Liens and such ordinary and customary
imperfections of title, restrictions and encumbrances as do not, individually or
in the aggregate, materially detract from the value of the property or assets or
materially impair the use made thereof by the Company in its business. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company has good and indefeasible
title to all of its properties and assets reflected in the Balance Sheet, except
for property disposed of in the usual and ordinary course of business since the
Balance Sheet Date and for property held under valid and subsisting leases which

more of the policies of insurance issued by insurers of recognized
responsibility, insuring the Company and its properties, products and business
against such losses and risks, and in such amounts, as are customary for

sought or applied for, and the Company has no reason to believe that it will be
unable to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when the same shall

possible increases in premiums that do not result from any act or omission of
the Company. No suit, proceeding or action or threat of suit, proceeding or

reasonably be expected to result in or form the basis for any such action, suit,

100% of the amount thereof and have been collected, or are or will be
collectible in the usual and ordinary course of the Company's business, in the
full amounts thereof (less normal allowances for doubtful accounts). All of the
accounts receivable reflected on the Balance Sheet and all accounts receivable
which have arisen since the Balance Sheet Date are valid and enforceable claims,

implied warranties, purchase orders, agreements and specifications, and are not

will be usable or are being sold and will be saleable in the ordinary course of
its business with full mark-up at prevailing market prices, except to the extent
of reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventories reflected in the Balance
Sheet. Such inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and were
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied. The Company has not experienced, nor has any reason to
believe that it will experience in the foreseeable future, any material
difficulty in obtaining, in the desired quantity and quality and upon reasonable
terms and conditions, the raw materials, supplies or component products required
for the manufacture, assembly or production of its products.

          2.27    CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. Since the

commitment of the Company is in excess of normal, ordinary and usual
requirements of its business, or was made at any price in excess of then current
market price, or contains terms and conditions more onerous than those usual and
customary in the industry. There is no outstanding bid, sales proposal, contract

the Company to supply goods or services at a cost to the Company significantly
in excess of the normal cost of goods or services established for the product or
service in question, or (b) quotes prices which do not include a mark-up over
reasonably estimated costs reasonably consistent with past mark-ups on similar
business.

          2.30    QUESTIONABLE PAYMENTS. Neither the Company nor any director,

inquiry of its directors, officers and key personnel.

          2.33    DISCLOSURE. There is no fact relating to the Company that the
Company has not disclosed to Parent and Acquisition Corp. in writing which
materially and adversely affects nor, insofar as the Company can now foresee,
will materially and adversely affect, the Condition of the Company. No
representation or warranty by the Company herein and no information disclosed in
the schedules or exhibits hereto by the Company contains any untrue statement of
a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements contained herein or therein not misleading.

     3.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION CORP. Parent
and Acquisition Corp. represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

          3.1     ORGANIZATION AND STANDING. Each of Parent and Acquisition
Corp. is a corporation duly organized and existing in good standing under the

direct or indirect interest (by way of stock ownership or otherwise) in any
firm, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association or
business. Parent owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
Acquisition Corp. free and clear of all Liens, and Acquisition Corp. has no
outstanding options, warrants or rights to purchase capital stock or other
equity securities of Acquisition Corp., other than the capital stock owned by

                                       16
<Page>

          3.2     QUALIFICATION. Each of Parent and Acquisition Corp. is duly
qualified to conduct business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing
in such jurisdictions wherein the nature of its activities or its properties
owned or leased makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so qualified would not have a material adverse effect on the condition
(financial or otherwise), properties, assets, liabilities, business operations,
results of operations or prospects of the Parent (the "Condition of Parent").

          3.3     CORPORATE AUTHORITY. Each of Parent and/or Acquisition Corp.
(as the case may be) has full corporate power and authority to enter into the
Merger Documentation and the other agreements to be made pursuant to the Merger
Documentation, and to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. All corporate acts and proceedings required for the authorization,
execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Documentation and such other
agreements and documents by Parent and/or Acquisition Corp. (as the case may be)
have been duly and validly taken or will have been so taken prior to the
Closing. Each of the Merger Documents constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent and/or Acquisition Corp. (as the case may be), each
enforceable against them in accordance with their respective terms, except as
such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity.

          3.4     BROKER'S AND FINDER'S FEES. No person, firm, corporation or
other entity is entitled by reason of any act or omission of Parent or
Acquisition Corp. to any broker's or finder's fees, commission or other similar
compensation with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Certificate of Merger, or with respect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, except as disclosed in SCHEDULE 3.4 HERETO.

          3.5     CAPITALIZATION OF PARENT. The authorized capital stock of

(b) 60,000,000 shares of the Parent Stock, of which 4,097,107 shares are issued
and outstanding on the date hereof, prior to taking into consideration the
issuance of Parent Stock in the Private Placement and after taking into
consideration the cancellation of Parent Stock as indicated in

no outstanding options, rights or commitments to issue shares of Parent
Preferred Stock, Parent Common Stock, or any other Equity Security of Parent or
Acquisition Corp, and there are no outstanding securities convertible or
exercisable into or exchangeable for shares of Parent Preferred Stock, Parent
Common Stock or other any Equity Security of Parent or Acquisition Corp. To the
best knowledge of Parent, there is no voting trust, agreement or arrangement
among any of the beneficial holders of Parent Stock affecting the nomination or
election of directors or the exercise of the voting rights of Parent Stock. All
outstanding shares of the capital stock of Parent are validly issued and
outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, and none of such shares have been
issued in violation of the preemptive rights of any person.

          3.6     ACQUISITION CORP. Acquisition Corp. is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent that was formed specifically for the purpose of the Merger
and that has not conducted any business or acquired any property, and will not
conduct any business or acquire any property, prior to the Closing Date, except
in preparation for and otherwise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the other
agreements to be made pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement and the
