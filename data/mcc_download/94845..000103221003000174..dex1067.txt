adversely affect the rights and remedies of the Secured Party hereunder with
respect thereto.

          (c) IP Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing

foregoing rights acquired by such Grantor after the date hereof or the date of
the last such notice, as the case may be. Within 45 days after the end of each

Office of the United States. Upon delivery to the Secured Party of an IP
Supplement, Schedules 1(f)(i), 1(f)(ii) and 1(f)(iii) attached hereto and
Schedule A to each Grant, as applicable, shall be deemed modified to include
reference to any right, title or interest in any existing IP Collateral or any
IP Collateral set forth on Schedule A to such IP Supplement. Each Grantor hereby
authorizes the Secured Party to modify this Agreement without the signature or
consent of any Grantor by attaching Schedules 1(f)(i), 1(f)(ii) and 1(f)(iii),
as applicable, that have been modified to include such IP Collateral or to
delete any reference to any right, title or interest in any IP Collateral in
which any Grantor no longer has or claims any right, title or interest;
provided, the failure of any Grantor to execute an IP Supplement with respect to
--------
any additional IP Collateral pledged pursuant to this Agreement shall not impair
the security interest of the Secured Party therein or otherwise adversely affect
the rights and remedies of the Secured Party hereunder with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Grantor shall not be required to record the
security interest of the Secured Party in any IP Collateral, if such recordation
would result in the grant of a Trademark Registration, Patent or Copyright
Registration, or any application therefor, in the name of the Secured Party.

shall be, and shall forthwith be delivered to the Secured Party to hold as,
Securities Collateral and shall, if received by such Grantor, be received in
trust for the benefit of the Secured Party, be segregated from the other
property or funds of such Grantor and be forthwith delivered to the Secured
Party as Securities Collateral in the same form as so received (with all
necessary endorsements); and (iii) the Secured Party shall promptly execute and
deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to such Grantor all such
proxies, dividend payment orders and other instruments as such Grantor may from
time to time reasonably request for the purpose of enabling such Grantor to
exercise the voting and other consensual rights which it is entitled to exercise
pursuant to clause (i) above and to receive the dividends, distributions,
principal or interest payments which it is authorized to receive and retain
pursuant to clause (ii) above.

          Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
Default, (x) upon written notice from the Secured Party to any Grantor, all
rights of such Grantor to exercise the voting and other consensual rights which
it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant hereto shall cease, and all
such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Secured Party who shall
thereupon have the sole right to exercise such voting and other consensual
rights; (y) all rights of such Grantor to receive the dividends, other
distributions and interest payments which it

                                       16          Pledge and Security Agreement

<PAGE>

would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant hereto shall
cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Secured Party
who shall thereupon have the sole right to receive and hold as Securities
Collateral such dividends, other distributions and interest payments; and (z)
all dividends, principal, interest payments and other distributions which are
received by such Grantor contrary to the provisions of clause (ii) of the
immediately preceding paragraph or clause (y) above shall be received in trust
for the benefit of the Secured Party, shall be segregated from other funds of
such Grantor and shall forthwith be paid over to the Secured Party as
Securities Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary
endorsements).

               In order to permit the Secured Party to exercise the voting and
other consensual rights which it may be entitled to exercise pursuant hereto and
to receive all dividends and other distributions which it may be entitled to
receive hereunder, (I) each Grantor shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause
to be executed and delivered) to the Secured Party all such proxies, dividend
payment orders and other instruments as the Secured Party may from time to time
reasonably request, and (II) without limiting the effect of clause (I) above,
each Grantor hereby grants to the Secured Party an irrevocable proxy to vote the
Pledged Interests and to exercise all other rights, powers, privileges and
remedies to which a holder of the Pledged Interests would be entitled (including
giving or withholding written consents of shareholders or other holders of
equity interests, calling special meetings of shareholders or other holders of
equity interests and voting at such meetings), which proxy shall be effective,
automatically and without the necessity of any action (including any transfer of
any Pledged Interests on the record books of the issuer thereof) by any other
Person (including the issuer of the Pledged Interests or any officer or agent
thereof), upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and which proxy shall only
terminate upon the payment in full of the Secured Obligations.

SECTION 10. Special Covenants With Respect to the IP Collateral.
            ---------------------------------------------------

          (a)  Each Grantor shall:

               (i)   diligently keep reasonable records respecting the IP
     Collateral and at all times keep at least one complete set of its records
     concerning such Collateral at its chief executive office or principal place
     of business;

               (ii)  use commercially reasonable efforts so as not to permit the
     inclusion in any contract to which it hereafter becomes a party of any
     provision that could or might in any way impair or prevent the creation of
     a security interest in, or the assignment of, such Grantor's rights and
     interests in any property included within the definitions of any IP
     Collateral acquired under such contracts;

               (iii) take any and all reasonable steps to protect the secrecy of
     all trade secrets relating to the products and services sold or delivered
     under or in connection with the IP Collateral, including where appropriate
     entering into confidentiality agreements with employees and labeling and
     restricting access to secret information and documents;

               (iv)  use proper statutory notice in connection with its use of
     any of the IP Collateral, except where the failure to give such notice
     would not have a Material Adverse Effect;

                                       17          Pledge and Security Agreement

<PAGE>

               (v)   use a commercially appropriate standard of quality
     (which may be consistent with such Grantor's past practices) in the
     manufacture, sale and delivery of products and services sold or delivered
     under or in connection with the Trademarks; and

               (vi)  furnish to the Secured Party from time to time at the
     Secured Party's reasonable request statements and schedules further
     identifying and describing any IP Collateral and such other reports in
     connection with such Collateral, all in reasonable detail.

          (b)  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10, each Grantor
                                                    ----------
shall continue to collect, at its own expense, all amounts due or to become due
to such Grantor in respect of the IP Collateral or any portion thereof. In
connection with such collections, each Grantor may take (and, after the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default at the Secured
Party's reasonable direction, shall take) such action as such Grantor or the
Secured Party may deem reasonably necessary or advisable to enforce collection
of such amounts; provided, the Secured Party shall have the right at any time,
                 --------
upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default and upon
written notice to such Grantor of its intention to do so, to notify the obligors
with respect to any such amounts of the existence of the security interest
created hereby and to direct such obligors to make payment of all such amounts
directly to the Secured Party, and, upon such notification and at the expense of
such Grantor, to enforce collection of any such amounts and to adjust, settle or
compromise the amount or payment thereof, in the same manner and to the same
extent as such Grantor might have done. After receipt by any Grantor of the
notice from the Secured Party referred to in the proviso to the preceding
sentence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, (i) all amounts
and proceeds (including checks and other instruments) received by each Grantor
in respect of amounts due to such Grantor in respect of the IP Collateral or any
portion thereof shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Secured Party
hereunder, shall be segregated from other funds of such Grantor and shall be
forthwith paid over or delivered to the Secured Party in the same form as so
received (with any necessary endorsement) to be held as cash Collateral and
applied as provided by Section 17 hereof, and (ii) such Grantor shall not
                       ----------
adjust, settle or compromise the amount or payment of any such amount or release
wholly or partly any obligor with respect thereto or allow any credit or
discount thereon.

          (c)  Each Grantor shall have the duty diligently, through counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Secured Party, to prosecute, file and/or make,
unless and until such Grantor, in its commercially reasonable judgment, decides
otherwise, (i) any application relating to any of the IP Collateral owned, held
or used by such Grantor and set forth on Schedules 1(f)(i), 1(f)(ii) or
1(f)(iii) attached hereto, as applicable, that is pending as of the date of this
Agreement, (ii) any Copyright Registration on any existing or future
unregistered but copyrightable works (except for works of nominal commercial
value or with respect to which such Grantor has determined in the exercise of
its commercially reasonable judgment that it shall not seek registration), (iii)
application on any future patentable but unpatented innovation or invention
comprising IP Collateral, and (iv) any Trademark opposition and cancellation
proceedings, renew Trademark Registrations and Copyright Registrations and do
any and all acts which are necessary or desirable to preserve and maintain all
rights in all IP Collateral. Any expenses incurred in connection therewith shall
be borne solely by the Grantors. Subject to the foregoing, each Grantor shall,
within 45 days after the end of each Fiscal Quarter of the Borrower, give the

                                       18          Pledge and Security Agreement

<PAGE>

Secured Party written notice of any abandonment of any IP Collateral registered
with a Governmental Authority or any pending patent application or any Patent.

          (d)  Except as provided herein, each Grantor shall have the right to
commence and prosecute in its own name, as real party in interest, for its own
benefit and at its own expense, such suits, proceedings or other actions for
infringement, unfair competition, dilution, misappropriation or other damage, or
reexamination or reissue proceedings as are necessary to protect the IP
Collateral. The Secured Party shall provide, at such Grantor's expense, all
reasonable and necessary cooperation in connection with any such suit,
proceeding or action including joining as a necessary party. Each Grantor shall,
within 45 days after the end of each Fiscal Quarter of the Borrower, notify the
Secured Party of the institution of, or of any adverse determination that would
be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect in, any proceeding
(whether in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States
Copyright Office or any federal, state, local or foreign court) or regarding
such Grantor's ownership, right to use, or interest in any IP Collateral. Each
Grantor shall provide to the Secured Party any information with respect thereto
requested by the Secured Party.

          (e)  In addition to, and not by way of limitation of, the granting of
a security interest in the Collateral pursuant hereto, each Grantor, effective
upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, hereby
assigns, transfers and conveys to the Secured Party the nonexclusive right and
license to use all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents or technical
processes (including the IP Collateral) owned or used by such Grantor that
relate to the Collateral and any other collateral granted by such Grantor as
security for the Secured Obligations, together with any goodwill associated
therewith, all to the extent necessary to enable the Secured Party to realize on
the Collateral in accordance with this Agreement and to enable any transferee or
assignee of the Collateral to enjoy the benefits of the Collateral; provided,
                                                                    --------
however, the license granted under this Section 10(e) shall not be construed to
                                        -------------
limit such Grantor's ability to take reasonable steps, in accordance with its
then current business practices, to protect and preserve the Trademarks, the
Trademark Registrations, the Trademark Rights and the Associated Goodwill. This
right shall inure to the benefit of all successors, assigns and transferees of
the Secured Party and its successors, assigns and transferees, whether by
voluntary conveyance, operation of law, assignment, transfer, foreclosure, deed
in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise. Such right and license shall be granted
free of charge, without requirement that any monetary payment whatsoever be made
to such Grantor. In addition, each Grantor hereby grants to the Secured Party
and its employees, representatives and agents the right to visit such Grantor's
and any of its Affiliate's or subcontractor's plants, facilities and other
places of business that are utilized in connection with the manufacture,
production, inspection, storage or sale of products and services sold or
delivered under any of the IP Collateral (or which were so utilized during the
prior six month period), and to inspect the quality control and all other
records relating thereto upon reasonable advance written notice to such Grantor
and at reasonable dates and times and as often as may be reasonably requested.
If and to the extent that any Grantor is permitted to license the IP Collateral,
the Secured Party shall promptly enter into a non-disturbance agreement or other
similar arrangement, at such Grantor's request and expense, with such Grantor
and any licensee of any IP Collateral permitted hereunder in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Secured Party pursuant to which (i) the Secured
Party shall agree not to disturb or interfere with such licensee's rights under
its license agreement with such Grantor so long as such licensee is not in
default thereunder, and


                                       19          Pledge and Security Agreement

<PAGE>

(ii) such licensee shall acknowledge and agree that the IP Collateral licensed
to it is subject to the security interest created in favor of the Secured Party
and the other terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 11. Cash Collateral Accounts.
            ------------------------

          The Secured Party is hereby authorized to establish and maintain as
blocked accounts in the name of the Borrower and under the sole dominion and
control of the Secured Party, a restricted deposit account designated as "Levi
Strauss & Co. Cash Collateral Account" (the "Cash Collateral Account") and a
restricted deposit account designated as "Levi Strauss & Co. L/C Cash Collateral
Account" the "L/C Cash Collateral Account"). All amounts at any time held in the
Cash Collateral Account and the L/C Cash Collateral Account shall be
beneficially owned by the Grantors but shall be held in the name of the Secured
Party hereunder, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Selected Revolving
Lenders, as collateral security for the Secured Obligations upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein. The Grantors shall have no right to withdraw,
transfer or, except as expressly set forth herein, otherwise receive any funds
deposited into the Cash Collateral Account and the L/C Cash Collateral Account.
Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Cash Collateral
Account and the L/C Cash Collateral Account shall be subject to such applicable
laws, and such applicable regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System and of any other appropriate banking or governmental authority,
as may now or hereafter be in effect. All deposits of funds in the Cash
Collateral Account and the L/C Cash Collateral Account shall be made by wire
transfer (or, if applicable, by intra-bank transfer from another account of a
Grantor) of immediately available funds, in each case addressed in accordance
with instructions of the Secured Party. Each Grantor shall, promptly after
initiating a transfer of funds to the Cash Collateral Account, give notice to
the Secured Party by telefacsimile of the date, amount and method of delivery of
such deposit. Cash held by the Secured Party in the Cash Collateral Account and
the L/C Cash Collateral Account shall not be invested by the Secured Party but
instead shall be maintained as a cash deposit in the Cash Collateral Account and
the L/C Cash Collateral Account pending application thereof as elsewhere
provided in this Agreement. To the extent permitted under Regulation Q of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, any cash held in the Cash
Collateral Account and the L/C Cash Collateral Account shall bear interest at
the standard rate paid by the Secured Party to its customers for deposits of
like amounts and terms. Subject to the Secured Party's rights hereunder, any
interest earned on deposits of cash in the Cash Collateral Account and the L/C
Cash Collateral Account shall be deposited directly in, and held in the Cash
Collateral Account and the L/C Cash Collateral Account.

SECTION 12. Secured Party Appointed Attorney-in-Fact.
            ----------------------------------------

          Each Grantor hereby irrevocably appoints the Secured Party as such
Grantor's attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such
Grantor and in the name of such Grantor, the Secured Party or otherwise, from
time to time in the Secured Party's discretion to take any action and to execute
any instrument that the Secured Party may deem necessary or advisable to
accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, including:

          (a) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, to obtain and adjust insurance required to be maintained by such
Grantor or paid to Administrative Agent pursuant to the Credit Agreement;


                                       20          Pledge and Security Agreement

<PAGE>

     (b) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
to ask for, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compound, receive and give
acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become due under or in respect of
any of the Collateral;

     (c) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
to receive, endorse and collect any drafts or other instruments, documents and
chattel paper in connection with clauses (a) and (b) above;

     (d) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
to file any claims or take any action or institute any proceedings that the
Secured Party may deem necessary or desirable for the collection of any of the
Collateral or otherwise to enforce the rights of the Secured Party with respect
to any of the Collateral;

     (e) except as otherwise permitted by the Credit Agreement, to pay or
discharge taxes or Liens (other than Liens permitted under this Agreement or the
Credit Agreement) levied or placed upon or threatened against the Collateral,
the legality or validity thereof and the amounts necessary to discharge the same
to be determined by the Secured Party in its sole discretion, any such payments
made by the Secured Party to become Obligations of such Grantor to the Secured
Party, due and payable immediately without demand;

     (f) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
to sign and endorse any invoices, freight or express bills, bills of lading,
storage or warehouse receipts, drafts against debtors, assignments,
verifications and notices in connection with Accounts and other documents
relating to the Collateral; and

     (g) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
generally to sell, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or
otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as though the
Secured Party were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and to do, at
the Secured Party's option and the Grantors' expense, at any time or from time
to time, all acts and things that the Secured Party deems necessary to protect,
preserve or realize upon the Collateral and the Secured Party's security
interest therein in order to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as fully
and effectively as such Grantor might do.

SECTION 13. Secured Party May Perform.
            -------------------------

     If any Grantor fails to perform any agreement contained herein, the Secured
Party may itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement, and the
expenses of the Secured Party incurred in connection therewith shall be payable
by the Grantors under Section 18(b) hereof.
                      -------------

SECTION 14. Standard of Care.
            ----------------

     The powers conferred on the Secured Party hereunder are solely to protect
its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise
any such powers. Except for the exercise of reasonable care in the custody of
any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received
by it hereunder, the Secured Party shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as
to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or
any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. The Secured Party shall be deemed
to

                                       21          Pledge and Security Agreement

<PAGE>

have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of Collateral in
its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to
that which the Secured Party accords its own property.

SECTION 15. Remedies.
            --------

     (a) Generally. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Secured Party may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in
addition to all other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise
available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under
the UCC (whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral), and also
may (i) require each Grantor to, and each Grantor hereby agrees that it will at
its expense and upon request of the Secured Party forthwith, assemble all or
part of the Collateral as directed by the Secured Party and make it available to
the Secured Party at a place to be designated by the Secured Party that is
reasonably convenient to both parties, (ii) enter onto the property where any
Collateral is located and take possession thereof with or without judicial
process, (iii) prior to the disposition of the Collateral, store, process,
repair or recondition the Collateral or otherwise prepare the Collateral for
disposition in any manner to the extent the Secured Party deems appropriate,
(iv) take possession of any Grantor's premises or place custodians in exclusive
control thereof, remain on such premises and use the same and any of such
Grantor's equipment for the purpose of completing any work in process, taking
any actions described in the preceding clause (iii) and collecting any Secured
Obligation, (v) without notice except as specified below, sell the Collateral or
any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the
Secured Party's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future
delivery, at such time or times and at such price or prices and upon such other
terms as the Secured Party may deem commercially reasonable, (vi) exercise
dominion and control over and refuse to permit further withdrawals from any
Deposit Account maintained with the Secured Party or any Lender and provide
instructions directing the disposition of funds in Deposit Accounts not
maintained with Secured Party or any Lender, (vii) provide entitlement orders
with respect to security entitlements and other investment property]
constituting a part of the Collateral, and (viii) without notice to any Grantor,
transfer to or to register in the name of the Secured Party or any of its
nominees any or all of the Securities Collateral. The Secured Party or any
Lender or Selected Revolving Lender may be the purchaser of any or all of the
Collateral at any such sale and the Secured Party, as agent for and
representative of the Lenders and the Selected Revolving Lenders (but not any
Lender or Selected Revolving Lender in its individual capacity unless Required
Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing), shall be entitled, for the purpose of
bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any
portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of
the Secured Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any
Collateral payable by the Secured Party at such sale. Each purchaser at any such
sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the
part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) all rights of redemption, stay and/or appraisal which it now has
or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now
existing or hereafter enacted. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of
sale shall be required by law, at least ten days' notice to such Grantor of the
time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to
be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Secured Party shall not be
obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having
been given. The Secured Party may adjourn any public or private sale from time
to time by announcement at the time and place fixed

                                       22          Pledge and Security Agreement

<PAGE>

therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and
place to which it was so adjourned. Each Grantor hereby waives any claims
against the Secured Party arising by reason of the fact that the price at which
any Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price
which might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the Secured Party
accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Collateral to more than
one offeree. If the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral
are insufficient to pay all the Secured Obligations, the Grantors shall be
jointly and severally liable for the deficiency and the fees of any attorneys
employed by the Secured Party to collect such deficiency. Each Grantor further
agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 15 will
                                                               ----------
cause irreparable injury to the Secured Party, that the Secured Party has no
adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that
each and every covenant contained in this Section 15 shall be specifically
                                          ----------
enforceable against such Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives and agrees not
to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance of such
covenants except for a defense that no default has occurred giving rise to the
Secured Obligations becoming due and payable prior to their stated maturities.

          (b)  Securities Collateral.

               (i)  Each Grantor recognizes that, by reason of certain
     prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933 and the regulations
     promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act") and applicable state
     securities laws, the Secured Party may be compelled, with respect to any
     sale of all or any part of the Securities Collateral conducted without
     prior registration or qualification of such Securities Collateral under the
     Securities Act and/or such state securities laws, to limit purchasers to
     those who will agree, among other things, to acquire the Securities
     Collateral for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the
     distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges that any such
     private sales may be at prices and on terms less favorable than those
     obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions (including a
     public offering made pursuant to a registration statement under the
     Securities Act) and, notwithstanding such circumstances and the
     registration rights granted to the Secured Party by such Grantor pursuant
     hereto and notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9-610(c) of the UCC,
     which each Grantor hereby waives, each Grantor agrees that any such private
     sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner
     and that the Secured Party shall have no obligation to engage in public
     sales and no obligation to delay the sale of any Securities Collateral for
     the period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register it
     for a form of public sale requiring registration under the Securities Act
     or under applicable state securities laws, even if such issuer would, or
     should, agree to so register it. If the Secured Party determines to
     exercise its right to sell any or all of the Securities Collateral, upon
     written request, each Grantor shall and shall cause each issuer of any
     Pledged Interests to be sold hereunder from time to time to furnish to the
     Secured Party all such information as the Secured Party may request in
     order to determine the number of shares and other instruments included in
     the Securities Collateral which may be sold by the Secured Party in exempt
     transactions under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the
     Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, as the same are from time to
     time in effect.

                                       23          Pledge and Security Agreement

<PAGE>

               (ii)  If the Secured Party shall determine to exercise its right
     to sell all or any of the Securities Collateral pursuant to this Section
                                                                      -------
     15, each Grantor agrees that, upon request of the Secured Party (which
     --
     request may be made by the Secured Party in its sole discretion), such
     Grantor will, at its own expense (A) execute and deliver, and cause each
     issuer of the Securities Collateral contemplated to be sold and the
     directors and officers thereof to execute and deliver, all such instruments
     and documents, and do or cause to be done all such other acts and things,
     as may be necessary or, in the opinion of the Secured Party, advisable to
     register such Securities Collateral under the provisions of the Securities
     Act and to cause the registration statement relating thereto to become
     effective and to remain effective for such period as prospectuses are
     required by law to be furnished, and to make all amendments and supplements
     thereto and to the related prospectus which, in the opinion of the Secured
     Party, are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the requirements
     of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and
     Exchange Commission applicable thereto; (B) use its best efforts to qualify
     the Securities Collateral under all applicable state securities or "Blue
     Sky" laws and to obtain all necessary governmental approvals for the sale
     of the Securities Collateral, as requested by the Secured Party; (C) cause
     each such issuer to make available to its security holders, as soon as
     practicable, an earnings statement which will satisfy the provisions of
     Section 11(a) of the Securities Act; (D) do or cause to be done all such
     other acts and things as may be necessary to make such sale of the
     Securities Collateral or any part thereof valid and binding and in
     compliance with applicable law; and (E) bear all costs and expenses,
     including reasonable attorneys' fees, of carrying out its Obligations under
     this Section 15.
          ----------

               (iii) Without limiting the generality of Sections 10.04 and 10.05
     of the Credit Agreement, in the event of any public sale described herein,
     each Grantor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless (to the maximum extent
     permitted under the Securities Act or other applicable law) the Secured
     Party, and each Lender and each Selected Revolving Lender and each of their
     respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any
     loss, fee, cost, expense, damage, liability or claim, joint or several, to
     which any such Persons may become subject or for which any of them may be
     liable, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
     fees, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities or claims (or any litigation
     commenced or threatened in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
     an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
     contained in any preliminary prospectus, registration statement, prospectus
     or other such document published or filed in connection with such public
     sale, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based
     upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
     required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
     not misleading, and will (to the maximum extent permitted under the
     Securities Act or other applicable law) reimburse the Secured Party and
     such other Persons for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
     the Secured Party and such other Persons in connection with any litigation,
     of any nature whatsoever, commenced or threatened in respect thereof
     (including any and all fees, costs and expenses whatsoever reasonably
     incurred by the Secured Party and such other Persons and counsel for the
     Secured Party and such other Persons in investigating, preparing for,
     defending against or providing evidence, producing documents or taking any
     other action in respect of, any such commenced or threatened litigation or
     any claims asserted). This

                                       24          Pledge and Security Agreement

<PAGE>

     indemnity shall be in addition to any liability which any Grantor may
     otherwise have and shall extend upon the same terms and conditions to each
     Person, if any, that controls the Secured Party or such Persons within the
     meaning of the Securities Act.

          (c) L/C Cash Collateral Account. If an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing and, in accordance with Section 8.02 of the Credit Agreement,
the Borrower is required to pay to the Secured Party an amount (the "Aggregate
Available Amount") equal to the maximum amount that may at any time be drawn
under all Letters of Credit then outstanding under the Credit Agreement, the
Borrower shall deliver funds in such an amount for deposit in the L/C Cash
Collateral Account. If for any reason the aggregate amount delivered by the
Borrower for deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account as aforesaid is less
than the Aggregate Available Amount, the aggregate amount so delivered by the
Borrower shall be apportioned among all outstanding Letters of Credit for
purposes of this Section 15 in accordance with the ratio of the maximum amount
                 ----------
available for drawing under each such Letter of Credit (as to such Letter of
Credit, the "Maximum Available Amount") to the Aggregate Available Amount. Upon
any drawing under any outstanding Letter of Credit in respect of which the
Borrower has deposited in the L/C Cash Collateral Account any amounts described
above, the Secured Party shall apply such amounts to reimburse the L/C Issuer
for the amount of such drawing. In the event of cancellation or expiration of
any Letter of Credit in respect of which the Borrower has deposited in the L/C
Cash Collateral Account any amounts described above, or in the event of any
reduction in the Maximum Available Amount under such Letter of Credit, the
Secured Party shall apply the amount then on deposit in the L/C Collateral
Account in respect of such Letter of Credit (less, in the case of such a
reduction, the Maximum Available Amount under such Letter of Credit immediately
after such reduction) first, to the payment of any amounts payable to the
Secured Party pursuant to Section 17 hereof, second, to the extent of any
                          ----------
excess, to the cash collateralization pursuant to the terms of this Agreement of
any outstanding Letters of Credit in respect of which the Borrower has failed to
pay all or a portion of the amounts described above (such cash collateralization
to be apportioned among all such Letters of Credit in the manner described
above), third, to the extent of any further excess, to the payment of any other
outstanding Secured Obligations in such order as the Secured Party shall elect,
and fourth, to the extent of any further excess, to the payment to whomsoever
shall be lawfully entitled to receive such funds.

          (d) Cash Collateral Account. If an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, the Borrower shall deliver any and all cash dividends paid or
payable to it or any of its Subsidiaries from any of its Subsidiaries from time
to time for deposit in the Cash Collateral Account. Amounts in the Cash
Collateral Account shall be applied in accordance with Section 17 hereof.
                                                       ----------

SECTION 16. Additional Remedies for IP Collateral.
            -------------------------------------

          (a) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, upon
the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, (i) the
Secured Party shall have the right (but not the obligation) to bring suit, in
the name of any Grantor, the Secured Party or otherwise, to enforce any IP
Collateral, in which event each Grantor shall, at the request of the Secured
Party, do any and all lawful acts and execute any and all documents required by
the Secured Party in aid of such enforcement and each Grantor shall promptly,
upon demand, reimburse and indemnify the Secured Party as provided in Sections
10.04 and 10.05 of the Credit

                                       25          Pledge and Security Agreement

<PAGE>

Agreement and Section 18 hereof, as applicable, in connection with the exercise
              ----------
of its rights under this Section 16, and, to the extent that the Secured Party
                         ----------
shall elect not to bring suit to enforce any IP Collateral as provided in this
Section 16, each Grantor agrees to use all reasonable measures, whether by
----------
action, suit, proceeding or otherwise, to prevent the infringement of any of the
IP Collateral by others and for that purpose agrees to use its commercially
reasonable judgment in maintaining any action, suit or proceeding against any
Person so infringing reasonably necessary to prevent such infringement; (ii)
upon written demand from the Secured Party, each Grantor shall execute and
deliver to the Secured Party an assignment or assignments of the IP Collateral
and such other documents as are necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent
and purposes of this Agreement; (iii) each Grantor agrees that such an
assignment and/or recording shall be applied to reduce the Secured Obligations
outstanding only to the extent that the Secured Party (or any Lender) receives
cash proceeds in respect of the sale of, or other realization upon, the IP
Collateral; and (iv) within five Business Days after written notice from the
Secured Party, each Grantor shall make available to the Secured Party, to the
extent within such Grantor's power and authority, such personnel in such
Grantor's employ on the date of such Event of Default as the Secured Party may
reasonably designate, by name, title or job responsibility, to permit such
Grantor to continue, directly or indirectly, to produce, advertise and sell the
products and services sold or delivered by such Grantor under or in connection
with the Trademarks, Trademark Registrations and Trademark Rights, such persons
to be available to perform their prior functions on the Secured Party's behalf
and to be compensated by the Secured Party at such Grantor's expense on a per
diem, pro-rata basis consistent with the salary and benefit structure applicable
to each as of the date of such Event of Default.

            (b) If (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and, by reason of
cure, waiver, modification, amendment or otherwise, no longer be continuing,
(ii) no other Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (iii) an
assignment to the Secured Party of any rights, title and interests in and to the
IP Collateral shall have been previously made, and (iv) the Secured Obligations
shall not have become immediately due and payable, upon the written request of
any Grantor, the Secured Party shall promptly execute and deliver to such
Grantor such assignments as may be necessary to reassign to such Grantor any
such rights, title and interests as may have been assigned to the Secured Party
as aforesaid, subject to any disposition thereof that may have been made by the
Secured Party; provided, after giving effect to such reassignment, the Secured
               --------
Party's security interest granted pursuant hereto, as well as all other rights
and remedies of the Secured Party granted hereunder, shall continue to be in
full force and effect; and provided further, the rights, title and interests so
                           ----------------
reassigned shall be free and clear of all Liens other than Liens (if any)
encumbering such rights, title and interest at the time of their assignment to
the Secured Party and Liens expressly permitted by the Credit Agreement.

SECTION 17. Application of Proceeds.
            -----------------------

            Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, all
proceeds received by the Secured Party in respect of any sale of, collection
from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral shall be
applied as provided in Section 8.03 of the Credit Agreement.

SECTION 18. Indemnity and Expenses.

            (a) The Grantors jointly and severally agree to indemnify the
Secured Party, each Lender and each Selected Revolving Lender from and against
any and all claims, losses and liabilities in any way relating to, growing out
of or resulting from this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including enforcement of this Agreement), except to the extent such claims,
losses or liabilities result solely from the Secured Party's or such Lender's or
Selected Revolving Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

            (b) The Grantors jointly and severally agree to pay to the Secured
Party upon demand the amount of any and all costs and expenses, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel and of any experts and agents, that
the Secured Party may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this
Agreement, (ii) the custody, preservation, use or operation of, or the sale of,
collection from, or other realization upon, any of the Collateral, (iii) the
exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the Secured Party hereunder, or
(iv) the failure by any Grantor to perform or observe any of the provisions
hereof.

            (c) The obligations of the Grantors in this Section 18 shall (i)
                                                        ----------
survive the termination of this Agreement and the discharge of the Grantors'
other Obligations under this Agreement, the Selected Revolving Lender Swap
Contracts, the Selected Revolving Lender Cash Management Services, the Credit
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii), as to any Grantor that is a
party to a Guaranty, be subject to the provisions of Section 1(b) thereof.

SECTION 19. Continuing Security Interest; Transfer of Loans; Termination and
            ----------------------------------------------------------------
            Release.
            -------

            (a) This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in
the Collateral and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until the payment
in full of the Obligations, the cancellation or termination of the Commitments
and the cancellation or expiration of all outstanding Letters of Credit, (ii) be
binding upon the Grantors and their respective successors and assigns, and (iii)
inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Secured Party hereunder, to
the benefit of the Secured Party and its successors, transferees and assigns.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (iii), (A) but subject
to the provisions of Section 10.07 of the Credit Agreement, any Lender may
assign or otherwise transfer any Loans held by it to any other Person, and such
other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect
thereof granted to the Lenders herein or otherwise and (B) any Selected
Revolving Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any Selected Revolving Lender
Swap Contracts to which it is a party to any other Person in accordance with the
terms of such Selected Revolving Lender Swap Contract, and such other Person
shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted
to the Selected Revolving Lenders herein or otherwise.

            (b) Upon the payment in full of all Obligations, the cancellation or
termination of the Commitments and the cancellation or expiration of all
outstanding Letters of Credit, the security interest granted hereby shall
terminate and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to the applicable the
Grantors. Upon any such termination the Secured Party will, at the Grantors'
expense, execute and deliver to the Grantors such documents as the Grantors
shall reasonably request to evidence such termination.

                                       27          Pledge and Security Agreement

<PAGE>

            (c) In addition, upon the proposed sale, transfer or other
disposition of any Collateral by a Grantor in accordance with the Credit
Agreement for which such Grantor desires to obtain a security interest release
from the Secured Party, a security interest release may be obtained pursuant to
the provisions of Section 10.19 of the Credit Agreement.

SECTION 20. Secured Party as Agent.
            ----------------------

            (a) The Secured Party has been appointed to act as the Secured Party
hereunder by the Lenders and, by their acceptance of the benefits hereof, the
Selected Revolving Lenders. The Secured Party shall be obligated, and shall have
the right hereunder, to make demands, to give notices, to exercise or refrain
from exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from taking any action
(including the release or substitution of Collateral), solely in accordance with
this Agreement and the Credit Agreement; provided that the Secured Party shall
                                         --------
exercise, or refrain from exercising, any remedies provided for in Section 15
                                                                   ----------
hereof in accordance with the instructions of Required Lenders. In furtherance
of the foregoing provisions of this Section 20(a), each Selected Revolving
                                    -------------
Lender, by its acceptance of the benefits hereof, agrees that it shall have no
right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral hereunder, it being
understood and agreed by such Selected Revolving Lender that all rights and
remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Secured Party for the benefit
of the Lenders and the Selected Revolving Lenders in accordance with the terms
of this Section 20(a).
        -------------

            (b) The Secured Party shall at all times be the same Person that is
Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement. Written notice of resignation
by Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.09 of the Credit Agreement shall
also constitute notice of resignation as the Secured Party under this Agreement;
and appointment of a successor administrative agent pursuant to Section 9.09 of
the Credit Agreement shall also constitute appointment of a successor Secured
Party under this Agreement. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Administrative Agent under Section 9.09 of the Credit Agreement by a successor
administrative agent, that successor administrative agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Secured Party under this Agreement, and the retiring Secured
Party under this Agreement shall promptly (i) transfer to such successor Secured
Party all sums, securities and other items of Collateral held hereunder,
together with all records and other documents necessary or appropriate in
connection with the performance of the duties of the successor Secured Party
under this Agreement, and (ii) execute and deliver to such successor Secured
Party such amendments to financing statements, and take such other actions, as
may be necessary or appropriate in connection with the assignment to such
successor Secured Party of the security interests created hereunder, whereupon
such retiring Secured Party shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
under this Agreement. After any retiring administrative agent's resignation
hereunder as the Secured Party, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to
its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it under this
Agreement while it was the Secured Party hereunder.

            (c) The Secured Party shall not be deemed to have any duty
whatsoever with respect to any Selected Revolving Lender until it shall have
received written notice in form and substance satisfactory to the Secured Party
from a Grantor or the Selected Revolving Lender as to the existence and terms of
the applicable Selected Revolving Lender Swap Contract or Selected Revolving
Lender Cash Management Services.

SECTION 21. Additional Grantors.
            -------------------

            The initial Subsidiary Grantors hereunder shall be such of the
Subsidiaries of the Borrower as are signatories hereto on the date hereof. From
time to time subsequent to the date hereof, additional Material Domestic
Subsidiaries of the Borrower may become parties hereto as additional Grantors
(each an "Additional Grantor"), by executing a counterpart substantially in the
form of Exhibit VI annexed hereto. Upon delivery of any such counterpart to the
        ----------
Secured Party, notice of which is hereby waived by the Grantors, each such
Additional Grantor shall be a Grantor and shall be as fully a party hereto as if
such Additional Grantor were an original signatory hereto. Each Grantor
expressly agrees that its obligations arising hereunder shall not be affected or
diminished by the addition or release of any other Grantor hereunder, nor by any
election of Administrative Agent not to cause any Subsidiary of the Borrower to
become an Additional Grantor hereunder. This Agreement shall be fully effective
as to any Grantor that is or becomes a party hereto regardless of whether any
other Person becomes or fails to become or ceases to be a Grantor hereunder.

SECTION 22. Amendments; Etc.
            ---------------

            No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement, and no consent to any departure by any Grantor therefrom,
shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed
by the Secured Party and, in the case of any such amendment or modification, by
the Grantors; provided that Schedule 2(a) may be amended with respect to the
              --------
description of the Selected Revolving Lender Cash Management Services of any
Selected Revolving Lender or the maximum amount secured in connection therewith
by a writing delivered to the Secured Party signed solely by the Borrower and
such Selected Revolving Lender; provided further that this Agreement may be
                                ----------------
modified by the execution of a counterpart by an Additional Grantor in
accordance with Section 21 hereof and the Grantors hereby waive any requirement
                ----------
of notice of or consent to any such amendment. Any such waiver or consent shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which it was given.

SECTION 23. Notices.
            -------

            Any notice or other communication herein required or permitted to be
given shall be mailed, faxed or delivered to the applicable address or facsimile
number and shall be deemed to be given or made upon the earlier to occur of (i)
actual receipt by the relevant party hereto and (ii) (A) if delivered by hand or
by courier, when signed for by or on behalf of the relevant party hereto; (B) if
delivered by mail, four Business Days after deposit in the mails, postage
prepaid; and (C) if delivered by facsimile, when sent and receipt has been
confirmed by telephone; provided, however, that notices and other communications
                        --------  -------
to the Secured Party shall not be effective until actually received. For the
purposes hereof, the address and facsimile number of each party hereto shall be
as provided in Section 10.02 of the Credit Agreement or as set forth under such
party's name on the signature pages hereof or as set forth on Schedule A
attached hereto, as Schedule A may be updated upon the execution of this
Agreement by an Additional Grantor, or such other address or facsimile number as
shall be designated by such party in a written notice delivered to the other
parties hereto.

SECTION 24. Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.
            -----------------------------------------------------

            No failure or delay on the part of the Secured Party in the exercise
of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies,
powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

SECTION 25. Severability.
            ------------

            If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b)
the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of
which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

                                       I-1         Pledge and Security Agreement

<PAGE>

               (i)    all rights, title and interest (including rights acquired
     pursuant to a license or otherwise) in and to all trademarks, service
     marks, designs, logos, indicia, tradenames, trade dress, corporate names,
     company names, business names, fictitious business names, trade styles
     and/or other source and/or business identifiers and applications pertaining
     thereto, owned by Grantor, or hereafter adopted and used, in its business
     (including the trademarks set forth on Schedule A attached hereto)
     (collectively, the "Trademarks"), all registrations that have been or may

     the Trademark Collateral hereby shall include, without limitation, all
     rights and interests pursuant to licensing or other contracts in favor of
     Grantor pertaining to Trademark applications and Trademarks presently or in
