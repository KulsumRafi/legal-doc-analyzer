<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT made and entered into this ___ day of ________, 2003,
by and between Building Materials Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the &#147;Company&#148;), and _________ (the &#147;Indemnitee&#148;); </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
there is a general awareness that competent and experienced persons are becoming
more reluctant to serve as directors or officers of a corporation unless they
are protected by comprehensive insurance and indemnification, especially since
shareholder and derivative suits against public-held corporations, their
directors and officers for decisions and action in the scope of their duties
have increased in number in recent years for damages in amounts that have no
reasonable relationship to the compensation received by such directors and
officers from the corporation; and </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Company has adopted provisions in its Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws providing for indemnification of its officers and directors to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the Company wishes to clarify
the rights and obligations of the Company and the Indemnitee with respect to
indemnification; and </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which sets
forth certain provisions relating to the mandatory and permissive
indemnification of officers and directors (among others) of a Delaware
corporation by such corporation is specifically not exclusive of other rights to
which those indemnified thereunder may be entitled under any charter, by-law,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, and
thus does not by itself limit the extent to which the Company may indemnify
persons serving as its officers and directors (among others); and </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in order to induce and encourage highly experienced and capable persons such as
the Indemnitee to serve and continue to serve as directors of the Company and in
any other capacity with respect to the Company, and to otherwise promote the
desirable end that such persons will resist what they consider unjustified
lawsuits and claims made against them in connection with the good faith
performance of their duties to the Company, with the knowledge that certain
costs, judgments, penalties, fines, liabilities and expenses incurred by them in
their defense of such litigation are to be borne by the Company and they will
receive the maximum protection against such risks and liabilities as may be
afforded by law, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined, after due
consideration and investigation of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and the various other options available to the Company and the Indemnitee in
lieu hereof, that the following Agreement is not only reasonable and prudent but
necessary to promote and ensure the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders; and </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Company desires to have the Indemnitee continue to serve as a director of
the Company and in such other capacity with respect to the Company as the
Company may request, as the case may be, free from undue concern for
unpredictable, inappropriate or unreasonable legal risks and personal
liabilities by reason of Indemnitee&#146;s acting in good faith in </FONT></P>

with respect to the Company, nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon the
Indemnitee the right to continue in the employ of the Company or affect the
right of the Company to terminate the Indemnitee&#146;s employment at any time
in the sole discretion of the Company, with or without cause. </FONT></P>

Board of Directors by the majority vote of Disinterested Directors so directs or if there
are no Disinterested Directors, by Independent Counsel (defined below) in a written
opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee.
Such Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors and approved by the
Indemnitee. Upon failure of the Board so to select such Independent Counsel or upon
failure of the Indemnitee so to approve, such Independent Counsel shall be selected upon
application of Indemnitee by the Chancellor of the State of Delaware or such other person
as the Chancellor shall designate to make such selection. Such determination of
entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than 30 calendar days after
receipt by the Company of a written request for indemnification. Such request shall
include documentation or information which is necessary for such determination and which
is reasonably available to the Indemnitee. Any Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with Indemnitee&#146;s request for indemnification hereunder, under any other
agreement, any provision of the Company&#146;s Bylaws or any directors&#146;and officers&#146;liability
insurance, shall be borne by the Company. The Company hereby indemnifies Indemnitee for
any such Expense and agrees to hold the Indemnitee harmless therefrom irrespective of the
outcome of the determination of the Indemnitee&#146;s entitlement to indemnification. If
the person making such determination shall determine that the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification as to part (but not all) of the application for indemnification, such
person shall reasonably prorate such partial indemnification among such claims, issues or
matters.  </FONT></P>

9. <I>Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings</I>. The Secretary of the
Company shall, promptly upon receipt of the Indemnitee&#146;s request for
indemnification, advise in writing the Board of Directors or such other person
or persons empowered to make the determination as provided in Section 8 that the
Indemnitee has made such request for indemnification. Upon making such request
for indemnification, the Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to
indemnification hereunder and the Company shall have the burden of proof in
making of any determination contrary to such presumption. If the person or
persons so empowered to make such determination shall have failed to make the
requested indemnification within 30 calendar days after receipt by the Company
of such request, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification

Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder or if payment has not
been timely made following a determination of entitlement to indemnification
pursuant to Sections 8 and 9, or if Expenses are not advanced pursuant to
Section 10, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to a final adjudication in an
appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent
jurisdiction of Indemnitee&#146;s entitlement to such indemnification or
advance. Alternatively, the Indemnitee at Indemnitee&#146;s option may seek an
award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the
rules of the American Arbitration Association, such award to be made within
sixty days following the filing of the demand for arbitration. The Company shall
not oppose the Indemnitee&#146;s right to seek any such adjudication or award in
arbitration or any other claim. Such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be
made de novo and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of a
determination (if so made) pursuant to Sections 8 or 9 that Indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification. If a determination is made or deemed to have been
made pursuant to the terms of Section 8 or 9 that the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination and is
precluded from asserting that such determination has not been made or that the
procedure by which such determination was made is not valid, binding and
enforceable. The Company further agrees to stipulate in any such court or before
any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this
Agreement and is precluded from making any assertions to the contrary. If the
court or arbitrator shall determine that the Indemnitee is entitled to any
indemnification hereunder, the Company shall pay all Expenses actually and
reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such adjudication or
award in arbitration (including, but not limited to, any appellate Proceedings). </FONT></P>
