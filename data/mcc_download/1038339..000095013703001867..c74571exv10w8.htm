<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>9.1. Property Insurance/Builder&#146;s Risk Insurance</B>. The parties acknowledge
that: (i)&nbsp;EOP has added SR1, FS2 and Ferry to its master property insurance
program as of the date of receipt of the temporary certificate of occupancy for
each such project. Each of FS4 and Concar will remain on their respective
builder&#146;s risk insurance policies until a temporary certificate of occupancy
(or, in the case of Concar, a certificate of substantial completion from the
City of San Mateo) is issued, whereupon EOP will add such project to its master
property insurance program (provided that the project is still owned by the
existing Project Entity and has not been sold); it being understood that a
temporary certificate of occupancy has been obtained for Ferry and a
certificate of substantial completion has been obtained for Concar and the
parties are in the process of trying to transfer these policies.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>9.2. General Liability Insurance</B>. The parties understand that currently
WEO and its members, WEO LP, WEO Inc. and the Project Entities are covered by a
commercial general liability policy maintained by WEO (the &#147;<B>CGL Policy</B>&#148;) and
that the FS2, FS4, Ferry and Concar Projects are covered with owners and
contractors protective liability policies (the &#147;<B>OCP Policies</B>&#148;). Following the
Closing, WEO LP will continue the existing CGL Policy which will continue to
name Wilson and WEO LP and WEO Inc. (under their new names) and their members,
partners and owners as named insureds. Wilson (including by acting as Manager
of WEO) shall cause (and EOP shall cooperate with Wilson in connection
therewith) WEO and the FS2, FS3, and Ferry Projects and the related entities
and their Subsidiaries to be removed from the existing CGL Policy and EOP will
have the removed parties added to the EOP master liability policy going forward
(to the extent that EOP and its Affiliates have acquired all of the interests
of WEO in these Projects at or after the Closing). Each of the FS4 and Concar
Projects and the related entities and their Subsidiaries will remain on the
existing CGL Policy until the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the date such Projects are sold,
(ii)&nbsp;the date that Wilson transfers its indirect interests therein to EOP, or
(iii)&nbsp;the date the OCP Policy for the particular Project expires (currently
January&nbsp;13, 2003 for Concar and April&nbsp;1, 2003 for FS4), at which time, unless
they are sold, they will be added to the EOP master liability policy. From and
after the Closing, WEO LP will be solely responsible for paying all premiums
for the CGL Policy and maintaining liability insurance for the remaining
insureds on such policy on such terms and in such amounts as Wilson deems
appropriate.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OCP Policies for the FS2, FS4, Ferry and Concar Projects will be
terminated when their respective Project Entities are removed from the CGL
Policy and added to the EOP master liability policy or when they expire,
whenever is earlier. The OCP Policies for FS2, FS4, and Ferry Project
currently expire April&nbsp;1, 2003 and the Concar OCP Policy expires on January&nbsp;13,
2003. Premiums for the OCP Policies have been and will continue to be paid by
the respective Projects. Wilson (including by acting as Manager of WEO) shall
use its reasonable efforts to cause the terms of the OCP Policies to be
shortened to end on the Closing Date and to obtain and cause the payment of any
return or refund of additional premiums resulting from such a shortening to the
applicable Project.

consideration for the sale of the Ferry Interest to EOPMC pursuant to this
Agreement, EOP shall cause EOPMC to pay to WEO, and Wilson and EOP agree to
cause WEO to distribute to Wilson, the Ferry Post-Closing Amount (as defined
below) at the times and to the extent provided in this <B>Section&nbsp;10.1</B>. WEO will
take the payment of the Ferry Post-Closing Amount into account in computing
WEO&#146;s loss on the sale of the Ferry Interest, and this reduced loss will be
reflected in the losses otherwise allocated to Wilson to the extent such
payment is distributed to Wilson. Section&nbsp;5.7 of the WEO Agreement (including
its subsections) shall not apply to this distribution. The &#147;<B>Ferry Post-Closing
Payment Amount</B>&#148; means the difference between (i)&nbsp;the capital contributed by WIC
to WEO that was contributed by WEO to the Ferry Project Entity and not returned
to WIC and (ii) $1,862,010.

to this paragraph, each time after the Closing Date that BoA makes any Capital
Contribution (&#147;<B>BofA Contribution</B>&#148;) pursuant to Sections&nbsp;4.6 or 4.7 of the FBI
Operating Agreement, EOP and EOP Ferry Investor shall cause payments to be made
to WEO (to the extent such amounts could be distributed to the Ferry Project
Entity), as follows: an amount equal to the lesser of (A)(i)(a) the amount of
the BofA Contribution, minus (b)&nbsp;the amount of any capital contributions or
loans (other than construction loans or amounts that would have been funded by
construction loans consistent with the Project budget) made with respect to the
Ferry Project Entity by EOP, EOP Ferry Investor or their Affiliates which were
consistent with the Project budget, multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;20.04%, and (B)&nbsp;the
portion of the Ferry Post-Closing Amount that has not yet been paid pursuant to
this <B>Section&nbsp;10.1</B>. Except as expressly provided in this <B>Section&nbsp;10.1</B>, neither
Wilson nor WEO shall be entitled to any payment with respect to the Ferry
Project and the EOP Ferry Investor shall be entitled to all future BofA
Contributions. No amount shall be payable under this <B>Section&nbsp;10.1 </B>because all
amounts that would have been payable under this <B>Section&nbsp;10.1 </B>were paid prior to
the closing and the Ferry Post-Closing Amount is therefore zero dollars
($0.00).

approval in its sole discretion, and if approved by Owner shall be executed by
Owner. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein Broker shall have no

likely to aid in successfully filling the vacancy. Broker agrees to perform
whatever services may be reasonably requested by Owner in connection with the

thereof with proper additional compensation), so long as said services do not
limit or interfere with the execution of Leases or other matters exclusively within the province of the Owner.

Party or any purchaser at such transaction shall not be liable for any fees or
other obligations due hereunder, provided that any Termination Fee payable
pursuant to <B>Section&nbsp;4.3 </B>shall be paid by Owner to Broker and shall not be
affected thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in the event of any
foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction, judicial sale of the
Property or similar transaction involving Riverside Finance Company, L.L.C.
(and any successors or assigns of its interest in such mortgage) with respect
to its existing mortgage, this Agreement shall not terminate and shall be
deemed to have been assigned to and assumed by Riverside Finance Company,
L.L.C. (or any successors or assigns of its interest in such mortgage),
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed to prevent Riverside
Finance Company, L.L.C. (or any successors or assigns of its interest in such
mortgage) from terminating this Agreement without cause under Section&nbsp;7.2 and
paying the Termination Fee to Broker.

The foregoing prohibition shall include the placement of the name of a company
producing, selling or distributing cigarettes or tobacco products or the name

on any sign. The foregoing prohibition shall not apply to any advertisement
sponsored by a state, local or nonprofit entity designed to communicate the

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>9.19. REIT Qualification. </B>Broker recognizes and acknowledges that Equity
Office Properties Trust (the <B>REIT&#148;</B>), an affiliate of Owner, intends to qualify
as a &#147;real estate investment trust&#148; for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code
and that maintaining such status and avoiding any activity which might cause a
penalty or tax (including, without being limited to, the tax imposed on income
from foreclosure property under Section&nbsp;857(b)(4) of the Code, the tax imposed
on the failure to meet certain income requirements under Section&nbsp;857(b)(5) of
the Code and the tax imposed on income from prohibited transactions under
Section&nbsp;857(b)(6) of the Code) to be applied is of material concern to Owner in
the conduct of its business generally. Prior to such time that the REIT
notifies Broker in writing that the Board of Trustees of the REIT has
determined pursuant to the REIT&#146;s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as
may be amended and/or restated, to revoke or otherwise terminate the REIT&#146;s
election to be treated as a real estate investment trust under the Code, Broker
shall not enter into or cause Owner to enter into any agreement to engage, nor
shall Broker engage in, any activities which, in the reasonable opinion of
Broker or in the reasonable opinion of counsel selected by Broker, could result
in (i)&nbsp;the prevention of the qualification of the REIT as a &#147;real estate
investment trust,&#148; (ii)&nbsp;imposition of a penalty or tax (including,
without being limited to, the tax imposed on income from foreclosure property
under Section&nbsp;857(b)(4) of the Code, the tax imposed on the failure to meet
certain income requirements under Section&nbsp;857(b)(5) of the code and the tax
imposed on income from prohibited transactions under Section&nbsp;857(b)(6) of the
Code) on the REIT, or (iii)&nbsp;the realization by the REIT of income in the form
of original issue discount.
