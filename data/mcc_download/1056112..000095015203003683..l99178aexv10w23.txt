                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


         This Employment Agreement ("this Agreement") is made and entered into
as of July 9, 2001 (the "Effective Date"), by and between Werner Co., a
Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company"), and Steve Bentson ("Executive").

         The Company hereby agrees to employ Executive, and Executive hereby
accepts such employment, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. The
offer of employment letter dated June 7, 2001 (the "Offer Letter"), is hereby
incorporated herein by reference; however, the provisions of this Employment
Agreement shall supersede the Offer Letter in case there is a discrepancy
between the documents or if the Offer Letter does not address certain issues,
similarly any issues addressed in the Offer Letter but not herein shall be
considered part of this Employment Agreement.

1.       POSITION.

         From the Effective Date until the termination of Executive's employment
hereunder (the "Period of Employment"), Executive shall serve in the capacity
indicated on Schedule 1 hereto, and shall have the normal duties and
responsibilities commensurate with such position. During the Period of
Employment, Executive will (a) during normal business hours, devote his full
time and exclusive attention to, and use his best efforts to advance, the
business and welfare of the Company, and (b) not engage in any other employment
activities for any direct or indirect remuneration without the concurrence of
the Executive's Supervisor and the Board of Directors (the "Board"), provided,
however, Executive may serve on corporate, charitable and community boards so
long as such activities do not unreasonably interfere with the performance of
his duties under this Agreement and provided that any such activities are
approved in advance by the Executive's Supervisor and the Board, which approval
will not be unreasonably withheld.

2.       PLACE AND TERM OF EMPLOYMENT.

         (a)      Executive's office shall be at the location set forth on
                  Schedule 1 attached hereto.

         (b)      Subject to Section 6 hereunder, the term of this Agreement
                  shall be for three (3) years from the Effective Date. This
                  Employment Agreement shall be



                                       1
<PAGE>

                  automatically renewed for successive one (1) year periods
                  unless either party gives notice otherwise within 12 months,
                  but not less than 6 months prior to an expiration. One (1)
                  year prior to expiration the Company and Executive shall meet
                  and have dialogue regarding this Agreement.

         (c)      Notwithstanding anything else contained herein or elsewhere
                  to the contrary, if Executive's employment terminates for any
                  reason other than Cause or by Executive without Good Reason,
                  Executive shall be eligible to receive a prorated bonus even
                  if Executive is not employed by the Company when such bonus is
                  paid.

3.       COMPENSATION.

         3.1 Base Salary. Effective as of July 9, 2001, the Company shall pay
Executive the per annum Base Salary indicated on Schedule 1 attached hereto
during the Period of Employment payable biweekly and otherwise in accordance
with the standard policies of the Company and subject to payroll deductions as
may be necessary or customary in respect of the Company's salaried employees in
general. Thereafter Executive's Base Salary hereunder shall be subject to annual
review.

         3.2 Performance Based Compensation. In addition to the Base Salary
provided for in Section 3.1 hereof, commencing on July 9, 2001, Executive shall
be eligible to receive an annual cash bonus (prorated based on service) earned
during the calendar year in an amount equal to 60% of the Base Salary in effect
at the end of such calendar year based upon the extent to which Werner Holding
Co. (PA), Inc.'s ("Holdings") consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,
Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), as defined in Exhibit 1 hereto, equals
or exceeds the percentages of target annual EBITDA with respect to such fiscal
year in accordance with the attached Exhibit 3.

The EBITDA target for the fiscal year 2001 is $72 million and for future years
shall be set by Holdings' Board of Directors as part of its annual budgeting
process.


                                       2
<PAGE>

         Executive shall also be eligible to receive an additional annual cash
bonus at the discretion of the Executive's Supervisor and the Board based upon
the evaluation of Executive's performance for each fiscal year of Holdings
during the Period of Employment. Bonuses will be payable no later than April of
the respective years following the years with respect to which they were earned.
Notwithstanding that Executive may begin employment after June 30, 2001 and
anything else contained herein or elsewhere to the contrary (including but not
limited to Exhibit 3 hereto), Executive shall be entitled to receive a prorated
bonus for fiscal year 2001 to be paid in April 2002.

4.       BENEFITS.

         During the Period of Employment, Executive shall be entitled to
participate in all benefit plans and programs maintained by the Company which
are available to its executive officers or employees generally, including any
and all perquisites, provided that, (i) Executive's right to participate in such
plans and programs shall not affect the Company's right to amend or terminate
the general applicability of such plans and programs, and (ii) Executive
acknowledges that he shall have no vested rights under or to participate in any
such plan or program except as expressly provided under the terms thereof. The
Company shall provide the Executive with the benefits described on Exhibit 2
hereto, provided, however, the benefits so described may be amended or
terminated by the Board.

5.       EXPENSES; TAXES.

         Upon presentation of acceptable substantiation therefor, the Company
will pay or reimburse Executive for such reasonable travel, entertainment and
other expenses as he may incur during the Period of Employment in connection
with the performance of his duties hereunder. Federal, state and local income
taxes shall be withheld on all cash and in-kind payments made by the Company to
Executive in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations.

6.       TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

         The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply upon termination of
Executive's employment hereunder. In connection with any termination of
Executive's employment hereunder, Executive



                                       3
<PAGE>

or his beneficiaries shall be entitled to receive, pro-rated as appropriate,
earned but unpaid Base Salary, unreimbursed amounts pursuant to Section 5
hereof, and unpaid and unreimbursed payments and benefits under, and in
accordance with the terms of, applicable benefit plans and programs, said
payments being collectively referred to as Standard Termination Payments.

         6.1 For Cause or Not for Good Reason. If the Company terminates
Executive's employment for Cause (as hereinafter defined) or if Executive
terminates his employment other than for Good Reason (as defined in Section
6.3), the Company's obligations to compensate Executive shall in all respects
cease as of the date of such termination, except for Standard Termination
Payments. Termination of Executive's employment for "Cause" shall mean
termination by the Company because Executive:

                  (i) has been convicted of a felony, or has entered a plea of
guilty or nolo contendere to a felony;

                  (ii) has committed an act of fraud involving dishonesty for
personal gain which is materially injurious to the Company;

                  (iii) has willfully and continually refused to substantially
perform his duties with the Company (other than any such refusal resulting from
his incapacity due to mental illness or physical illness or injury), after a
demand for substantial performance has been delivered to the Executive by the
Executive's Supervisor and the Board, where such demand specifically identifies
the manner in which the Executive's Supervisor and the Board believe that the
Executive has refused to substantially perform his duties and the passage of a
reasonable period of time for Executive to comply with such demand; or

                  (iv) has willfully engaged in gross misconduct materially and
demonstrably injurious to the Company or its subsidiaries.

                  For purposes of this paragraph, no act or failure to act on
the Executive's part shall be considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be
done, by the Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his
action or omission was in the best interest of the Company or its subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to termination for Cause arising out



                                       4
<PAGE>

of conduct described in clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, a termination shall
not be considered for Cause for purposes of this Agreement unless there shall
have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the
affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire Board, at a
meeting of the Board called and held for that purpose (after reasonable notice
to the Executive and an opportunity for the Executive, together with his counsel
or other advisors, to be heard at such meeting), finding that in the good faith
opinion of the Board the Executive had engaged in conduct described in clause
(ii), (iii) or (iv) above and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. Such
a finding by the Board of Directors of the Company is a prerequisite to a
termination for Cause pursuant to clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) above; provided,
however, that such a finding may be challenged, by appropriate judicial process,
on the merits (i.e., that Cause did not exist) or on the basis that the Board's
finding was not made in good faith (provided that proof that Cause for
termination existed shall be a complete defense to any showing that the Board's
findings were not made in good faith).

         If the Executive terminates his employment other than for Good Reason,
the Executive must provide the Company with thirty (30) days written notice
prior to such termination.

         6.2 Upon Death or Permanent Disability. If Executive's employment is
terminated as a result of death or Permanent Disability (as hereinafter
defined), the Company's obligation to compensate Executive shall in all respects
cease as of the date of such termination, except for Standard Termination
Payments including all applicable disability benefits. The Company may terminate
Executive's employment hereunder attributable to the "Permanent Disability" of
Executive if Executive becomes physically or mentally incapacitated or disabled
so that he is unable to perform for the Company substantially the same services
as he performed prior to incurring such incapacity or disability (the Company,
at its option and expense, is entitled to retain a physician reasonably
acceptable to Executive to confirm the existence of such incapacity or
disability, and the determination of such physician shall be binding upon the
Company and Executive), and such incapacity or disability exists for an
aggregate of six (6) calendar months in any twelve (12) calendar month period.

         6.3 Not For Cause or For Good Reason. If (i) Executive's employment is
terminated by the Company for a reason other than Cause, Executive's death or
Executive's Permanent


                                       5
<PAGE>

Disability, or (ii) Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason (as
hereinafter defined), the Company's obligation to compensate Executive shall in
all respects cease as of the date of such termination, except (a) for Standard
Termination Payments, (b) that the Company will pay to Executive an amount equal
to twelve (12) month's of the Executives base salary in effect at the time of
such termination paid in twelve (12) equal monthly payments over the next twelve
(12) months. Payments shall be discontinued to the extent Executive receives
income from subsequent employment, and (c) that the Company will, for a period
of six (6) months following said date of termination, provide Executive with
retirement benefits and welfare (including any life insurance, hospitalization,
medical and disability) benefits, substantially similar to those provided to
Executive as of the date of termination, provided that such welfare benefits
shall be discontinued to the extent Executive receives similar benefits from
subsequent employment. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean
(1) a reduction by the Company in the Executive's bonus opportunities or, except
as specifically provided herein, base salary as in effect on the Effective Date
or as the same may be increased from time to time; (2) unless the members of the
Board appointed pursuant to Section 4(iii) of the Shareholder Agreement dated as
of the date hereof agree to such reduction or other action, any material
reduction in the level of benefits (including participation in any bonus plan)
to which the Executive is entitled under one or more employee benefit plans on
the Effective Date, or the taking of any action by the Company which would
adversely affect the Executive's accrued benefits under any such employee
benefit plans or deprive the Executive of any material fringe benefit enjoyed by
the Executive on the Effective Date; (3) a demand by the Company to the
Executive to relocate to any place that exceeds a fifty (50) mile radius beyond
the location at which the Executive performed the Executive's duties on the
Effective Date; or (4) any material breach by the Company of any provision of
this Agreement.

         6.4 Release and Satisfaction. At the time of termination of Executive's
employment, Executive and the Company agree to execute mutual releases whereby
(a) Executive will release, relinquish and forever discharge the Company and any
director, officer, employee, shareholder, controlling person or agent of the
Company from any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, expenses, liabilities
or obligations, whether known or unknown (except as set forth in Section 6.5
hereof other than any such claims, damages losses, costs, expenses, liabilities
or obligations



                                       6
<PAGE>

arising under (i) any indemnification arrangement of the Company with respect
to Executive, (ii) any employee benefit plan or program (whether or not
tax-qualified) covering Executive, (iii) any stock purchase or stock option plan
or agreement to which the Company and Executive are parties (or any document
executed in connection therewith) or (iv) this Agreement, to the extent the
Company or any such person has continuing obligations pursuant to the express
provisions hereof following such termination), which Executive has incurred or
suffered or may incur or suffer as a result of Executive's employment by the
Company or the termination of such employment, and (b) the Company will release,
relinquish and forever discharge Executive and his heirs, successors and assigns
from any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, expenses, liability or
obligations, whether known or unknown (except as set forth in Section 6.5 hereof
and other than any such claims, damages, losses, costs, expenses, liabilities or
obligations arising under any of the arrangements or agreements referred to in
clauses (i) through (iii) in the preceding clause (a) of this Section 6.4 or
under this Agreement to the extent Executive or any such person has continuing
obligations pursuant to the express provisions hereof following such
termination), which the Company has incurred or suffered or may incur or suffer
as a result of the Company's employment of Executive or the termination of such
employment.

         6.5 Effect on This Agreement. The termination of Executive's employment
shall not affect the continuing operation and effect of Sections 6.4 and 7
hereof, nor affect any obligation of the Company to make payments pursuant to
Section 6 hereof, which shall continue in full force and effect upon the Company
and Executive, and its and his heirs, successors and assigns. Nothing in Section
6.1 or 6.4 hereof shall be deemed to operate or shall operate as a release,
settlement or discharge of any liability of Executive to the Company (a) from
any act or omission by Executive enumerated in Section 6.1 which constituted a
reason for termination of Executive's employment for Cause or (b) in connection
with any amount Executive owes to the Company pursuant to a loan or other
advance.

         6.6 Mitigation. Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount
of any payment provided for under this Agreement by seeking other employment or
otherwise nor will any payments provided for herein be subject to offset in
respect of any claims which the Company may have against Executive and, except
as specifically provided herein, the amount of



                                       7
<PAGE>

any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement shall not be reduced by
any compensation earned or benefits received by Executive as the result of
employment by a future employer, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed
by him to the Company, or otherwise.

7.       NON-COMPETITION; NON-DISCLOSURE OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, SURRENDER
         OF RECORDS; INVENTIONS AND PATENTS.

         7.1      Non-Competition

                  (a) Executive acknowledges that in the course of his
employment with the Company he will become familiar with the trade secrets and
other confidential information of the Company and its subsidiaries and that his
services will be of special, unique and extraordinary value to the Company.
Therefore, Executive agrees that, during the Period of Employment and for two
(2) years thereafter (the "Noncompete Period"), he shall not directly or
indirectly own, manage, control, participate in, consult with, render services
for, or in any manner engage in any business competing with the businesses of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (i) which relates to (A) the
manufacturing or sale of climbing equipment (defined as step, extension,
multi-use, multi-purpose and articulating ladders, stages, planks, work
platforms, scaffolds and accessories) or (B) aluminum extrusions or (ii) which
is commenced by the Company or any of its subsidiaries after the Effective Date
and as of the date of termination constitutes or will constitute a material
portion of the Company's overall future business within the United States and
any other geographical area in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries
engage in such businesses. Nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from being a
passive owner of not more than 2% of the outstanding equity of any class of a
corporation or other entity which is publicly traded so long as Executive has no
active participation in the business of such corporation.

                  (b) During the Noncompete Period, Executive shall not directly
or indirectly through another entity (i) induce or attempt to induce any
employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to leave the employ of such
person, or in any way interfere with the employee relationship between the
Company or any of its subsidiaries and any employee thereof, (ii) hire any
person who was an employee of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company at
any time during the Employment Period (other than individuals who have not been
employed by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for a period of at
least one (1) year prior to employment by Executive directly or



                                       8
<PAGE>

indirectly through another entity), or (iii) induce or attempt to induce any
customer, supplier, licensee or other person having a business relationship with
the Company or any of its subsidiaries if such business relationship; relates
(i) to (A) the manufacturing or sale of climbing equipment (as defined above) or
(B) aluminum extrusions, or (ii) relates to business which is commenced by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries after the Effective Date and as of the date
of termination constitutes or will constitute a material portion of the
Company's overall future business, to cease doing business with the Company or
such subsidiaries, or interfere materially with the relationship between any
such customer, supplier, licensee or other person having a business relationship
with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Within 120 days of termination, the
Company will notify Executive in writing of any potential future businesses
commenced by the Company or any of its subsidiaries after the Effective Date and
as of the date of termination which the Company considers to be within the scope
of Sections 7.1 and 7.2 because at that time it constitutes or will constitute a
material portion of the Company's overall future business, whether within the
United States or any other geographical area in which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries engage in such businesses.

         7.2 Proprietary Information. Executive agrees that he shall not use for
his own purpose or for the benefit of any person or entity other than the
Company or its shareholders or affiliates, nor otherwise disclose to any
individual or entity at any time while he is employed by the Company or
thereafter any proprietary information of the Company unless such disclosure (a)
has been authorized by the Board, (b) is in the good faith judgment of Executive
required in the course of Executive's employment hereunder, (c) is in the course
of such individual's or entity's employment or retention by the Company, or (d)
is required by law, a court of competent jurisdiction or a governmental or
regulatory agency. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "proprietary
information" shall mean: (a) the name or address of any customer, supplier or
affiliate of the Company or any information concerning the transactions or
relations of any customer, supplier or affiliate of the Company or any of its
shareholders; (b) any information concerning any product, technology or
procedure employed by the Company, but not generally known to its customers,
suppliers or competitors, or under development by or being tested by the
Company, but not at the time offered generally to customers or suppliers; (c)
any information relating to the marketing methods, sales margins, discounts,
rebates, supplier incentives, or the



                                       9
<PAGE>

like, the capital structure, or results of any business plan of the Company; (d)
any information contained in the Company's policies and procedures or employees'
manual; (e) any inventions, innovations, trade secrets or other items covered by
Section 7.4 below; and (f) any other information which the Board has determined
by resolution and communicated to Executive to be confidential or proprietary.
However, proprietary information shall not include any information that is or
becomes generally known to the public other than through actions of Executive in
violation of Sections 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 hereof or any information which become
available to Executive on a non-confidential basis from a source other then the
Company, its affiliates or their respective employees, provided that such source
is not known to Executive to be subject to any obligation of secrecy to the
Company or its affiliates provided that such information was unsolicited and
that with regard thereto Executive took no action.

         7.3 Confidentiality and Surrender of Records. Executive agrees that,
while he is employed by the Company or at any time thereafter, he shall not
except as required by law give any "confidential records" (as hereinafter
defined) to, or permit any inspection or copying of confidential records by, any
individual or entity other than in the course of such individual's or entity's
employment or retention by the Company or as required by law, a court of
competent jurisdiction, or a governmental or regulatory agency, nor shall he
retain any of the same following termination of this employment, without the
prior approval of the Board. For purposes hereof, "confidential records" means
all correspondence, memoranda, files, manuals, financial, operating or marketing
records, magnetic tape, or electronic or other media of any kind which may be in
Executive's possession or under his control or accessible to him which contain
any proprietary information as defined in Section 7.2 above.

         7.4 Inventions and Patents. Executive agrees that all inventions,
innovations, trade secrets, patents and processes in any way relating, directly
or indirectly, to the Company's or its subsidiaries' businesses developed by him
alone or in conjunction with others at any time during his employment by the
Company shall belong to the Company. Executive will use his best efforts to
perform all actions reasonably requested by the Executive's Supervisor or the
Board to establish and confirm such ownership by the Company.



                                       10
<PAGE>

         7.5 Definition of Company. For purposes of this Section 7, the term
"Company" shall include Holdings and any and all of its subsidiaries, ventures
or affiliates (including the Company and any and all of its subsidiaries,
ventures or affiliates) whether currently existing or hereafter formed.

         7.6 Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that the duration and area
for which the covenants set forth in Section 7 are to be effective are
reasonable. In the event that any court or arbitrator determines that the time
period or the area, or both of them, are unreasonable and that any of the
covenants are to that extent unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that such
covenants will remain in full force and effect, first, for the greatest time
period, and second, in the greatest geographical area that would not render them
unenforceable. The parties intend that this Agreement will be deemed to be a
series of separate covenants, one for each and every county of each and every
state of the United States of America. Executive agrees that damages are an
inadequate remedy for any breach of the covenants in this Section 7 and that the
Company will, whether or not it is pursuing any potential remedies at law, be
entitled to equitable relief in the form of preliminary and permanent
injunctions without bond or other security upon any actual or threatened breach
of this Agreement.

8.       MISCELLANEOUS.

         8.1 Notice. Any notice required or permitted to be given hereunder
shall be deemed sufficiently given if sent by registered or certified mail,

indicated opposite his or its signature to this Agreement. Each party may also
provide notice by sending the other party a facsimile at a number provided by
such other party.

         8.2 Modification and No Waiver of Breach. No waiver or modification of
this Agreement shall be binding unless it is in writing signed by the parties
hereto. No waiver by a party of a breach hereof by the other party shall be
deemed to constitute a waiver of a future breach, whether of a similar or
dissimilar nature, except to the extent specifically provided in any written
waiver under this Section 8.2.

laws of descent and distribution upon the death of Executive. Any attempted
assignment, transfer, conveyance, or other disposition (other than as aforesaid)
of any interest in the rights of Executive to receive any form of compensation

be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the then-prevailing

shall be jointly selected by the parties. If the parties have not jointly agreed
upon an arbitrator within twenty days of respondent's receipt of claimant's
notice of intention to arbitrate, either party may request the American

                          DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION




         Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization
("EBITDA") is defined as Consolidated Net Income (loss) of Holdings and its
subsidiaries as it would appear on a statement of income (loss), which shall (i)
exclude or be adjusted otherwise for all acquisitions and additional equity
contributions to the extent such acquisitions and/or equity contributions
materially change target EBITDA for any particular Fiscal Year, (ii) reflect a
reduction for all management and employment bonuses payable with respect to the
Fiscal Year of Holdings prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP consistently
applied and (iii) be adjusted for any material Board approved amendment to the
capital expenditure plan: plus (minus) the following amounts, to the extent such
amounts are otherwise taken into account in determining EBITDA (prior to
adjustment):

         1.  Any provision (benefit) for taxes (including franchise taxes)
deducted (added) in calculating such consolidated net income (loss); plus

         2.  Any interest expense (net of interest income), deducted in
calculating such consolidated net income (loss); plus

         3.  Amortization expenses deducted in calculating consolidated net
income (loss); plus

         4.  Depreciation expense deducted in calculating consolidated net
income (loss); plus

         5.  Management fees paid to Investcorp; plus (minus)

         6.  Any unusual losses (gains) deducted (added) in calculating
consolidated net income (loss). (Unusual items are intended to include
transactions considered outside the ordinary course of business. EBITDA will be
adjusted to eliminate the effects, if any, of such



                                       16

transactions, the intent being to calculate EBITDA as if such transactions had
not occurred; plus (minus)

         7.  Any compensation expense (income) deducted (added) in
calculating consolidated net income (loss) attributable to transactions
involving equity securities of Holdings or its subsidiaries.

         The Executive and his representative shall be provided reasonable
opportunity to review the computation of EBITDA and reasonable access to the
data and information supporting much computation, but Holding's Board of
Director's determination shall be conclusive and binding.

                     VARIABLE PAY BONUS COMPENSATION SYSTEM
                                EMPLOYEE SUMMARY
OBJECTIVE
The objective of the Werner Variable Pay Bonus Compensation System is to
motivate associates to achieve exceptional EBITDA performance by providing
substantial financial rewards when such performance is attained.

ELIGIBILITY
Participating associates shall be approved by the Board of Directors each year.
Participants must hold a position which impacts profitability and strategy,
generally Job Band 5 or currently participating in the Company's variable pay
bonus program. Individuals impacting profitability, in lower grades, may also be
considered.

To be eligible a participant must be employed, designated and otherwise eligible
by June 30th and remain a participant for a minimum of six (6) months. Awards
generally will be prorated for participants who do not participate for a full
year.

At any time during the year, the Board may also designate new participants in
its sole discretion.

Only Board approved associates of the Company or its subsidiaries will be
eligible to participate in the Plan. Once a participant ceases to be an
employee, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, he or she shall automatically
cease to be a participant in the Plan, and shall cease to be entitled to receive
an award unless the participant retires, dies or becomes permanently disabled,
as noted herein. Participants must be employed by the Company at the time the
bonus is paid, unless the participant has retired, becomes permanently disabled
or is deceased (in which case, payment shall be made to the participants
estate).

An associate's participation in the Plan in any prior year(s) does not give the
associate the right to be a participant in the Plan in the current year or in
any subsequent year.

No associate shall be a participant in the Plan during any year in which he or
she is a participant in any other annual incentive plan of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries.

ADMINISTRATION
The Board shall determine whether awards will be granted. The Board will also
determine which participants will receive an award and the amount of each award,
in its sole discretion. Due consideration will be given to the award guidelines,
performance against financial objectives, individual participant performance
against objectives, the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer and the
appropriate Executive and Management Leadership Team representative(s) and such
other factors as the Board may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion.

Payments will be made in cash as soon as practical after audited financial
results are available, normally by March 15th of each year, to participants who
are regular full-time employees on the date of payment. Federal, State and/or
local taxes or other similar payments required by law will

                                       19
<PAGE>

be withheld with respect to such payments, but no 401(k) or other similar
deductions will be made.

The Board will make bonus payments at a level commensurate with the
Corporation's overall performance, including adjustments consistent with past
bonus and current stock option plans (i.e. accrued costs for acquisitions,
extraordinary expenditures, unbudgeted gains/losses arising from a change in
accounting, etc.) as follows:

                  EBITDA Performance             Pool & Individual
                  ------------------             -----------------
                       To Target                 % of Target Bonus
                       ---------                 -----------------
                         110%                           130%
                         105%                           115%
                         100%                           100%
                          95%                            75%
                          90%                            50%
                Less than 90%                             0%

The bonus is calculated by multiplying 50% times the individuals EBITDA Target
bonus percent, times the individuals bonus percent to get the EBITDA portion of
the bonus percentage. Then the Personal Performance Factor ("PPF") portion is
calculated by multiplying 50% times the individuals EBITDA Target bonus percent,
times the individuals bonus percent times their PPF rating. Finally, the two (2)
percentages are added together to get the final bonus percentage.

Under this format, it is possible for individuals to earn awards greater or less
than the formula, however, there shall be a calculated fixed bonus pool for each
year and a cap on each individual target bonus of 150% of the participant's
target bonus percent. In the event that the sum of all individual bonus's exceed
the fixed bonus pool, each individual bonus will be proportionately reduced so
that the total pay out does not exceed the fixed bonus pool. However, additional
funding can be attained if business exceeds budgeted EBITDA and the Company
makes significant progress against strategic objectives as determined by the
Board of Directors.

No person shall have any claim or right to be granted an award under the Plan.
The decisions to pay or not to pay an award, the amount of the award to be paid,
and to whom an award will be paid, shall be made by the Board, in its sole
discretion. The Board may pay an award even when the results would not otherwise
call for an award payment. Likewise, the Board may elect not to pay awards even
when minimum objectives are met.

Any exceptions to the Plan must be approved in writing by the Chief Executive
Officer based on approval of the Board.

Nothing in the Plan or in any action taken hereunder shall affect the Company's
right to terminate at any time and for any reason the employment of any employee
who is a participant in the Plan.

The Plan may be amended, suspended, terminated or reinstated in whole or in part
by the Board of Directors.

         Potential Additional Funding - Strategic Objectives
         Additional plan funding can be attained if business exceeds budgeted
         EBITDA and makes significant progress against strategic objectives as
         determined by the Board of Directors.

         Strategic Objectives are identified separately.

         The Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, can approve additional
         funding up to 20% for exceptional financial performance and significant
         progress against strategic objectives.

         The decisions to pay or not to pay an award, the amount of the award to
         be paid, and to whom an award will be paid, shall be made by the Board,
         in its sole discretion. The Board may pay an award even when the
         results would not otherwise call for an award payment. Likewise, the
         Board may elect not to pay awards even when minimum objectives are met.

Each individual participant in the program will be evaluated and performance
rated to reflect their own attainment of individual goals on a measure of 0 -
1.5 measured in 1/10th increments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

Individual bonus payout has two (2) components:

         1.   50% of individual's target bonus is based upon Enterprise
              Financial Results (EBITDA) which may be adjusted consistent with
              past bonus and current stock option plans (i.e. accrued costs for
              acquisitions, extraordinary expenditures, unbudgeted gains/losses
              arising from a change in accounting, etc.).
         2.   50% of individual's bonus is based upon personal factors.

Therefore, a bonus can be "0" if the Company does not meet minimum EBITDA target
(if EBITDA is less than 90%) or up to a maximum of 1.5 times the individual
target if the Company achieves 110% of EBITDA Target and the individual receives
a 1.5 personal performance factor/modifier.

To calculate the bonus amount, take 75% times the individuals EBITDA Target
bonus percent, times the individuals bonus % to get the EBITDA portion of the
bonus % and for the PPF portion, multiply 25% times the individuals EBITDA
Target bonus percent, times the individuals bonus % times their PPF rating. Add
these two (2) percentages together to get the final bonus percentage. See
examples below

FOR THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES, ASSUME THAT THE TOTAL BONUS POOL HAS ADEQUATE
FUNDING EXCEPT FOR EXAMPLE #4.

         Total Bonus Percentage = 7.125%
                  [7.125% x $75,000]

         Bonus = $5,343.75

3)   Individual #3 above, assuming the Company reached 110% of EBITDA and the
     individuals PPF = 0

                           EBITDA           PPF

         individual by 10%)
