Ladies and Gentlemen:

     Wisconsin United for Health Foundation, Inc., a non-profit charitable
public health foundation (the "Selling Stockholder"), proposes to sell to the
Underwriters named in Schedule A annexed hereto (the "Underwriters") an
aggregate of 5,500,000 shares (the "Firm Shares") of Common Stock, no par value
per share (the "Common Stock"), of Cobalt Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation
(the "Company"). In addition, solely for the purpose of covering
over-allotments, the Selling Stockholder proposes to grant to the Underwriters
the option to purchase from the Selling Stockholder up to an additional 825,000
shares of Common Stock (the "Additional Shares"). The Firm Shares and the
Additional Shares are hereinafter collectively sometimes referred to as the
"Shares." The Shares are described in the Prospectus which is referred to below.

     The Company has filed, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (collectively,
the "Act"), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a
registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-101111) including a basic
prospectus relating to the Shares. One or more amendments to such registration
statement have been filed with the Commission. Such registration statement, as
so amended, has been declared by the Commission to be effective under the Act.
The Company will next file with the Commission, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under
the Act, the basic prospectus in final form and a final prospectus supplement to
the basic prospectus, describing the Shares and the offering thereof, in such
forms as have been provided to and approved by the Underwriters.

     The term "Registration Statement" as used in this Agreement means the
registration statement, as amended at the time it became effective and as
amended prior to the execution of this Agreement, including (i) all financial
schedules and exhibits thereto and


<PAGE>

(ii) all documents incorporated by reference or deemed to be incorporated by
reference therein. If an abbreviated registration statement is prepared and
filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 462(b) under the Act (an
"Abbreviated Registration Statement"), the term "Registration Statement"
includes the Abbreviated Registration Statement. The term "Basic Prospectus" as
used in this Agreement means the basic prospectus dated as of January 27, 2003
and to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) on February 4, 2003.
The term "Prepricing Prospectus" as used in this Agreement means any form of
preliminary prospectus used in connection with the marketing of the Shares
(including the preliminary prospectus supplement dated as of January 24, 2003
and filed with the Commission on January 24, 2003 pursuant to Rule 424 under the
Act and any basic prospectus (whether or not in preliminary form) used with any
such preliminary prospectus supplement in connection with the marketing of the
Shares, in each case as any of the foregoing may be supplemented by the Company.
The term "Prospectus Supplement" as used in this Agreement means any final
prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Shares, in the form filed
with, or transmitted for filing to, the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under
the Act. The term "Prospectus" as used in this Agreement means the Basic
Prospectus together with the Prospectus Supplement except that if such Basic
Prospectus is supplemented on or prior to the date on which the Prospectus
Supplement was first filed pursuant to Rule 424, the term "Prospectus" shall
refer to the Basic Prospectus as so supplemented and as supplemented by the
Prospectus Supplement. Any reference herein to the registration statement, the
Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Prepricing Prospectus, any
Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include
(i) the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Form S-3 (the
"Incorporated Documents") and (ii) the copy of the Registration Statement, the
Basic Prospectus, the Prepricing Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the
Prospectus or the Incorporated Documents filed with the Commission pursuant to
its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR"). Any
reference herein to the terms "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect
to the Registration Statement, any Prepricing Prospectus, the Prospectus
Supplement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing
of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules and regulations thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act") after the
effective date of the Registration Statement, or the date of the Prospectus, as
the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.

     The Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters agree as follows:

     1. Sale and Purchase. Upon the basis of the representations and warranties
and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Selling
Stockholder agrees to sell to the respective Underwriters and each of the
Underwriters, severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase from the Selling
Stockholder the respective number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the name of
such Underwriter in Schedule A annexed hereto, in each case at a purchase price
of $11.40 per Share. The Company and the Selling Stockholder are advised by you
that the Underwriters intend (i) to make a public offering of their respective
portions of

                                       2
<PAGE>

the Firm Shares as soon after the effective date of the Registration Statement
as in your judgment is advisable and (ii) initially to offer the Firm Shares
upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus. You may from time to time increase
or decrease the public offering price after the initial public offering to such
extent as you may determine.

     In addition, the Selling Stockholder hereby grants to the several
Underwriters the option to purchase, and upon the basis of the representations
and warranties and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the
Underwriters shall have the right to purchase, severally and not jointly, from
the Selling Stockholder all or a portion of the Additional Shares as may be
necessary to cover over-allotments made in connection with the offering of the
Firm Shares, at the same purchase price per share to be paid by the Underwriters
for the Firm Shares. This option may be exercised by you on behalf of the
several Underwriters at any time and from time to time on or before the 30th day
following the date hereof by written notice to the Company and the Selling
Stockholder. Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of Additional
Shares as to which the option is being exercised and the date and time when the
Additional Shares are to be delivered (such date and time being herein referred
to as the "additional time of purchase"); provided, however, that the additional
time of purchase shall not be earlier than the time of purchase (as defined
below) nor earlier than the second business day1 after the date on which the
option shall have been exercised nor later than the tenth business day after the
date on which the option shall have been exercised. The number of Additional
Shares to be sold to each Underwriter shall be the number which bears the same
proportion to the aggregate number of Additional Shares being purchased as the
number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter on
Schedule A hereto bears to the total number of Firm Shares (subject, in each
case, to such adjustment as you may determine solely to eliminate fractional
shares).

   Exchange is open for trading.

be made to you at the additional time of purchase in such names and in such
denominations as you shall specify.

the purchase of the Shares shall be made at the offices of Dewey Ballantine LLP,

          (xix) the statements identified in the pages from the Registration
     Statement and the Prospectus attached hereto as Exhibit C, to the extent
     they are descriptions of contracts, agreements or other legal documents or

     securities issued by the Company and owned by them registered pursuant to
     the Act, included in the Registration Statement or sold in the offering
     contemplated thereby, whether as a result of the filing or effectiveness of
     the Registration Statement or the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement or otherwise, except for such rights as have been complied with
     or waived;

          In addition, such counsel shall state that such counsel has
     participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the
     Company, representatives of the Selling Stockholder, representatives of the
     independent public accountants of the Company and representatives of the
     Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement and
     Prospectus were discussed and, although such counsel is not passing upon
     and does not assume responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or
     fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or
     Prospectus

                                       24
<PAGE>

     (except as and to the extent stated in subparagraphs (vii), (ix) and (xix)
     above), on the basis of the foregoing nothing has come to the attention of
     such counsel that causes them to believe that the Registration Statement or
     any amendment thereto at the time such Registration Statement or amendment
     became effective contained an untrue statement of a material fact or
     omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
     to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus or
     any supplement thereto at the date of such Prospectus or such supplement,
     and at all times up to and including the time of purchase or additional
     time of purchase, as the case may be, contained an untrue statement of a
     material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
     therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
     circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being
     understood that such counsel need express no opinion with respect to the
     financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical data
     included in the Registration Statement or Prospectus).

          Such counsel may assume, for purposes of its opinion, that no investor
     (whether an individual or entity), nor any group of investors acting in
     concert, will acquire such number of the Shares as shall (a) violate the
     ownership restrictions contained in the Company's Amended and Restated
     Articles of Incorporation or (b) require prior approval from the insurance
     regulatory agency of any state.

     (b) You shall have received, at the time of purchase and at the additional
time of purchase, as the case may be, the opinion of Davis & Kuelthau, S.C.,
counsel to the Selling Stockholder, addressed to the Underwriters, and dated the
time of purchase or the additional time of purchase, as the case may be, with
reproduced copies for each of the other Underwriters and in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Underwriters, stating that:

          (i) the Selling Stockholder is validly existing as a non-stock
     corporation under the laws of the State of Wisconsin, has filed its most
     recent required annual report and has not filed articles of dissolution,
     and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and
     operate its properties as currently owned, leased and operated and to
     conduct its business as currently conducted;

          (ii) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by or on
     behalf of the Selling Stockholder;

          (iii) the Selling Stockholder has full legal right and power, and has
     obtained any authorization, approval or consent required by law (other than
     those imposed by the Act and the securities or blue sky laws of certain
     jurisdictions), to sell and cause to be assigned, transferred and delivered
     the Shares in the manner provided in this Agreement;

                                       25
<PAGE>

          (iv) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
     Selling Stockholder and the consummation by the Selling Stockholder of the
     transactions contemplated hereby do not constitute, and will not result in,
     a Default Event under any provisions of the charter or bylaws of the
     Selling Stockholder; and

          (v) assuming each Underwriter acquires its interest in the Shares
     without notice of any adverse claim (within the meaning of Section 8-105 of
     the UCC), each Underwriter that has purchased Shares delivered at the time
     of purchase or at the additional time of purchase, as the case may be, to
     DTC or other securities intermediary by making payment therefor as provided
     herein, and that has had such Shares credited to the securities account or
     accounts of such Underwriters maintained with DTC or such other securities
     intermediary, will have acquired a security entitlement (within the meaning
     of Section 8-102(a)(17) of the UCC) to such Shares, and no action based on
     an adverse claim (within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(1) of the UCC) may
     be asserted against such Underwriter with respect to such Shares.

     (c) You shall have received at the time of purchase and at the additional
time of purchase, as the case may be, the opinion of Dewey Ballantine LLP,
counsel for the Underwriters, dated the time of purchase or the additional time
of purchase, as the case may be, with respect to the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as
the Underwriters may require.

     (d) You shall have received from Ernst & Young LLP letters dated,
respectively, the date of this Agreement and the time of purchase and additional
time of purchase, as the case may be, and addressed to the Underwriters (with
reproduced copies for each of the Underwriters) in the forms heretofore approved
by Dewey Ballantine LLP, counsel for the Underwriters.

     (e) No amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus,
or document which upon filing with the Commission would be incorporated by
reference therein, shall at any time have been filed to which you have objected
in writing.

     (f) The Registration Statement shall have become effective not later than
5:30 PM New York City time on the date of this Agreement and, if Rule 430A under
the Act is used, the Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission
pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act at or before 5:30 PM New York City time on
the second full business day after the date of this Agreement.

     (g) Prior to the time of purchase or the additional time of purchase, as
the case may be, (i) no stop order with respect to the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement shall have been issued under the Act or proceedings
initiated under Section 8(d) or 8(e) of the

                                       26
<PAGE>

Act; (ii) the Registration Statement and all amendments thereto, or
modifications thereof, if any, shall not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and (iii) the
Prospectus and all amendments or supplements thereto, or modifications thereof,
if any, shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

     (h) Between the time of execution of this Agreement and the time of
purchase or the additional time of purchase, as the case may be, (i) no material
and adverse change or any development involving a prospective material and
adverse change (other than as specifically described in the Registration
Statement and Prospectus), in the business, properties, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, shall occur or become known and (ii) no transaction which is
material to the Company shall have been entered into by the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries.

     (i) The Company will, at the time of purchase or additional time of
purchase, as the case may be, deliver to you a certificate signed by two of the
Company's executive officers to the effect that the representations and
warranties of the Company as set forth in this Agreement are true and correct as
of each such date as if made on each such date, that the Company has performed
such of its obligations under this Agreement as are to be performed at or before
the time of purchase and at or before the additional time of purchase, as the
case may be, and the conditions set forth in Sections 6(g) and 6(h) hereof have
been met.

     (j) The Selling Stockholder will, at the time of purchase or additional
time of purchase, as the case may be, deliver to you a certificate signed on
behalf of the Selling Stockholder to the effect that the representations and
warranties of the Selling Stockholder as set forth in this Agreement are true
and correct as of each date as if made on each such date, that the Selling
Stockholder has performed such of its obligations under this Agreement as are to
be performed at or before the time of purchase and at or before the additional
time of purchase as the case may be, and the conditions set forth in clauses
(ii) and (iii) of Section 6(g) hereof, insofar as it relates to Selling
Stockholder Information, have been met.

     (k) You shall have received the letters referred to in Section 3(i)(p)
hereof.

     (l) The Company and the Selling Stockholder, but in the case of the Selling
Stockholder only to the extent of the Selling Stockholder Information, shall
have furnished to you such other documents and certificates as to the accuracy
and completeness of any statement in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus as of the time of purchase and the additional time of purchase, as
the case may be, as you may reasonably request.

                                       27
<PAGE>

     (m) The Shares shall be approved for listing on the NYSE.

     (n) Between the time of execution of this Agreement and the time of
purchase or additional time of purchase, as the case may be, there shall not
have occurred any downgrading, nor shall any notice or announcement have been
given or made of (i) any intended or potential downgrading or inclusion on a
watchlist or (ii) any watch, review or possible change that does not indicate an
improvement, in the rating accorded any securities of or guaranteed by the
Company or any Subsidiary by any "nationally recognized statistical rating
organization", as that term is defined in Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act.

     7. Effective Date of Agreement; Termination. This Agreement shall become
effective when the parties hereto have executed and delivered this Agreement.

     The obligations of the several Underwriters hereunder shall be subject to
termination in the absolute discretion of UBS Warburg LLC and Salomon Smith
Barney Inc., acting jointly on behalf of the Underwriters, if (x) since the time
of execution of this Agreement or the earlier respective dates as of which
information is given in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, there has
been any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective
material adverse change, in the properties, management, financial condition,
stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, which would, in the judgment of UBS Warburg LLC
and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., acting jointly, make it impracticable or
inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Shares on the terms
and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus, (y) there shall have occurred
any downgrading, or any notice shall have been given of (i) any intended or
potential downgrading or inclusion on a watchlist or (ii) any watch, review or
possible change that does not indicate an improvement, in the rating accorded
any securities of or guaranteed by the Company or any Subsidiary by any
"nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined
in Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act or (z) at any time since the time of execution
of this Agreement and prior to the time of purchase or, with respect to the
purchase of any Additional Shares, the additional time of purchase, (i) trading
in securities on the NYSE, the American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq shall have been
suspended or limitations or minimum prices shall have been established on the
NYSE, the American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, (ii) a general moratorium on
commercial banking activities shall have been declared by either Federal or New
York State authorities or there shall have occurred a material disruption in
commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United
States or (iii) there is an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or one or more
acts of terrorism involving the United States or the declaration by the United
States of a national emergency or war or an occurrence of any other calamity or
crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the
United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event, in the judgment of
UBS Warburg LLC and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., acting jointly, makes it
impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the
Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus.

                                       28
<PAGE>

     If you elect to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section 7, you
shall promptly notify the Company, the Selling Stockholder and each other
Underwriter.

     If the sale to the Underwriters of the Shares, as contemplated by this
Agreement, is not carried out by the Underwriters for any reason permitted under
this Agreement or if such sale is not carried out because the Company or the
Selling Stockholder shall be unable or unwilling, or shall fail for any reason,
to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement, neither the Company nor the
Selling Stockholder shall be under any obligation or liability under this
Agreement (except to the extent provided in Sections 4(i)(k), 5 and 9 hereof),
and the Underwriters shall be under no obligation or liability to the Company or
the Selling Stockholder under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in
Section 9 hereof) or to one another hereunder.

     8. Increase in Underwriters' Commitments. Subject to Sections 6 and 7
hereof, if any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase and pay
for the Firm Shares to be purchased by it hereunder (otherwise than pursuant to
the provisions of Section 7 hereof) and if the number of Firm Shares which all
Underwriters so defaulting shall have agreed but failed to purchase and pay for
does not exceed 10% of the total number of Firm Shares, the non-defaulting
Underwriters shall purchase and pay for (in addition to the aggregate number of
Firm Shares they are obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof) the
number of Firm Shares agreed to be purchased by all such defaulting
Underwriters, as hereinafter provided. Such Shares shall be purchased and paid
for by such non-defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters in such amount or amounts
as you may designate with the consent of each Underwriter so designated or, in
the event no such designation is made, such Shares shall be purchased and paid
for by all non-defaulting Underwriters pro rata in proportion to the aggregate
number of Firm Shares set opposite the names of such non-defaulting Underwriters
in Schedule A.

     Without relieving any defaulting Underwriter from its obligations
hereunder, the Selling Stockholder agrees with the non-defaulting Underwriters
that it will not sell any Firm Shares hereunder unless all of the Firm Shares
are purchased by the Underwriters (or by substituted Underwriters selected by
you with the approval of the Company or selected by the Company with your
approval).

     If a new Underwriter or Underwriters are substituted by the Underwriters or
by the Company for a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters in accordance with
the foregoing provision, the Company or you shall have the right to postpone the
time of purchase for a period not exceeding five business days in order that any
necessary changes in the Registration Statement and Prospectus and other
documents may be effected.

     The term Underwriter as used in this Agreement shall refer to and include
any Underwriter substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if such
substituted Underwriter had originally been named in Schedule A.

                                       29
<PAGE>

     If the aggregate number of Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or
Underwriters agreed to purchase exceeds 10% of the total number of Shares which
all Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder, and if neither the non-defaulting
Underwriters nor the Company shall make arrangements within the five business
day period stated above for the purchase of all the Shares which the defaulting
Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder, this Agreement shall
terminate without further act or deed and without any liability on the part of
the Company or the Selling Stockholder to any non-defaulting Underwriter (except
to the extent provided in Sections 4(i)(k) and 9 hereof) and without any
liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter to the Company or the
Selling Stockholder (except to the extent provided in Section 9 hereof). Nothing
in this paragraph, and no action taken hereunder, shall relieve any defaulting
Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under
this Agreement.

     9. Indemnity and Contribution.

     (a) Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations contained in this
Section 9, the Company and the Selling Stockholder jointly and severally agree
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors
and officers, and any person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and
assigns of all of the foregoing persons from and against any loss, damage,
expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation)
which, jointly or severally, any such Underwriter or any such person may incur
under the Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such
loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any
post-effective amendment thereof by the Company) or in a Prospectus (the term
Prospectus for the purpose of this Section 9 being deemed to include any
Prepricing Prospectus, the Prospectus and the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented by the Company), or arises out of or is based upon any omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated in either such
Registration Statement or Prospectus or necessary to make the statements made
therein not misleading, except insofar as any such loss, damage, expense,
liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in and in conformity with
information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter through you to the
Company expressly for use with reference to such Underwriter in such
Registration Statement or such Prospectus or arises out of or is based upon any
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in connection with such
information required to be stated in such Registration Statement or such
Prospectus or necessary to make such information not misleading, (ii) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement made by the Company or the Selling
Stockholder in Section 3 hereof or the failure by the Company to perform when
and as required any agreement or covenant contained herein or (iii) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any
audio or visual materials provided by the

                                       30
<PAGE>

Company or the Selling Stockholder or based upon written information furnished
by or on behalf of the Company or the Selling Stockholder including, without
limitation, slides, videos, films, tape recordings, used in connection with the
marketing of the Shares; provided, that with respect to any untrue statement or
omission of a material fact made in any Prepricing Prospectus, the indemnity
agreement contained in this Section 9(a) shall not inure to the benefit of any
Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or
liability purchased the securities concerned, to the extent that any such loss,
claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter occurs under the circumstance
where it shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by
final and nonappealable judgment that (w) the Company had previously furnished
copies of the Prospectus to the Underwriters, (x) delivery of the Prospectus was
required by the Act to be made to such person, (y) the untrue statement or
omission of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement
was corrected in the Prospectus and (z) there was not sent or given to such
person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such securities
to such person, a copy of the Prospectus.

     In making a claim for indemnification or contribution under this Section 9
by any indemnified party against the Company or the Selling Stockholder, and
subject to the further provisions of this paragraph, any such indemnified party:
(i) may proceed, with respect to a claim for indemnification or contribution
based on or arising out of the Selling Stockholder Information, against either
the Company or the Selling Stockholder and (ii) may proceed, with respect to a
claim for indemnification or contribution not based on or arising out of the
Selling Stockholder Information, against the Company only, or against both the
Company and the Selling Stockholder jointly, but may not proceed solely against
the Selling Stockholder. Except with respect to a claim for indemnification or
contribution based on or arising out of the Selling Stockholder Information (as
to which the following restrictions shall not apply), in the event that an
indemnified party is entitled to seek indemnity or contribution hereunder
against any loss, liability, claim, damage and expense incurred as contemplated
by this Section 9(a), as a precondition to any indemnified party obtaining
indemnification or contribution from the Selling Stockholder, any such
indemnified party shall first: (a) (i) obtain a final judgment from a trial
court of competent jurisdiction that such indemnified party is entitled to
indemnity or contribution under this Agreement with respect to such loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense (the "Final Judgment") from the Company and
the Selling Stockholder and (ii) seek to satisfy such Final Judgment in full
from the Company by making a written demand upon the Company for such
satisfaction and pursuing appropriate legal actions to satisfy the Final
Judgment, or (b) obtain a final determination from a trial court of competent
jurisdiction that such indemnity or contribution is unenforceable against the
Company (a "Final Determination"). If such Final Determination has been
obtained, or such Final Judgment shall remain unsatisfied in whole or in part 30
days following the date of receipt by the Company of such demand, such
indemnified party shall have the right to make demand directly on the Selling
Stockholder (but, in the case of a Final Judgment, only if and to the extent the
Company has not already satisfied such Final Judgment). Such indemnified

                                       31
<PAGE>

party shall, however, be relieved of its obligation to first obtain a Final
Determination or, in the case of a Final Judgment, to first seek to obtain
payment from the Company with respect to such Final Judgment as required by this
Section 9, if (w) the Company files a petition for relief under the United
States Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") and such order remains unstayed
and in effect for 60 days, (x) an order for relief is entered against the
Company in an involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Code and such order remains
unstayed and in effect for 60 days, (y) the Company makes an assignment for the
benefit of its creditors, or (z) any court orders or approves the appointment of
a receiver or custodian for the Company or a substantial portion of its assets
and such order remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days.

     If any action, suit or proceeding (together, a "Proceeding") is brought
against an Underwriter or any such person in respect of which indemnity may be
sought against the Company or the Selling Stockholder pursuant to the foregoing
paragraph, such Underwriter or such person shall promptly notify the Company and
Selling Stockholder in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and the
Company or the Selling Stockholder, as the case may be, shall assume the defense
of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory
to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses; provided,
however, that the omission to so notify the Company or the Selling Stockholder
shall not relieve the Company or Selling Stockholder from any liability which
the Company or Selling Stockholder may have to any Underwriter or any such
person or otherwise. Such Underwriter or such person shall have the right to
employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or of such person
unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by
the Company in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or the Company
shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the
circumstances, employed counsel to defend such Proceeding or such indemnified
party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses
available to it or them which are different from, additional to or in conflict
with those available to the Company or the Selling Stockholder (in which case
the Company shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Proceeding on
behalf of the indemnified party or parties, but the Company and/or the Selling
Stockholder may employ counsel and participate in the defense thereof at its own
expense), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by the
Company or the Selling Stockholder, as the case may be, and paid as incurred (it
being understood, however, that the Company or the Selling Stockholder shall not
be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any
local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the
same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such
Proceeding). The Company or the Selling Stockholder shall not be liable for any
settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent, but if
settled with the written consent of the Company or the Selling Stockholder, the
Company or the Selling Stockholder, having given such consent, agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless any Underwriter and any such person from and against
any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, if

                                       32
<PAGE>

at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to
reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated
by the second sentence of this paragraph, then such indemnifying party agrees
that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without
its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business
days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii)
such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in
accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such
indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days'
prior notice of its intention to settle. No indemnifying party shall, without
the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any
pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or
could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such
indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of
such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter
of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault, culpability or a
failure to act, by or on behalf of such indemnified party.

     (b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Company, the Selling Stockholder, their respective directors and
officers, and any person who controls the Company or the Selling Stockholder
within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act
and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons from and against
any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of
investigation) which, jointly and severally, the Company, the Selling
Stockholder or any such person may incur under the Act, the Exchange Act, the
common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or
claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in and in conformity with information
furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you to the
Company expressly for use with reference to such Underwriter in the Registration
Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective
amendment thereof by the Company) or in a Prospectus, or arises out of or is
based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in
connection with such information required to be stated in such Registration
Statement or such Prospectus or necessary to make such information not
misleading.

     If any Proceeding is brought against the Company, the Selling Stockholder
or any such person in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any
Underwriter pursuant to the foregoing paragraph, the Company, the Selling
Stockholder or such person shall promptly notify such Underwriter in writing of
the institution of such Proceeding and such Underwriter shall assume the defense
of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory
to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses; provided,
however, that the omission to so notify such Underwriter shall not relieve such
Underwriter from any liability which such Underwriter may have to the Company,
the Selling Stockholder or any such person or otherwise. The Company, the
Selling Stockholder

                                       33
<PAGE>

or such person shall have the right to employ their or its own counsel in any
such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
the Company, the Selling Stockholder or such person unless the employment of
such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by such Underwriter in
connection with the defense of such Proceeding or such Underwriter shall not
have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed
counsel to defend such Proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall
have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them
which are different from or additional to or in conflict with those available to
such Underwriter (in which case such Underwriter shall not have the right to
direct the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party or
parties, but such Underwriter may employ counsel and participate in the defense
thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
such Underwriter), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne
by such Underwriter and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that
such Underwriter shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate
counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of
related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified
parties who are parties to such Proceeding). No Underwriter shall be liable for
any settlement of any such Proceeding effected without the written consent of
such Underwriter but if settled with the written consent of such Underwriter,
such Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Selling
Stockholder and any such person from and against any loss or liability by reason
of such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an
indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the
indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second
sentence of this paragraph, then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be
liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent
if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt
by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying
party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such
request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party
shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days' prior notice of its
intention to settle. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written
consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or
threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have
been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified
party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such
indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of
such Proceeding.

     (c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to
an indemnified party under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 9 in respect
of any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein,
then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such
indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or
claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the
Underwriters on the other hand

                                       34
<PAGE>

from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i)
above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but
also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one
hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or
omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or
claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and
the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective
proportions as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting
discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Selling
Stockholder and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the
Underwriters, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Shares. The
relative fault of the Company and Selling Stockholder on the one hand and of the
Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the
Company and Selling Stockholder on the one hand or by the Underwriters on the
other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or
payable by a party as a result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and
claims referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or
other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with
investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.

     (d) The Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters agree that it
would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were
determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one
entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (c) of this
Section 9. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, in no case shall
any Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by
which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by such Underwriter and
distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any
damage which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of
such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters'
obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion
to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint.

     (e) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 9
and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company and the Selling
Stockholder contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its
partners, directors or officers or any person (including each partner, officer
or director of such person) who controls any

                                       35
<PAGE>

Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Selling Stockholder or
their respective directors or officers or any person who controls any of the
foregoing within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the
issuance and delivery of the Shares. The Company, the Selling Stockholder and
each Underwriter agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any
Proceeding against it and against any of the officers or directors of the
Company in connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares, or in connection
with the Registration Statement or Prospectus.

     10. Notices. Except as otherwise herein provided, all statements, requests,
notices and agreements shall be in writing or by telegram and, if to the
Underwriters, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent to UBS
Warburg LLC, 299 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10171-0026, Attention: Syndicate

respects if delivered or sent to the Company at the offices of the Company at

     11. Information Furnished by the Underwriters. The statements set forth in
the last paragraph on the cover page of the Prospectus and the statements set
forth in the fifth, eighth, ninth and tenth paragraphs under the caption
"Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement constitute the only information

in Sections 3 and 9 hereof.

     12. Governing Law; Construction. This Agreement and any claim, counterclaim
or dispute of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of or in any way
relating to this Agreement ("Claim"), directly or indirectly, shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The
section headings in this Agreement have been inserted as a matter of convenience
of reference and are not a part of this Agreement.

     13. Submission to Jurisdiction. Except as set forth below, no Claim may be
commenced, prosecuted or continued in any court other than the courts of the
State of New York located in the City and County of New York or in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which courts shall
have jurisdiction over the adjudication of such matters, and you, the Company
and the Selling Stockholder consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and
personal service with respect thereto. The Company and the Selling Stockholder
hereby consent to personal jurisdiction, service and venue in any court in which
any Claim arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement is brought by
any third party against an Underwriter or any indemnified party. Each
Underwriter, the Company and

                                       36
<PAGE>

the Selling Stockholder (on their own behalf and, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, on behalf of their respective stockholders and affiliates)
waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim
(whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) in any way arising out of or
relating to this Agreement. The Company and the Selling Stockholder agree that a
final judgment in any such action, proceeding or counterclaim brought in any
such court shall be conclusive and binding thereupon, and may be enforced in any
other courts in the jurisdiction to which the Company or the Selling Stockholder
is or may be subject, by suit upon such judgment.

     14. Parties at Interest. The Agreement herein set forth has been and is
made solely for the benefit of the Underwriters, the Company, the Selling
Stockholder and, to the extent provided in Section 9 hereof, the controlling
persons, directors and officers referred to in such section, and their
respective successors, assigns, heirs, personal representatives and executors
and administrators. No other person, partnership, association or corporation
(including a purchaser, as such purchaser, from any of the Underwriters) shall
acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement.

     15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed by the parties in one or
more counterparts which together shall constitute one and the same agreement
among the parties.

     16. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
Underwriters, the Company and the Selling Stockholder and their successors and
assigns and any successor or assign of any substantial portion of the Company's,
the Selling Stockholders and any of the Underwriters' respective businesses
and/or assets.

     17. Miscellaneous. UBS Warburg LLC, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
UBS AG, is not a bank and is separate from any affiliated bank, including any
U.S. branch or agency of UBS Warburg LLC. Because UBS Warburg LLC is a
separately incorporated entity, it is solely responsible for its own contractual
obligations and commitments, including obligations with respect to sales and
purchases of securities. Securities sold, offered or recommended by UBS Warburg
LLC are not deposits, are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, are not guaranteed by a branch or agency, and are not otherwise an
obligation or responsibility of a branch or agency.

     A lending affiliate of UBS Warburg LLC may have lending relationships with
issuers of securities underwritten or privately placed by UBS Warburg LLC. To
the extent required under the securities laws, prospectuses and other disclosure
documents for securities underwritten or privately placed by UBS Warburg LLC
will disclose the existence of any such lending relationships and whether the
proceeds of the issue will be used to repay debts owed to affiliates of UBS
Warburg LLC.

UBS Warburg LLC
Salomon Smith Barney Inc.
    As Representatives of the Several Underwriters
c/o UBS Warburg LLC
299 Park Avenue
New York, New York 10171

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     This Lock-Up Letter Agreement is being delivered to you in connection with
the proposed Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") to be entered
into by and among Cobalt Corporation (the "Company"), Wisconsin United for
Health Foundation, Inc. and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters,
with respect to the public offering (the "Offering") of common stock of the
Company (the "Common Stock").

     In order to induce you to enter into the Underwriting Agreement, the
undersigned agrees that from the date hereof through and including the 90th day
after the date of the final prospectus relating to the Offering, the undersigned
will not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of UBS
Warburg LLC, (i) sell, offer to sell, contract to sell, hypothecate, pledge,
grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of, or establish or increase a
put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position
within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder
with respect to, any Common Stock of the Company or any securities convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, or warrants or other
rights to purchase Common Stock or any such security, except for the exercise of
any stock option by the undersigned, (ii) enter into any swap or other
arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic
consequences of ownership of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, or warrants or other rights to
purchase Common Stock, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery
of Common Stock or such other

                                       1
<PAGE>

securities, in cash or otherwise, or (iii) publicly announce an intention to
effect any transaction specified in clause (i) or (ii). The foregoing sentence
shall not apply to (a) the sale of any Common Stock to the Underwriters pursuant
to the Underwriting Agreement; (b) bona fide gifts, provided the recipient or
recipients thereof agree in writing to be bound by the terms of this Lock-Up
Letter Agreement; or (c) in connection with the simultaneous sale of all of the
Common Stock of the Company (by means of a merger, consolidation or otherwise).

     In addition, the undersigned hereby waives any rights the undersigned may
have to require registration of Common Stock in connection with the filing of a
registration statement relating to the Offering. The undersigned further agrees
that, from the date hereof through and including the 90th day after the date of
the final prospectus relating to the Offering, the undersigned will not,
directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of UBS Warburg LLC,
