         WHEREAS, the Lenders have made available to the Borrower a credit
facility pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement.

         WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested certain amendments to the Credit

the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth.

         NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

                  Section 1. Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used herein and
         not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the
         Credit Agreement.

                  Section 2. Amendments to the Credit Agreement. Subject to the
         satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4 hereof,
         the Credit Agreement is hereby amended as of the Effective Date (as
         hereinafter defined) as follows:

                  (A)      Article 1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended
                           by adding the following definition in the appropriate
                           alphabetical sequence:

         "'Tax Sharing Agreement' shall mean the Federal Income Tax Sharing

         (B) Section 6.5 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by adding a

         and is continuing, payments to Hallmark Cards for amounts owing to
         Hallmark Cards under the Tax Sharing Agreement (including any payments
         to Hallmark Cards under Section 2 of the Tax Sharing Agreement),
         provided that such payments are no greater than amounts that the
         Borrower would have owed directly to the Internal Revenue Service if it
         were an independent tax payer and provided, further, that without the
         consent of the Required Lenders, the Borrower shall not be permitted to
         repay to Hallmark Cards any amounts that have been paid to it by
         Hallmark Cards under the Tax Sharing Agreement in an amount greater
         than $10,000,000 in the aggregate from and after the Effective Date (as
         such term is defined in Amendment No. 5 to the Credit Agreement dated
         as of February 5, 2003)."

                  (C) Section 6.23 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by
