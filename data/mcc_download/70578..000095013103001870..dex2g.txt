                                    Exhibit J

Schedule 10.1(c) to the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended to include the
following items:

National Steel Pellet Company
1.   The taconite Maximum Achievable Control Technology standard, as proposed by
     EPA on December 18, 2002, would require an upgrade to NSPC's waste gas dust
     control system.
2.   In November 2000, NSPC was contacted by the City of Hibbing regarding drums
     found on property formerly owned by the Hanna Ore Mining Company. NSPC
     notified the City and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency ("MPCA") that
     subsequent sampling revealed no contamination and to date, no further
     action has been taken against NSPC.
3.   In June 1981, NSPC provided notice to EPA pursuant to section 103(c) of the
     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of
     1980, 42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq., ("CERCLA"), that approximately 70,000
     gallons of open gear lubricants containing between 1% and 2% lead had been
     disposed in stockpiles throughout NSPC's property.
4.   In October 1999, the EPA Region V Office issued an Information Request to
     NSPC seeking records relating to production rates, fuel usage, physical
     changes and changes in the method of operation of NSPC facilities since
     1978. NSPC responded to the Request in December 1999 and has received no
     further communication from EPA regarding this request.
5.   NSPC has experienced periodic exceedances of its turbidity limit at Outfall
     050.
6.   In August 2002, the MPCA issued an Administrative Penalty Order to NSPC for
     tailings basin fugitive dust emissions. Due to unseasonable weather
     conditions, NSPC continues to experience fugitive dust incidents in the
     area of its tailings basins, and although no further penalties have been
     assessed by MPCA, NSPC has received numerous complaints from local
     residents regarding property damage stemming from these emissions.
7.   NSPC's Title V Air Permit requires NSPC to do air modeling for particulate
     matter. While NSPC has been advised by the state that this modeling is not
     required despite the permit condition, should the state subsequently elect
     to enforce this requirement, there is the potential that modeling would not
     show compliance with the established ambient air standard.

                                    Exhibit X

Section II of Schedule 5.20 of the Disclosure Schedule is hereby amended to
include the following items:

National Steel Pellet Company
1.   The taconite Maximum Achievable Control Technology standard, as proposed by
     EPA on December 18, 2002, would require an upgrade to NSPC's waste gas dust
     control system.
2.   In November 2000, NSPC was contacted by the City of Hibbing regarding drums
     found on property formerly owned by the Hanna Ore Mining Company. NSPC
     notified the City and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency ("MPCA") that
     subsequent sampling revealed no contamination and to date, no further
     action has been taken against NSPC.
3.   In June 1981, NSPC provided notice to EPA pursuant to section 103(c) of the
     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of
     1980, 42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq., ("CERCLA"), that approximately 70,000
     gallons of open gear lubricants containing between 1% and 2% lead had been
     disposed in stockpiles throughout NSPC's property.
4.   In October 1999, the EPA Region V Office issued an Information Request to
     NSPC seeking records relating to production rates, fuel usage, physical
     changes and changes in the method of operation of NSPC facilities since
     1978. NSPC responded to the Request in December 1999 and has received no
     further communication from EPA regarding this request.
5.   NSPC has experienced periodic exceedances of its turbidity limit at Outfall
     050.
6.   In August 2002, the MPCA issued an Administrative Penalty Order to NSPC for
     tailings basin fugitive dust emissions. Due to unseasonable weather
     conditions, NSPC continues to experience fugitive dust incidents in the
     area of its tailings basins, and although no further penalties have been
     assessed by MPCA, NSPC has received numerous complaints from local
     residents regarding property damage stemming from these emissions.
7.   NSPC's Title V Air Permit requires NSPC to do air modeling for particulate
     matter. While NSPC has been advised by the state that this modeling is not
     required despite the permit condition, should the state subsequently elect
     to enforce this requirement, there is the potential that modeling would not
     show compliance with the established ambient air standard.
8.   All other potential violations, releases, and areas of contamination
     referenced in the Draft Environmental Due Diligence Assessment of National
     Steel Pellet Company, Keewatin, Minnesota, Prepared by ENSR, July 2002,
     Document No. 06975-293-208
