notwithstanding, Entrust Mortgage shall remain liable under each Contract and

<U>Remedies, Rights Upon Default.</U> (a) In addition to any other
rights given to Lender hereunder, if an Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing and Lender shall have declared the amounts owing under the Note to be
due and payable (or such amounts shall have automatically, become due and
payable), all payments received by Entrust Mortgage under or in connection with
any of the Collateral shall be held by Entrust Mortgage in trust for Lender,
shall be segregated from other funds of Entrust Mortgage and shall, if requested
by Lender forthwith upon receipt by Entrust Mortgage be turned over to Lender,
in the same form as received by Entrust Mortgage (duly endorsed by Entrust
Mortgage to Lender, if required).</FONT></FONT> </P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para" -->
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><FONT SIZE="2">(b)
If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing Lender may exercise
in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to it in this Security
Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or
relating to the Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under
the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Entrust Mortgage
expressly agrees that in any such event, Lender, without demand of performance
or other demand, (except the notice specified below of time and place of public
or private sale) to or upon Entrust Mortgage or any other person may forthwith
collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part
thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options to
purchase, or sell or otherwise dispose of and deliver said Collateral (or
contract to do so), or any part thereof, in one or more parcels at public or
private sale or sales, at any exchange broker&#146;s board or at any of
Lender&#146;s offices or elsewhere at such prices as it may deem best, for cash
or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk.
Lender shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the
extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the
whole or any part of said Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of
redemption, which equity of redemption Entrust Mortgage hereby releases. Entrust
Mortgage further agrees, at Lender&#146;s request, to assemble the Collateral,
make it available to Lender at places which Lender shall reasonably select,
whether at Entrust Mortgage&#146;s premises or elsewhere. Lender shall apply the
net proceeds of any such collection, recovery, receipt, appropriation,
realization or sale, after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every
kind incurred therein or incidental to the care, safe keeping or otherwise of
any or all of the Collateral or in any way relating to the rights of Lender
hereunder, including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and legal expenses, to the
payment in whole or in part of the Obligations, Entrust Mortgage remaining
liable for any deficiency remaining unpaid after the application, and only after
so paying over such net proceeds and after the payment by Lender of any other
amount required by any provision of law. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, Entrust Mortgage waives all claims, damages, and demands against Lender
arising out of the repossession, retention or sale of the Collateral. Entrust
Mortgage agrees that Lender need not give more than 10 days notice of the time
and place of any public sale or of the time after which a private sale may take
place and that such notice is reasonable notification of such matters. Entrust
Mortgage shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or
disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all amounts to which
Lender is entitled.</FONT></FONT> </P>
