<h1 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center"><font size="3">Third Declaration of Amendment</font></h1>

<p align=center style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Pursuant to the
retained power of amendment contained in Section 11.2 of the BMC Industries,
Inc. Savings and Profit Sharing Plan - 2001 Revision, the Plan is amended in
the manner set forth below to reflect certain provisions of the Economic Growth
and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (&quot;EGTRRA&quot;).&nbsp; This amendment is intended as good faith
compliance with the requirements of EGTRRA and is to be construed in accordance
with EGTRRA and Treasury Regulations.&nbsp;
Except as this amendment provides otherwise, this amendment will be
effective as of January 1, 2002.&nbsp; This
amendment will supersede the provisions of the Plan to the extent those
provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of this amendment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effective for limitation years beginning
after December 31, 2001, the aggregate annual additions that may be contributed
or allocated to a Participant's account under the Plan for any Plan Year will
not exceed the lesser of:<br></p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; $40,000, as adjusted for increases in the
cost-of-living under Code section 415(d), or<br><br></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">(b)&nbsp; 100 percent of the Participant's Section
415 Wages for the Plan Year.&nbsp; The
compensation limit referred to in this clause (b) will not apply to any contribution
for medical benefits after separation from service (within the meaning of Code
sections 401(h) or 419A(f)(2)) that is otherwise treated as an annual addition.<br></p>

</blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Eligible earnings and Testing Wages
of a Participant taken into account for any Plan Year beginning after December
31, 2001, will not exceed $200,000, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in
accordance with Code section 401(a)(17)(B).&nbsp;
The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to
Eligible Earnings and Testing Wages for the determination period that begins
with or within such calendar year.<br><br></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term &quot;key employee&quot; means
any employee or former employee (including any deceased employee) who, at any
time during the Plan Year that includes the determination date, was an officer
of an Affiliated Organization having annual compensation greater than $130,000
(as adjusted under Code section 416(i)(1) for Plan Years beginning after
December 31, 2002), a 5-percent owner of the Affiliated Organization, or a
1-percent owner of the Affiliated Organization having annual compensation of
more than $150,000.&nbsp; For this purpose
annual compensation means compensation within the meaning of Code section
415(c)(3).&nbsp; The determination of key
employees will be made in accordance with Code section 416(i)(1) of the Code
and Treasury Regulations.<br><br></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In determining if the Plan is a top-heavy
plan, the present values of accrued benefits and the amounts of account
balances of an employee as of the determination date will be increased by the
distributions made with respect to the employee under the Plan and any plan
aggregated with the Plan under Code section 416(g)(2) during the 1-year period
ending on the determination date.&nbsp; The
preceding sentence will also apply to distributions under a termination plan
which, had it not been terminated, would have been aggregated with the Plan
under Code section 416(g)(2)(A)(i).&nbsp; If
a distribution is made for a reason other than separation from service, death,
or disability, this provision will be applied by substituting &quot;5-year
period&quot; for &quot;1-year period.&quot;&nbsp;
The accrued benefits and accounts of any individual who has not
performed services for the Affiliated Organization during the 1-year period
ending on the determination date will not be taken into account.<br><br></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Plan is a top-heavy plan, Matching
Contributions will be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the minimum
contribution requirements of Code section 416(c)(2) and the Plan.&nbsp; The preceding sentence will apply with
respect to Matching Contributions under the Plan or, if the Plan provides that
the minimum contribution requirement will be met in another plan, such other
plan.&nbsp; Matching Contributions that are
used to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements will be treated as
matching contributions for purposes of the actual contribution percentage test
and other requirements of Code section 401(m).<br><br></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effective for distributions made after
December 31, 2001, for purposes of the direct rollover provisions in Section
8.7, an eligible retirement plan will also mean an annuity contract described
in Code section 403(b) and an eligible plan under Code section 457(b) that is
maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and that agrees
to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this
Plan.&nbsp; The definition of eligible
retirement plan will also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving
spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a
qualified domestic relation order, as defined in Code section 414(p).&nbsp; No amount that is distributed on account of
hardship will be an eligible rollover distribution, and the distribute may not
elect to have any portion of such a distribution paid directly to an eligible
retirement plan.<br><br></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A portion of a distribution will not fail
to be an Eligible Rollover Distribution merely because the portion consists of
After-Tax Contributions that are not includible in gross income.&nbsp; However, such portion may be transferred
only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a)
or (b) of the Code or to a qualified defined&nbsp;
contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that
agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately
accounting for the portion of such distribution that is includible in gross
income and the portion of such distribution that is not so includible.<br><br></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan will accept Rollover
contributions of Eligible Rollover Distributions made after December 31, 2001,
from:<br></p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; a qualified plan described in Code
section 401(a) or 403(a), excluding after-tax employee contributions;<br><br></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">(b)&nbsp; an annuity contract described in Code
section 403(b), excluding after-tax employee contributions; or<br><br></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; an eligible plan under Code section
457(b) that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any
agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state.<br><br></p>

</blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Plan will not accept a participant
rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual
retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code
that is eligible to be rolled over and would otherwise be includible in gross
income, other than such an account or annuity that is solely a conduit for
distributions from a qualified retirement plan, excluding after-tax employee
contributions.<br><br></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">10)For purposes of Section 8.1(a)
(involuntary distribution of vested Accounts of $5,000 or less), the value of a
Participant's no forfeitable Account balances will be determined without regard
to that portion of the Account balances that is attributable to a Participant's
Profit Sharing Plan Rollover Account and Rollover contributions (and earnings
allocable thereto) within the meaning of sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8),
408(d)(3)(A)(ii), and 457(e)(16) of the Code.<br><br></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">11)The multiple use test described in
Treasury Regulation section 1.401(m)-2 and Section 9.4 will not apply.<br><br></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">12)The top-heavy requirements of Code
section 416 and Section 13.3 will not apply in any year beginning after
December 31, 2001, in which the Plan consists solely of a cash or deferred
arrangement which meets the design-based safe harbor alternative requirements
of Code section 401(k)(12) and Matching Contributions with respect to which the
design-based safe harbor alternative requirements of Code section 401(m)(11)
are met.<br><br></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">13)A Participant who receives a hardship
withdrawal of 401(k) Contributions after December 31, 2001, will be prohibited
from making 401(k) Contributions and After-Tax Contributions under this Plan
and elective deferrals and after-tax employee contributions under any other
plans maintained by any Affiliated Organization for 6 months after receipt of
the hardship withdrawal.<br><br></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">14)A Participant's vested Account balances
will become distributable following the Participant's severance from employment
with all Affiliated Organizations.&nbsp; Such
a distribution will be subject to the other provisions of the Plan regarding distributions,
other than provisions that require a separation from service before such
amounts may be distributed.<br><br></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">IN WITNESS
WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this instrument to be executed this 31<sup>st</sup>
day of December, 2002.</p>
