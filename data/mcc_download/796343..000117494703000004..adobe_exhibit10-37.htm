<B><P>7.1</B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><B>Types of SARs Authorized.</B> SARs may be granted in tandem with all or any portion of a related Option (a <I>"<B>Tandem SAR</B>"</I>) or may be granted independently of any Option (a <I>"<B>Freestanding SAR</B>"</I>). A Tandem SAR may be granted either concurrently with the grant of the related Option or at any time thereafter prior to the complete exercise, termination, expiration or cancellation of such related Option.</P>
<B><P>7.2</B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><B>Exercise Price.</B> The exercise price for each SAR shall be established in the discretion of the Committee; provided, however, that the exercise price per share subject to a Tandem SAR shall be the exercise price per share under the related Option.</P>

The Committee may, in its discretion, provide in any Award Agreement evidencing a Tandem SAR that such SAR may not be exercised without the advance approval of the Company and, if such approval is not given, then the Option shall nevertheless remain exercisable in accordance with its terms. A Tandem SAR shall terminate and cease to be exercisable no later than the date on which the related Option expires or is terminated or canceled. Upon the exercise of a Tandem SAR with respect to some or all of the shares subject to such SAR, the related Option shall be canceled automatically as to the number of shares with respect to which the Tandem SAR was exercised. Upon the exercise of an Option related to a Tandem SAR as to some or all of the shares subject to such Option, the related Tandem SAR shall be canceled automatically as to the number of shares with respect to which the related Option was exercised.</P>

<B><P>7.4</B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><B>Exercise of SARs.</B> Upon the exercise (or deemed exercise pursuant to Section 7.5) of an SAR, the Participant (or the Participant's legal representative or other person who acquired the right to exercise the SAR by reason of the Participant's death) shall be entitled to receive payment of an amount for each share with respect to which the SAR is exercised equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of exercise of the SAR over the exercise price. Payment of such amount shall be made in cash, shares of Stock, or any combination thereof as determined by the Committee. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement evidencing such SAR, payment shall be made in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the date of exercise of the SAR. The Award Agreement evidencing any SAR may provide for deferred payment in a lump sum or in installments. When payment is to be made in shares of Stock, the number of shares to be issued shall be determined on the basis of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of exercise of the SAR. For purposes of Section 7, an SAR shall be deemed exercised on the date on which the Company shall have received notice of exercise from the Participant.</P>

<B><P>7.6</B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><B>Effect of Termination of Service.</B> An SAR shall be exercisable after a Participant's termination of Service to such extent and during such period as determined by the Committee, in its discretion, and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such SAR.</P>

Upon request by the Company, each Participant shall execute any agreement evidencing such transfer restrictions prior to the receipt of shares of Stock hereunder and shall promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends evidencing any such transfer restrictions.</P>

However, in the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.2, then any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than normal cash dividends) to which the Participant is entitled by reason of the Participant's Stock Award shall be immediately subject to the same Vesting Conditions as the shares subject to the Stock Award with respect to which such dividends or distributions were paid or adjustments were made.</P>
<B><P>8.7</B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><B>Effect of Termination of Service</B>. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the grant of a Stock Award and set forth in the Award Agreement, if a Participant's Service terminates for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary (including the Participant's death or disability), then (i)&nbsp;the Company shall have the option to repurchase for the purchase price paid by the Participant any shares acquired by the Participant pursuant to a Stock Purchase Right which remain subject to Vesting Conditions as of the date of the Participant's termination of Service and (ii)&nbsp;the Participant shall forfeit to the Company any shares acquired by the Participant pursuant to a Stock Bonus which remain subject to Vesting Conditions as of the date of the Participant's termination of Service.

<B><P>13.2</B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><B>Withholding in Shares.</B> The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deduct from the shares of Stock issuable to a Participant upon the exercise or settlement of an Award, or to accept from the Participant the tender of, a number of whole shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value, as determined by the Company, equal to all or any part of the tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group.

<B><U><LI>Miscellaneous Provisions</U>.</LI>
<P>15.1</B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><B>Repurchase Rights<I>.</B></I> Shares issued under the Plan may be subject to one or more repurchase options, or other conditions and restrictions as determined by the Committee in its discretion at the time the Award is granted. The Company shall have the right to assign at any time any repurchase right it may have, whether or not such right is then exercisable, to one or more persons as may be selected by the Company. Upon request by the Company, each Participant shall execute any agreement evidencing such transfer restrictions prior to the receipt of shares of Stock hereunder and shall promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends evidencing any such transfer restrictions.</P>
<B><P>15.2</B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><B>Provision of Information.</B> Each Participant shall be given access to information concerning the Company equivalent to that information generally made available to the Company's common stockholders.</P>
<B><P>15.3</B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><B>Rights as Employee or Consultant</B> <B>.</B> No person, even though eligible pursuant to Section 5, shall have a right to be selected as a Participant, or, having been so selected, to be selected again as a Participant. Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall confer on any Participant a right to remain an Employee or Consultant, or interfere with or limit in any way any right of a Participating Company to terminate the Participant's Service at any time.</P>
<B><P>15.4</B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><B>Rights as a Stockholder.</B> A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by an Award until the date of the issuance of such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such shares are issued, except as provided in Section 4.2 or another provision of the Plan.</P>
<B><P>15.5</B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><B>Fractional Shares.</B> The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares upon the exercise or settlement of any Award.</P>
<B><P>15.6</B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><B>Beneficiary Designation.</B> Each Participant may file with the Company a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any benefit under the Plan to which the Participant is entitled in the event of such Participant's death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit. Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime. If a married Participant designates a beneficiary other than the Participant's spouse, the effectiveness of such designation shall be subject to the consent of the Participant's spouse. If a Participant dies without an effective designation of a beneficiary who is living at the time of the Participant's death, the Company will pay any remaining unpaid benefits to the Participant's legal representative.</P>
<B><P>15.7</B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I><B>Unfunded Obligation.</B> Participants shall have the status of general unsecured creditors of the Company. Any amounts payable to Participants pursuant to the Plan shall be unfunded and unsecured obligations for all purposes, including, without limitation, Title&nbsp;I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. No Participating Company shall be required to segregate any monies from its general funds, or to create any trusts, or establish any special accounts with respect to such obligations. The Company shall retain at all times beneficial ownership of any investments, including trust investments, which the Company may make to fulfill its payment obligations hereunder. Any investments or the creation or maintenance of any trust or any Participant account shall not create or constitute a trust or fiduciary relationship between the Committee or any Participating Company and a Participant, or otherwise create any vested or beneficial interest in any Participant or the Participant's creditors in any assets of any Participating Company. The Participants shall have no claim against any <A NAME="_Toc433182160"><A NAME="_Toc433182008">Participating Company for any changes in the value of any assets which may be invested or reinvested by the Company with respect to the Plan.</A></A></P>
