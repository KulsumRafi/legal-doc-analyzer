     AND without limiting any of the other provisions of this Security
Instrument, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Borrower expressly grants
to Lender, as secured party, a security interest in the portion of the Property
which is or may be subject to the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code
which are applicable to secured transactions; it being understood and agreed
that the Improvements and Fixtures are part and parcel of the Land (the Land,
the Improvements and the Fixtures collectively referred to as the "Real
Property") appropriated to the use thereof and, whether affixed or annexed to
the Real Property or not, shall for the purposes of this Security Instrument be
deemed conclusively to be real estate and mortgaged hereby.

     Section 1.2 Assignment of Rents. Borrower hereby absolutely and
unconditionally assigns to Lender all of Borrower's right, title and interest in
and to all current and future Leases and Rents; it being intended by Borrower
that this assignment constitutes a present, absolute assignment and not an
assignment for additional security only. Nevertheless, subject to the terms of
the Assignment of Leases, the Cash Management Agreement and Section 7.1(h) of
this Security Instrument, Lender grants to Borrower a revocable license to
collect, receive, use and enjoy the Rents and Borrower shall hold the Rents, or
a portion thereof sufficient to discharge all current sums due on the Debt, for
use in the payment of such sums.

     Section 1.3 Security Agreement. This Security Instrument is both a real
property mortgage and a "security agreement" within the meaning of the Uniform
Commercial Code. The Property includes both real and personal property and all
other rights and interests, whether tangible or intangible in nature, of
Borrower in the Property. By executing and delivering this Security Instrument,
Borrower hereby grants to Lender, as security for the Obligations (hereinafter
defined), a security interest in the Fixtures, the Equipment and the Personal
Property to the full extent that the Fixtures, the Equipment and the Personal
Property may be subject to the Uniform Commercial Code (said portion of the
Property so subject to the Uniform Commercial Code being called the


                                       5
<PAGE>

"Collateral"). If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, Lender, in
addition to any other rights and remedies which it may have, shall have and may
exercise immediately and without demand, any and all rights and remedies granted
to a secured party upon default under the Uniform Commercial Code, including,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the right to take possession
of the Collateral or any part thereof, and to take such other measures as Lender
may deem necessary for the care, protection and preservation of the Collateral.
Upon request or demand of Lender after the occurrence and during the continuance
of an Event of Default, Borrower shall, at its expense, assemble the Collateral
and make it available to Lender at a convenient place (at the Land if tangible
property) reasonably acceptable to Lender. Borrower shall pay to Lender on
demand any and all expenses, including reasonable legal expenses and attorneys'
fees, incurred or paid by Lender in protecting its interest in the Collateral
and in enforcing its rights hereunder with respect to the Collateral after the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default. Any notice of
sale, disposition or other intended action by Lender with respect to the
Collateral sent to Borrower in accordance with the provisions hereof at least
ten (10) business days prior to such action, shall, except as otherwise provided
by applicable law, constitute reasonable notice to Borrower. The proceeds of any
disposition of the Collateral, or any part thereof, may, except as otherwise
required by applicable law, be applied by Lender to the payment of the Debt in
such priority and proportions as Lender in its discretion shall deem proper.
Borrower's (debtor's) principal place of business is as set forth on page one
hereof and the address of Lender (secured party) is as set forth on page one
hereof.

     Section 1.4 Fixture Filing. Certain of the Property is or will become
"fixtures" (as that term is defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) on the Land,
and this Security Instrument, upon being filed for record in the real estate
records of the city or county wherein such fixtures are situated, shall operate
also as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing in accordance with the
applicable provisions of said Uniform Commercial Code upon such of the Property
that is or may become fixtures.

     Section 1.5 Pledges of Monies Held. Borrower hereby pledges to Lender any
and all monies now or hereafter held by Lender or on behalf of Lender,
including, without limitation, any sums deposited in the Lockbox Account, the
Reserve Funds and Net Proceeds, as additional security for the Obligations until
expended or applied as provided in this Security Instrument.

                               CONDITIONS TO GRANT

     TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the above granted and described Property unto and to
the use and benefit of Trustee and its successors and assigns, forever;

     IN TRUST, WITH POWER OF SALE, to secure payment to Lender of the
Obligations at the time and in the manner provided for its payment in the Note
and in this Security Instrument.

and in any event never permit to be created or exist in respect of the Property
or any part thereof any other or additional lien or security interest other than
the liens or security interests hereof except for the Permitted Encumbrances;
provided, however, in the event Borrower receives notice of any such lien or
security interest Borrower shall have thirty (30) days to discharge, bond or
otherwise remove the same of record.

     (b)  After prior written notice to Lender, Borrower, at its own expense,
          may contest by appropriate legal proceeding, promptly initiated and
          conducted in good faith and with due diligence, the amount or validity
          or application in whole or in part of any of the Labor and Material
          Costs, provided that (i) no Event of Default has occurred and is
          continuing under the Loan Agreement, the Note, this Security
          Instrument or any of the other Loan Documents, (ii) Borrower is
          permitted to do so under the provisions of any other mortgage, deed of
          trust or deed to secure debt affecting the Property, (iii) such
          proceeding shall suspend the collection of the Labor and Material
          Costs from Borrower and from the Property or Borrower shall have paid
          all of the Labor and Material Costs under protest, (iv) such
          proceeding shall be permitted under and be conducted in accordance
          with the provisions of any other instrument to which Borrower is
          subject and shall not constitute a default thereunder, (v) neither the
          Property nor any part thereof or interest therein will be in danger of
          being sold, forfeited, terminated, canceled or lost, and (vi) Borrower
          shall have furnished the security as may be required in the
          proceeding, or as may be reasonably requested by Lender to insure the
          payment of any contested Labor and Material Costs, together with all
          interest and penalties thereon.


                                       8

     Section 3.7 Performance of Other Agreements. Borrower shall observe and
perform each and every term, covenant and provision to be observed or performed
by Borrower pursuant to the Loan Agreement, any other Loan Document and any
other agreement or recorded instrument affecting or pertaining to the Property
and any amendments, modifications or changes thereto.

     Section 3.8 Change of Name, Identity or Structure. Borrower shall not
change Borrower's name, identity (including its trade name or names) or, if not
an individual, Borrower's corporate, partnership or other structure without
notifying Lender of such change in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to
the effective date of such change and, in the case of a change in Borrower's
structure, without first obtaining the prior written consent of Lender, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Borrower shall execute
and deliver to Lender, prior to or contemporaneously with the effective date of
any such change, any financing statement or financing statement change required
by Lender to establish or maintain the validity, perfection and priority of the
security interest granted herein. At the request of Lender, Borrower shall
execute a certificate in form reasonably satisfactory to Lender listing the
trade names under which Borrower intends to operate the Property, and
representing and warranting that Borrower does business under no other trade
name with respect to the Property.

     Section 3.9 Title. Borrower has good and insurable fee simple title to the
real property comprising part of the Property and good title to the balance of
such Property, free and clear all Liens (as defined in the Loan Agreement)
whatsoever except the Permitted Encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement),
such other Liens as are permitted pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Liens
created by the Loan Documents. The Permitted Encumbrances in the aggregate do
not materially and adversely affect the value, operation or use of the Property
or Borrower's ability to repay the Loan. This Security Instrument, when properly
recorded in the appropriate records, together with any Uniform Commercial Code
financing statements required to be filed in connection therewith, will create
(a) a valid, perfected first priority lien on the Property, subject only to
Permitted Encumbrances, other Liens permitted by the Loan Documents and the
Liens created by the Loan Documents and (b) perfected security interests in and
to, and perfected collateral assignments of, all personalty (including the
Leases), all in accordance with the terms thereof, in each case subject only to
any applicable Permitted Encumbrances, such other Liens as are permitted
pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Liens created by the Loan Documents to
the extent the same may be perfected by filing a financing statement. There are


                                       9
<PAGE>

no claims for payment for work, labor or materials affecting the Property which
are past due and are or may become a lien prior to, or of equal priority with,
the Liens created by the Loan Documents unless such claims for payments are
being contested in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Security
Instrument.

                      ARTICLE 4 - OBLIGATIONS AND RELIANCES


     Section 4.1 Relationship of Borrower and Lender. The relationship between
Borrower and Lender is solely that of debtor and creditor, and Lender has no
fiduciary or other special relationship with Borrower, and no term or condition
of any of the Loan Agreement, the Note, this Security Instrument and the other
Loan Documents shall be construed so as to deem the relationship between
Borrower and Lender to be other than that of debtor and creditor.

     Section 4.2 No Reliance on Lender. The general partners, members,
principals and (if Borrower is a trust) beneficial owners of Borrower are
experienced in the ownership and operation of properties similar to the
Property, and Borrower and Lender are relying solely upon such expertise and
business plan in connection with the ownership and operation of the Property.
Borrower is not relying on Lender's expertise, business acumen or advice in
connection with the Property.

     Section 4.3 No Lender Obligations. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of
Subsections 1.1(h) and (n) or Section 1.2, Lender is not undertaking the
performance of (i) any obligations under the Leases; or (ii) any obligations
with respect to such agreements, contracts, certificates, instruments,
franchises, permits, trademarks, licenses and other documents.

     (b)  By accepting or approving anything required to be observed, performed
          or fulfilled or to be given to Lender pursuant to this Security
          Instrument, the Loan Agreement, the Note or the other Loan Documents,
          including, without limitation, any officer's certificate, balance
          sheet, statement of profit and loss or other financial statement,
          survey, appraisal, or insurance policy, Lender shall not be deemed to
          have warranted, consented to, or affirmed the sufficiency, the
          legality or effectiveness of same, and such acceptance or approval
          thereof shall not constitute any warranty or affirmation with respect
          thereto by Lender.

     Section 4.4 Reliance. Borrower recognizes and acknowledges that in
accepting the Loan Agreement, the Note, this Security Instrument and the other
Loan Documents, Lender is expressly and primarily relying on the truth and
accuracy of the warranties and representations set forth in Section 4.1 of the
Loan Agreement without any obligation to investigate the Property and
notwithstanding any investigation of the Property by Lender; that such reliance
existed on the part of Lender prior to the date hereof, that the warranties and
representations are a material inducement to Lender in making the Loan; and that
Lender would not be willing to make the Loan and accept this Security Instrument
in the absence of the warranties and representations as set forth in Section 4.1
of the Loan Agreement.

                         ARTICLE 5 - FURTHER ASSURANCES


                                       10
<PAGE>

     Section 5.1 Recording of Security Instrument, etc. Borrower forthwith upon
the execution and delivery of this Security Instrument and thereafter, from time
to time, will cause this Security Instrument and any of the other Loan Documents
creating a lien or security interest or evidencing the lien hereof upon the
Property and each instrument of further assurance to be filed, registered or
recorded in such manner and in such places as may be required by any present or
future law in order to publish notice of and fully to protect and perfect the
lien or security interest hereof upon, and the interest of Lender in, the
Property. Borrower will pay all taxes, filing, registration or recording fees,
and all expenses incident to the preparation, execution, acknowledgment and/or
recording of the Note, this Security Instrument, the other Loan Documents, any
note, deed of trust or mortgage supplemental hereto, any security instrument
with respect to the Property and any instrument of further assurance, and any
modification or amendment of the foregoing documents, and all federal, state,
county and municipal taxes, duties, imposts, assessments and charges arising out
of or in connection with the execution and delivery of this Security Instrument,
any deed of trust or mortgage supplemental hereto, any security instrument with
respect to the Property or any instrument of further assurance, and any
modification or amendment of the foregoing documents, except where prohibited by
law so to do.

     Section 5.2 Further Acts, etc. Borrower will, at the cost of Borrower, and
without expense to Lender, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all and every
further acts, deeds, conveyances, deeds of trust, mortgages, assignments,
notices of assignments, transfers and assurances as Lender shall, from time to
time, reasonably require, for the purpose of assuring, conveying, assigning,
transferring, and confirming unto Lender and Trustee the property and rights
hereby deeded, granted, bargained, sold, conveyed, confirmed, pledged, assigned,
warranted and transferred or intended now or hereafter so to be, or which
Borrower may be or may hereafter become bound to convey or assign to Lender, or
for carrying out the intention or facilitating the performance of the terms of
this Security Instrument or for filing, registering or recording this Security
Instrument, or for complying with all Legal Requirements. Borrower, promptly on
demand, will execute and deliver, and in the event it shall fail to so execute
and deliver, hereby authorizes Lender to execute in the name of Borrower or
without the signature of Borrower to the extent Lender may lawfully do so, one
or more financing statements to evidence more effectively the security interest
of Lender in the Property. Borrower grants to Lender an irrevocable power of
attorney coupled with an interest for the purpose of exercising and perfecting
any and all rights and remedies available to Lender at law and in equity,
including without limitation, such rights and remedies available to Lender
pursuant to this Section 5.2; provided, however, Lender will not exercise the
same without giving Borrower three (3) days advance written notice so long as
such notice does not materially effect Lender's ability to exercise its rights
and remedies.

     Section 5.3 Changes in Tax, Debt, Credit and Documentary Stamp Laws. (a) If
any law is enacted or adopted or amended after the date of this Security
Instrument which deducts the Debt from the value of the Property for the purpose
of taxation or which imposes a tax, either directly or indirectly, on the Debt
or Lender's interest in the Property, Borrower will pay the tax, with interest
and penalties thereon, if any. If Lender is advised by counsel chosen by it that
the payment of tax by Borrower would be unlawful or taxable to Lender or
unenforceable or provide the basis for a defense of usury then Lender shall have
the option by written notice of not less than one hundred twenty (120) days to
declare the Debt immediately due and payable.


                                       11
<PAGE>

     (b)  Borrower will not claim or demand or be entitled to any credit or
          credits on account of the Debt for any part of the Taxes or Other
          Charges assessed against the Property, or any part thereof, and no
          deduction shall otherwise be made or claimed from the assessed value
          of the Property, or any part thereof, for real estate tax purposes by
          reason of this Security Instrument or the Debt. If such claim, credit
          or deduction shall be required by law, Lender shall have the option,
          by written notice of not less than one hundred twenty (120) days, to
          declare the Debt immediately due and payable.

     (c)  If at any time the United States of America, any State thereof or any
          subdivision of any such State shall require revenue or other stamps to
          be affixed to the Note, this Security Instrument, or any of the other
          Loan Documents or impose any other tax or charge on the same, Borrower
          will pay for the same, with interest and penalties thereon, if any.

     Section 5.4 Splitting of Deed of Trust. This Security Instrument and the
Note shall, at any time until the same shall be fully paid and satisfied, at the
sole election of Lender, be severed into two or more notes and two or more
security instruments in such denominations as Lender shall determine in its sole
discretion, each of which shall cover all or a portion of the Property to be
more particularly described therein. To that end, Borrower, upon written request
of Lender, shall execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be executed,
acknowledged and delivered by the then owner of the Property, to Lender and/or
its designee or designees substitute notes and security instruments in such
principal amounts, aggregating not more than the then unpaid principal amount of
this Security Instrument, and containing terms, provisions and clauses similar
to those contained herein and in the Note, and such other documents and
instruments as may be reasonably required by Lender, provided that the costs
incurred herewith shall be at Lender's sole cost and expense. As a condition
hereto, Lender shall contemporaneously with the execution of the substitute
documents, return the old documents to Borrower "marked" VOID or CANCELED or
such documents shall otherwise be satisfied or released to Borrower's reasonable
satisfaction.

     Section 5.5 Replacement Documents. Upon receipt of an affidavit of an
officer of Lender as to the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of the Note
or any other Loan Document which is not of public record, and, in the case of
any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of such Note or other Loan
Document, Borrower will issue, in lieu thereof, a replacement Note or other Loan
Document, dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or
other Loan Document in the same principal amount thereof and otherwise of like
tenor.

                       ARTICLE 6 - DUE ON SALE/ENCUMBRANCE

     Section 6.1 Lender Reliance. Borrower acknowledges that Lender has examined
and relied on the experience of Borrower and its general partners, members,
principals and (if Borrower is a trust) beneficial owners in owning and
operating properties such as the Property in agreeing to make the Loan, and will
continue to rely on Borrower's ownership of the Property as a means of
maintaining the value of the Property as security for repayment of the Debt and
the performance of the Other Obligations. Borrower acknowledges that Lender has
a valid interest in maintaining the value of the Property so as to ensure that,
should Borrower default in the repayment of the Debt or the performance of the
Other Obligations, Lender can recover the Debt by a sale of the Property.


                                       12
<PAGE>

     Section 6.2 No Sale/Encumbrance. Neither Borrower nor any Restricted Party
shall Transfer the Property or any part thereof or any interest therein or
permit or suffer the Property or any part thereof or any interest therein to be
Transferred other than as expressly permitted pursuant to the terms of the Loan
Agreement.

                  ARTICLE 7 - RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT

     Section 7.1 Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default, Borrower agrees that Lender or Trustee, or both may take such
action, without notice or demand, as it deems advisable to protect and enforce
its rights against Borrower and in and to the Property, including, but not
limited to, the following actions, each of which may be pursued concurrently or
otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender or Trustee may determine, in
their sole discretion, without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights
and remedies of Lender or Trustee:

          or portions and in any order or manner;

     (c)  with or without entry, to the extent permitted and pursuant to the
          procedures provided by applicable law, institute proceedings for the

          Debt then due and payable, subject to the continuing lien and security
          interest of this Security Instrument for the balance of the Debt not
          then due, unimpaired and without loss of priority;

     (d)  to the extent permitted by applicable law, sell for cash or upon
          credit the Property or any part thereof and all estate, claim, demand,

          and after such notice thereof as may be required or permitted by law;

     (e)  institute an action, suit or proceeding in equity for the specific
          performance of any covenant, condition or agreement contained herein,
          in the Note, the Loan Agreement or in the other Loan Documents;



                                       13
<PAGE>

     (f)  recover judgment on the Note either before, during or after any
          proceedings for the enforcement of this Security Instrument or the
          other Loan Documents;

     (g)  apply for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, liquidator or
          conservator of the Property, without notice and without regard for the
          adequacy of the security for the Debt and without regard for the
          solvency of Borrower, any guarantor, indemnitor with respect to the
          Loan or of any Person liable for the payment of the Debt;

     (h)  revoke the license granted to Borrower under Section 1.2 hereof and
          Lender may enter into or upon the Property, either personally or by
          their agents, nominees or attorneys and dispossess Borrower and its
          agents and servants therefrom, without liability for trespass, damages
          or otherwise and exclude Borrower and its agents or servants wholly
          therefrom, and take possession of all books, records and accounts
          relating thereto and Borrower agrees to surrender possession of the
          Property and of such books, records and accounts to Lender upon
          demand, and thereupon Lender may (i) use, operate, manage, control,

          every part of the Property and conduct the business thereat; (ii)
          complete any construction on the Property in such manner and form as
          Lender deems advisable; (iii) make alterations, additions, renewals,
          replacements and improvements to or on the Property; (iv) exercise all
          rights and powers of Borrower with respect to the Property, whether in
          the name of Borrower or otherwise, including, without limitation, the
          right to make, cancel, enforce or modify Leases, obtain and evict
          tenants, and demand, sue for, collect and receive all Rents of the
          Property and every part thereof; (v) require Borrower to pay monthly
          in advance to Lender, or any receiver appointed to collect the Rents,

          the Property to the payment of the Debt, in such order, priority and
          proportions as Lender shall deem appropriate in its sole discretion
          after deducting therefrom all expenses (including reasonable
          attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with the aforesaid operations
          and all amounts necessary to pay the Taxes, Other Charges, insurance
          and other expenses in connection with the Property, as well as just
          and reasonable compensation for the services of Lender, its counsel,
          agents and employees;

     (i)  exercise any and all rights and remedies granted to a secured party
          upon default under the Uniform Commercial Code, including, without
          limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) the right to take
          possession of the Fixtures, the Equipment, the Personal Property or
          any part thereof, and to take such other measures as Lender may deem
          necessary for the care, protection and preservation of the Fixtures,
          the Equipment, the Personal Property, and (ii) request Borrower at its
          expense to assemble the Fixtures, the Equipment, the Personal Property
          and make it available to Lender at the Real Property or such other
          convenient place acceptable to Lender. Any notice of sale, disposition
          or other intended action by Lender with respect to the Fixtures, the

          the provisions hereof at least ten (10) days prior to such action,

<PAGE>

     (j)  apply any sums then deposited or held in escrow or otherwise by or on
          behalf of Lender in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement,
          this Security Instrument or any other Loan Document to the payment of
          the following items in any order in its uncontrolled discretion:

          (i)  Taxes and Other Charges;

          (ii) Insurance Premiums;

          (iii) Interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Note;

          (iv) Amortization of the unpaid principal balance of the Note;

          (v)  All other sums payable pursuant to the Note, the Loan Agreement,
               this Security Instrument and the other Loan Documents, including
               without limitation advances made by Lender pursuant to the terms
               of this Security Instrument;

     (k)  pursue such other remedies as Lender may have under applicable law; or

     (l)  apply the undisbursed balance of any Net Proceeds Deficiency deposit,
          together with interest thereon, to the payment of the Debt in such
          order, priority and proportions as Lender shall deem to be appropriate
          in its discretion.

In the event of a sale, by foreclosure, power of sale or otherwise, of less than
all of Property, this Security Instrument shall continue as a lien and security
interest on the remaining portion of the Property unimpaired and without loss of
priority.

     Section 7.2 Application of Proceeds. The purchase money, proceeds and
avails of any disposition of the Property, and or any part thereof, or any other
sums collected by Lender pursuant to the Note, this Security Instrument or the
other Loan Documents, may be applied by Lender to the payment of the Debt in
such priority and proportions as Lender in its discretion shall deem proper.

     Section 7.3 Right to Cure Defaults. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, Lender may, but without any obligation to
do so and without notice to or demand on Borrower and without releasing Borrower
from any obligation hereunder, make any payment or do any act required of
Borrower hereunder in such manner and to such extent as Lender may deem
necessary to protect the security hereof. Lender is authorized to enter upon the
Property for such purposes, or appear in, defend, or bring any action or
proceeding to protect its interest in the Property or to foreclose this Security


                                       15
<PAGE>

Instrument or collect the Debt, and the cost and expense thereof (including
reasonable attorneys' fees to the extent permitted by law), with interest as
provided in this Section 7.3, shall constitute a portion of the Debt and shall
be due and payable to Lender upon demand. All such costs and expenses incurred
by Lender in remedying such Event of Default or such failed payment or act or in
appearing in, defending, or bringing any such action or proceeding shall bear
interest at the Default Rate, for the period after notice from Lender that such
cost or expense was incurred to the date of payment to Lender. All such costs
and expenses incurred by Lender together with interest thereon calculated at the
Default Rate shall be deemed to constitute a portion of the Debt and be secured
by this Security Instrument and the other Loan Documents and shall be
immediately due and payable upon demand by Lender therefor.

     Section 7.4 Actions and Proceedings. Lender or Trustee has the right to
appear in and defend any action or proceeding brought with respect to the
Property and to bring any action or proceeding, in the name and on behalf of
Borrower, which Lender, in its discretion, decides should be brought to protect
its interest in the Property.

     Section 7.5 Recovery of Sums Required To Be Paid. Lender shall have the
right from time to time to take action to recover any sum or sums which
constitute a part of the Debt as the same become due, without regard to whether
or not the balance of the Debt shall be due, and without prejudice to the right
of Lender or Trustee thereafter to bring an action of foreclosure, or any other
action, for a default or defaults by Borrower existing at the time such earlier
action was commenced.

     Section 7.6 Examination of Books and Records. At reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice, Lender, its agents, accountants and attorneys shall have the
right to examine the records, books, management and other papers of Borrower
which reflect upon their financial condition, at the Property or at any office
regularly maintained by Borrower where the books and records are located. Lender
and its agents shall have the right to make copies and extracts from the
foregoing records and other papers. In addition, at reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice, Lender, its agents, accountants and attorneys shall have the
right to examine and audit the books and records of Borrower pertaining to the
income, expenses and operation of the Property during reasonable business hours
at any office of Borrower where the books and records are located. This Section
7.6 shall apply throughout the term of the Note and without regard to whether an
Event of Default has occurred or is continuing.

     Section 7.7 Other Rights, etc. (a) The failure of Lender or Trustee to
insist upon strict performance of any term hereof shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of any term of this Security Instrument. Borrower shall not be relieved
of Borrower's obligations hereunder by reason of (i) the failure of Lender or
Trustee to comply with any request of Borrower or any guarantor or indemnitor
with respect to the Loan to take any action to foreclose this Security
Instrument or otherwise enforce any of the provisions hereof or of the Note or
the other Loan Documents, (ii) the release, regardless of consideration, of the
whole or any part of the Property, or of any person liable for the Debt or any
portion thereof, or (iii) any agreement or stipulation by Lender extending the
time of payment or otherwise modifying or supplementing the terms of the Note,
this Security Instrument or the other Loan Documents.


                                       16
<PAGE>

     (b)  It is agreed that the risk of loss or damage to the Property is on
          Borrower, and Lender shall have no liability whatsoever for decline in
          value of the Property, for failure to maintain the Policies, or for
          failure to determine whether insurance in force is adequate as to the
          amount of risks insured. Possession by Lender shall not be deemed an
          election of judicial relief if any such possession is requested or
          obtained with respect to any Property or collateral not in Lender's
          possession.

     (c)  Lender may resort for the payment of the Debt to any other security
          held by Lender in such order and manner as Lender, in its discretion,
          may elect. Lender or Trustee may take action to recover the Debt, or
          any portion thereof, or to enforce any covenant hereof without

without, as to the remainder of the Property, in any way impairing or affecting
the lien or priority of this Security Instrument, or improving the position of
any subordinate lienholder with respect thereto, except to the extent that the
obligations hereunder shall have been reduced by the actual monetary
consideration, if any, received by Lender for such release, and may accept by
assignment, pledge or otherwise any other property in place thereof as Lender
may require without being accountable for so doing to any other lienholder. This
Security Instrument shall continue as a lien and security interest in the
remaining portion of the Property.

     Section 7.9 Violation of Laws. If the Property is not in material
compliance with Legal Requirements, Lender may impose additional requirements
upon Borrower in connection herewith including, without limitation, monetary
reserves or financial equivalents.

Parties (as hereinafter defined) are entitled to enforce the obligations of
Borrower, any guarantor and indemnitor contained in Sections 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4
herein without first resorting to or exhausting any security or collateral and
without first having recourse to the Note or any of the Property, through
foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise, and in
the event Lender commences a foreclosure action against the Property, or
otherwise causes Trustee to exercise the power of sale pursuant to this Security
Instrument, Lender is entitled to pursue a deficiency judgment with respect to
such obligations against Borrower and any guarantor or indemnitor with respect
to the Loan. The provisions of Sections 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4 herein are exceptions

this Security Instrument or the other Loan Documents, and Borrower and any

of Borrower and any guarantor or indemnitor with respect to the Loan pursuant to
Sections 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4 herein is not limited to the original principal amount

prevent Lender or Trustee from foreclosing or exercising a power of sale
pursuant to this Security Instrument or exercising any other rights and remedies
pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Note, this Security Instrument and the other
Loan Documents, whether simultaneously with foreclosure proceedings or in any
other sequence. A separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted

action is brought against any other Person or whether or not any other Person is
joined in the action or actions. In addition, Lender shall have the right but

administrative or judicial proceedings or actions initiated in connection with
any matter addressed in Article 8 or Section 9.4 herein.

agreements and communications between Borrower and Lender are hereby and shall
automatically be limited so that, after taking into account all amounts deemed
interest, the interest contracted for, charged or received by Lender shall never
exceed the maximum lawful rate or amount, (b) in calculating whether any
interest exceeds the lawful maximum, all such interest shall be amortized,
prorated, allocated and spread over the full amount and term of all principal
indebtedness of Borrower to Lender, and (c) if through any contingency or event,
Lender receives or is deemed to receive interest in excess of the lawful
maximum, any such excess shall be deemed to have been applied toward payment of
the principal of any and all then outstanding indebtedness of Borrower to
Lender, or if there is no such indebtedness, shall immediately be returned to
Borrower.

remedies provided in this Security Instrument may be exercised only to the

render this Security Instrument invalid, unenforceable or not entitled to be
recorded, registered or filed under the provisions of any applicable law. If any
term of this Security Instrument or any application thereof shall be invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Security Instrument and any other
application of the term shall not be affected thereby.

binding upon and inure to the benefit of Borrower and Lender and their
respective successors and assigns forever.

     Section 15.3 Inapplicable Provisions. If any term, covenant or condition of

Security Instrument shall be construed without such provision.

subrogated to all of the rights, claims, liens, titles, and interests existing
against the Property heretofore held by, or in favor of, the holder of such
indebtedness and such former rights, claims, liens, titles, and interests, if
any, are not waived but rather are continued in full force and effect in favor
of Lender and are merged with the lien and security interest created herein as

     Section 15.8 Limitation on Lender's Responsibility. No provision of this
Security Instrument shall operate to place any obligation or liability for the
control, care, management or repair of the Property upon Lender, nor shall it
operate to make Lender responsible or liable for any waste committed on the
Property by the tenants or any other Person, or for any dangerous or defective
condition of the Property, or for any negligence in the management, upkeep,
repair or control of the Property resulting in loss or injury or death to any
tenant, licensee, employee or stranger. Nothing herein contained shall be
construed as constituting Lender a "mortgagee in possession."

                      ARTICLE 16 - DEED OF TRUST PROVISIONS

                  Section 16.1 Concerning the Trustee. Trustee shall be under no
duty to take any action hereunder except as expressly required hereunder or by
law, or to perform any act which would involve Trustee in any material expense
or liability or to institute or defend any suit in respect hereof, unless
properly indemnified to Trustee's reasonable satisfaction. Trustee, by
acceptance of this Security Instrument, covenants to perform and fulfill the
trusts herein created, being liable, however, only for negligence or willful
misconduct, and hereby waives any statutory fee and agrees to accept reasonable
compensation, in lieu thereof, for any services rendered by Trustee in
accordance with the terms hereof. Trustee may resign at any time upon giving
thirty (30) days' notice to Borrower and to Lender. Lender may remove Trustee at
any time or from time to time and select a successor trustee. In the event of
the death, removal, resignation, refusal to act, or inability to act of Trustee,
or in its sole discretion for any reason whatsoever Lender may, without notice
and without specifying any reason therefor and without applying to any court,
select and appoint a successor trustee, by an instrument recorded wherever this
Security Instrument is recorded and all powers, rights, duties and authority of
Trustee, as aforesaid, shall thereupon become vested in such successor. Such
substitute trustee shall not be required to give bond for the faithful
performance of the duties of Trustee hereunder unless required by Lender. The
procedure provided for in this paragraph for substitution of Trustee shall be in
addition to and not in exclusion of any other provisions for substitution, by
law or otherwise.

     Section 16.2 Trustee's Fees. Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs, fees
and expenses incurred by Trustee and Trustee's agents and counsel in connection
with the performance by Trustee of Trustee's duties hereunder and all such
costs, fees and expenses shall be secured by this Security Instrument.

     Section 16.3 Certain Rights. With the approval of Lender, Trustee shall
have the right to take any and all of the following actions: (i) to select,
employ, and advise with counsel (who may be, but need not be, counsel for
Lender) upon any matters arising hereunder, including the preparation,
execution, and interpretation of the Loan Agreement, the Note, this Security
Instrument or the other Loan Documents, and shall be fully protected in relying
as to legal matters on the advice of counsel, (ii) to execute any of the trusts
and powers hereof and to perform any duty hereunder either directly or through
his agents or attorneys, (iii) to select and employ, in and about the execution
of his duties hereunder, suitable accountants, engineers and other experts,
agents and attorneys-in-fact, either corporate or individual, not regularly in
the employ of Trustee, and Trustee shall not be answerable for any act, default,
negligence, or misconduct of any such accountant, engineer or other expert,
agent or attorney-in-fact, if selected with reasonable care, or for any error of
judgment or act done by Trustee in good faith, or be otherwise responsible or
accountable under any circumstances whatsoever, except for Trustee's gross
negligence or bad faith, and (iv) any and all other lawful action as Lender may
instruct Trustee to take to protect or enforce Lender's rights hereunder.
Trustee shall not be personally liable in case of entry by Trustee, or anyone
entering by virtue of the powers herein granted to Trustee, upon the Property
for debts contracted for or liability or damages incurred in the management or
operation of the Property. Trustee shall have the right to rely on any
instrument, document, or signature authorizing or supporting an action taken or
proposed to be taken by Trustee hereunder, believed by Trustee in good faith to
be genuine. Trustee shall be entitled to reimbursement for actual expenses
incurred by Trustee in the performance of Trustee's duties hereunder and to
reasonable compensation for such of Trustee's services hereunder as shall be
rendered.


                                       28

     Section 16.4 Retention of Money. All moneys received by Trustee shall,
until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for
which they were received, but need not be segregated in any manner from any
other moneys (except to the extent required by applicable law) and Trustee shall
be under no liability for interest on any moneys received by Trustee hereunder.

     Section 16.5 Perfection of Appointment. Should any deed, conveyance, or
instrument of any nature be required from Borrower by any Trustee or substitute
trustee to more fully and certainly vest in and confirm to the Trustee or
substitute trustee such estates rights, powers, and duties, then, upon written
request by the Trustee or substitute trustee, any and all such deeds,
conveyances and instruments reasonably requested shall be made, executed,
acknowledged, and delivered and shall be caused to be recorded and/or filed by
Borrower.

     Section 16.6 Succession Instruments. Any substitute trustee appointed
pursuant to any of the provisions hereof shall, without any further act, deed,
or conveyance, become vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers,
and trusts of its or his predecessor in the rights hereunder with like effect as
if originally named as Trustee herein; but nevertheless, upon the written
request of Lender or of the substitute trustee, the Trustee ceasing to act shall
execute and deliver any instrument transferring to such substitute trustee, upon
the trusts herein expressed, all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and
trusts of the Trustee so ceasing to act, and shall duly assign, transfer and
deliver any of the property and moneys held by such Trustee to the substitute
trustee so appointed in the Trustee's place.

                      ARTICLE 17 - SPECIAL TEXAS PROVISIONS

     Section 17.1 Principles of Construction. In the event of any
inconsistencies between the terms and provisions of this Article 17 and the
terms and provisions of any other Article of this Deed of Trust, the terms and
provisions of this Article 17 shall govern and control.

     Section 17.2 Warranty of Title. Borrower warrants that Borrower has good,
insurable and fee simple indefeasible title to the Property and has the full
power, authority and right to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under
this Security Instrument and to deed, encumber, mortgage, give, grant, bargain,
sell, alienate, enfeoff, convey, confirm, pledge, assign and hypothecate the
same and that Borrower possesses an unencumbered fee simple indefeasible estate
in the Property and the Improvements, subject to those exceptions and
encumbrances shown in the title insurance policy insuring the lien of this
Security Instrument, and that it owns the Property free and clear of all liens,
encumbrances and charges whatsoever except for those exceptions shown in the
title insurance policy insuring the lien of this Security Instrument and that
this Security Instrument is and will remain a valid and enforceable first lien
on and security interest in the Property, subject only to said exceptions.
Borrower shall forever warrant, defend and preserve such title and the validity
and priority of the lien of this Security Instrument and shall forever warrant
and defend the same to Lender against the claims of all persons whomsoever.


                                       29

     Section 17.3 Instrument. This Security Instrument shall be deemed and shall
be enforceable as a deed of trust and financing statement.

     Section 17.4 Foreclosure. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default,
Lender may request Trustee to proceed with foreclosure under the power of sale
which is hereby conferred, such foreclosure to be accomplished in accordance
with the following provisions:

     (a)  Public Sale. Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered, and it shall
          be Trustee's special duty, upon such request of Lender, to sell the
          Property, or any part thereof, at public auction to the highest bidder
          for cash, with or without having taken possession of same. Any such
          sale (including notice thereof) shall comply with the applicable
          requirements, at the time of the sale, of Section 51.002 of the Texas
          Property Code or, if and to the extent such statute is not then in
          force, with the applicable requirements, at the time of the sale, of
          the successor statute or statutes, if any, governing sales of Texas
          real property under powers of sale conferred by deeds of trust. If
          there is no statute in force at the time of the sale governing sales
          of Texas real property under powers of sale conferred by deeds of
          trust, such sale shall comply with applicable law, at the time of the
          sale, governing sales of Texas real property under powers of sale
          conferred by deeds of trust. Trustee or his successor or substitute
          may appoint or delegate any one or more persons as agent to perform
          any act or acts necessary or incident to any sale held by Trustee,
          including the posting of notices, and the conduct of sale, but in the
          name and on behalf of Trustee, his successor or substitute.

     (b)  Right to Require Proof of Financial Ability and/or Cash Bid. At any
          time during the bidding, the Trustee may require a bidding party (A)
          to disclose its full name, state and city of residence, occupation,
          and specific business office location, and the name and address of the
          principal the bidding party is representing (if applicable), and (B)
          to demonstrate reasonable evidence of the bidding party's financial
          ability (or, if applicable, the financial ability of the principal of
          such bidding party), as a condition to the bidding party submitting
          bids at the foreclosure sale. If any such bidding party (the
          "Questioned Bidder") declines to comply with the Trustee's requirement
          in this regard, or if such Questioned Bidder does respond but the
          Trustee, in Trustee's sole and absolute discretion, deems the
          information or the evidence of the financial ability of the Questioned
          Bidder (or, if applicable, the principal of such bidding party) to be
          inadequate, then the Trustee may continue the bidding with
          reservation; and in such event (1) the Trustee shall be authorized to
          caution the Questioned Bidder concerning the legal obligations to be
          incurred in submitting bids, and (2) if the Questioned Bidder is not
          the highest bidder at the sale, or if having been the highest bidder
          the Questioned Bidder fails to deliver the cash purchase price payment
          promptly to the Trustee, all bids by the Questioned Bidder shall be
          null and void. The Trustee may, in Trustee's sole and absolute
          discretion, determine that a credit bid may be in the best interest of
          the Borrower and Lender, and elect to sell the Property for credit or
          for a combination of cash and credit; provided, however, that the
          Trustee shall have no obligation to accept any bid except an all cash
          bid. In the event the Trustee requires a cash bid and cash is not
          delivered within a reasonable time after conclusion of the bidding
          process, as specified by the Trustee, but in no event later than 3:45
          p.m. local time on the day of sale, then said contingent sale shall be
          null and void, the bidding process may be recommenced, and any
          subsequent bids or sale shall be made as if no prior bids were made or
          accepted.


                                       30

     (c) Sale Subject to Unmatured Debt. In addition to the rights and powers of
sale granted under the preceding provisions of this subsection, if default is
made in the payment of any installment of the Debt, Lender may, at Lender's
option, at once or at any time thereafter while any matured installment remains
unpaid, without declaring the entire Debt to be due and payable, orally or in
writing direct Trustee to enforce this Security Instrument and to sell the
Property subject to such unmatured Debt and to the rights, powers, liens,
security interests, and assignments securing or providing recourse for payment
of such unmatured Debt, in the same manner, all as provided in the preceding
provisions of this subsection. Sales made without maturing the Debt may be made
hereunder whenever there is a default in the payment of any installment of the
Debt, without exhausting the power of sale granted hereby, and without affecting
in any way the power of sale granted under this subsection, the unmatured
balance of the Debt or the rights, powers, liens, security interests, and
assignments securing or providing recourse for payment of the Debt.

     (d) Partial Foreclosure. Sale of a part of the Property shall not exhaust
the power of sale, but sales may be made from time to time until the Debt is
paid in full. It is intended by each of the foregoing provisions of this
subsection that Trustee may, after any request or direction by Lender, sell not
only the Property and the Improvements, but also the Equipment and other
interests constituting a part of the Property or any part thereof, along with
the Property and the Improvements or any part thereof, as a unit and as a part
of a single sale, or may sell at any time or from time to time any part or parts
of the Property separately from the remainder of the Property. It shall not be
necessary to have present or to exhibit at any sale any of the Property. Any
sale of personal property made hereunder shall be deemed to have been a public
sale conducted in a commercially reasonable manner if held contemporaneously
with, or as part of, and upon the same notice as required for the sale of real
property under the power of sale granted herein.

     (e) Trustee's Deeds. After any sale under this subsection, Trustee shall
make good and sufficient deeds, assignments, and other conveyances to the
purchaser or purchasers thereunder in the name of Borrower, conveying the
Property or any part thereof so sold to the purchaser or purchasers with general
warranty of title by Borrower. It is agreed that in any deeds, assignments or
other conveyances given by Trustee, any and all statements of fact or other
recitals therein made as to the identity of Lender, the occurrence or existence
of any Event of Default, the notice of intention to accelerate, or acceleration
of, the maturity of the Debt, the request to sell, notice of sale, time, place,
terms and manner of sale, and receipt, distribution, and application of the
money realized therefrom, the due and proper appointment of a substitute
trustee, and without being limited by the foregoing, any other act or thing
having been duly done by or on behalf of Lender or by or on behalf of Trustee,
shall be taken by all courts of law and equity as prima facie evidence that such
statements or recitals state true, correct, and complete facts and are without
further question to be so accepted, and Borrower does hereby ratify and confirm
any and all acts that Trustee may lawfully do in the Property by virtue hereof.

     Section 17.5 Receiver. Lender, as a matter of right and without regard to
the sufficiency of the security for repayment of the Debt and performance and
discharge of the obligations hereunder, without notice to Borrower and without
any showing of insolvency, fraud, or mismanagement on the part of Borrower, and
without the necessity of filing any judicial or other proceeding other than the
proceeding for appointment of a receiver, shall be entitled to the appointment
of a receiver or receivers of the Property or any part thereof, and of the
Rents, and Borrower hereby irrevocably consents to the appointment of a receiver
or receivers. Any receiver appointed pursuant to the provisions of this
subsection shall have the usual powers and duties of receivers in such matters.

     Section 17.6 Inapplicability of Credit Code. In no event shall the
provisions of Article 5069, ch. 15 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas (which
regulates certain revolving credit loan accounts and revolving triparty
accounts) apply to the loan evidenced by the Loan Documents and/or secured
hereby.

     Section 17.7 Maturity Date. The Maturity date of the Note secured hereby is
December 9, 2004, as such Maturity Date may be extended pursuant to the terms of
the Loan Documents.

     Section 17.8 Notice of Indemnification. BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS
SECURITY INSTRUMENT PROVIDES FOR INDEMNIFICATION OF LENDER AND TRUSTEE BY
BORROWER. IT IS SPECIFICALLY INTENDED BY BORROWER, LENDER, AND TRUSTEE THAT ALL
INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BY BORROWER HEREUNDER BE WITHOUT
LIMIT AND WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES THEREOF (INCLUDING PREEXISTING
CONDITIONS), STRICT LIABILITY, OR THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PARTY OR PARTIES
(INCLUDING LENDER AND TRUSTEE) WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR
CONCURRENT, OR PASSIVE. THE PARTIES SPECIFICALLY INTEND THAT LENDER AND TRUSTEE
ARE TO BE INDEMNIFIED AGAINST THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE.

     Section 17.9 THE BORROWER HEREBY DECLARES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE
BORROWER HAS RECEIVED, WITHOUT CHARGE, A TRUE COPY OF THIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT.
