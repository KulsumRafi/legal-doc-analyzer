<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACTIVISION,&nbsp;INC., a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Company"), hereby establishes and adopts the following 2002 Studio
Employee Retention Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>RECITALS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company desires to encourage high levels of performance by those employees and contractors working for the Company's studios who are key to the
success of the Company and to encourage such employees and contractors working for the Company's studios to remain as employees of the Company and its subsidiaries by increasing their proprietary
interest in the Company's growth and success. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
to attain these ends, the Company has formulated the Plan embodied herein to authorize the granting of incentive awards through grants of share options ("Options") or grants of
Restricted Share Awards (hereafter defined) made under the Plan to those persons (each such person, a "Participant") whose judgment, initiative and efforts are or have been or will be responsible for
the success of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, the Company hereby constitutes, establishes and adopts the following Plan and agrees to the following provisions: </FONT></P>

subsidiaries in retaining selected key employees and contractors working for the Company's studios whose judgment, initiative and efforts are responsible for the success of the Company and its
subsidiaries and to help the Company and its subsidiaries secure and retain the services of such individuals. Options granted under the Plan will be nonqualified share options." For purposes of the
Plan, the term "subsidiary" shall mean "subsidiary corporation," as such term is defined in Section&nbsp;424(f) of the Code, and "affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in
Rule&nbsp;12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). For purposes of the Plan, the term "Award" shall mean a grant of an Option or a grant of a
Restricted Share Award made under the terms of the Plan. </FONT></P>

Option shall be exercised by the Holder (or by her executors, administrators, guardian or legal representative) as to all or part of the Shares, by the giving of written notice of
exercise to the Company, specifying the number of Shares to be purchased, accompanied by payment of the full purchase price for the Shares being purchased. Full payment of such purchase price shall be
made at the time of exercise and shall be made (i)&nbsp;in cash or by certified check or bank check or wire transfer of immediately available funds, (ii)&nbsp;with the consent of the Company, by
tendering previously acquired Shares (valued at its Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan), as determined by the Company as of the date of tender), or (iii)&nbsp;with the consent of the Company,
a combination of (i)&nbsp;and (ii). Such notice of exercise, accompanied by such payment, shall be delivered to the Company at its principal business office or such other office as the Company may
from time to time direct, and shall be in such form, containing such further provisions as the Company may from time to time prescribe. In no event may this Option be exercised for a fraction of a
Share. The Company shall effect the transfer of Shares purchased pursuant to an Option as soon as practicable, and, within a reasonable time thereafter, such transfer shall be evidenced on the books
of the Company. No person exercising this Option shall have any of the rights of a holder of Shares subject to this Option until certificates for such Shares shall
have been issued following the exercise of such Option. No adjustment shall be made for cash dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date of such issuance. </FONT></P>
