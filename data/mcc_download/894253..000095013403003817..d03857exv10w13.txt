                       NONSTATUTORY STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

1.   General.

     (a) The terms and conditions set forth below, together with a certificate
         issued by the Company ("Option Certificate") setting forth the name of
         the person (the "Awardee") to whom the Company has granted an option to
         purchase a number of Shares (the "Option"), the number of Shares that
         may be purchased (the "Option Shares"), the purchase price at which
         such Shares may be purchased (the "Exercise Price"), and the dates on
         which such option may be exercised, constitute this Nonstatutory Stock
         Option Agreement ("Award Agreement").

     (b) The terms and conditions of the Perot Systems Corporation 2001
         Long-Term Incentive Plan ("Plan"), except Sections 11, 12 and 13 of the
         Plan, are incorporated by reference into this Award Agreement and,
         unless provided otherwise in this Award Agreement, will apply to the
         Option. Capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement will have the
         meanings given such terms in the Plan, unless they are defined
         differently in this Award Agreement.

     (c) ENGLISH LANGUAGE. This Agreement has been written in English, which
         language will control in all respects. No translation of this Agreement
         into any other language will be of any force or effect in its
         interpretation or in a determination of the intent of either party.
         Each party waives, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
         any right it may have under the laws of any country or other
         jurisdiction to have this Agreement written in any other language.

2.   Grant, Vesting and Exercise of Option.

     (a) Awardee is granted an option to purchase from the Company the number of
         Shares specified as the "Option Shares" in the Option Certificate at
         the purchase price per Share specified as the "Exercise Price" in the
         Option Certificate. This Option is not intended to constitute an
         "incentive stock option" as that term is used in section 422 of the
         Code.

     (b) This Option will become exercisable, if at all, in one or more
         installments for a portion of the Option Shares ("Vested Shares") on
         the dates, or upon satisfaction of the conditions, specified as the
         "Vesting Schedule" in the Option Certificate, provided that no
         installment of this Option will become exercisable after any date, or
         upon satisfaction of any condition after any date, after the Awardee's
         Severance Date, except as provided in Section 10(b), (c), (d) or (e) of
         the Plan.

     (c) Awardee may exercise this Option to purchase all or any part of the
         Vested Shares at any time on or before the earlier of (i) the date
         specified as the "Expiration Date" in the Option Certificate, or (ii)
         the date on which the Awardee's Option terminates under Section 10(b),
         (c), (d) or (e) of the Plan.

     (d) To exercise this Option, Awardee (or any other person entitled to
         exercise this Option) must deliver to the Company in accordance with
         the procedures established by the Administrator from time to time (i) a
         written or electronic notice of exercise in the form established by the
         Administrator from time to time stating the number of Vested Shares to
         be purchased upon exercise of the Option, (ii) full payment for such
         Vested Shares (A) in cash, by check or wire transfer in U.S. Dollars,
         (B) in the form required by any cashless exercise program implemented
         by the Company in connection with the Plan, or (C) in such other form
         of consideration approved by the Administrator, and (iii) full payment
         for all applicable taxes required to be withheld by the Company or the
         Employer in connection with such exercise. The Option will be deemed to
         be exercised only upon receipt by the Company of all the items
         described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above and Awardee will bear
         all risks and all costs and expenses associated with any delay in
         delivering these items.

3.   Restrictions on Assignment. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
     and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal
     representatives, successors, and assigns. This Option may not be sold,
     assigned, given, exchanged, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred

     the written consent (executed in ink on paper) of the Administrator. This
     Option may be exercised only by (i) Awardee, (ii) the executor or
     administrator of Awardee's estate (or, if Awardee has designated a
     beneficiary in accordance with Section 17 of the Plan, such beneficiary)
     following his or her death, or (iii) the guardian of Awardee's property if
     one is appointed by reason of Awardee's Total Disability. The Company is
     not obligated to recognize any exercise of this Option, or any purported
     sale, assignment, gift, exchange, pledge, hypothecation or other transfer,
     in violation of this Section 3 and, unless it elects to do otherwise, may

     AWARDEE'S EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE.
     AWARDEE FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS OPTION, AND AWARDEE'S
     ABILITY TO PURCHASE SHARES, WILL TERMINATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF

         at any time change its address for notification purposes by giving the
         other written notice of the new address and the date upon which it will
         become effective.

     (b) If any legal proceeding is brought to enforce or interpret the terms of

         agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter and
         may be waived or modified only in writing.

7.   Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure. Awardee acknowledges that: (i) in the
     course and as a result of employment with the Company or the Employer,
     Awardee will obtain special training and knowledge and will come in contact
     with the Company's or the Employer's current and potential customers, which
     training, knowledge, and contacts would provide invaluable benefits to
     competitors of the Company and the Employer; (ii) the Company and the
     Employer are continuously developing or receiving Confidential Information,
     and that during Awardee's employment he or she will receive Confidential
     Information from the Company, the Employer, and their respective customers
     and suppliers and special training related to the Company's and the
     Employer's business methodologies; and (iii) Awardee's employment by the
     Employer creates a relationship of trust that extends to all Confidential
     Information that becomes known to Awardee. Accordingly, and in
     consideration of this Award, Awardee agrees that the Company and the
     Employer will be entitled to terminate all rights to exercise the Award and
     to exercise the rights specified in Section 8 below if Participant does any
     of the following without the prior written consent of the Company or the
     Employer:

     (a)  while employed by the Company or the Employer or within one year
          thereafter:

         (i)   competes with, or engages in any business that is competitive
               with, the Company or the Employer within 250 miles of any
               location at which Awardee was employed by or provided services to
               the Company or the Employer;

         (ii)  solicits or performs services, as an employee, independent
               contractor, or otherwise, for any person (including any Affiliate
               or Subsidiary of that person) that is or was a customer or
               prospect of the Company or the Employer during the two years
               before Awardee's Severance Date if Awardee solicited business
               from or performed services for that customer or prospect while
               employed by the Company or the Employer; or

         (iii) recruits, hires, or helps anyone to recruit or hire anyone who
               was an employee of the Company or any Affiliate or Subsidiary of
               the Company, or of any of their customers for whom Awardee
               performed services or from whom Awardee solicited business,
               within the six months before Participant's Severance Date; or

     (b) discloses or uses any Confidential Information, except in connection
         with the good faith performance of Awardee's duties as an employee or,
         solely with respect to the terms of this Agreement or the Plan, to
         Awardee's spouse or legal or financial advisors; or fails to take
         reasonable precautions against the unauthorized disclosure or use of
         Confidential Information; or solicits or induces the unauthorized
         disclosure or use of Confidential Information.

     If any court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Section
     7 to be unreasonable, then that provision shall be considered to be amended
     to provide the broadest scope of protection to the Company that such court
     would find reasonable and enforceable. For purposes of this Section 7, the
     term "Confidential Information" means all written, machine reproducible,
     oral and visual data, information and material, including but not limited
     to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan, business, financial and
     technical information, computer programs, documents and records (including
     those that Awardee develops in the scope of his or her employment) that (i)
     the Company, its Affiliates and Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
     customers or suppliers treats as proprietary or confidential through
     markings or otherwise, (ii) relates to the Company, its Affiliates and
     Subsidiaries, or any of their respective customers or suppliers or

     any of their business activities, products or services (including software
     programs and techniques) and is competitively sensitive or not generally
     known in the relevant trade or industry, or (iii) derives independent
     economic value from not being generally known to, and is not readily
     ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic
     value from its disclosure or use. Confidential Information does not include
     any information or material that is approved by the Company or its
     Affiliates or Subsidiaries for unrestricted public disclosure.

8.   Right to Buy Back Purchased Stock and to Require Payback of Certain
     Profits.

     (a) If the Administrator (i) discovers that Awardee has engaged in any
         conduct prohibited by Section 7 or (ii) determines, in its sole
         discretion, that Awardee's employment by the Company or any of its
         Affiliates or Subsidiaries terminated or, if the relevant facts been
         known at the time, would have been terminated for Substantial
         Misconduct, then the Company will have the right for 150 days after the
         Administer discovers the relevant facts (A) to cancel any unexercised
         Award, whether or not exercisable or vested, (B) to buy from Awardee,
         at a purchase price equal to the Exercise Price, any Shares acquired by
         exercising this Option that became exercisable on or after the date two
         years before the date the Administrator discovered the relevant facts,
         and (C) to require Awardee to pay to the Company the Net Investment
         Proceeds with respect to any Shares that have been sold or otherwise
         transferred by Participant that the Company has the right to buy
         pursuant to clause (B) above. For purposes of this Section 8,
         "Substantial Misconduct" means termination of employment for conduct
         resulting in a felony conviction of Awardee; actions involving moral
         turpitude, theft, or dishonesty in a material matter; breach of any
         obligation under Section 7 of this Agreement; or failure by Awardee to
         carry out the directions, instructions, policies, rules, regulations,
         or decisions of the Company's or the Employer's Board of Directors
         including, without limitation, those relating to business ethics and
         the ethical conduct of the business of the Company and its Affiliates
         and Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Section 8, "Net Investment
         Proceeds," with respect to any Share sold or otherwise transferred by
         Awardee or Awardee's successor in interest, means the greater of the
         value of the gross proceeds received for such share or the Fair Market
         Value of such Share on the date of sale or transfer less, in either
         case, (i) the exercise price of this Option for such Share plus simple
         interest on such amount at the rate of 8% per annum to the date of the
         sale or transfer, (ii) any reasonable and customary commission paid for
         the sale or transfer, and (iii) the verified amount of any income taxes
         paid or payable on the sale or transfer.

     (b) The Company may exercise its right by notifying Awardee of its election
         to exercise its right within such 150-day period. Awardee shall tender
         to the Company, within 10 days, the applicable Shares together with a
         duly executed stock power attached in proper form for transfer and/or a
         cashiers or certified check in the amount of the Net Investment
         Proceeds. If any such Shares or Net Investment Proceeds are not
         tendered within 10 days, the Company may cancel any outstanding
         certificate representing such Shares. The Company shall tender the
         purchase price for tendered Shares within five business days after the
         Shares are tendered to the Company or the Company cancels the
         applicable certificate, whichever occurs first.
