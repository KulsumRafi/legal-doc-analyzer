Shares already owned by the Participant based in any such instance on the fair market value of the unrestricted Shares on the date the Option is exercised; provided, however, that, in the case of an Incentive Option, the right to make a payment in
the form of already owned Shares may be authorized only at the time the Option is granted; (ii) by delivering a properly executed exercise notice to the Corporation, together with a copy of irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to
the Corporation the amount of sale or loan proceeds to pay the purchase price; (iii) by a combination thereof, in each case in the manner provided in the Option agreement; or (iv) by any other means acceptable to the Corporation.&#160; To facilitate
the foregoing, the Corporation may enter into agreements for coordinated procedures with one or more brokerage firms.&#160; To the extent the Option exercise price may be paid in Shares as provided above, Shares delivered by the Participant may be
(i) Shares which were received by the Participant upon exercise of one or more Incentive Options, but only if such Shares have been held by the Participant for at least the greater of (a) two years from the date the Incentive Options were granted or
(b) one year after the transfer of Shares to the Participant, or (ii) Shares which were received by the Participant upon exercise of one or more Non-qualified Options, but only if such Shares have been held by the Participant for at least six

Corporation, at the time of exercise of a Nonqualified Option, such amount as the Committee deems necessary to satisfy the Corporation&#146;s obligation to withhold federal or state income or other taxes incurred by reason of the exercise or the
transfer of Shares thereupon.&#160; A Participant may satisfy such withholding requirements by having the Corporation withhold from the number of Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of the Option that number of shares having an aggregate fair
market value on the date of exercise equal to the minimum amount required by law to be withheld; provided, however, that in the case of an exercise by a Participant subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the Participant must (i) exercise the
Option during the period beginning on the third business day following the date of release to the press of the quarterly or annual summary of earnings for the Corporation, and ending on the twelfth business day following such date, or (ii)
irrevocably elect to utilize Share withholding at least six months prior to the date of exercise.</font></p> <p align=center> <font size=2 face="Times New Roman">5</font></p>
