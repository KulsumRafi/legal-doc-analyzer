<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cimarex Energy Co., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), established the Cimarex Energy Co. Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), effective as of
October&nbsp;1, 2002. The Company has amended and restated the Plan and renamed the Plan the Cimarex Energy Co. Supplemental Savings Plan, effective as of March&nbsp;3, 2003. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of February&nbsp;23, 2002 (the "Merger Agreement") among Helmerich&nbsp;&amp; Payne,&nbsp;Inc. ("H&amp;P"),
Helmerich&nbsp;&amp; Payne Exploration and Production Co., Mountain Acquisition Co., and Key Production Company,&nbsp;Inc. ("Key"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the parties agreed that the
Company would assume the Key Deferred Compensation Plan and extend participation in the Plan to certain identified executives of H&amp;P. This Plan is intended to assume the Key Deferred Compensation
Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan is intended to provide a mechanism whereby certain of the highly compensated and select management employees of the Company may defer compensation and have such amounts,
together with deemed earnings, paid out upon the participant's retirement, death, disability or other termination of service with the Company. In addition, the Company intends that this Plan shall
provide the eligible employees with deferred compensation benefits in addition to the benefits under the Cimarex Energy Co. 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") in cases where benefits under the 401(k)
Plan may be limited by applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The Company intends that the Plan shall be an "unfunded" plan for purposes of the Code and
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time each Participant makes his initial election under the Plan in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.2, the Participant shall elect one or Measurement Funds
that shall be used to determine the additional amounts, if any, to be credited to his Plan Account for the first calendar quarter or portion thereof in which he participates in the Plan and continuing
thereafter, unless changed as provided in the next sentence. All allocations among Measurement Funds shall be made in increments of at least one percent (1%). Commencing with the first calendar
quarter that follows the Participant's commencement of participation in the Plan, no later than the fifth (5th) business day preceding the last business day of the calendar quarter, the Participant
may elect, by submitting an Election Form to the Committee that is actually received and accepted by the Committee, to add or delete one or more Measurement Funds, to change the allocation of his Plan
Account among Measurement Funds, or both. Elections made according to the previous sentence shall become effective on the next business day following the Committee's actual receipt and acceptance of
the Election Form and shall continue in effect until the Participant makes a subsequent election in accordance with the preceding sentence. The Committee may permit Participants to change their
elections more frequently. The Committee may adopt additional rules and procedures for making changes that it deems, in its sole discretion, to be necessary or appropriate. If a Participant fails to
elect at least one Measurement Fund, amounts, if any, to be credited to his Plan Account shall be determined by the Measurement Fund designated by the Committee as the default Measurement Fund.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed to require the Committee to make Measurement Funds available to Participants, and in lieu thereof the manner in which
additional amounts may be credited or debited from Plan Accounts may be determined by the Company or the Trustee. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee will determine the performance (positive or negative) of each Measurement Fund in its reasonable discretion, based on the actual perfomance of each
Measurement Fund. Each Plan Account will be credited or debited on a daily basis based on the performance of the Measurement Fund or Funds selected by the Participant, as determined by the Committee
in its sole discretion, as though (a)&nbsp;the Plan Account were invested in the Measurement Fund or Funds, in the percentages applicable to that date, as of the close of business on that day at the
closing price on such day, (b)&nbsp;the Participant Deferral was invested in the Measurement Fund or Funds selected by the Participant, in the percentages applicable to the day, on the day the
amounts are withheld from the Participant's Compensation at the closing price on such date, and (c)&nbsp;any distribution made to a Participant that decreases the Plan Account ceased being invested
in the Measurement Fund or Funds, in the applicable percentages, on the business day prior to the distribution at the closing price on such date. The Company Matching Contribution, if any, for a Plan
Year shall be credited to Plan Accounts as of

the Trustee chooses to invest any funds in any one or more of the Measurement Funds, no Participant shall have any right in or to such investments. Each Participant's Plan Account shall be a

manner in which the Plan Account shall be paid once each Plan Year at the same time the Particpant makes deferral elections for the following Plan Year; a changed election shall not be effective until
