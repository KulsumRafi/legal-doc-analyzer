                          LOAN AND SERVICING AGREEMENT

                          Dated as of December 18, 2002


         THIS IS A LOAN AND SERVICING AGREEMENT, among ACE FUNDING LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (the "Borrower"), ACE CASH EXPRESS, INC., a
Texas corporation, individually ("ACE") and as Check-Casher (in such capacity,
the "Check-Casher"), AUTOBAHN FUNDING COMPANY LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the "Lender"), DZ BANK AG DEUTSCHE ZENTRAL-GENOSSENSCHAFTSBANK
FRANKFURT AM MAIN ("DZ Bank"), as administrative agent for Lender (in such
capacity, the "Administrative Agent") and as liquidity agent for Liquidity
Providers (in such capacity, the "Liquidity Agent"), and U.S. BANK NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION, as collateral agent for the Secured Parties (in such capacity, the
"Collateral Agent"). Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used in this
Agreement are defined in Appendix A.

                                   Background

         1. Borrower intends to borrow Loans from the Lender and has requested
Lender and Lender has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions contained in
this Agreement, to make such Loans to Borrower from time to time during the term
of this Agreement. The Loans will be secured by a security interest in all of
the assets of Borrower.

         2. The Check-Casher has agreed to undertake certain obligations in
connection with the cashing of tax refund loan checks as set forth herein and
the Borrower has agreed to provide cash inventory to the Check-Casher in
exchange for the Cash Inventory Provision Fee.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                      LOANS

         SECTION 1.01 Commitments to Lend; Limits on Lender's Obligations. Upon
the terms and subject to Article V and the other conditions of this Agreement,
from time to time during each Usage Period and prior to the Termination Date,
the Borrower may request that Lender make loans to the Borrower on a revolving
basis secured by a Lien on all of the assets of Borrower (each, a "Loan") and
Lender shall make such Loans; provided that no Loan shall be made by Lender if,
after giving effect thereto, the sum of (1) the outstanding Face Amount of all
Commercial Paper Notes issued by Lender with respect to the Transaction
Documents less the aggregate amount of all interest or discount accrued on or
scheduled to accrue on such Commercial Paper Notes and (2) the aggregate
principal amount of all Loans funded other than through the issuance of
Commercial Paper Notes (such sum, the "Facility Amount") would exceed an amount
equal to the lesser of (a) $190,000,000, as such amount may be increased from
time to time with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall
be in the Administrative Agent's sole and absolute discretion) following the
written request of the



<PAGE>

Borrower and payment by the Borrower of the Increase Fee (the "Maximum Facility
Amount") and (b) the product of the Maximum Advance Percentage and the Net
Balance (the "Capital Limit").

         SECTION 1.02 Borrowing Procedures.

                  (a) Notice of Borrowing. Each Borrowing by Borrower shall be
         made on a Business Day on notice in writing from Borrower to the
         Administrative Agent (with a copy to the Collateral Agent) received by
         the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time)
         on the Business Day preceding the date of such proposed Borrowing. Each
         such notice of a proposed Borrowing shall be substantially in the form
         of Exhibit 1.02 (each, a "Borrowing Notice") and shall specify the
         amount of such Borrowing and the date on which such Borrowing is to be
         made. Each Borrowing made pursuant to this Section 1.02 shall have an
         initial principal amount of at least $1,000,000 and shall be in
         integral multiples of $1,000, unless otherwise approved by the
         Administrative Agent. Any Borrowing Request given by Borrower pursuant
         to this Section 1.02 shall be irrevocable and binding on Borrower.

                  (b) Funding of Borrowing. On each Borrowing Date, upon
         satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Article V,
         Lender shall deposit in same day funds by wire transfer to the Trust
         Collection Account an amount equal to the requested Borrowing. After
         acknowledgement of receipt by the Borrower of such funds, the
         Collateral Agent will transfer such funds into one or more Vault
         Collection Accounts specified by the Check-Casher by written
         instructions (with a copy to the Lender).

                  (c) Interest Periods. In the Borrowing Notice and prior to the
         end of each existing Interest Period for a Loan, the Borrower may
         request an Interest Period for the applicable Loan of up to 30 days
         subject to the Administrative Agent's approval; provided, however, that
         following a Termination Event, Event of Default, Check-Casher Event of
         Default or Termination Date, the Administrative Agent shall select the
         Interest Periods in its sole discretion.

         SECTION 1.03 Security Interest. The Borrower hereby grants to the
Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a first priority
continuing lien and security interest in all of the assets of the Borrower
(including, without limitation, all of the Assets, all of the Borrower's cash
and currency, accounts, chattel paper, instruments, general intangibles, deposit
accounts, inventory, investment property, equipment, rights under Sections 1.04
hereof and all other personal property of Borrower), whether now owned or
hereafter acquired, wherever located, and including proceeds of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Pledged Collateral"). For the avoidance of doubt, the above
grant shall include all amounts due and payable by any Person (including,
without limitation, Approved Vault Banks, Approved Banks and Approved Couriers)
to the Borrower. Such liens and security interests shall secure all of
Borrower's obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, the payments of
principal of, and interest on, the Note (and the Loans evidenced thereby) and
all Indemnified Amounts.

         SECTION 1.04 Use of Proceeds; Provision of Cash. The Borrower covenants
and agrees to use all proceeds of the Loans solely to provide Cash to the SSMs
for use by the Check-


                                       2
<PAGE>

Casher in cashing Checks in the SSMs. The Check-Casher hereby covenants and
agrees that the Borrower shall be the sole and exclusive source of cash for the
SSMs, and until the Final Payout Date hereunder it will not permit cash from any
other cash provider to be placed in the SSMs. No self-service check machine
included as an SSM hereunder during any Usage Period shall be removed as an SSM
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent. Prior
to the initial Usage Period, Borrower will provide Administrative Agent a
Schedule of the SSMs for such Usage Period to be attached hereto as Schedule II
consisting of not less than 145 SSMs, indicating the locations thereof. Such
locations shall be deemed acceptable unless Administrative Agent objects to any
specific location within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of the proposed
Schedule of SSMs. SSMs will not be relocated during a Usage Period. If for any
reason Borrower cannot satisfy all the requirements of this Agreement as to a
particular SSM, Borrower shall have the right to seek an alternative source of
Cash for such SSM, provided the total number of SSM's subject hereto shall not
be less than 145 during such Usage Period. Prior to the commencement of any
subsequent Usage Period, Borrower will provide Administrative Agent a Schedule
of the SSMs for such Usage Period to be attached as a replacement Schedule II,
consisting of not less than 145 SSMs, indicating the locations thereof, with any
change in such Schedule from the prior Usage Period subject to approval by the
Administrative Agent. The Borrower covenants and agrees at all times to ensure
that Schedule III contains a complete and accurate listing of the Excluded SSMs
which will not be funded by the Borrower with Cash (any update to which shall be
delivered to the Administrative Agent). ACE is expressly authorized to seek
alternative sources of cash for the Excluded SSMs. The Check-Casher hereby
appoints the Borrower as its cash provider for all SSMs, and the Borrower hereby
accepts such appointment. At no time shall any funds from other cash providers
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include funds received in respect
of Checks) be placed in any SSM or the Trust Collection Account, any Vault
Collection Account, any account created pursuant to Section 3.01 or any other
account created in connection with this Agreement; provided, however, that for
so long as the Electronic Presentment Agreement is in effect, funds representing
checks cashed at the 10 Excluded SSMs funded by Texas Capital Bank, National
Association's vault cash (the "Texas Capital Funds") and subject to the
Electronic Presentment Agreement shall be permitted to be deposited into the
Trust Collection Account for a period not to exceed one Business Day from
deposit therein. The Collateral Agent shall wire to the account specified by
Texas Capital Bank, National Association on each Business Day the amount
specified by the Check-Casher as Texas Capital Funds in a notice to the
Collateral Agent (with a copy to the Administrative Agent). The Collateral Agent
will cease transferring such funds to Texas Capital Bank, National Association
upon receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent to such effect and, after
receipt of such notice, shall only so transfer funds upon the instruction of the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall deliver a copy of any
notice of the type described in the preceding sentence to the Check-Casher
simultaneously with its delivery to the Collateral Agent. As compensation to the
Borrower for the provision of cash inventory hereunder, the Check-Casher shall
pay to the Borrower the Cash Inventory Provision Fee as provided herein.

         The Check-Casher hereby acknowledges and agrees that all right, title
and interest in and to any and all Cash provided by the Borrower for use in the
SSMs and all Checks are and shall remain the sole and separate property of the
Borrower and under no circumstances the property of the Check-Casher. The
Check-Casher expressly acknowledges (i) that the Cash supplied to the SSMs is
not, and is not intended to be, a loan from the Borrower to the Check-Casher and
(ii)


                                       3
<PAGE>

all Checks cashed by the Check-Casher shall remain the sole and separate
property of the Borrower. The Check-Casher shall acquire no right, title or
interest in any Cash, Checks or the proceeds thereof wherever located,
including, without limitation, Checks or Cash (whether in the form of currency
or otherwise) in the possession of an Approved Courier, any other agent or
subcontractor of the Check-Casher or at an SSM, in the Vault Collection Account,

Transaction Document.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                      NOTE

         SECTION 2.01 Note. The Loans shall be evidenced by a promissory note
(as from time to time supplemented, extended, amended or replaced, the "Note"),
substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit 2.01, with appropriate
insertions, dated the date hereof, payable to the order of the Lender in the
initial maximum principal amount of $190,000,000 on the Maturity Date. The
entire Facility Amount shall be due and payable on each Usage Period Maturity
Date. If the Maximum Facility Amount is increased pursuant to Section 1.01, the
Note shall be replaced by a promissory note, substantially in the form of the
existing Note, with appropriate changes to reflect an increased maximum
principal amount to reflect the increased Maximum Facility Amount. Upon receipt
of a replacement Note satisfactory to Lender, Lender shall cause the existing
Note to be returned to the Borrower. Principal of, and interest on, the Loans
shall be paid from time to time as set forth in Section 3.03. The Borrower shall
have the right to prepay all or any portion of the Loans in full at any time,
provided that the Borrower (i) notifies the Administrative Agent of such
intention to prepay the Loans in a notice delivered at least 5 Business Days
prior to the proposed date of repayment and (ii) otherwise complies with the
requirements of this Section 2.01. Any such prepayment under this Section 2.01
shall be accompanied by all accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans and all
other amounts then due hereunder (including all amounts due and payable under
Section 4.02). Upon any prepayment in full of the Loan in conjunction with the
termination of this Agreement prior to the Maturity Date, the Check-Casher
agrees to pay the Lender a prepayment fee (the "Prepayment Fee") in accordance
with the terms of the Fee Letter, provided that no Prepayment Fee shall be
payable in the event of an optional redemption pursuant to Section 2.06. The
Administrative Agent shall record in its records, or at its option on the
schedule attached to the Note, the date and amount of each Loan made hereunder,
the interest rate with respect thereto (as determined under Section 2.02), each
repayment thereof, and the other information provided for thereon. The aggregate
unpaid principal amount so recorded shall be rebuttable presumptive evidence of
the principal amount owing and unpaid on the Note. The failure so to record any
such information or any error in so recording any such information shall not,
however, limit or otherwise affect the actual obligations of the Borrower
hereunder or under the Note to repay the principal amount of all Loans, together
with all interest accruing thereon, as set forth in this Agreement.

         SECTION 2.02 Interest on Loans. Each Loan shall accrue interest during
each Interest Period at a rate equal to the Interest Rate, as in effect for such
Interest Period for such Loan, which interest shall be payable as set forth in
Section 3.03.

         SECTION 2.03 General Procedures. No outstanding principal balance of
the Loans shall be considered reduced by any allocation, set-aside or
distribution of any portion of




                                       4
<PAGE>

Collections or any other payment unless such Collections or other payment shall
have been actually delivered to the applicable Secured Party pursuant hereto. No
principal or interest or other amounts hereunder shall be considered paid by any
distribution of any portion of Collections or any other payment if at any time
such distribution or payment is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any
reason. No provision of this Agreement shall require the payment or permit the
collection of interest in excess of the maximum permitted by Applicable Law.

         SECTION 2.04 Commitment Fee. In consideration of the Lender's
Commitment under this Agreement, the Borrower will pay an Annual Commitment Fee
to the Agent for the benefit of the Lender annually on the first day of each
Usage Period pursuant to the Fee Letter.

         SECTION 2.05 Transfer and Exchange of Notes. At the option of the
holder of a Note in connection with any permitted transfer or assignment of such
Note, Notes may be exchanged for other Notes in authorized denominations of a
like aggregate principal amount upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged to
the Borrower. Upon surrender for the transfer or exchange of any Note, the
Borrower shall deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees,
one or more new Notes in authorized denominations of a like aggregate principal
amount dated the date of issuance thereof. Every Note presented or surrendered
for registration of transfer or exchange shall be accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer duly executed by the holder of such Note or his attorney
duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration
of transfer or exchange of Notes.

         SECTION 2.06 Optional Redemption. On any Business Day after April 15th
during any Usage Period, the Borrower shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to repay the Facility Amount in whole, but not in part, on the
Optional Redemption Date, provided that immediately prior to such repayment the
Net Balance is less than 10% of the greatest Net Balance during such Usage
Period and in connection with such repayment the Borrower pays in full all other
obligations under the Transaction Documents due and payable or accrued through
such date (including any amounts described in Section 4.02). Following an
Optional Redemption Date, the Borrower will no longer be able to request
additional Borrowings during such Usage Period and the Lender's commitment to
make Loans shall be suspended until the commencement of the next following Usage
Period, if any.

                                   ARTICLE III

                                   SETTLEMENTS

         SECTION 3.01 Accounts; Investments.

                  (a) Accounts.

                  On or before the first Borrowing Date, the Borrower shall
establish the following accounts:

                  (i) the Trust Collection Account; and

                  (ii) the Reserve Account.



                                       5
<PAGE>

                  On or before the first Borrowing Date, there shall be
         established, in the name of the Collateral Agent or in the name of the
         Borrower, for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, a deposit account
         subject, in the case of any account in the name of the Borrower, to an
         Approved Vault Bank Agreement (each, a "Vault Collection Account") at
         each Approved Vault Bank (i) into which the Approved Vault Bank shall
         accept transfers of the proceeds of Loans and from which the applicable
         Approved Vault Bank shall distribute funds to the Trust Collection
         Account in accordance with instructions received by such Approved Vault
         Bank from the Collateral Agent (pursuant to instructions received from
         the Borrower (or its authorized agents, including the Check-Casher)) in
         accordance with the terms of the Transaction Documents and the
         applicable Approved Vault Bank Agreement, and (ii) into which the
         applicable Approved Vault Bank shall accept transfers of funds in
         respect of Collections and from which the applicable Approved Vault
         Bank shall distribute funds to an Approved Courier for delivery to
         specified SSMs in accordance with instructions received by such
         Approved Vault Bank from the Borrower (or its authorized agents,
         including the Check-Casher) in accordance with the terms of the
         Transaction Documents and the applicable Approved Vault Bank Agreement,
         until such time as the Collateral Agent instructs such Approved Vault
         Bank to cease such distribution of funds and to distribute funds then
         on deposit in the applicable Vault Collection Account only in
         accordance with further instructions from the Collateral Agent. The
         initial Vault Collection Accounts shall be as set forth on Schedule I.
         The parties hereto hereby authorize and direct the Collateral Agent to
         establish in the name of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured
         Parties the Vault Collection Accounts listed on Schedule I and to
         execute and deliver the account agreements and all ancillary documents
         relating to such Vault Collection Accounts, in each case in the form
         prepared by the Check-Casher and approved by the Administrative Agent.
         For so long as the Electronic Presentment Agreement is in effect,
         Collections in respect of the Checks shall be deposited directly into
         the Trust Collection Account. If a Vault Collection Account is not
         subject to an Approved Vault Bank Agreement, it shall be subject to an
         account agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative
         Agent. Until such time as such an account agreement is entered into
         with respect to any Vault Collection Account, notwithstanding any
         provision of this agreement to the contrary, all transfers and
         distributions of funds with respect any such account shall be made only
         in accordance with instructions from the Collateral Agent.

Prior to adding any additional Vault Collection Accounts, Borrower shall provide
an opinion of counsel with respect to perfection issues substantially in the
form of the opinion issued pursuant to Section 5.01(f) prior to the initial
Borrowing and otherwise acceptable to the Administrative Agent. Borrower shall
provide the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent with an updated
Schedule I prior to adding any additional Vault Collection Accounts.

         All such amounts in the Vault Collection Accounts, the Trust Collection
Account, and the Reserve Account shall be held by each Approved Vault Bank and
the Collateral Agent (in the case of the Trust Collection Account and the
Reserve Account), as the case may be, in such accounts as part of the Assets as
herein provided, subject to withdrawal by, or at the direction of, the
Collateral Agent, Borrower or Check-Casher, in accordance with, and for the
purposes specified in the provisions of, this Agreement. The Vault Collection
Accounts, the Trust



                                       6
<PAGE>

Collection Account, and the Reserve Account are referred to collectively herein
as the "Transaction Accounts".

                  (b) Investments. All or a portion of the amounts in the Trust
         Collection Account and the Reserve Account (together, the "Trust
         Accounts") shall be invested and reinvested by the Collateral Agent (as
         directed by the Borrower or the Check-Casher on its behalf as its
         authorized agent) in one or more Eligible Investments.

                  (c) Maturity of Investments. No investment of any amount held
         in the Trust Accounts shall mature later than the earlier of (i) the
         Business Day immediately preceding the Settlement Date which is
         scheduled to occur immediately following the date of investment and
         (ii) one week from the date of investment.

                  (d) Form of Investment. Any investment of any funds in the
         Trust Accounts shall be made under the following terms and conditions:

                           (i) each such investment shall be made in the name of
                  the Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such) or in the name
                  of a nominee of the Collateral Agent, and

                           (ii) any certificate or other instrument evidencing
                  such investment shall be delivered directly to the Collateral
                  Agent and endorsed in the name of the Collateral Agent and the
                  Collateral Agent shall have sole possession of such
                  instrument.

                  (e) Collateral Agent Not Liable The Collateral Agent shall not
         in any way be held liable by reason of any insufficiency in the Trust
         Accounts resulting from losses on investments made in accordance with
         the provisions of this Section 3.01 (but the Collateral Agent shall at
         all times remain liable for its own debt obligations, if any,
         constituting part of such investments). The Collateral Agent shall not
         be liable for any investment made by it in accordance with this Section
         3.01 on the grounds that it could have made a more favorable
         investment.

                  (f) Reserve Account. If on any applicable Business Day amounts
         are not available in the Trust Collection Account (A) to make all
         distributions set forth in Section 3.03(c)(i) through (iii) or (B) to
         make all distributions set forth in Section 3.03(d)(i) through (viii),
         as applicable, the Collateral Agent shall withdraw funds from the
         Reserve Account and deposit into the Trust Collection Account the
         lesser of (i) such shortfall and (ii) the amounts on deposit in the
         Reserve Account. If after making all distributions set forth in Section
         3.03(c) and (d) on a Business Day the amount on deposit in the Reserve
         Account exceeds the Required Reserve Level, any such excess shall be
         released by the Collateral Agent to the Borrower.

                  (g) Funding Cessation after Licensing Inquiry. Upon receipt of
         a Licensing Inquiry, if, in the reasonable judgment of the
         Administrative Agent it would be inadvisable for the Borrower to
         continue to provide Cash for SSMs in the jurisdiction whose
         Governmental Authority generated the Licensing Inquiry without the
         Borrower and/or the Check-Casher first (i) complying with that
         jurisdiction's Applicable Law



                                       7
<PAGE>

         regarding licensing or (ii) delivering an opinion of counsel acceptable
         to the Administrative Agent confirming that compliance with such
         Applicable Law is not required based on the activities of the Borrower
         and the Check-Casher contemplated by the Transaction Documents, then
         upon written notice from the Administrative Agent (x) ACE will
         immediately cease providing the instructions to either (I) the
         Collateral Agent or (II) the applicable Approved Vault Bank, in each
         case as contemplated by Section 8.01(f) to transfer funds to any Vault
         Collection Account in such jurisdiction and (y) the Collateral Agent,
         ACE and/or the Borrower, as may be required by the applicable account
         agreement, will immediately cease making any transfers of funds to any
         Vault Collection Account in such jurisdiction and ACE, the Collateral
         Agent and/or the Borrower, as may be required by the applicable account
         agreement, will instruct any applicable Approved Vault Bank to cease
         any distribution of funds and to distribute funds then on deposit in
         any applicable Vault Collection Account only in accordance with further
         instructions from the Collateral Agent.

         SECTION 3.02 Collection of Moneys. If at any time Borrower or the
Check-Casher shall receive any payment on or in respect of any Asset, it shall
hold such payment in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the other
Secured Parties, shall segregate such payment from the other property of
Borrower or the Check-Casher, as the case may be, and shall, within one Business
Day of receipt, deliver such payment in the form received to the Collateral
Agent for deposit into the Trust Collection Account.

         SECTION 3.03 Settlement.

                  (a) Deposit of Collections. Each of the Check-Casher and the
         Borrower covenants and agrees to cause all Collections to be deposited
         directly into either the applicable Vault Collection Account or the
         Trust Collection Account on each Business Day.

                  (b) Transfer of Collections. The Borrower (or its authorized
         agents, including the Check-Casher) shall instruct the Collateral Agent
         to transfer all Collections from the relevant Vault Collection Accounts
         into the Trust Collection Account to the extent necessary to make the
         distributions set forth in Sections 3.03(d), (e) and (f). The
         Collateral Agent shall make such transfers in accordance with
         instructions from the Borrower or its authorized agents.

                  (c) Daily Settlement Procedures. On each Business Day during
         the Usage Period that is not a Settlement Date or the Usage Period
         Maturity Date, amounts on deposit in the Trust Collection Account
         (including transfers from the Reserve Account pursuant to Section
         3.01(f)) will be applied by the Collateral Agent at the written
         direction of the Check-Casher (or, absent such direction, at the
         direction of the Collateral Agent) in the following order of priority:

                           (i) To the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of

                  Loan;

                  Collection Account an amount equal to the Accrued Facility
                  Costs (net of amounts paid in clause (i) above) for transfer
                  at the further direction of the Administrative Agent (whether

                           (iii) To set aside in the Trust Collection Account or
                  repay any Loans for which such Business Day is the last day of
                  the applicable Interest Period for such Loans in an amount
                  necessary, if any, to maintain the Advance Percentage equal to

                  entity deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be an Affiliate)
                  of any Affected Party (to the extent such Affiliate is
                  providing funding, liquidity or credit enhancement for the

         Affected Party with respect to any of the foregoing, or (ii) the

         Administrative Agent or Liquidity Agent for continuing its or
         Borrower's relationship with Lender,

                  (y) to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by
         an Affected Party under this Agreement or under the Liquidity Agreement
         with respect thereto, or

                  (z) in the good faith determination of such Affected Party, to
         reduce the rate of return on the capital of an Affected Party as a
         consequence of its obligations hereunder or arising in connection
         herewith to a level below that which such Affected Party could
         otherwise have achieved,

then on the first Settlement Date after demand by such Affected Party (which
demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis of such
demand), Borrower shall pay directly to such Affected Party such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Affected Party for such additional or
increased cost or such reduced return.

                  (b) Each Affected Party will promptly notify Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge which will
         entitle such Affected Party to compensation pursuant to this Section
         4.01. Failure or delay in giving such notification shall not constitute
         a waiver of such Affected Party's right to such compensation.

                  (c) In determining any amount provided for or referred to in
         this Section 4.01, an Affected Party may use any reasonable averaging
         and attribution methods that it (in its sole discretion) shall deem
         applicable. Any Affected Party when making a claim under this Section
         4.01 shall submit to Borrower a statement as to such increased cost or
         reduced return (including calculation thereof in reasonable detail),
         which statement shall, in the absence of demonstrable error, be
         conclusive and binding upon Borrower.

                  (d) Upon receipt by an Affected Party of a refund or credit
         for any amounts paid by the Borrower under this Section 4.01, such
         Affected Party shall pay to Borrower an amount equal to the amount of
         such refund or credit plus any interest received by or credited to such
         Affected Party with respect to such refund or credit.

         SECTION 4.02 Funding Losses. In the event that any Affected Party shall
incur any loss or expense (including any loss or expense incurred by reason of
the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such
Affected Party to make or maintain any liquidity funding under the Liquidity
Agreement) as a result of (i) any payment being made on any day other than on
the last day of the applicable Interest Period, or (ii) any Borrowing not being
made in accordance with a request therefor under Section 1.02, then, upon
written notice from the Administrative Agent or the Liquidity Agent to Borrower
and Check-Casher, Borrower shall pay to the applicable Affected Party the amount
of such loss or expense. Such written notice (which shall include calculations
in reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and
binding upon Borrower.

         SECTION 4.03 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower or the
Check-Casher hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for
any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, net income
taxes that are imposed by the United States and franchise taxes and net




                                       13
<PAGE>

income taxes that are imposed by the state or foreign jurisdiction under the
laws of which the payee is organized or conducts business or any political
subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes").
If the Borrower or the Check-Casher shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes
from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to the Lender or any Affected
Party, (i) the Borrower or the Check-Casher, as the case may be, shall make an
additional payment to the payee in an amount sufficient so that, after making
all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
payable under this section), the payee receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower or the
Check-Casher, as the case may be, shall make such deductions and (iii) the
Borrower or the Check-Casher, as the case may be, shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance
with Applicable Law.

                  (b) If the Lender or the applicable Affected Party is not
         created or organized under the laws of the United States or a political
         subdivision thereof, such Person shall, to the extent that it may then
         do so under Applicable Laws and regulations, deliver to the Borrower
         (with, in the case of any Affected Party, a copy to the Administrative
         Agent) (i) within thirty (30) days after the date hereof, or, if later,
         the date on which such Person becomes an Affected Party pursuant to
         this Agreement two (or such other number as may from time to time be
         prescribed by Applicable Laws or regulations) duly completed copies of
         IRS Form 4224 or Form 1001 (or any successor form or other certificate
         or statement which may be required from time to time by the relevant
         United States taxing authorities or Applicable Law or regulation), as
         appropriate, to permit the Borrower to make payments hereunder for the
         account of such Person, as the case may be, without deduction or
         withholding of income taxes and (ii) upon the obsolescence of or after
         the occurrence of any event requiring a change in any form or
         certificate previously delivered pursuant to this Section 4.03(b),
         copies (in such numbers as may from time to time be prescribed by
         Applicable Law or regulation) of such additional, amended or successor
         form, certificate or statement as may be required under Applicable Law
         or regulation to permit the Borrower to make payments hereunder for the
         account of such Person without deduction or withholding of income
         taxes.

                  (c) For any period with respect to which the Lender or such
         Affected Party has failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate
         form, certificate or statement described in clause (b) of this section
         (except if such failure is due to a change in law occurring after the
         date of this Agreement), such Person, as the case may be, shall not be
         entitled to indemnification under clause (a) of this Section with
         respect to any Taxes.

                  (d) Within thirty (30) days of the written request of the
         Borrower therefor, the Lender or such Affected Party, as appropriate,
         shall execute and deliver to the Borrower such certificates, forms or
         other documents which can be furnished consistent with the facts and
         which are reasonably necessary to assist the Borrower in applying for
         refunds of taxes remitted hereunder.

                  (e) If, in connection with an agreement or other document
         providing liquidity support, credit enhancement or other similar
         support to the Lender in connection with this Agreement or the funding
         or maintenance of the Loans hereunder, the Lender is required



                                       14
<PAGE>

         to compensate a bank or other financial institution providing such
         liquidity support, credit enhancement or other similar support in
         respect of taxes under circumstances similar to those described in this
         section then upon written demand by the Lender, the Borrower or the
         Check-Casher shall pay to the Lender such additional amount or amounts
         as may be necessary to reimburse such Lender for any amounts paid by
         it.

                                       29
<PAGE>

steps specifically required by this Agreement or reasonably required by the
Administrative Agent to continue Borrower's identity as a separate legal entity
and to make it apparent to third Persons that Borrower is an entity with assets
and liabilities distinct from those of any other Person and is not a division of
any other Person. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and in
addition to and consistent with the other covenants set forth herein, each of
Borrower and ACE shall take such actions as shall be required in order that:

                  (a) Borrower will be a limited liability company whose primary
         activities are restricted in its organizational documentation and whose
         purposes include borrowing funds from Lender and using such funds to
         provide Cash to SSMs to be used solely to provide funds to enable ACE
         to cash Checks, and conducting such other activities as it deems
         necessary or appropriate to carry out its primary activities;

                  (b) Any employee, consultant or agent of Borrower will be
         compensated from Borrower's funds for services provided to Borrower.
         Borrower will not engage any agents other than its attorneys, auditors
         and other professionals, and a Check-Casher and any other agent
         contemplated by the Transaction Documents, which Check-Casher will be
         fully compensated for its services by payment of the Servicing Fee and
         Check-Cashing Payment;

                  (c) Subject to the following sentence, Borrower will not incur
         any material indirect or overhead expenses for items shared with ACE
         (or any other Affiliate thereof) which are not reflected in the
         Servicing Fee and Check-Cashing Payment. To the extent, if any, that
         ACE (or any Affiliate thereof) shares with Borrower items of expense
         not reflected in the Servicing Fee and the Check-Cashing Payment, such
         as legal, auditing and other professional services, such expenses will
         be allocated to the extent practical on the basis of actual use or the
         value of services rendered, and otherwise on a basis reasonably related
         to the actual use or the value of services rendered;

                  (d) Borrower's operating expenses will not be paid by ACE or
         any other Affiliate thereof;

                  (e) Borrower will have its own stationery separate from that
         of any other Person;

                  (f) Borrower's books and records will be maintained separately
         from those of any other Person;

                  (g) All financial statements of any Person that are
         consolidated to include Borrower will contain detailed notes clearly
         stating that (A) all of Borrower's assets are owned by Borrower, and
         (B) Borrower is a separate entity with creditors who have received
         security interests in Borrower's assets;

                  (h) Borrower's assets will be maintained in a manner that
         facilitates their identification and segregation from those of any
         other Person;

                  (i) Borrower will strictly observe limited liability company
         formalities in its dealings with ACE and any Affiliate thereof, and
         funds or other assets of Borrower will not be commingled with those of
         any other Person. Borrower shall not maintain joint



                                       30
<PAGE>

         bank accounts or other depository accounts to which any other Person
         has independent access (other than in accordance with the Transaction
         Documents). Borrower is not named, and has not entered into any
         agreement to be named, directly or indirectly, as a direct or
         contingent beneficiary or loss payee on any insurance policy with
         respect to any loss relating to the property of any other Person; and

                  (j) Borrower will not hold itself out to be responsible for
         the debts of any other Person or the decisions or actions respecting
         the daily business and affairs of any other Person. Borrower will
         immediately correct any known misrepresentation with respect to the
         foregoing, and it will not operate or purport to operate as an
         integrated single economic unit with respect to or in its dealing with
         any other Person.

records regarding its duties hereunder.

         SECTION 8.05 Check-Casher Representations. The Check-Casher covenants
and agrees that each delivery of a Borrowing Base Report or Servicing Report
shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by the Check-Casher that (i)
all information in such Borrowing Base Report or Servicing Report is true and
accurate in all material respects (including, without limitation, that all

(ii) the Check-Casher is in compliance with all of its agreements and covenants
set forth in the Transaction Documents, (iii) no Check-Casher Event of Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (iv) the representations
and warranties of the Check-Casher contained in the Transaction Documents are
true and correct in all material respects as if made on the date of the
execution of such Borrowing Base Report or Servicing Report.

         SECTION 8.06 Costs of Servicing; Check-Casher's Fee. (a) Costs of
Servicing. All costs of servicing in the manner required by this Article VIII

shall be entitled to receive the servicing fee (the "Servicing Fee") in the
amount described in Section 8.06(b).

                  (b) Servicing Fee; Check-Casher's Fee. The amount of the
         Servicing Fee which the Check-Casher shall be entitled to receive on
         each Settlement Date during the Usage Period and on the Usage Period
         Maturity Date shall be determined by multiplying (i) the average
         Eligible Pool Balance during the prior Monthly Period multiplied by
         (ii) 1.00% multiplied by (iii) 1/12 (pro rated in the case of the Usage
         Period Maturity Date). In addition, the Check-Casher shall be entitled
         to receive the Check-Cashing Payment in accordance Section 3.03(e)(ix).

         SECTION 8.07 Successor Check-Casher; Liquidation. Upon the occurrence
of any Check-Casher Event of Default, the Termination Date, or any Event of
Default, the Collateral Agent shall (i) if so directed by the Administrative
Agent, designate a new Check-Casher for purposes of liquidating the facility and
give notice to the Check-Casher that a new Check-Casher has been designated for
such purposes or (ii) if so directed by the Administrative Agent, give notice to
the Check-Casher that the Collateral Agent will assume all of the rights of the
Check-Casher hereunder for purposes of liquidating the facility in accordance
with Section 9.02(c) and (d). The Collateral Agent shall have no liability with
respect to any obligation which was required to be performed by the Check Casher
or any claim of a third party based on any alleged action or inaction by the
Check-Casher. Upon receipt by the Check-Casher of any notice in accordance with
clause (i) or (ii) above, it shall terminate its activities as Check-Casher
hereunder in a manner that the Collateral Agent believes will facilitate the
transition of the performance of such activities to a new Check-Casher or the
Collateral Agent, as the case may



                                       34
<PAGE>

be. All costs and expenses of the Collateral Agent or any successor Check-Casher
in liquidating the facility shall be paid by the prior Check-Casher. Any new
Check-Casher must agree in writing to perform the duties and obligations of the
Check-Casher pursuant to the terms hereof. The Collateral Agent shall provide
each Rating Agency with notice of any change in the Check-Casher.

         The Check-Casher hereby agrees to cooperate with the Collateral Agent
and any successor to the Check-Casher appointed in accordance herewith in
effecting the termination and transfer of the responsibilities and rights of the
Check-Casher hereunder to the Collateral Agent or any successor to the
Check-Casher, including, without limitation, the transfer to the Collateral
Agent or to the successor to the Check-Casher, as applicable, for administration
by it of all Cash and Checks which shall at the time be held by the Check-Casher
or thereafter received with respect to the Assets. In addition, upon the
appointment of any successor Check-Casher or the assumption by the Collateral
Agent of the Check-Casher's rights and responsibilities hereunder, the
Check-Casher shall obtain and/or assign to the Collateral Agent or such
successor any license or approval required for the use of any program used by
the Check-Casher in the servicing of the Assets. The Check-Casher hereby
designates the Collateral Agent or any successor to the Check-Casher as its
agent and attorney-in-fact to execute transfers of financing statements and any
other filings or instruments which may be necessary or advisable to effect such
transfer of the Check-Casher's responsibilities and rights hereunder.

         SECTION 8.08 Bailee for Collateral Agent. The Check-Casher hereby
acknowledges that Borrower has granted to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit
of the Secured Parties, a security interest in all of the assets of Borrower. If

the form of cash or otherwise), the Check-Casher agrees that it shall hold all
such Assets as custodian and bailee on behalf of the Collateral Agent for the
purposes of perfecting the security interest of the Secured Parties in such Cash
and other Assets.

         payment of any amount due thereunder (after giving effect to any
         periods of grace or right to cure) or which default if unremedied,
         uncured, or unwaived (with or without the passage of time or the giving
         of notice or both) would permit acceleration of the maturity of such
         indebtedness and such default shall have continued unremedied, uncured
         or unwaived for a period long enough to permit such acceleration; or

                  (e) An Event of Bankruptcy shall have occurred and remain

         actions), arbitration proceedings or governmental proceedings so
         disclosed, which, in the case of clause (i) or (ii), in the reasonable
         opinion of the Administrative Agent, has a reasonable likelihood of
         having a Material Adverse Effect; or

                  (h) There shall exist any event or occurrence that would
         reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect; or

         SECTION 9.02 Remedies.

                  (a) Optional Acceleration. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
         Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 9.01(e)),
         the Administrative Agent may declare that the Termination Date has
         occurred and the unpaid principal amount of the Note to be due and
         payable immediately, by a notice in writing to Borrower, and upon any
         such declaration, the Termination Date shall occur and such principal
         amount shall be immediately due and payable, together with all accrued
         and unpaid interest thereon, without presentment, demand, protest or
         other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by Borrower.

                  (b) Automatic Acceleration. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
         Default described in Section 9.01(e), the Termination Date shall occur
         automatically and the unpaid principal amount of the Note shall
         automatically become due and payable, together with all accrued and
         unpaid interest thereon, without presentment, demand, protest or notice
         of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by Borrower.

                  (c) Additional Remedies. Upon any acceleration of the Note
         pursuant to this Section 9.02, no Borrowings thereafter will be made,
         and the Collateral Agent and other Secured Parties shall have, in
         addition to all other rights and remedies under this Agreement or
         otherwise, all other rights and remedies provided under the UCC of each
         applicable jurisdiction and other Applicable Laws to a secured party,
         which rights shall


                                       37
<PAGE>

         be cumulative. Upon the acceleration of the Note, the Collateral Agent
         shall (unless otherwise instructed by the Majority Liquidity Providers)
         take all lawful action at ACE's expense (for reasonable costs and
         expenses) to exercise any and all rights, remedies, powers and
         privileges lawfully available to the Collateral Agent including,
         without limitation, the transmission of notices of default and the
         institution of legal or administrative actions or proceedings to compel
         or secure performance by the Borrower or the Check-Casher and to
         exercise any other remedies available to a secured party. If an Event
         of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Collateral Agent
         shall (at the direction of the Administrative Agent) direct Borrower to
         exercise all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims of
         Borrower against the Check-Casher or any other party under or in
         connection with the Transaction Documents, including the right or power
         to take any action to compel performance or observance by the
         Check-Casher or such other party of its obligations to Borrower, and
         the right to give any consent, request, notice, direction, approval,
         extension or waiver in respect of any Transaction Document. If Borrower
         shall have failed, within five (5) Business Days of receiving the
         directions of the Collateral Agent, to satisfactorily undertake such
         directed actions, the Collateral Agent may take such previously
         directed actions on behalf of Borrower and the Secured Parties.

                  (d) Collateral Agent to Instruct. Upon the occurrence of an
         Event of Default, Termination Event or Termination Date, the Collateral
         Agent shall be the sole party authorized to instruct the Approved
         Couriers and each Approved Vault Bank as to any action to be taken with
         respect to Cash, Checks and Collections. Without limiting any other
         provision of this Section 9.02, upon the acceleration of the Notes
         pursuant to this Section 9.02 or upon the occurrence of a Termination
         Event, the Collateral Agent shall (unless otherwise instructed by the
         Majority Liquidity Providers) give notice to the Check-Casher, each
         Approved Vault Bank and each Approved Courier to cease distributing
         Cash and to arrange for the return within two (2) Business Days of all
         of the Cash and Checks in the possession of such Approved Vault Bank or
         Approved Courier or any SSM serviced by such Approved Courier (all such
         Cash to be deposited in the Trust Collection Account).

                                    ARTICLE X

                   THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT; COLLATERAL AGENT

         SECTION 10.01 Authorization and Action. Pursuant to agreements entered
into with the Administrative Agent, Lender has appointed and authorized the
Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise
such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by
the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto.

         SECTION 10.02 Administrative Agent's and Collateral Agent's Reliance,
Etc. The Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and their directors,
officers, agents or employees shall not be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with the Transaction
Documents (including, without limitation, the servicing, administering or
collecting of Assets as Check-Casher pursuant to Section 8.01), except for its
or their own gross


                                       38
<PAGE>

negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent: (a) may
consult with legal counsel (including counsel for Borrower), independent
certified public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (b) makes no
warranty or representation to any Secured Party or any other holder of any
interest in Assets and shall not be responsible to any Secured Party or any such
other holder for any statements, warranties or representations made in or in
connection with any Transaction Document; (c) shall not have any duty to
ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms,
covenants or conditions of any Transaction Document on the part of Borrower or
the Check-Casher or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of
Borrower or the Check-Casher; (d) shall not be responsible to any Secured Party
or any other holder of any interest in the Assets for the due execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of any
Transaction Document; and (e) shall incur no liability under or in respect of
this Agreement by acting upon any notice (including notice by telephone where
permitted herein), consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which
may be by facsimile or telex) in good faith believed by it to be genuine and
signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

         SECTION 10.03 The Liquidity Agent, the Collateral Agent, the
Administrative Agent and Affiliates. The Liquidity Agent, the Collateral Agent,
the Administrative Agent and any of their respective Affiliates may generally
engage in any kind of business with Borrower or the Check-Casher, any of their
respective Affiliates and any Person who may do business with or own securities
of Borrower or the Check-Casher or any of their respective Affiliates, all as if
they were not the Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and the Liquidity
Agent, respectively, and without any duty to account therefor to any Secured
Party or any other holder of an interest in the Assets.

         SECTION 10.04 Appointment and Powers of Collateral Agent. The Secured
Parties hereby appoint the Collateral Agent as their agent hereunder and hereby
authorize the Collateral Agent to take such action on their behalf and to
exercise such rights, remedies, powers and privileges hereunder as are
specifically authorized to be exercised by the Collateral Agent by the terms
hereof, together with such rights, remedies, powers and privileges as are
reasonably incidental thereto. The parties hereto agree that the Collateral
Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action or
refrain from taking any action in its capacity as Collateral Agent, but shall
only be required to act or refrain from acting in such capacity (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instruction of
the Majority Liquidity Providers. The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to
retain experts and to act in reliance upon the advice of such experts concerning
all matters pertaining to the agencies hereby created and its duties hereunder,
and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in
good faith in accordance with the advice of such experts selected by it. The
relationship between the Collateral Agent and each of the Secured Parties is
that of Collateral Agent and principal only, and nothing herein shall be deemed
to constitute the Collateral Agent a trustee for any of the Secured Parties or
impose on the Collateral Agent any obligations other than those for which
express provision is made herein.

         If the Collateral Agent receives unclear or conflicting instructions,
it shall be entitled to refrain from taking action until clear or
non-conflicting instructions are received, but shall inform


                                       39
<PAGE>

the instructing party or parties promptly of its decision to refrain from taking
such action. Except as required by the specific terms of this Agreement, the
Collateral Agent shall have no duty to exercise any right, power, remedy or
privilege granted to it hereby, or to take any affirmative action hereunder,
unless directed to do so by the Majority Liquidity Providers (and shall be fully
protected in acting or refraining from acting pursuant to such directions which
shall be binding on the Secured Parties), and shall not, without the prior
approval of the Majority Liquidity Providers, waive any default on the part of
Borrower or the Check-Casher. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action (i) which the
Collateral Agent has determined will expose the Collateral Agent to personal or
financial liability, unless indemnified to its satisfaction, or (ii) which is
contrary to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, or Applicable Law.

         The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely on any communication,
instrument, paper or other document reasonably believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been given, signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons.
The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, unless a Responsible Officer of the Collateral
Agent has actual knowledge thereof or the Collateral Agent has received written
notice thereof from the Secured Parties.

         Each of the Borrower and ACE hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to
file one or more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto,
relative to all or any part of the collateral in which an interest is granted,
or is purported to be granted, hereby, without the signature of the Borrower or
ACE, as the case may be, where permitted by law. The Collateral Agent shall, at
the direction of the Administrative Agent, file any such financing statements or
amendments thereto as the Administrative Agent may provide to the Collateral
Agent; provided that absent any such instruction, the Collateral Agent shall
have no obligation to file any such financing statements or amendments. In
addition, Collateral Agent shall, at the direction of Borrower, file any
continuation statements provided to it by Borrower, provided that absent any
such instruction and the provision of such continuation statements, the
Collateral Agent shall prepare and file all continuation statements necessary to
maintain a first priority perfected security interest in all of the assets of
Borrower which may be perfected by filing a financing statement under the UCC.

         SECTION 10.05 Collateral Agent and Employees of the Collateral Agent.

                  (a) No provision of this Agreement shall require the
         Collateral Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any
         financial or other liability in the performance of any duties hereunder
         or in the exercise of any rights and powers hereunder.

                  (b) The Collateral Agent shall have the right at any time to
         seek instructions from any court of competent jurisdiction. The
         Collateral Agent may rely on the advice of counsel and shall be held
         harmless for actions taken in reliance thereon.

                  (c) The Collateral Agent makes no representation as to, and
         shall have no responsibility for, the correctness of any statement
         contained in, or the validity or sufficiency of, this Agreement or any
         documents or instruments referred to in this Agreement or the
         sufficiency or effectiveness of any collateral assigned by this


                                       40
<PAGE>

         Agreement or as to or for the validity or collectibility of any
         obligation contemplated by this Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall
         not be accountable for the use or application by any person of
         disbursements properly made by the Collateral Agent in conformity with
         the provisions of this Agreement.

                  (d) The Collateral Agent may exercise any of its duties
         hereunder by or through Collateral Agents or employees. The possession
         of the Collateral by such Collateral Agents or employees shall be
         deemed to be the possession of the Collateral Agent.

                  (e) Each Liquidity Provider hereby agrees to indemnify and
         hold harmless, in accordance with its pro rata percentage of the sum of
         the aggregate commitments under the Liquidity Agreement, the Collateral
         Agent (to the extent not indemnified or reimbursed by the Check Casher
         or the Borrower) from and against any and all out-of-pocket costs and
         expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and other
         experts) incurred or suffered by the Collateral Agent in its capacity
         as Collateral Agent hereunder (or as the account holder for any of the
         Vault Collection Accounts) as a result of any action taken or omitted
         to be taken by the Collateral Agent in such capacity or otherwise
         incurred or suffered by the Collateral Agent in such capacity to the
         extent not reimbursed by the Check Casher or the Borrower or by
         application of the Collateral; provided that no Liquidity Provider
         shall be liable for any portion of any such costs or expenses resulting
         from or attributable to gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
         part of the Collateral Agent. The obligations of each Liquidity
         Provider under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the
         Liquidity Agreement.

                  (f) The provisions of this Section shall survive the
         termination of this Agreement and the resignation of the Collateral
         Agent hereunder.

         SECTION 10.06 Successor Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent acting
hereunder at any time may resign by an instrument in writing addressed and
delivered, 60 days prior to the effectiveness of such resignation, to each of
the Liquidity Providers, the Administrative Agent, the Liquidity Agent, the
Lender, the Borrower and the Check-Casher, and may be removed at any time with
cause by an instrument in writing duly executed by or on behalf of the Majority
Liquidity Providers. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Majority Liquidity
Providers shall also have the right to appoint a successor to the Collateral
Agent upon any such resignation or removal, by an instrument of substitution
complying with the requirements of Applicable Law, or, in the absence of any
such requirements, without any formality other than appointment and designation
in writing. Upon the making and acceptance of such appointment, the execution
and delivery by such successor Collateral Agent of a ratifying instrument
pursuant to which such successor Collateral Agent agrees to assume the duties
and obligations imposed on the Collateral Agent by the terms of this Agreement,
and the delivery to such successor Collateral Agent of the collateral, and
documents and instruments then held by the retiring Collateral Agent, such
successor Collateral Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all
the estate, rights, powers, remedies, privileges, immunities, indemnities,
duties and obligations hereby granted to or conferred or imposed upon the
retiring Collateral Agent, and one such appointment and designation shall not
exhaust the right to appoint and designate further successor Collateral Agents
hereunder. No removal or resignation of the Collateral Agent shall be effective
unless and until a successor Collateral Agent has been duly appointed, and the
appointment of such


                                       41
<PAGE>

successor Collateral Agent has been accepted by such successor Collateral Agent.
No Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder
until the collateral and documents and instruments then held by such retiring
Collateral Agent shall have been transferred or delivered to the successor
Collateral Agent, until such retiring Collateral Agent shall have executed and
delivered to the successor Collateral Agent appropriate instruments substituting
such successor Collateral Agent for purposes of this Agreement and assigning the
retiring Collateral Agent's interest in the collateral, to the successor
Collateral Agent. If no successor Collateral Agent shall be appointed, as
aforesaid, or, if appointed, shall not have accepted its appointment, within 30
days after notice of resignation or removal of the retiring Collateral Agent,
then, subject to the provisions hereof, the retiring Collateral Agent may
appoint a successor Collateral Agent with the written consent of the Liquidity
Agent or petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor collateral agent. Each such successor Collateral Agent shall provide
the Check-Casher, the Borrower, ACE, the Administrative Agent, the Lender, each
Liquidity Provider and the Liquidity Agent with its address and telephone
numbers. Notwithstanding the resignation or removal of any Collateral Agent
hereunder, the provisions of this Article X shall continue to inure to the
benefit of such retiring Collateral Agent in respect of any action taken or
omitted to be taken by such retiring Collateral Agent in its capacity as such
while it was Collateral Agent under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent
shall provide prompt notice to each Rating Agency, the Check-Casher and the
Borrower of the appointment of a successor Collateral Agent.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                         ASSIGNMENT OF LENDER'S INTEREST

         SECTION 11.01 Restrictions on Assignments. Neither Borrower nor
Check-Casher may assign its rights, or delegate its duties hereunder or any
interest herein, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.
Lender may assign its rights hereunder or its Commitment or the Note to any
Person without the consent of Borrower; provided, however, that if the Lender
has assigned more than 50% of its Commitment hereunder to any Person other than
its related Liquidity Providers, then the Borrower may prepay the facility in
whole pursuant to Section 2.01 and terminate this Agreement and shall not be
required to pay any Prepayment Fee; and provided, further, that prior to the
occurrence of a Termination Event, the Lender may not without the prior written
consent of the Borrower assign its Commitment hereunder to an entity which does
not then either have a short-term unsecured debt rating or issue commercial
paper with a short-term unsecured debt rating, in each case, by one or more
nationally recognized rating agencies, equivalent to the rating of the Lender's
commercial paper notes.

         SECTION 11.02 Rights of Assignee. Upon the assignment by Lender in
accordance with this Article XI, the assignee receiving such assignment shall
have all of the rights of Lender with respect to the Transaction Documents and
the Assets (or such portion thereof as has been assigned).

         SECTION 11.03 Evidence of Assignment. Any assignment of the Commitment,
the Note and the Assets (or any portion thereof) to any Person may be evidenced
by such instruments or documents as may be satisfactory to the Lender.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         SECTION 12.01 Indemnities by Borrower.

                  (a) General Indemnity. Without limiting any other rights which
         any such Person may have hereunder or under Applicable Law, the
         Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify each of the Administrative Agent,
         the Lender, the Liquidity Providers, the Liquidity Agent, the
         Collateral Agent, each of their respective Affiliates, and all
         successors and permitted transferees, participants and assigns and all
         officers, directors, shareholders, controlling persons, employees and
         agents of any of the foregoing (each an "Indemnified Party"), forthwith
         on demand, from and against any and all damages, losses, claims,
         liabilities and related costs and expenses, including reasonable
         attorneys' fees and disbursements (all of the foregoing being
         collectively referred to as "Indemnified Amounts") awarded against or
         incurred by any of them as a result of a claim arising out of or
         relating to the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
         thereby, excluding, however, Indemnified Amounts to the extent
         determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or in binding
         arbitration to have resulted from gross negligence or willful
         misconduct on the part of such Indemnified Party. Without limiting the
         foregoing, Borrower shall indemnify each Indemnified Party for
         Indemnified Amounts arising out of or relating to:

                           (i) the transfer by Borrower of any interest in any
                  of its assets other than the grant of a security interest
                  granted to the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties,
                  pursuant to Section 1.03 (or as otherwise permitted
                  hereunder);

                           (ii) any representation or warranty made by Borrower
                  (or any of its officers or Affiliates) under or in connection
                  with any Transaction Document, any information or report
                  delivered by or on behalf of Borrower pursuant hereto, which
                  shall have been false, incorrect or misleading in any material
                  respect when made or deemed made (unless so disclosed at the
                  time of delivery);

                           (iii) the failure by Borrower or the Check-Casher to
                  comply with any Applicable Law, including, without limitation,
                  the failure to obtain and maintain in full force and effect
                  any licenses required by any Governmental Authority or the
                  failure to comply with all required disclosure and other
                  regulatory requirements, in each case in connection with the
                  Borrower's and ACE's activities contemplated by the
                  Transaction Documents or the terms of any of the Transaction
                  Documents;

                           (iv) the failure to vest and maintain vested in the
                  Collateral Agent a first priority perfected security interest
                  in all of the assets of Borrower free and clear of any Lien,
                  other than a Lien arising solely as a result of an act of the
                  Secured Parties, whether existing at the time of any Borrowing
                  or at any time thereafter;


                                       43
<PAGE>

                           (v) the failure to file, or any delay in filing,
                  financing statements or other similar instruments or documents
                  under the UCC of any applicable jurisdiction or other
                  Applicable Laws with respect to the assets of Borrower,
                  whether at the time of any Borrowing or at any time
                  thereafter;

                           (vi) any failure of Borrower to perform its duties or
                  obligations in accordance with the provisions of Article VII
                  or otherwise hereunder or under any other Transaction
                  Document;

                           (vii) any failure by Borrower to file any tax returns
                  or pay any taxes when due;

                           (viii) any tax or governmental fee, fine or charge
                  (but not including U.S. federal income taxes upon or measured
                  by net income or state or local taxes upon or measured by net
                  income imposed on the Indemnified Parties by the jurisdiction
                  in which such Indemnified Party is organized or is otherwise
                  taxable without regard to their participation in the
                  transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents), all
                  interest and penalties (including, but not limited to,
                  penalties for failure to file returns or pay amounts due)
                  thereon or with respect thereto, and all out-of-pocket costs
                  and expenses, including, but not limited to (i) the reasonable
                  fees and expenses of counsel in defending against the same,
                  which may arise by reason of the Loans or any interest in the
                  assets of Borrower, (ii) any fees, fines or charges which may
                  be imposed as a result of any failure to properly disclose any
                  fees charged to any consumer in an SSM transaction and (iii)
                  the reasonable fees and expenses incurred to file any returns
                  required to be filed to report the same; and

                           (ix) any and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
                  (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and other
                  experts) incurred or suffered by the Collateral Agent in its
                  capacity as the account holder for any of the Vault Collection
                  Accounts as a result of any action taken or omitted to be
                  taken by the Collateral Agent in such capacity or otherwise
                  incurred or suffered by the Collateral Agent in such capacity,
                  including, without limitation, all cost and expense associated
                  with the establishment and maintenance of the Vault Collection
                  Accounts, to the extent not reimbursed by application of the
                  Collateral; provided that the Borrower shall not be liable for
                  any portion of any such costs or expenses resulting from or
                  attributable to gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
                  part of the Collateral Agent.

                  (b) Contest of Tax Claim; After-Tax Basis. If any Indemnified
         Party shall have notice of any attempt to impose or collect any tax or
         governmental fee or charge for which indemnification will be sought
         from Borrower under Section 12.01(a)(viii), such Indemnified Party
         shall give prompt and timely notice of such attempt to Borrower and
         Borrower shall have the right, at its expense, to participate in any
         proceedings resisting or objecting to the imposition or collection of
         any such tax, governmental fee or charge. Failure or delay in giving
         such notification shall not constitute a waiver of such Indemnified
         Party's right to such compensation; provided, that such Indemnified
         Party


                                       44
<PAGE>

         shall not be entitled to compensation under this Section 12.01 for any
         Indemnified Amounts incurred or suffered with respect to any date
         unless such Indemnified Party shall have notified the Borrower not more
         than 90 days after the applicable Indemnified Party shall have notice
         of any attempt to impose or collect any tax or governmental fee or
         charge for which indemnification will be sought from Borrower under
         Section 12.01(a)(vii). Indemnification hereunder shall be in an amount
         necessary to make the Indemnified Party whole after taking into account
         any tax consequences to the Indemnified Party of the payment of any of
         the aforesaid taxes and the receipt of the indemnity provided hereunder
         or of any refund of any such tax previously indemnified hereunder,
         including the effect of such tax or refund on the amount of tax
         measured by income or profits which is or was payable by the
         Indemnified Party.

                  (c) Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification
         provided above in this Section 12.01 is unavailable to an Indemnified
         Party or is insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party harmless, then
         Borrower shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
         Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability
         in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative
         benefits received by such Indemnified Party on the one hand and
         Borrower on the other hand but also the relative fault of such
         Indemnified Party as well as any other relevant equitable
         considerations.

                  (d) Available Funds. Payments by Borrower under this Section
         12.01 shall be paid solely to the extent funds are available pursuant
         to the priorities set forth in Section 3.03.

         SECTION 12.02 Indemnities by Check-Casher.

                  (a) Indemnity. Without limiting any other rights which the
         Borrower or any Indemnified Party may have hereunder or under
         Applicable Law, the Check-Casher hereby agrees to indemnify the
         Borrower and the Indemnified Parties, forthwith on demand, from and
         against any and all Indemnified Amounts awarded against or incurred by
         any of them to the extent that such Indemnified Amounts are a result of
         a claim arising out of or relating to (i) the Check-Casher's
         performance of, or failure to perform, any of its duties or obligations
         under or in connection with any Transaction Documents, (ii) any
         representation or warranty made by the Check-Casher under or in
         connection with any Transaction Document, any Borrowing Base Report or
         any Servicing Report or any other information or request delivered by
         or on behalf of Check-Casher pursuant hereto, which shall have been
         false, incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or
         deemed made (unless so disclosed at the time of delivery), (iii) the
         co-mingling of any Cash or other Assets with any of the assets of the
         Check-Casher, (iv) any failure by the Check-Casher to pay any taxes
         when due, (v) any failure of Check-Casher to comply with any Applicable
         Law, including, without limitation, the failure to obtain and maintain
         in full force and effect any licenses required by any Governmental
         Authority or the failure to comply with all required disclosure and
         other regulatory requirements, in each case in connection with the
         Borrower's and ACE's activities contemplated by the Transaction
         Documents or the terms of any of the Transaction Documents or (vi) any
         theft, fraud, stealing or misappropriation of Assets by the employees,
         officers, directors or representatives of the Check-Casher, excluding,
         however, Indemnified Losses to the


                                       45
<PAGE>

         extent determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or in binding
         arbitration to have resulted from gross negligence or willful
         misconduct on the part of such Indemnified Party or the Borrower.

                  (b) Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification
         provided above in this Section 12.02 is unavailable to the Borrower or
         an Indemnified Party or is insufficient to hold the Borrower or an
         Indemnified Party harmless, then the Check-Casher shall contribute to
         the amount paid by the Borrower or such Indemnified Party as a result
         of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is
         appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the
         Borrower or such Indemnified Party on the one hand and the Check-Casher
         on the other hand, but also the relative fault of such Indemnified
         Party (if any) and the Borrower and any other relevant equitable
         considerations.

         SECTION 12.03 Indemnities by ACE.

                  (a) Indemnity. Without limiting any other rights which the
         Borrower or any Indemnified Party may have hereunder or under
         Applicable Law, ACE hereby agrees to indemnify the Borrower and the
         Indemnified Parties, forthwith on demand, from and against any and all
         Indemnified Amounts awarded against or incurred by any of them to the
         extent that such Indemnified Amounts are a result of a claim arising
         out of or relating to (i) any tax or governmental fee, fine or charge
         (but not including U.S. federal income taxes upon or measured by net
         income or state or local taxes upon or measured by net income imposed
         on the Borrower or the Indemnified Parties by the jurisdiction in which
         the Borrower or such Indemnified Party is organized or is otherwise
         taxable without regard to their participation in the transactions
         contemplated by the Transaction Documents), all interest and penalties
         (including, but not limited to, penalties for failure to file returns
         or pay amounts due) thereon or with respect thereto, and all
         out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including, but not limited to (x) the
         reasonable fees and expenses of counsel in defending against the same,
         which may arise by reason of or relating to the Transaction Documents
         and (y) the reasonable fees and expenses incurred to file any returns
         required to be filed to report the same, (ii) ACE's performance of, or
         failure to perform, any of its duties or obligations under or in
         connection with any Transaction Documents, (iii) any representation or
         warranty made by ACE under or in connection with any Transaction
         Document or any other information or request delivered by or on behalf
         of ACE pursuant hereto, which shall have been false, incorrect or
         misleading in any material respect when made or deemed made (unless so
         disclosed at the time of delivery), (iv) the co-mingling of any Cash or
         other Assets with any of the assets of the ACE, (v) any failure of the
         Borrower or ACE to comply with any Applicable Law, including, without
         limitation, the failure to obtain and maintain in full force and effect
         any licenses required by any Governmental Authority or the failure to
         comply with all required disclosure and other regulatory requirements,
         in each case in connection with the Borrower's and ACE's activities
         contemplated by the Transaction Documents or the terms of any of the
         Transaction Documents or (vi) any theft, fraud, stealing or
         misappropriation of Assets by the employees, officers, directors or
         representatives of ACE, excluding, however, Indemnified Losses to the
         extent determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or in binding
         arbitration to have resulted from gross negligence or


                                       46
<PAGE>

         willful misconduct on the part of such Indemnified Party or the
         Borrower. ACE further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
         Collateral Agent (to the extent not indemnified or reimbursed by the
         Borrower) from and against any and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
         (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and other experts)
         incurred or suffered by the Collateral Agent in its capacity as the
         account holder for any of the Vault Collection Accounts as a result of
         any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Collateral Agent in such
         capacity or otherwise incurred or suffered by the Collateral Agent in
         such capacity, including, without limitation, all cost and expense
         associated with the establishment and maintenance of the Vault
         Collection Accounts, to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower or by
         application of the Collateral; provided that ACE shall not be liable
         for any portion of any such costs or expenses resulting from or
         attributable to gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
         the Collateral Agent.

                  (b) Contest of Tax Claim; After-Tax Basis. If the Borrower or
         any Indemnified Party shall have notice of any attempt to impose or
         collect any tax or governmental fee or charge for which indemnification
         will be sought from ACE under Section 12.03(a)(i), the Borrower or such
         Indemnified Party shall give prompt and timely notice of such attempt
         to ACE and ACE shall have the right, at its expense, to participate in
         any proceedings resisting or objecting to the imposition or collection
         of any such tax, governmental fee or charge. Failure or delay in giving
         such notification shall not constitute a waiver of such party's right
         to such compensation; provided, that such party shall not be entitled
         to compensation under this Section 12.03 for any Indemnified Amounts
         incurred or suffered with respect to any date unless such party shall
         have notified ACE not more than 90 days after the applicable party
         shall have notice of any attempt to impose or collect any tax or
         governmental fee or charge. Indemnification hereunder shall be in an
         amount necessary to make the Borrower or Indemnified Party whole after
         taking into account any tax consequences to such party of the payment
         of any of the aforesaid taxes and the receipt of the indemnity provided
         hereunder or of any refund of any such tax previously indemnified
         hereunder, including the effect of such tax or refund on the amount of
         tax measured by income or profits which is or was payable by such
         party.

                  (c) Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification
         provided above in this Section 12.03 is unavailable to the Borrower or
         an Indemnified Party or is insufficient to hold the Borrower or an
         Indemnified Party harmless, then ACE shall contribute to the amount
         paid or payable by the Borrower or such Indemnified Party as a result
         of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is
         appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received the
         Borrower or by such Indemnified Party on the one hand and ACE on the
         other hand but also the relative fault of the Borrower or such
         Indemnified Party as well as any other relevant equitable
         considerations.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 13.01 Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement nor consent to any departure by Borrower or Check-Casher
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by each of the parties hereto.


                                       47
<PAGE>

The parties acknowledge that, before entering into such an amendment or granting
such a waiver or consent, Lender may also be required to obtain the approval of
some or all of the Liquidity Providers or to obtain confirmation from the Rating
Agencies that such amendment, waiver or consent will not result in a withdrawal
or reduction of the ratings of the Commercial Paper Notes.

         SECTION 13.02 Notices, Etc. All notices and other communications
provided for hereunder shall, unless otherwise stated herein, be in writing
(including facsimile communication) and shall be personally delivered or sent by
express mail or by overnight courier service, or by courier, or by certified

facsimile number of such party set forth under its name on the signature pages
hereof or at such other address or facsimile number as shall be designated by

         SECTION 13.03 No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of the
Administrative Agent, Liquidity Agent, any other Secured Party to exercise, and
no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof;
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The
remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided by law.

         SECTION 13.04 Binding Effect; Survival. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lender,
ACE, the Check-Casher, the Collateral Agent, the Liquidity Agent and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, and the provisions of Section 4.02
and Article XII shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnified Parties,
respectively, and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided,
however, nothing in the foregoing shall be deemed to authorize any assignment
not permitted by Section 11.01. This Agreement shall create and constitute the
continuing obligations of the parties hereto in accordance with its terms, and
shall remain in full force and effect until the Final Payout Date. The
indemnification and payment provisions of Article XII and Sections 4.01, 4.02,
4.03, 13.05, 13.06, 13.07 and 13.14, subject to the limitations, if any, set

Agreement.

         SECTION 13.05 Costs, Expenses and Taxes. In addition to its obligations
under Article XII, ACE agrees to pay on demand:

                  (a) all costs and expenses incurred by the Secured Parties and

         the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to any of such Persons
         incurred in connection with any of the foregoing or in advising such
         Persons as to their respective rights and remedies under any of the
         Transaction Documents, and (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
         (including reasonable fees and expenses of independent accountants),

<PAGE>

         any review of Borrower's or the Check-Casher's books and records either
         prior to the execution and delivery hereof or pursuant to and subject
         to the maximum amounts described in Sections 7.01(c) and 7.04(c) (such
         out-of-pocket expenses are typically expected to include periodic asset
         audit and field examination expenses and legal and rating agency
         expenses incurred in association with any amendments to any of the
         Transaction Documents); and

                  (b) all stamp and other taxes and fees payable or determined

         Indemnified Party against any liabilities with respect to or resulting
         from any delay in paying or omission to pay such taxes and fees.

         SECTION 13.06 No Proceedings. Borrower, the Check-Casher, ACE, the
Collateral Agent and the Liquidity Agent each hereby agrees that it will not
institute against Lender, or join any other Person in instituting against
Lender, any insolvency proceeding (namely, any proceeding of the type referred
to in the definition of Event of Bankruptcy) so long as any commercial paper
issued by Lender shall be outstanding or there shall not have elapsed one year
plus one day since the last day on which any such commercial paper shall have
been outstanding. The Check-Casher and ACE each hereby agrees that it will not
institute against Borrower, or join any other person in instituting against
Borrower, any insolvency proceeding (namely, any proceeding of the type referred
to in clause (a) of the definition of "Event of Bankruptcy") so long as any debt
of Borrower shall be outstanding hereunder or there shall not have elapsed one
year plus one day since the last day on which any such debt shall have been
outstanding. The foregoing shall not limit the Check-Casher's right to file any
claim in or otherwise take any action with respect to any insolvency proceeding
that was instituted by any other Person. The provisions of this Section 13.06
shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

         SECTION 13.07 Confidentiality.

                  (a) Each of the parties to this Agreement shall maintain, and
         shall cause each of its employees and officers to maintain, the

         Excepted Person shall, as a condition to any such disclosure, agree for
         the benefit of the other parties hereto that such information shall be
         used solely in connection with such Excepted Person's evaluation of the
         Borrower, the Check-Casher and their respective affiliates or such
         Excepted Person's relationship with such Person, (ii) disclose the
         existence of this Agreement, but not the financial terms thereof, (iii)
         disclose such information as is required by an Applicable Law or an
         order of an judicial or administrative proceeding and (iv) disclose
         this Agreement and related information in any suit, action, proceeding
         or investigation (whether in law or in equity or pursuant to

         of defending itself, reducing its liability, or protecting or

         accountants and attorneys of any of the foregoing, provided each such
         Person is informed of the confidential nature of such information. In
         addition, any such nonpublic information may be disclosed as required
         pursuant to any law, rule, regulation, direction, request or order of

         (whether or not having the force or effect of law).

                  (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
         foregoing shall not be construed to prohibit (i) disclosure of any and
         all information that is or becomes publicly known, (ii) disclosure of

         of the confidential nature of the information being disclosed, or (iii)
         any other disclosure authorized by the Borrower, ACE or Check-Casher.

         SECTION 13.08 Captions and Cross References. The various captions

<PAGE>

         Borrower in accordance with the priority of payments set forth in
         Section 3.03 of the Loan and Servicing Agreement, provided that, the
         outstanding Loans have been paid in full.;

                  (b) In the event of any dissolution, winding up, liquidation,
         readjustment, reorganization or other similar event relating to the
         Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, partial or complete, and
         whether in bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership proceedings, or upon
         an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or any other marshalling of
         the assets and liabilities of the Company or any sale of all or
         substantially all of the assets of the Company (such proceedings being
         herein collectively called "Bankruptcy Proceedings"), the Senior
         Interests shall first be paid and performed in full and in cash before
         ACE shall be entitled to receive and to retain any payment or
         distribution in respect of this Term Note. In order to implement the
         foregoing: (i) all payments and distributions of any kind or character
         in respect of this Term Note to which Holder would be entitled except
         for this clause (b) shall be made directly to the Collateral Agent (for
         the benefit of the Senior Interest Holders); (ii) Holder shall promptly
         file a claim or claims, in the form required in any Bankruptcy
         Proceedings, for the full outstanding amount of this Term Note, and
         shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause said claim or claims
         to be approved and all payments and other distributions in respect
         thereof to be made directly to the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of
         the Senior Interest Holders) until the Senior Interests shall have been
         paid and performed in full and in cash; and (iii) Holder hereby
         irrevocably agrees that the Collateral Agent, in the name of Holder or
         otherwise, may demand, sue for, collect, receive and receipt for any
         and all such payments or distributions, and file, prove and vote or
         consent in any such Bankruptcy Proceedings with respect to any and all
         claims of Holder relating to this Term Note, in each case until the
         Senior Interests shall have been paid and performed in full and in
         cash;

                  (c) In the event that Holder receives any payment or other
         distribution of any kind or character from the Company or from any
         other source whatsoever, in respect of this Term Note, other than as
         expressly permitted by the terms of this Term Note, such payment or
         other distribution shall be received in trust for the Senior Interest
         Holders and shall be turned over by Holder to the Collateral Agent (for
         the benefit of the Senior Interest Holders) forthwith. Holder will mark
         its books and records so as clearly to indicate that this Term Note is
         subordinated in accordance with the terms hereof. All payments and
         distributions received by the Collateral Agent in respect of this Term
         Note, to the extent received in or converted into cash, may be applied
         by the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Senior Interest
         Holders) first to the payment of any and all expenses (including
         reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses) paid or incurred by the
         Senior Interest Holders in enforcing these Subordination Provisions, or
         in endeavoring to collect or realize upon this Term Note, and any
         balance thereof shall, solely as between ACE and the Senior Interest
         Holders, be applied by the Collateral Agent (in the order of
         application set forth in Section 3.03 of the Loan and Servicing
         Agreement) toward the payment of the Senior Interests; but as between
         the Company and its creditors, no such payments or distributions of any
         kind or character shall be deemed to be payments or distributions in
         respect of the Senior Interests;

                  (d) Notwithstanding any payments or distributions received by
         the Senior Interest Holders in respect of this Term Note, while any

         shall not be subrogated to the then existing rights of the Senior
         Interest Holders in respect of the Senior Interests until the Senior
         Interests have been paid and performed in full and in cash. If no
         Bankruptcy Proceedings are pending, Holder shall only be entitled to
         exercise any subrogation rights that it may acquire by reason of a
         payment or distribution to the Senior Interest Holders in respect of
         this Term Note;

                  (e) These Subordination Provisions are intended solely for the
         purpose of defining the relative rights of Holder, on the one hand, and
         the Senior Interest Holders on the other hand. Nothing contained in
         these Subordination Provisions or elsewhere in this Term Note is
         intended to or shall impair, as between the Company, its creditors
         (other than the Senior Interest Holders) and Holder, the Company's
         obligation, which is unconditional and absolute, to pay Holder the
         principal of this Term Note as and when the same shall become due and
         payable in accordance with the terms hereof or to affect the relative
         rights of Holder and creditors of the Company (other than the Senior
         Interest Holders);

                  (f) Holder shall not, until the Senior Interests have been
         paid and performed in full and in cash, (i) cancel, waive, forgive, or
         commence legal proceedings to enforce or collect, or subordinate to any
         obligation of the Company, howsoever created, arising or evidenced,
         whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, or now or hereafter
         existing, or due or to become due, other than the Senior Interests,
         this Term Note or any rights in respect hereof, (ii) assign or transfer
         this Term Note or (iii) convert this Term Note into an equity interest
         in the Company, unless Holder shall have received the prior written
         consent of the Administrative Agent and the Lender in each case;

                  (g) Holder shall not, without the advance written consent of
         the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lender,
         commence, or join with any other Person in commencing, any Bankruptcy
         Proceedings with respect to the Company until at least one year and one
         day shall have passed since the Senior Interests shall have been paid
         and performed in full and in cash;

                  (h) If, at any time, any payment (in whole or in part) of any
         Senior Interest is rescinded or must be restored or returned by a
         Senior Interest Holder (whether in connection with Bankruptcy
         Proceedings or otherwise), these Subordination Provisions shall
         continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, as
         though such payment had not been made;

                  (i) Each of the Senior Interest Holders may, from time to
         time, at its sole discretion, without notice to Holder, and without
         waiving any of its rights under these Subordination Provisions, take
         any or all of the following actions: (i) retain or obtain an interest
         in any property to secure any of the Senior Interests; (ii) retain or
         obtain the primary or secondary obligations of any other obligor or
         obligors with respect to any of the Senior Interests; (iii) extend or
         renew for one or more periods (whether or not longer than the original
         period), alter or exchange any of the Senior Interests, or release or
         compromise any obligation of any nature with respect to any of the
         Senior Interests; (iv) amend, supplement, amend and restate, or
         otherwise modify any Transaction Document; and (v) release its security
         interest in, or surrender, release or permit any substitution or
         exchange for all or any



                                        4
<PAGE>

         part of any rights or property securing any of the Senior Interests, or
         extend or renew for one or more periods (whether or not longer than the
         original period), or release, compromise, alter or exchange any
         obligations of any nature of any obligor with respect to any such
         rights or property;

                  (j) Holder hereby waives: (i) notice of acceptance of these
         Subordination Provisions by any of the Senior Interest Holders; (ii)
         notice of the existence, creation, non-payment or non-performance of
         all or any of the Senior Interests; and (iii) all diligence in
         enforcement, collection or protection of, or realization upon, the
         Senior Interests, or any thereof, or any security therefor;

                  (k) Each of the Senior Interest Holders may, from time to
         time, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
         Transaction Documents to which such Persons are party, but without
         notice to Holder, assign or transfer any or all of the Senior
         Interests, or any interest therein; and, notwithstanding any such
         assignment or transfer or any subsequent assignment or transfer
         thereof, such Senior Interests shall be and remain Senior Interests for
         the purposes of these Subordination Provisions, and every immediate and
         successive assignee or transferee of any of the Senior Interests or of
         any interest of such assignee or transferee in the Senior Interests
         shall be entitled to the benefits of these Subordination Provisions to
         the same extent as if such assignee or transferee were the assignor or
         transferor; and

                  (l) These Subordination Provisions constitute a continuing
         offer from the holder of this Term Note to all Persons who become the
         holders of, or who continue to hold, Senior Interests; and these
         Subordination Provisions are made for the benefit of the Senior
         Interest Holders, and the Administrative Agent may proceed to enforce
         such provisions on behalf of each of such Persons.

         7. General. No failure or delay on the part of the Holder in exercising
any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such power or right preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. No
amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent with respect to, any provision
of this Term Note shall in any event be effective unless (i) the same shall be
in writing and signed and delivered by the Company and Holder and consented to
by the Administrative Agent and (ii) all consents required for such actions
under the Transaction Documents shall have been received by the appropriate
Persons.

         8.       No Negotiation.  This Term Note is not negotiable.

                        ELECTRONIC PRESENTMENT AGREEMENT

         This Agreement is made as of the 6th day of January, 2003 ("Effective
Date"), between Ace Funding, LLC, a limited liability company organized under
the laws of Delaware ("Funding") and a subsidiary of ACE Cash Express, Inc., a
Texas corporation, having its principal place of business at 1231 Greenway
Drive, Suite 600, Irving, Texas 75038, ACE Cash Express, Inc., a Texas

and subsidiary of ITLA Capital Corporation ("Bank"), and Household Tax Masters
Inc., a Delaware corporation having its principal place of business at 200
Somerset Corporate Boulevard, Suite 102, Bridgewater, New Jersey 08807-2862
("HTM").

         A. WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain License Agreement between ACE and
Block dated November 22, 2000, and Addendum No. 1 to the License Agreement dated
May 31, 2001 (collectively the "License") ACE operates Self Service Machines
("SSMs") in approximately 248 Block business premises ("locations"), during that
period of time from the first Monday after January 1st through May 31st of each
year ("Tax Season");

         B. WHEREAS, Block desires to expedite the disbursement of cash to their
customers ("Customers") who obtain Refund Anticipation Loans ("RAL") or Refund
Anticipation Checks ("RAC") (collectively, the "Customer Checks"); and

         C. WHEREAS, HTM provides the Bank with critical services in order for
Bank to conduct the Refund Anticipation Loan program ("RAL Program"); and

         D. WHEREAS, Bank is the originator of Refund Anticipation Loans for the
RAL program and the issuer of the Refund Anticipation Checks; and

         E. WHEREAS, ACE wishes to facilitate cash disbursements through the
SSMs and to deliver to the Bank, at the conclusion of the Tax Season, the
Customer Checks that were deposited into the SSMs during the Tax Season; and

         F. WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to provide for electronic
presentment of Customer Checks to Bank in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement to facilitate the payment of amounts due with
respect to Customer Checks cashed in SSMs.

         NOW, THEREFORE, ACE, Funding, Bank, Block and HTM agree as follows:

1. SSM CUSTOMER PROCEDURES AND DISCLOSURE

1.1. Paper Checks - When a Customer applies and is accepted for a RAL or RAC and
indicates that he/she wants to utilize a SSM to cash his/her Customer Check,
Block shall provide all disclosures to the Customer as previously agreed to
between HTM and Block, which in any event shall be in accordance with applicable
law and regulations. Block and ACE agree and warrant that no part of any check
cashing fee or other fee charged for the privilege of using the SSM shall be
included in or deducted from the amount of the RAL or RAC prior to the Customer
check being cashed in the SSM.

<PAGE>

1.2. Electronic Checks - When a Customer applies and is accepted for a RAL or
RAC and indicates that he/she wants his/her proceeds to be disbursed in cash
from a SSM, Block agrees to provide that Customer with Truth-in-Lending and
other disclosures required by applicable law and regulation and obtain the
Customer's agreement to those disclosures (including by signature, whether
physical or electronic) in a form and manner to be determined solely by HTM and
Bank prior to any cash being disbursed. Further, Block and ACE agree, represent
and warrant that no part of any check cashing fee, funds disbursement fee or
other fee charged for the privilege of using the SSM shall be included in or
deducted from the amount of the RAL or RAC prior to the proceeds being disbursed
from the SSM. ACE agrees that each such disbursement transaction shall be
considered as being accomplished through the issuance and negotiation of a check
by electronic means and that such issuance and negotiation shall be governed by
the Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC") as that code has been enacted in the State
of New York.

2. SETTLEMENT DIRECTIONS

         Each business day, at 3:00 p.m. Central Time, ACE will compile (i) the
check approval and check print files for Customer Checks cashed in SSMs pursuant
to this Agreement which are presented electronically and that originate from the
Block host system ("Block's Check Authorization File") and are received by the
ACE host system and (ii) the cash dispensed from SSMs in order to prepare a
checks cleared file in NACHA format. This process will generate pre-commit
information on the Customer Checks that were cashed in the SSMs after 3:00 p.m.
(local time) the immediately preceding business day until 3:00 p.m. (local time)
of the current business day. ACE will, following review and correction, if any,
finalize and commit the file by 4:00 p.m. Central Time on such business day,
thereby automatically creating a check cleared file in NACHA Format (a "Check
Cleared File"). By 4:00 p.m. on such day ACE will electronically send the Check
Cleared File to HTM for review and confirmation.

         By 4:00 p.m. on such day such Check Cleared File shall include, with
respect to each Customer Check, the data indicated on the attached Exhibit "A".
HTM shall review and approve each such Check Cleared File, provided that HTM may
elect, by notice to ACE, to disapprove specific Customer Checks ("Exceptions").
Upon such approval, and in time to permit the wire transfer by the time set
forth below, HTM shall forward such Check Cleared File (adjusted for the
Exceptions) to Bank with instructions to wire funds to U.S. Bank, National
Association as collateral agent for secured parties pursuant to the following
wire instructions: Account # 1801211673C5 ABA #091000622 Re: 33480100 Attn.:
Dawn Gipson/Ace Funding, which instructions shall not be modified without the
prior written consent of U.S. Bank National Association, the designated
recipient of such funds. Bank shall use its best efforts to complete such wire
on or before 1:00 pm Pacific Time of the business day following receipt of the
Check Cleared File authorizing the wire, but shall, in any event, complete such
wire transfer on the next business day.

3. CHECK PROCESSING AND DELIVERY

         (a)  The endorsement on paper checks shall be voided by ACE
              immediately upon deposit into a SSM.


                                       2
<PAGE>


         (b)  ACE will be responsible for voiding and safekeeping the checks
              until the conclusion of Tax Season, at which time ACE will
              deliver the voided checks to HTM as servicer for Bank.

         (c)  ACE and Bank will resolve Exceptions, through HTM as servicer for
              Bank, on an individual item-by-item basis. If ACE and HTM are
              unable to resolve an Exception with respect to any specific check
              cashed in an SSM and have it included in a Check Cleared File,
              ACE shall retain all remedies under the applicable Uniform
              Commercial Code with respect to pursuing payment of such Customer
              Check by Bank.

4. GUARANTEE OF CHECK AUTHORIZATION FILES

         As an inducement for HTM and Bank to enter into this Agreement, ACE and
Block hereby represent, warrant and guarantee that the information contained in
the Check Cleared File delivered to HTM and to Bank from ACE will be true and
accurate in all material respects. Further, Block represents, warrants and
guarantees that the information contained in Block's Check Authorization File
will be true and correct in all material respects. ACE and Block represent,
warrant and guarantee the identity of the Customers who cash Customer Checks or
otherwise receive funds through transactions appearing in the Check Cleared
File, provided the foregoing shall not modify, as between ACE and Block, the
risk-sharing terms of the License. With respect to all such transactions, ACE
makes to Bank and guarantees all warranties of presentment contained in UCC
Sections 3-417 and 4-208. This Agreement shall be considered an agreement for
Electronic Presentment pursuant to UCC Section 4-110. Bank agrees (i) to pursue
any claims against Block or ACE directly against Block and ACE and (ii) under no
circumstances shall any funds to be wired pursuant to Section 2 following HTM's
approval, subject to Exceptions, of the Check Cleared File, hereof be subject to
any offset or deduction of any kind, with respect to disputes with Block or ACE
or otherwise.

5. CUSTOMER PRIVACY

         A. ACE and/or Block, in performing their obligations pursuant to this
Agreement, may have access to or receive disclosure of information (either from
Bank, HTM or a Customer) about a Customer, including but not limited to,
Non-Public Personal Information, as hereinafter defined in subparagraph b.
below. ACE and Block agree that all such information obtained from Bank, HTM or
from a Customer in the course of this Agreement (hereinafter referred to as

shall be considered, confidential and neither ACE nor Block shall use, disclose,
give, sell, or otherwise transfer or make available, directly or indirectly,
Consumer Personal Information to any third party, except as may be necessary to

respective comprehensive privacy policies with respect to their handling of the
Consumer Personal Information, which policies, in any event, shall at all times
comply with applicable law and regulation governing the use and dissemination of
such Consumer Personal Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Consumer
Personal Information obtained from Customers by Block and ACE, respectively, may
be used by Block and ACE as allowed in their respective privacy policies.


                                       3

         B. All parties agree that, during the term of this Agreement and
thereafter, Consumer Personal Information will be used by each party solely
according to the terms of their respective privacy policies.

         C. Each party has developed, implemented and will maintain effective
information security policies and procedures that include administrative,
technical and physical safeguards designed to 1) ensure the security and
confidentiality of Consumer Personal Information provided hereunder, 2) protect
against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such
Consumer Personal Information, 3) protect against unauthorized access or use of
such Consumer Personal Information and 4) comply with applicable law and
regulations. All personnel of each party handling such Consumer Personal
Information have been appropriately trained in the implementation of the party's
information security policies and procedures. Each party regularly audits and
reviews its information security policies and procedures to ensure their
continued effectiveness and determine whether adjustments are necessary in light
of circumstances including, without limitation, changes in technology, customer
information systems or threats or hazards to Consumer Personal Information.

         D. Bank covenants and agrees that Bank will not use any information
received by reason of this Agreement to market products or services to Block
Customers. ACE covenants and agrees that ACE will not use any information
contained in Block's Check Authorization File received by ACE or any other

         Re:      Custodial Acknowledgment in favor of the Collateral Agent (as

                  ACE FUNDING LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the

Servicing Agreement dated as of December 18, 2002 (as amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Loan Agreement")
hereby notify you ("Approved Courier") and you hereby acknowledge, that the
Borrower has assigned, pledged and granted to the Collateral Agent, for the
benefit of the Secured Parties, a first and prior security interest in certain
property of Borrower, including all currency, coin, checks, securities and other
valuable property and proceeds thereof received, transported and delivered by

supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time with the consent of the
Collateral Agent (the "SSMs") located in certain business premises of H&R Block
Tax Services, Inc., to secure certain obligations and indebtedness of the
Borrower owing to the "Secured Parties" as defined in the Loan Agreement.

                  1. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in
the Contract:

                  (a) Approved Courier is hereby irrevocably authorized and
directed by Borrower, upon the request of the Collateral Agent, to retrieve (if
necessary) and deliver to the Collateral Agent or its designee (as the
Collateral Agent may direct), to the applicable financial institution as
indicated on the attached Schedule I ("Approved Vault Bank") any and all
Property then and thereafter received, transported or delivered by Approved
Courier pursuant to the Contract (including, without limitation, all Property
contained in cartridges at the SSMs). All requests, instructions and notices to
be given to Approved Courier pursuant to this letter agreement by the Collateral
Agent may be oral or written (unless provided otherwise below) and shall be made
by a Vice President of the Collateral Agent and shall be delivered to Approved
Courier at the address indicated above, facsimile no. (210) 222-8329, phone no.
(210) 222-8505 extension 103 (subject to change only by prior written notice
from Approved Courier to the Borrower and the Collateral Agent as provided in
the last paragraph hereof) and to the attention of Eddie Lira. All requests,
instructions and notices shall be confirmed in writing, by telex, facsimile,
certified mail or express delivery service not later than the second business
day next following the date or time such request, instruction or notice is
effective. Approved Courier shall have a reasonable period of time (but in any
event not to exceed two business days) following the receipt of any request,
instruction or notice to comply therewith. Approved Courier accepts and agrees
to comply with the preceding authorization and direction, and with any such
request or instruction from the Collateral Agent until such time as the
Collateral Agent otherwise directs in writing, as provided above; provided, that
Approved Courier shall incur no liability whatsoever to the Borrower or the

Collateral Agent in acting upon any request or instruction which Approved
Courier reasonably believes to have been given in the manner provided herein by
an authorized representative of the Collateral Agent. Instructions of the
Collateral Agent shall control, and, except as permitted by the Collateral Agent
below in this letter agreement or otherwise in writing, the Borrower shall not
have any right or authority whatsoever to instruct Approved Courier with respect
to the Property.

                  (b) The Collateral Agent shall pay directly to Approved
Courier all costs and expenses payable to Approved Courier pursuant to the
Contract, including any additional cost or expense which Approved Courier shall
require if Approved Courier is directed by the Collateral Agent to perform any
service additional to or different from the services specifically set forth in
the Contract to the extent funds are available in Account # 33480100 at the
Collateral Agent (the "Trust Collection Account"). To the extent the Collateral
Agent fails to pay the amounts referenced in the foregoing sentence, the
Borrower (or ACE in the event the Borrower does not have sufficient funds) will
pay such amounts. Approved Courier waives and disclaims any and all interest
(whether ownership, security or otherwise), at law or in equity, including
without limitation any right of offset or counterclaim against, or carrier's
lien in, the Property and expressly agrees that the Borrower owns the Property,
free and clear of all liens, interests, claims or other rights arising by,
through or under Approved Courier.

                  (c) Neither this letter agreement nor the Contract shall be
modified or amended without the prior written consent of Approved Courier, the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, ACE and the Collateral Agent. In that
connection, it is agreed that the Contract may be amended to add thereto or to
delete therefrom the location of the SSMs by an amendment duly executed by
Approved Courier, the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, ACE and the
Borrower and that the Contract as amended shall thereafter continue in full
force and effect.

                  (d) Approved Courier hereby acknowledges that (i) the Property
is legally and equitably owned by the Borrower and is not the property of the
Approved Vault Bank, the owner of any SSM, H&R Block, ACE or any other party,
(ii) the Collateral Agent has been granted by the Borrower and currently holds a
security interest in the Property and (iii) pursuant to such grant, the
Collateral Agent has the right to exercise the rights of the Borrower under the
Contract. Approved Courier agrees and acknowledges that at all times during
which Approved Courier is in possession of Property received, transported and
delivered by Approved Courier pursuant to the Contract, Approved Courier shall
maintain possession of such Property in the capacity of a custodian and bailee
of such Property for the benefit of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the
Secured Parties for the purpose of perfecting the security interest of the
Collateral Agent pursuant to applicable provisions of the Uniform Commercial
Code or other applicable law, subject and pursuant to the provisions of the
Contract as amended from time to time and pursuant to the provisions of this
letter agreement.

                  (e) Approved Courier agrees to provide the Collateral Agent
with such information and records relating solely to the performance of the
Contract as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request from time to time;
provided that, Approved Courier shall furnish to the Borrower a copy of all such
information and records which are so provided to the Collateral Agent.

                  (f) In the event of loss of the Property, the Collateral
Agent, the Borrower or ACE (each of the Borrower and ACE as agent for the
Collateral Agent) shall have the right to present a claim to Approved Courier
for loss reimbursement in the manner specified and allowed under the terms of
the Contract. All such loss reimbursements shall be deposited directly into the
Vault Collection Account ("Vault Collection Account") designated from time to
time by the Collateral Agent at the applicable Approved Vault Bank to satisfy
any outstanding obligations under the Loan Agreement.

                  (g) Approved Courier shall have no liability in the event of
any dispute involving ownership of the Property or any other matter relating to
this letter agreement other than Approved Courier's nonperformance of its
obligations set forth herein, and the Borrower agrees to pay all court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees which Approved Courier may incur as a result of any
such dispute.

                  2. Until notice is given to the Approved Courier by the
Collateral Agent under Paragraph 1 above:

                  (a) Approved Courier shall continue, pursuant to the Contract,
to pick up sealed cartridges said or represented to contain currency at the
Approved Vault Bank for delivery to the SSMs. The sealed cartridges shall be
delivered by Approved Courier to the SSMs specifically designated in writing by
ACE, as check casher, but (notwithstanding any provision of the Contract to the
contrary) no cartridge shall be delivered to any location other than one or more
of the SSMs.

                  (b) Furthermore, Approved Courier shall continue to pick up
sealed cartridges said to contain all excess cash and items other than checks
and checks (unless checks are voided pursuant to the Electronic Presentment
Agreement referenced below) that are made available to Approved Courier from the
SSMs and shall deliver them to the Approved Vault Bank pursuant to the Contract.
If instructed by ACE (and approved by the Collateral Agent and the
Administrative Agent) that an Electronic Presentment Agreement has been
executed, Approved Courier shall continue to pick up all voided checks and shall
deliver them to Texas Capital Bank for safekeeping ("Texas Capital") pursuant to
the Contract.

                  (c) The instructions provided by ACE pursuant to this
Paragraph 2 may be revoked at any time by notice to that effect by an authorized
representative of the Collateral Agent given to Approved Courier and/or to the
attention of the Branch Manager or, in his or her absence, an Assistant Branch
Manager, of the Approved Vault Bank and any such oral notice shall be confirmed
in writing by certified mail or express delivery service not

later than the business day next following the date or time such notice is
effective.

                  3. By accepting this letter agreement, Approved Courier
represents that the Contract is in full force and effect and that Approved
Courier will not amend the Contract in any manner except in accordance with
paragraph 1(c) hereof. Approved Courier agrees that the Contract will not be
terminated without at least ten (10) days' prior written notice to the
Collateral Agent and prior to any such termination all Property shall be
collected and delivered to the Approved Vault Bank (or, in the case of voided
checks, Texas Capital as set forth in paragraph 2(b) above).

                  This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.

                  Approved Courier covenants and agrees that prior to the date
which is one year and one day (or the then applicable preference period) after
the date upon which all obligations under the Loan Agreement have been paid in
full, Approved Courier will not institute against, or join any other party in
instituting against the Borrower any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
insolvency or liquidation proceeding or other proceedings under any federal or
state bankruptcy or similar law.

respect to the subject matter hereof, please sign below as indicated and return

Collateral Agent in acting upon any request or instruction which Approved
Courier reasonably believes to have been given in the manner provided herein by
an authorized representative of the Collateral Agent. Instructions of the
Collateral Agent shall control, and, except as permitted by the Collateral Agent

have any right or authority whatsoever to instruct Approved Courier with respect
to the Property.

                  (b) The Collateral Agent shall pay directly to Approved
Courier all costs and expenses payable to Approved Courier pursuant to the
Contract, including any additional cost or expense which Approved Courier shall
require if Approved Courier is directed by the Collateral Agent to perform any
service additional to or different from the services specifically set forth in
the Contract to the extent funds are available in Account # 33480100 at the
Collateral Agent (the "Trust Collection Account"). To the extent the Collateral
Agent fails to pay the amounts referenced in the foregoing sentence, the
Borrower (or ACE in the event the Borrower does not have sufficient funds) will
pay such amounts. Approved Courier waives and disclaims any and all interest
(whether ownership, security or otherwise), at law or in equity, including

connection, it is agreed that the Contract may be amended to add thereto or to

Approved Courier, the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, ACE and the
Borrower and that the Contract as amended shall thereafter continue in full
force and effect.

                  (d) Approved Courier hereby acknowledges that (i) the Property
is legally and equitably owned by the Borrower and is not the property of the
Approved Vault Bank, the owner of any SSM, H&R Block, ACE or any other party,
(ii) the Collateral Agent has been granted by the Borrower and currently holds a
security interest in the Property and (iii) pursuant to such grant, the
Collateral Agent has the right to exercise the rights of the Borrower under the
Contract. Approved Courier agrees and acknowledges that at all times during
which Approved Courier is in possession of Property received, transported and
delivered by Approved Courier pursuant to the Contract, Approved Courier shall
maintain possession of such Property in the capacity of a custodian and bailee
of such Property for the benefit of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the
Secured Parties for the purpose of perfecting the security interest of the
Collateral Agent pursuant to applicable provisions of the Uniform Commercial
Code or other applicable law, subject and pursuant to the provisions of the
Contract as amended from time to time and pursuant to the provisions of this
letter agreement.

                  (e) Approved Courier agrees to provide the Collateral Agent
with such information and records relating solely to the performance of the
Contract as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request from time to time;
provided that, Approved Courier shall furnish to the Borrower a copy of all such
information and records which are so provided to the Collateral Agent.

                  (f) In the event of loss of the Property, the Collateral
Agent, the Borrower or ACE (each of the Borrower and ACE as agent for the
Collateral Agent) shall have the right to present a claim to Approved Courier
for loss reimbursement in the manner specified and allowed under the terms of
the Contract. All such loss reimbursements shall be deposited directly into the
Vault Collection Account ("Vault Collection Account") designated from time to
time by the Collateral Agent at the applicable Approved Vault Bank to satisfy
any outstanding obligations under the Loan Agreement.

                  (g) Approved Courier shall have no liability in the event of
any dispute involving ownership of the Property or any other matter relating to
this letter agreement other than Approved Courier's nonperformance of its
obligations set forth herein, and the Borrower agrees to pay all court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees which Approved Courier may incur as a result of any
such dispute.

                  2. Until notice is given to the Approved Courier by the
Collateral Agent under Paragraph 1 above:

to pick up sealed cartridges said or represented to contain currency at the
Approved Vault Bank for delivery to the SSMs. The sealed cartridges shall be
delivered by Approved Courier to the SSMs specifically designated in writing by
ACE, as check casher, but (notwithstanding any provision of the Contract to the
contrary) no cartridge shall be delivered to any location other than one or more
of the SSMs.

                  (b) Furthermore, Approved Courier shall continue to pick up
sealed cartridges said to contain all excess cash and items other than checks
and checks (unless checks are voided pursuant to the Electronic Presentment
Agreement referenced below) that are made available to Approved Courier from the
SSMs and shall deliver them to the Approved Vault Bank pursuant to the Contract.
If instructed by ACE (and approved by the Collateral Agent and the
Administrative Agent) that an Electronic Presentment Agreement has been
executed, Approved Courier shall continue to pick up all voided checks and shall
deliver them to Texas Capital Bank for safekeeping ("Texas Capital") pursuant to
the Contract.

                  (c) The instructions provided by ACE pursuant to this
Paragraph 2 may be revoked at any time by notice to that effect by an authorized
representative of the Collateral Agent given to Approved Courier and/or to the
attention of the Branch Manager or, in his or her absence, an Assistant Branch
Manager, of the Approved Vault Bank and any such oral notice shall be confirmed
in writing by certified mail or express delivery service not later than the
business day next following the date or time such notice is effective.

                  3. By accepting this letter agreement, Approved Courier
represents that the Contract is in full force and effect and that Approved
Courier will not amend the Contract in any manner except in accordance with
paragraph 1(c) hereof. Approved Courier agrees that the Contract will not be
terminated without at least ten (10) days' prior written notice to the
Collateral Agent and prior to any such termination all Property shall be

checks, Texas Capital as set forth in paragraph 2(b) above).

                  This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.

                  Approved Courier covenants and agrees that prior to the date
which is one year and one day (or the then applicable preference period) after
