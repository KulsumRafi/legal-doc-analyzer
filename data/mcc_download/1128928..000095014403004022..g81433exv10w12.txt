                                                                   EXHIBIT 10.12

among FLOWERS FOODS, INC., a Georgia corporation (the "Borrower"), the Lenders
party to the Credit Agreement referred to below (the "Lenders"), SUNTRUST BANK,
as syndication agent (the "Syndication Agent"), and BANKERS TRUST COMPANY, as
administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent" and, together with the
Syndication Agent, the "Agents" and each, an "Agent"). All capitalized terms
used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings
provided such terms in the Credit Agreement referred to below.

                              W I T N E S S E T H :
                              - - - - - - - - - -

            WHEREAS, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Agents are parties to the
Credit Agreement, dated as of March 26, 2001 (as amended, modified, restated
and/or supplemented through, but not including, the date hereof, the "Credit
Agreement");

            WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested, and the Agents and the Lenders
have agreed to, the amendments and waivers provided herein on the terms and
conditions set forth herein;

            NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed:

            1. Section 11 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by amending
the definition of "Test Period" appearing therein by (i) deleting the first
reference to "April 1, 2002" appearing therein and inserting a reference to
"July 1, 2002" in lieu thereof and (ii) deleting the first reference to "March
31, 2001" appearing therein and inserting a reference to "June 30, 2001" in lieu
thereof.

            2. This Amendment is limited as specified and shall not constitute
a modification, acceptance or waiver of any other provision of the Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document.

            3. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts and
by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which
counterparts when executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which
shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A complete set of
counterparts shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

            4. THIS AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.

<PAGE>
            5. This Amendment shall become effective on the date (the "Second
Amendment Effective Date") when the Borrower and the Required Lenders shall have
signed a counterpart hereof (whether the same or different counterparts) and
shall have delivered (including by way of facsimile transmission) the same to
the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office.

            6. In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Amendment, the
Borrower hereby represents and warrants that (i) no Default or Event of Default
exists as of the Second Amendment Effective Date, after giving effect to this
Amendment, and (ii) on the Second Amendment Effective Date, after giving effect
to this Amendment, all representations and warranties contained in the Credit
Agreement and in the other Credit Documents are true and correct in all material
respects (it being understood and agreed that any representation or warranty
which by its terms is made as of a specified date shall be true and correct in
all material respects only as of such specified date).

            7. From and after the Second Amendment Effective Date, all
references in the Credit Agreement and each of the Credit Documents to the
Credit Agreement shall be deemed to be references to the Credit Agreement as
modified hereby. This Amendment shall constitute a Credit Document for all
purposes under the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

                                      * * *
