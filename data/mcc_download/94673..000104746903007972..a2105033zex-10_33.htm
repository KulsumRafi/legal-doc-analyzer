prior agreements, representations and understandings, whether written or oral, between you and StorageTek and between you and any StorageTek Affiliate, as defined by StorageTek. This includes your
Letter Agreement dated July&nbsp;31, 2001 and the two extensions to said Letter Agreement. </FONT></P>
