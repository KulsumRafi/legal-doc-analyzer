court of competent jurisdiction. Claims subject to exclusive final and binding arbitration under this Agreement include, without limitation, claims that otherwise could be tried in court to a jury in

SIZE=2><I>Ongoing Rights and Obligations.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> You acknowledge that the Company and you have ongoing rights and obligations relating to
intellectual property, confidential information and non-competition with the Company, together with fiduciary rights and obligations, which will survive the termination of your employment.
The Company and you agree that nothing in this Agreement shall waive or otherwise preclude any otherwise available right to temporary restraining orders or other injunctive relief for any breach or
threatened breach of any of these obligations. You understand that injunctive relief may include, but shall not be limited to, restraining continuing breaches of such obligations. Any such
injunctive proceedings shall be without prejudice to any rights the Company or you may have under this Agreement to obtain relief in arbitration with respect to such matters. </FONT></P>
