Proceeds, be required to be applied as aforesaid may be transferred by the
Administrative Agent to the Company in which case such proceeds shall be used
for the general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries.

the number of Mandatory Securities ("Defaulted Securities") required to be
purchased by such Defaulting Purchaser which have not been purchased by such
Defaulting Purchaser; provided, however, that for the purposes of determining
the number of Warrants to be issued as Defaulted Securities the Warrant Factor

Interests shall be satisfied. Furthermore, at no time shall the Initial
Purchaser have any obligation to purchase any Securities or participation
interests after the Initial Closing, pursuant to this Agreement or the JPMP
(BHCA) Commitment Agreement if such purchase would cause the aggregate purchase
price payable for all such Securities and participation interests (under both of
the foregoing agreements in the aggregate) to exceed the Purchaser Maximum
Amount (as defined in the JPMP (BHCA) Commitment Agreement).

its debts and other liabilities, contingent obligations and commitments as they

incurring debts or liabilities beyond its ability to pay as such debts and

transaction, and is not about to engage in any business or transaction, for
which its property would constitute unreasonably small capital after giving due
consideration to the prevailing practice in the industry in which the Company is
engaged. In computing the amount of such contingent liabilities at any time, it
is intended that such liabilities will be computed at the amount that, in the
light of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the
amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.

Preferred Shares and the Warrants.

for sales of Purchased Securities and Warrant Shares in limited amounts;

limit the enforceability of any representations made by the Company in any of
the Documents to which it is a party.

7.3      Notice of Transfer.

                  (a)      The holder of any Restricted Securities, by
acceptance thereof agrees, prior to any transfer of any Restricted Securities,
to give written notice to the Company of such holder's intention to effect such
transfer and to comply in all other respects with the provisions of this Section
7.3. Each such notice shall describe the manner and circumstances of the
proposed transfer and shall be accompanied, if reasonably requested by the
Company, by the written opinion, addressed to the Company, of counsel for the
holder of Restricted Securities, as to whether in the opinion of such counsel
(which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
which counsel may be the in-house counsel of such holder) such proposed transfer
involves a transaction requiring registration of such Restricted Securities
under the Securities Act; provided, however, that (i) in the case of a holder of
Restricted Securities which is a partnership or a limited liability company, no
such opinion of counsel shall be necessary for a transfer by such holder of
Restricted Securities to a partner or member of such holder of Restricted
Securities, or a retired partner or member of such holder who retires after the
date hereof, or the estate of any such partner or member or retired partner or
member, if in each case the transferee agrees in writing to be subject to the
terms of this Article VII to the same extent as if such transferee were
originally a signatory to this Agreement, (ii) in the case of a holder of
Restricted Securities which is a corporation, partnership or a limited liability
company, no such opinion of counsel shall be necessary for a transfer by such
holder of Restricted Securities to an Affiliate, officer, director, member or
manager of such entity if in each case the transferee agrees in writing to be
subject to the terms of this Article VII to the same extent as if such
transferee were originally a signatory to this Agreement and (iii) no such
opinion shall be required in connection with a transfer pursuant to Rule 144 (as
amended from time to time) promulgated under the Securities Act (or successor
rule thereto), provided, that the Company, shall be provided with customary
written representations relating to such transaction.

                  (b)      If in the opinion of such counsel (if such opinion is
required hereunder) the proposed transfer of Restricted Securities may be
effected without registration under the Securities Act, the holder of Restricted
Securities shall thereupon

                                       33

<PAGE>

be entitled to transfer Restricted Securities in accordance with the terms of
the notice delivered by it to the Company.

                  (c)      Each certificate or other instrument evidencing the
securities issued upon the transfer of any Restricted Securities (and each
certificate or other instrument evidencing any untransferred balance of such
securities) shall bear the legends set forth in Section 7.2 hereof unless (i) in
the opinion of such counsel registration of future transfer is not required by
the applicable provisions of the Securities Act or (ii) the Company shall have
waived the requirement of such legends; provided, however, that such legend
shall not be required on any certificate or other instrument evidencing the
securities issued upon such transfer in the event such transfer shall be made in
compliance with the requirements of Rule 144 (as amended from time to time)
promulgated under the Securities Act (or successor rule thereto).

7.4      Transfer Pursuant to Rule 144.

         The Company agrees to make publicly available the current information
with respect to the Company that is required by Rule 144(c) under the Securities
Act and otherwise to take any other action or to execute any certificates
necessary to permit a transfer by any holder of Restricted Securities to qualify
for the exemption set forth in Rule 144. Without limiting the foregoing, if such
information is not publicly available, then, upon a holder's request, the
Company will provide such information to such holder or any prospective
purchaser designated by such holder.

7.5      Minimum Transfer

         If the provisions of this Article VII have been complied with, any
Purchaser may transfer Series A Preferred Stock subject to a minimum transfer
amount of 4,000 shares (subject to adjustment for splits, reverse splits and
other like events) until such time as the Purchaser holds less than 4,000
shares, in which case the Purchaser shall not transfer less than all the shares
it holds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Purchaser may transfer fewer than
4,000 shares (subject to adjustment for splits, reverse splits and other like
events) to a transferee that is an investment fund under common control, or
having a common investment manager or advisor, with the transferor (a "Related
Fund"), provided that in determining the number of shares constituting all the
shares held by any Purchaser for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence,
such determination shall be made on an aggregate basis including all shares held
by the Purchaser and all its Related Funds.

         such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could
         be obtained at the time of such transaction in arm's-length dealings
         with a Person who is not such an Affiliate,

                           (ii)     that, in the event such Affiliate

         Transaction (if any such members exist), and

                           (iii)    that, in the event (A) such Affiliate

         ($10,000,000) or (B) if there are no members of the Board having no
         personal stake in such Affiliate Transaction and such Affiliate
         Transaction involves an aggregate amount in excess of five million
         dollars ($5,000,000), have been determined by a nationally recognized
         appraisal, accounting or investment banking firm to be fair, from a
         financial standpoint, to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

                  (b)      The provisions of the foregoing paragraph (a) will
not prohibit:

                           (i)      any payment or distribution permitted to be
         paid pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(i) of the Charter,

         the Board;

                           (iv)     loans or advances to officers, directors or

         any one time,

                           (v)      the payment of reasonable fees to directors
         of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are not employees of the
         Company or its Subsidiaries and other reasonable fees, compensation,
         benefits and indemnities paid or entered into by the Company or its

         Subsidiaries,

         lending or financing, investment, underwriting, placement agent,
         financial advisory or similar services to the Company or its
         Subsidiaries performed after the Initial Closing, provided that the
         terms are no less favorable to the Company or such Restricted
         Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained at
         the time of such transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who
         is not such an Affiliate (as determined in good faith by a majority of
         the members of the Board who do not have a material direct or indirect
         financial interest in or with respect to the transaction being
         considered),

                           (viii)   sales of Capital Stock to Permitted Holders
         approved by a majority of the members of the Board who do not have a
         material direct or indirect financial interest in or with respect to
         the transaction being considered, or

                           (ix)     the existence or performance by the Company
         or any Restricted Subsidiary under any agreement as in effect as of the
         Initial Closing or replacement agreement therefor or any transaction
         contemplated thereby (including pursuant to any amendment thereto or
         replacement agreement therefor) so long as such amendment or
         replacement is not more disadvantageous to the Purchasers in any
         material respect than the original agreement as in effect on the date
         of the Initial Closing.

8.2      Information Rights.

         The Company will furnish to each Significant Holder:

<PAGE>

Subsidiary, or compliance with the terms of any Document, as or any Significant
Holder may reasonably request.

                  (a)      The Company will not consolidate or consummate a
share exchange with, or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or
substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless, on or prior to the
consummation of such transaction, all the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are
redeemed in accordance with the Charter, or unless:

                           (i)      the resulting, surviving or transferee
         Person (the "Successor Company") will be a corporation organized and

         such Successor Company, having in respect of such Successor Company the
         same powers, preferences and relative participating, optional or other
         special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions

         such transaction;

                           (iii)    immediately after giving effect to such
         transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation
         of the Successor Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
         such transaction as having been incurred by the Successor Company or
         such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no default
         or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing under the
         Credit Agreement, the 2000 Notes Indenture or the 2002 Notes Indenture
         and no Event of Non-Compliance shall have occurred and be continuing;

                           (iv)     immediately after giving effect to such
         transaction, the Successor Company would be able to incur an additional
         $1.00 of Indebtedness under Section 4.03(a) of the 2000 Notes Indenture
         as in effect on the date hereof; and

                           (v)      the Company shall have delivered to the
         holders of the Series A Preferred Stock an Officers' Certificate
         stating that such consolidation, share exchange, merger, transfer or
         lease comply with this Section 8.4.

                  (b)      The Successor Company shall succeed to, and be
substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company to the
extent set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of a lease of all or
substantially all its assets, the Company shall not be released from its

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

9.1      Expenses, Etc.

                  (a)      The Company shall pay (i) all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Initial Purchaser, including the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Initial Purchaser,
in connection with the preparation of the Documents or any amendments,
modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) any
stamp or similar taxes which may be determined to be payable in connection with
the execution, delivery or performance of the Documents or any modification,
amendment or alteration of the terms or provisions of the Documents and any
issue taxes in respect of the issuance of any Purchased Securities to the
Purchasers and (iii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Purchasers including reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
for the Purchasers, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its
rights in connection with the Documents, including its rights under this
Section, or in connection with the Purchased Securities, including all such
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or
negotiations in respect of such Securities.

                  (b)      The Company shall indemnify the Purchasers and each
of their respective Affiliates (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee")
against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and related expenses (including, without limitation and as
incurred, reasonable costs of investigating, preparing or defending any such
claim or action, whether or not such Indemnitee is a party thereto), including
the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any
Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in
connection with, or as a result of (i) the Company's execution, delivery or
performance of any Document or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, or (ii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or
proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or
any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to
the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or
any Affiliate of such Indemnitee (or of any officer, director, employee, advisor
or agent of such Indemnitee or any such Indemnitee's Affiliates) or to the
extent such damages constitute special, indirect or consequential damages (as
opposed to direct or actual damages); and provided further that, for the
purposes of the foregoing proviso, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
deemed not to be Affiliates of any Purchaser.

                  (c)      To the extent permitted by applicable law, the
Company shall not assert, and it hereby waives, any claim against any
Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or
punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in
connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any other

                                       40

<PAGE>

Document, the transactions contemplated hereby or the use of the proceeds of the
Purchased Securities

                  (d)      All amounts due under this Section shall be payable
promptly after written demand therefor.

9.2      Further Assurances.

         The Company shall duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly
executed and delivered, at its own cost and expense, such further instruments
and documents and to take all such action, in each case as may be necessary or
proper in the reasonable judgment of the Purchasers to carry out the provisions
and purposes of the Agreement and the other Documents.

9.3      Specific Performance; Remedies.

         Damages in the event of breach of this Agreement or any other Document
by the Company or any Purchaser would be difficult, if not impossible, to
ascertain, and it is therefore agreed that the Company and each Purchaser, in
addition to and without limiting any other remedy or right it may have (other
than the limitations on remedies specified in Section 3.3(b)(viii) of the
Charter), will have the right to an injunction or other equitable relief in any
court of competent jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach, and enforcing
specifically the terms and provisions hereof and thereof, and the Company and
each Purchaser hereby waives any and all defenses it may have on the ground of
lack of jurisdiction or competence of the court to grant such an injunction or
other equitable relief. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section
3.3(b)(viii) of the Charter, the existence of this right to specific performance
will not preclude the Company or any Purchaser from pursuing any other rights
and remedies at law or in equity which the Company or any Purchaser may have.

9.4      Successors and Assigns.

                  (a)      This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of
the Company and the Purchasers and their respective successors, permitted
assigns, heirs and personal representatives. Upon the transfer of any Purchased
Securities in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Stockholders'
Agreement (to the extent that such Purchased Securities are subject to the terms
thereof), the transferee shall be bound by, and entitled to the benefits of,
this Agreement and the Stockholders' Agreement with respect to such transferred
Purchased Securities in the same manner as the transferring Purchaser.

                  (b)      Subject to compliance with the terms and conditions
of the Stockholders' Agreement (to the extent that such Purchased Securities are
subject to the terms thereof), the Initial Purchaser shall be permitted to
assign its rights to receive the Purchased Securities on any Closing Date to SIF
or any of its other Affiliates.

                  (c)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

9.8      Governing Law.

         THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPLES OF
CONFLICTS OF LAWS EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE NEW YORK CONFLICTS OF LAWS
PRINCIPLES WOULD APPLY THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE STATE OF THE COMPANY'S
ORGANIZATION TO INTERNAL MATTERS RELATING TO ENTITIES SUCH AS THE COMPANY
ORGANIZED THEREUNDER).

9.9      Third Party Reliance.

         Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement (i)
are being given by the Company as an inducement to the Purchasers to enter into
this Agreement and the other Documents (and the Company acknowledges that the
Purchasers have expressly relied thereon) and (ii) are solely for the benefit of
the Purchasers, their respective successors and assigns. No third party
(including, without limitation, any holder of capital stock of the Company) or
anyone acting on behalf of any thereof other than the Purchasers, and each of
them and their respective successors and assigns, shall be a third party or
other beneficiary of such representations and warranties. No such third party
shall have any rights of contribution against the Purchasers or the Company with
respect to such representations or warranties or any matter subject to or
resulting in indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise.

9.10     Submission to Jurisdiction.

         Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement may be
brought in the courts of the State of New York and the United States of America
for the Southern District of New York and, by execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company hereby accepts for itself and in respect of its property,
generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. The
Company hereby irrevocably waives, in connection with any such action or
proceeding, any objection, including, without limitation, any objection to the
venue or based on the grounds of forum non conveniens, which it may now or
hereafter have to the bringing of any such action or proceeding in such
respective jurisdictions. The Company hereby irrevocably consents to the service
of process of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding
by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage
prepaid, to it at its address as set forth herein. Nothing herein shall affect
the right of the Purchasers to serve process in any other manner permitted by
law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against the Company in
any other jurisdiction.

9.11     Information.

         Each Purchaser assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself
informed of the Company's and its subsidiaries' financial condition and assets,
and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Loans
and the nature, scope

                                       44

and extent of the risks that each Purchaser assumes and incurs hereunder, and
agrees that no Purchaser will have any duty to advise any other Purchaser of
information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.

9.12     Severability.

         It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this
Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the law and public
policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.
Accordingly, in the event that any provision of this Agreement would be held in
any jurisdiction to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, such
provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating
the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of such provision in any jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not be invalid,
prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

9.13     Independence of Agreements, Covenants, Representations and Warranties.

         All agreements and covenants hereunder shall be given independent
effect so that if a certain action or condition constitutes a default under a
certain agreement or covenant, the fact that such action or condition is
permitted by another agreement or covenant shall not affect the occurrence of
such default, unless expressly permitted under an exception to such initial
covenant. In addition, all representations and warranties hereunder shall be
given independent effect so that if a particular representation or warranty
proves to be incorrect or is breached, the fact that another representation or
warranty concerning the same or similar subject matter is correct or is not
breached will not affect the incorrectness of or a breach of a representation
and warranty hereunder.

9.14     Survival of Representation, Warranties, Etc.

         The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement or any other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement
shall survive the Initial Closing.

9.15     Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures.

         This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each
such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all
such counterparts together shall constitute but one agreement. Facsimile
counterpart signatures to this Agreement shall be acceptable and binding.
