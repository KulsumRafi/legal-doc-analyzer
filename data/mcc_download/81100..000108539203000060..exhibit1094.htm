               Each director of the Company who is a Nonemployee Director at any time during a
               calendar year shall receive a Stock Payment as a portion of the Quarterly
               Retainer payable to such director. The Stock Payment shall be made as soon as
               possible following a fiscal quarter end. The number of shares of Common Stock to
               be issued to each Participant as a Stock Payment shall be determined by dividing
               an amount equal to 50% of the Quarterly Retainer payable to such Participant for
               a fiscal quarter by the Market Price of the Common Stock for the last business
               day of that fiscal quarter; provided, however, that 100% of the Quarterly
               Retainer shall be paid to a Participant as a Stock Payment until such
               Participant owns that number of shares determined by dividing an amount equal to
               the value of two years of Quarterly Retainers (based on the amount of the
               Quarterly Retainer that is being paid for that fiscal quarter) by the Market
               Price of the Common Stock for the last business day of that fiscal quarter;
               provided further, that no fractional shares shall be issued, and in lieu thereof
               the number of shares in the Stock Payment shall be rounded to the nearest whole
               number of shares. Certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
               constituting Stock Payments shall be registered in the respective names of, or
               as directed by, the Participants and shall be issued to each Participant. </FONT></P></TD>
