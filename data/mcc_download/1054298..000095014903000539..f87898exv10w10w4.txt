            This DFP Extension Addendum No. 3, dated as of November 1, 2002 (the
"Addendum"), hereby amends the DART Service Attachment/Agreement for Publishers

1. Effective November 1, 2002, the parties hereby agree that Company's ad

System defaults will be charged as follows:

If System Defaults represent 50% or less of all Your impressions in a
      particular month, Your rate for all System Defaults that month shall equal
      $|*|.

If System Defaults represent greater than 50%, but equal to or less than 60%
      of all Your impressions in a particular month, Your rate for all System
      Defaults that month shall equal $|*|.

If System Defaults represent greater than 60%, but equal to or less than 70%
      of all Your impressions in a particular month, Your rate for all System
      Defaults that month shall equal $|*|.

If System Defaults represent greater than 70%, but equal to or less than 80%
      of all Your impressions in a particular month, Your rate for all System
      Defaults that month shall equal $|*|.

If System Defaults represent greater than 80%, but equal to or less than 90%
      of all Your impressions in a particular month, Your rate for all System
      Defaults that month shall equal $|*|.

If System Defaults represent greater than 90% of all Your impressions in a
      particular month, Your rate for all System Defaults that month shall equal
      $|*|.

However, for the month of December 2002, the system default fees shall be as

      particular month, Your rate for all System Defaults that month shall equal
