                                                                   WARRANT NO. 5

                                     WARRANT

                       TO PURCHASE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

                                       OF

                                  BLUEFLY, INC.

         THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT SFM DOMESTIC INVESTMENTS LLC, or its registered
assigns (the "Holder"), is the owner of the right to subscribe for and to
purchase from BLUEFLY, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), SEVEN
HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO (792) (the "Number Issuable"), fully paid, duly
authorized and non-assessable shares of Common Stock at a price per share equal
to the Current Market Price as of March 17, 2003, which is SEVENTY-EIGHT CENTS
($0.78), (the "Exercise Price"), at any time, in whole or in part, on or after
March 17, 2003 (the "Effective Date") through 5:00 PM New York City time, on
March 17, 2013 (the "Expiration Date") all on the terms and subject to the
conditions hereinafter set forth (the "Warrants").

         The Number Issuable and the Exercise Price are subject to further
adjustment from time to time pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 of this
Warrant Certificate.

         Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the
meanings given to them in Section 12 hereof.

         Section 1. Exercise of Warrants.

            (a) Subject to the last paragraph of this Section 1, the Warrants
evidenced hereby may be exercised, in whole or in part, by the Holder hereof at
any time

<PAGE>

or from time to time, on or after the Effective Date and on or prior to the
Expiration Date upon delivery to the Company at the principal executive office
of the Company in the United States of America, of (A) this Warrant Certificate,
(B) a written notice stating that such Holder elects to exercise the Warrants
evidenced hereby in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1 and
specifying the number of Warrants being exercised and the name or names in which
the Holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to
be issued and (C) payment of the Exercise Price for such Warrants, which shall
be payable by any one or any combination of the following: (i) cash; (ii)
certified or official bank check payable to the order of the Company; (iii) by
the surrender (which surrender shall be evidenced by cancellation of the number
of Warrants represented by any Warrant Certificate presented in connection with
a Cashless Exercise (as defined below)) of a Warrant or Warrants (represented by
one or more relevant Warrant Certificates), and without the payment of the
Exercise Price in cash, in return for the delivery to the surrendering Holder of
such number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of the
Common Stock for which such Warrant is exercisable as of the date of exercise
(if the Exercise Price were being paid in cash or certified or official bank
check) reduced by that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (x) the aggregate Exercise Price (assuming no Cashless
Exercise) to be paid by (y) the Market Price of one Share of Common Stock on the
Business Day which immediately precedes the day of exercise of the Warrant; or
(iv) by the delivery of shares of the Common Stock having a value (as defined by
the next sentence) equal to the aggregate Exercise Price to be paid, that are
either held by the Holder or are acquired in connection with such exercise, and
without payment of the Exercise Price in cash. Any share of Common Stock
delivered as payment for the Exercise Price in connection with an In-Kind
Exercise (as defined below) shall be deemed to have a value equal to the Market
Price of one Share of Common Stock on the Business Day that immediately precedes
the day of exercise of the Warrants. An exercise of a Warrant in accordance with
clause (iii) is herein referred to as a "Cashless Exercise" and an exercise of a
Warrant in accordance with clause (iv) is herein referred to as an "In-Kind
Exercise." The documentation and consideration, if any, delivered in accordance
with subsections (A), (B) and (C) are collectively referred to herein as the
"Warrant Exercise Documentation."

            (b) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of the Warrant Exercise Documentation, the Company
shall deliver or cause to be delivered (A) certificates representing the number
of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock specified
in the Warrant Exercise Documentation, (B) if applicable, cash in lieu of any
fraction of a share, as hereinafter provided, and (C) if less than the full
number of Warrants evidenced hereby are being exercised or used in a Cashless
Exercise, a new Warrant Certificate or Certificates, of like tenor, for the
number of Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate, less the number of
Warrants then being exercised and/or used in a Cashless Exercise. Such exercise
shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of
delivery of the Warrant Exercise Documentation so that the Person entitled to
receive shares of Common Stock upon such exercise shall be treated for all
purposes as having become the record holder of such shares of Common Stock at
such time.


                                       2

            (c) The Company shall pay all expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with and taxes and other governmental charges (other than income
taxes of the Holder) that may be imposed in respect of, the issue or delivery of
any shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants evidenced
hereby. The Company shall not be required, however, to pay any tax or other
charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue of any
certificate for shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Warrant evidenced hereby.

            (d) In connection with the exercise of any Warrants evidenced
hereby, no fractions of shares of Common Stock shall be issued, but in lieu
thereof the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional
interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the Market
Price for one Share of Common Stock on the Business Day which immediately
precedes the day of exercise. If more than one (1) such Warrant shall be
exercised by the holder thereof at the same time, the number of full shares of
Common Stock issuable on such exercise shall be computed on the basis of the
total number of Warrants so exercised.

         Section 2. Certain Adjustments.

            (a) The number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the
exercise of this Warrant and the Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment
as follows:

               (i) Stock Dividends, Subdivision, Combination or Reclassification
of Common Stock. If at any time after the date of the issuance of this Warrant
the Company shall (i) pay a dividend on Common Stock in shares of its capital
stock, (ii) combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number
of shares, (iii) subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock as the case
may be, or (iv) issue by reclassification of its shares of Common Stock any
shares of capital stock of the Company, then, on the record date for such
dividend or the effective date of such subdivision or split-up, combination or
reclassification, as the case may be, the number and kind of shares to be
delivered upon exercise of this Warrant will be adjusted so that the Holder will
be entitled to receive the number and kind of shares of capital stock that such
Holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon or by reason of such
event had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior thereto, and the
Exercise Price will be adjusted as provided below in paragraph 2(a)(v).

               (ii) Extraordinary Distributions. If at any time after the date
of issuance of this Warrant, the Company shall distribute to all holders of
Common Stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a
consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving
corporation and Common Stock is not changed or exchanged) cash, evidences of
indebtedness, securities or other assets (excluding (A) ordinary course cash
dividends to the extent such dividends do not exceed the Company's retained
earnings and (B) dividends payable in shares of capital stock for which
adjustment is made under Section 2(a)(i), or rights, options or warrants to
subscribe for or purchase securities of the Company), then in each such case the
number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered to such Holder upon exercise of
this Warrant


                                       3
<PAGE>

shall be increased so that the Holder thereafter shall be entitled to receive
the number of shares of Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of
shares such Holder would have been entitled to receive immediately before such
record date by a fraction, the denominator of which shall be the Exercise Price
on such record date minus the then fair market value (as reasonably determined
by the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith) of the portion of the
cash, evidences of indebtedness, securities or other assets so distributed or of
such rights or warrants applicable to one share of the Common Stock (provided
that such denominator shall in no event be less than $.01) and the numerator of
which shall be the Exercise Price.

               (iii) Reorganization, etc. If at any time after the date of
issuance of this Warrant any consolidation of the Company with or merger of the
Company with or into any other Person (other than a merger or consolidation in
which the Company is the surviving or continuing corporation and which does not
result in any reclassification of, or change (other than a change in par value
or from par value to no par value or from no par value to par value, or as a
result of a subdivision or combination) in, outstanding shares of either Common
Stock) or any sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company to any other person (each, a "Reorganization Event"),
shall be effected in such a way that the holders of the Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive cash, stock, other securities or assets (whether such cash,
stock, other securities or assets are issued or distributed by the Company or
another Person) with respect to or in exchange for the Common Stock, then, upon
exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive the kind
and amount of cash, stock, other securities or assets receivable upon such
Reorganization Event by a holder of the number of shares of the Common Stock
that such holder would have been entitled to receive upon exercise of this
Warrant had this Warrant been exercised immediately before such Reorganization
Event, subject to adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 2(a). The Company
shall not enter into any of the transactions referred to in this Section
2(a)(iii) unless effective provision shall be made so as to give effect to the
provisions set forth in this Section 2(a)(iii).

               (iv) Carryover. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 2(a), no adjustment shall be made to the number of shares of either
Common Stock to be delivered to the Holder (or to the Exercise Price) if such
adjustment represents less than .05% of the number of shares to be so delivered,
but any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time
and together with the next subsequent adjustment that together with any
adjustments so carried forward shall amount to .05% or more of the number of
shares to be so delivered.

               (v) Exercise Price Adjustment. Whenever the Number Issuable upon
the exercise of the Warrant is adjusted as provided pursuant to this Section
2(a), the Exercise Price per share payable upon the exercise of this Warrant
shall be adjusted by multiplying such Exercise Price immediately prior to such
adjustment by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the Number Issuable
upon the exercise of the Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, and of
which the denominator shall be the Number Issuable immediately thereafter;
provided, however, that the Exercise Price for


                                       4
<PAGE>

each Share of the Common Stock shall in no event be less than the par value of a
share of such Common Stock.

            (b) Notice of Adjustment. Whenever the Number Issuable or the
Exercise Price is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly mail
by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holder, notice of such adjustment
or adjustments setting forth the Number Issuable and the Exercise Price after
such adjustment, setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such
adjustment and setting forth the computation by which such adjustment was made.

         Section 3. No Redemption. The Company shall not have any right to
redeem any of the Warrants evidenced hereby.

         Section 4. Notice of Certain Events. In case at any time or from time
to time (i) the Company shall declare any dividend or any other distribution to
all holders of Common Stock, (ii) the Company shall authorize the granting to
the holders of Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase
any additional shares of stock of any class or any other right, (iii) the
Company shall authorize the issuance or sale of any other shares or rights which
would result in an adjustment to the Number Issuable pursuant to Section
2(a)(i), (ii) or (iii), (iv) there shall be any capital reorganization or
reclassification of Common Stock of the Company or consolidation or merger of
the Company with or into another Person, or any sale or other disposition of all
or substantially all the assets of the Company, or (v) there shall be a
voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company,
then, in any one or more of such cases the Company shall mail to the Holder at
such Holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the Company, as
promptly as practicable but in any event at least 10 days prior to the date on
which the transactions contemplated in Section 2(a)(i), (ii) or (iii) a notice
stating (a) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend, distribution, rights or warrants or, if a record is not to be taken,
the date as of which the holders of record of either Common Stock to be entitled
to such dividend, distribution, rights or warrants are to be determined, or (b)
the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale,
conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become
effective. Such notice also shall specify the date as of which it is expected
that the holders of record of the Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange the
Common Stock for shares of stock or other securities or property or cash
deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger,
sale, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

         Section 5. Certain Covenants. The Company covenants and agrees that all
shares of Capital Stock of the Company which may be issued upon the exercise of
the Warrants evidenced hereby will be duly authorized, validly issued and fully
paid and nonassessable. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep
available for issuance upon the exercise of the Warrants, such number of its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock as will from time to time be
sufficient to permit the exercise of all outstanding Warrants, and shall take
all action required to increase the authorized number of shares of Common Stock
if at any time there shall be insufficient authorized but


                                       5
<PAGE>

unissued shares of Common Stock to permit such reservation or to permit the
exercise of all outstanding Warrants.

         Section 6. Registered Holder. The persons in whose names this Warrant
Certificate is registered shall be deemed the owner hereof and of the Warrants
evidenced hereby for all purposes. The registered Holder of this Warrant
Certificate, in their capacity as such, shall not be entitled to any rights
whatsoever as a stockholder of the Company, except as herein provided.

         Section 7. Transfer of Warrants. Any transfer of the rights represented
by this Warrant Certificate shall be effected by the surrender of this Warrant
Certificate, along with the form of assignment attached hereto, properly
completed and executed by the registered Holder hereof, at the principal
executive office of the Company in the United States of America, together with
an appropriate investment letter and opinion of counsel, if deemed reasonably
necessary by counsel to the Company to assure compliance with applicable
securities laws. Thereupon, the Company shall issue in the name or names
specified by the registered Holder hereof and, in the event of a partial
transfer, in the name of the registered Holder hereof, a new Warrant Certificate
or Certificates evidencing the right to purchase such number of shares of Common
Stock as shall be equal to the number of shares of Common Stock then purchasable
hereunder.

         Section 8. Denominations. The Company covenants that it will, at its
expense, promptly upon surrender of this Warrant Certificate at the principal
executive office of the Company in the United States of America, execute and
deliver to the registered Holder hereof a new Warrant Certificate or
Certificates in denominations specified by such Holder for an aggregate number
of Warrants equal to the number of Warrants evidenced by this Warrant
Certificate.

         Section 9. Replacement of Warrants. Upon receipt of evidence
satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of
this Warrant Certificate and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, upon
delivery of an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Company (in the case of
an insurance company or other institutional investor, its own unsecured
indemnity agreement shall be deemed to be reasonably satisfactory), or, in the
case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation thereof, the Company will
issue a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor for a number of Warrants equal to
the number of Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate.

         Section 10. Governing Law. THIS WARRANT CERTIFICATE SHALL BE CONSTRUED
AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES SHALL BE GOVERNED
BY, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE
