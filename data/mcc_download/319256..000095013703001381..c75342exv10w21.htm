201(2), 301(a) (3), and 401(a) (1)&nbsp;of ERISA. As of the Effective Date of the
Plan, only management employees of all participating employers of the 401(k)

participation by one or more Participants shall cause the Plan to be subject to
Part 2, 3 or 4 of Title I of ERISA, the entire interest of such Participant or
Participants under the Plan shall be immediately paid to such Participant or
Participants or shall otherwise be segregated from the Plan in the discretion

as the Plan Administrator, from time to time, may establish, for each Plan Year
the Account of each Eligible Participant shall be credited with a &#147;Matching
Credit&#148; on the same date Company matching contributions are credited to his
account under the 401(k) Plan for that Plan Year. An individual who is
eligible to participate in the Plan in accordance with subsection 2.1 shall be
an &#147;Eligible Participant&#148; for a Plan Year if he is employed by the Company (or
one of its subsidiaries) on the first day following the close of the Plan Year
and he has made enough before-tax and/or after-tax contributions to the 401(k)
Plan for the Plan Year to be credited with the maximum amount of Company
matching contributions permitted under the 401(k) Plan for such year. An
Eligible Participant&#146;s Matching Credit for each Plan Year shall be equal to the
excess of the total amount of Company matching contributions that would have
been paid under the terms of the 401(k) Plan to the Participant for that Plan
Year had the amount of compensation that could have been taken into account
under the 401(k) Plan been limited to $235,840 rather than $150,000 (or such
other amount as may be prescribed for such Plan Year under section 401(a) (17)
of the Code), over the actual amount of Company matching contributions credited
to the account of such Participant under the 401(k) Plan for such Plan Year.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, effective as of January&nbsp;1, 1996, the
amount of compensation shall include any amounts deferred under the Sears,
Roebuck and Co. Deferred Compensation Plan. Beginning on January&nbsp;1, 1995, an
Eligible Participant shall also include those participants who are

Matching Credits by the &#147;fair market value&#148; of the Company&#146;s common shares
(which is, the closing price of the company&#146;s common shares as reported for
that day or the nearest preceding business day). On the dividend record date
for Company common shares Dividend Equivalents shall be credited to the
Accounts of Participants who have Common Share Units credited to their Accounts
as of the dividend record date, which shall be converted into the number of
Common Share Units which could be purchased with the amount of Dividend
Equivalents so credited in the manner set forth in the preceding sentence.

dividend paid on one of the Company&#146;s common shares on such dividend payment
date.

administrator of the 401(k) Plan while the Participant is alive and will cancel

plan administrator of the 401(k) Plan for the beneficiary designation forms
shall apply to each Participant under this Plan. If a deceased Participant
failed to designate a beneficiary, in accordance with the above procedure, then
the Plan Administrator shall pay the Participant&#146;s benefits under the Plan, as
soon as practicable after the participant&#146;s death, in a lump sum cash payment

Participant or beneficiary is under a legal disability or is in any way
incapacitated so as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, the Plan
Administrator may direct that payment be made to a relative or friend of such
person for his benefit until claim is made by a conservator or other person
legally charged with the care of his person or his estate, and such payment
shall be in lieu of any such payment to such Participant or beneficiary.
Thereafter, any benefits under the Plan to which such Participant or
beneficiary is entitled, shall be paid to such conservator or other person
legally charged with the care of his person or his estate.
