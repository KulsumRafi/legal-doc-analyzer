<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Additional
Compensation" shall mean bonuses and all other cash compensation designated by the Administrative Committee as Deferrable Compensation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Administrative
Committee" shall mean the committee appointed by the Compensation Committee of the Board to administer the Plan. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Base
Salary" shall mean a Participant's annual base salary, excluding bonuses, commissions, incentives and all other remunerations for services rendered to Company and

or "Beneficiaries" shall mean the person or persons, including a trustee, personal representative or other fiduciary, last designated in writing by a

Committee with or without the consent of the previous Beneficiary. No designation of a Beneficiary other than the Participant's spouse shall be valid unless consented to in writing by such spouse. If
there is no such designation, or if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary, then the Participant's surviving spouse shall be the Beneficiary. If there is no surviving spouse to receive any
benefits payable in accordance with the preceding sentence, the duly appointed and currently acting personal representative of the Participant's estate (which shall include either the Participant's
probate estate or living trust) shall be the Beneficiary. In any case where there is no such personal representative of the Participant's estate duly appointed and acting in that capacity within
90&nbsp;days after the Participant's death (or such extended period as the Administrative Committee determines is reasonably necessary to allow such personal representative to be appointed, but not
to exceed 180&nbsp;days after the Participant's death), then Beneficiary shall mean the person or persons who can verify by affidavit or court order to the satisfaction of the Administrative
Committee that they are legally entitled to receive the benefits specified hereunder. In the event any amount is payable under the Plan to a minor, payment shall not be made to the minor, but instead

parent, or (c)&nbsp;if no parent of that person is then living, to a custodian selected by the Administrative Committee to hold the funds for the minor under the Uniform </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants
and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors, and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, claims, or interest in any specific property or assets of the Company. No
assets of the Company shall be held in any way as collateral security for the fulfilling of the obligations of the Company under this Plan. Any and all of the Company's assets shall be, and remain,
the general unpledged, unrestricted assets of the Company. In the event the Company, in its sole discretion, decides to invest in any of the Funds, Participants and Beneficiaries shall have no rights
in or to such investments. The Company's obligation under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of the Company to pay money in the future, and the rights of the
Participants and Beneficiaries shall be no greater than those of unsecured general creditors. It is the intention of the Company that this Plan be unfunded for purposes of the Code and for purposes of
Title 1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). </FONT></P>

distribution or payment (or any part thereof) to or for the benefit of such Participant, Beneficiary or successor in interest in such manner as the Administrative Committee shall direct. </FONT></P>
