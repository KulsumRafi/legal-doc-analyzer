                                        Chief Executive Officer, you will have
                                        ultimate authority to recruit,
                                        reappoint, or terminate executive staff

                                        recommending to the Board the most
                                        appropriate corporate headquarters for
                                        the company. If the board decides to
                                        change the corporate headquarters, Kitty
                                        Hawk will arrange for you to relocate to
                                        that location.

                                             President & Chief Executive Officer

   Term & Termination:                  Your term as President & Chief Executive

                                        Should you be terminated involuntarily
                                        without cause or "constructively
                                        terminated", you would be provided a
                                        severance equal to twelve months' base
                                        salary and benefits for twelve months.
                                        "Constructively terminated" shall mean
                                        for these purposes involuntary removal
                                        from the President, CEO or Board Member
                                        capacity.

   Base Salary:                         $300,000, subject to review on an annual
                                        basis.

   Incentive Compensation               Kitty Hawk will be introducing a new
   (Cash and Equity)                    incentive compensation program for its
                                        top leadership team. As the CEO, you
                                        will participate in a process over the
                                        near-term, with help of professional
                                        compensation consultants, to develop and
                                        secure Board approval for the new
                                        incentive compensation program. Your own
                                        incentive compensation will be governed
                                        by this new program. You have our
                                        assurance that the Board wants this
                                        program and your participation to be
                                        similar to those in place at comparable
                                        public companies.

   Temporary Living:                    Kitty Hawk will cover the reasonable
                                        cost of a rented apartment (including
                                        utilities) in the Dallas area and the
                                        reasonable cost of a rental car until
                                        the earlier of:

                                        o   The sale of your Hawaii condominium
                                            and the relocation of your goods to
                                            Dallas; or
                                        o   The relocation of the Kitty Hawk
                                            corporate headquarters to a new
                                            location.

                                            Should the decision be taken to keep
                                            the corporate headquarters in
                                            Dallas, then you will be expected to
                                            relocate on a permanent basis within
                                            90 days of that decision.

   Travel Expenses:                     Until such a time as you relocate
                                        permanently, Kitty Hawk will cover your
                                        travel expenses to/from Hawaii to attend
                                        to personal matters (e.g., transferring
                                        basic living necessities such as
                                        clothing, selling your property,
                                        completing your participation on the

                                        the Dean Search Committee). Such travel
                                        should not be excessive and should be
                                        undertaken at lowest possible cost. To
                                        the extent that other airline - airline
