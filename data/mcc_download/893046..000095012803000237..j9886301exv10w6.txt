Attn: Chief Executive Officer

Dear Sir:

     Reference is made to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of
December 17, 2002, by and among Rent-A-Center East, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(formerly known as Rent-A-Center, Inc.) ("ACQUIROR"), and Rent-Way, Inc. (the
"COMPANY"), Rent-Way of Michigan, Inc. ("RENT-WAY MICHIGAN") and Rent-Way of
TTIG, L.P. ("TTIG" and, together with Rent-Way Michigan, the "OPERATING
SUBSIDIARIES"), as amended by that certain letter agreement dated December 31,
2002, that certain letter agreement dated January 7, 2003, and that certain
letter agreement dated February 7, 2003 (together, the "ASSET PURCHASE
AGREEMENT"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meaning ascribed to such terms in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

     WHEREAS, the Closing of the transactions contemplated under the Asset
Purchase Agreement occurred as of February 8, 2003; and

     WHEREAS, the parties now desire to alter the original lists of Account
Stores, the real property leases of which shall be retained by the Company and
the Operating Subsidiaries, and Acquired Stores, the real property leases of
which shall be assumed by Acquiror, as set forth herein.

     NOW, THEREFORE, this letter agreement, in accordance with Section 7.4 of
the Asset Purchase Agreement, memorializes the understanding of the parties to
the Asset Purchase Agreement regarding certain post-closing changes thereto and
hereby amends, modifies and supplements the Asset Purchase Agreement as follows:

1.   Return of Chattanooga Store. Acquiror hereby sells, transfers, assigns,
     conveys and delivers to TTIG any and all of those Assets related to the
     Account Store located at 2109 East 23rd Street, Chattanooga, TN (the
     "CHATTANOOGA STORE") and acquired at by Acquiror at Closing, effective as
     of the date hereof, free and clear of all Encumbrances (except for



<PAGE>

     those Encumbrances under Acquiror's senior credit facility, if any, which
     may have attached on February 8, 2003 and which Acquiror covenants it will
     obtain applicable releases if required). TTIG hereby assumes and agrees to
     pay, perform, discharge, and satisfy any and all of those Assumed
     Liabilities related to the Chattanooga Store previously assumed by Acquiror
     at Closing, effective as of the date hereof. Acquiror shall be entitled to
     all income earned in or from the ownership or operation of the Assets
     related to the Chattanooga Store with respect to events occurring prior to
     the date hereof, and TTIG will be entitled to all income earned in or from
     the ownership or operation of the Assets related to the Chattanooga Store
     with respect to events occurring on or after the date hereof. Without
     limiting the generality of the foregoing, all cash receipts received at the
     Chattanooga Store prior to the date hereof shall be the property of
     Acquiror, and all cash receipts received at the Chattanooga Store on or
     after the date hereof shall be the property of TTIG. The parties hereto
     agree to cooperate with each other to ensure that any amounts received are
     delivered to the party entitled to such amounts as provided herein.

2.   Acquisition of Marlow Heights Store.

     (a)  Each of the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries, as the case may
          be, hereby sells, transfers, assigns, conveys and delivers to Acquiror
          all of such entity's right, title and interest in and to those Assets
          related to the store located at 4141 Branch Avenue, Marlow Heights, MD
          (the "MARLOW HEIGHTS STORE"), in each case free and clear of any and
          all Encumbrances, effective as of the date hereof. Acquiror hereby
          acquires the Assets related to the Marlow Heights Store as of the date
          hereof as if the Assets related to the Marlow Heights Store were
          Assets originally acquired under the Asset Purchase Agreement as an
          Acquired Store. The Company and the Operating Subsidiaries, as the
          case may be, shall be entitled to all income earned in or from the
          ownership or operation of the Assets related to the Marlow Heights
          Store with respect to events occurring prior to the date hereof, and
          the Acquiror will be entitled to all income earned in or from the
          ownership or operation of the Assets related to the Marlow Heights
          Store with respect to events occurring on or after the date hereof.
          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all cash receipts
          received at the Stores prior to the date hereof shall be the property
          of the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and
          all cash receipts received at the Stores on or after the date hereof
          shall be the property of the Acquiror. The parties hereto agree to
          cooperate with each other to ensure that any amounts received are
          delivered to the party entitled to such amounts as provided herein.
          All property taxes, rent, utilities and amounts under the real estate
          lease related to the Marlow Heights Store shall be apportioned on an
          accrual basis as of the close of business on the date immediately
          prior to the date hereof between Acquiror, the Company and the
          Operating Subsidiaries such that Acquiror shall be responsible only
          for property taxes, rent, utilities and amounts under the Store Leases
          with respect to periods occurring on or after the date hereof.

     (b)  The Representations and Warranties of the Company and the Operating
          Subsidiaries set forth in Section 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11,

     (c)  As of the date hereof, Acquiror shall hereby assume only those
          liabilities or obligations of a kind or nature, whether absolute,
          contingent, accrued, known or unknown, that are attributable to the
          periods, events or circumstances on or after the date hereof, and
          which arise under, relate to or are in connection with the Assets
          related to the Marlow Heights Store on or after the date hereof.
          Except as specifically set forth in the previous sentence, Acquiror
          shall assume no other liabilities or obligations relating to the
          Assets related to the Marlow Heights Store, including, without
          limitation, those specifically excluded liabilities set forth in
          Section 1.5(b) of the Asset Purchase Agreement as applied to the
          Marlow Heights Store.

     (d)  Acquiror, the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries acknowledge and
          agree that all of the Indemnification provisions set forth in Article
          VIII of the Asset Purchase Agreement shall be deemed to apply with
          equal force to any Indemnity Claims arising or resulting from and to
          the extent they are attributable to the Marlow Heights Store as if the
          Marlow Heights Store was originally an Acquired Store and acquired as
          of the Closing Date under the Asset Purchase Agreement.

3.   New Acquired Stores.

     (a)  Each of the Company and the Operating Subsidiaries, as the case may
          be, hereby sells, transfers, assigns, conveys and delivers to Acquiror
          and the Subsidiary Transferees, as the case may be, all of such
          entity's right, title and interest in and to the real estate leases
          (and fixtures related thereto) (the "ACCOUNT STORE LEASES") related to
          the Stores set forth in this Section 3(a) below, such Stores having
          been previously designated as Account Stores under the Asset Purchase
          Agreement, in each case free and clear of any and all Encumbrances,
          effective as of the date hereof. Acquiror and the Subsidiary
          Transferees, as the case may be, will acquire the Account Store Leases
          as of the date hereof under the same terms and subject to the same
          exceptions (including those set forth in Section 1.5 of the Asset
          Purchase Agreement) as if the Account Store Leases related to the New
          Acquired Stores were Assets originally acquired under the Asset
          Purchase Agreement, effective as of the date hereof.
