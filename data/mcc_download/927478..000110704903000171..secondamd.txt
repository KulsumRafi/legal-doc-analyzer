            FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, COMMUNITY BANKSHARES, INC., a

receivership, or other court proceedings.

            This Note renews and replaces the Revolving Credit Note referred to
in the Prior Loan Agreement. Reference is hereby made to the Prior Loan
Agreement for rights and obligations of payment and prepayment, collateral
security, Events of Default and the rights of acceleration of the maturity
