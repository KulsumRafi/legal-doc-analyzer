                                                                   EXHIBIT 10.12

                          AMENDMENT OF INSTALLMENT NOTE

     THIS  AMENDMENT  OF  INSTALLMENT  NOTE  (this  "Amendment")  is  made as of
February 5, 2003, by and between COLOR  IMAGING,  INC.  ("Obligor"),  a Delaware
corporation,  successor by merger to Color Image,  Inc., a Georgia  corporation,
and  SOUTHTRUST  BANK ("Bank"),  an Alabama  banking  corporation,  successor by
conversion to SouthTrust Bank, National Association, as follows:

     Recitals.  Obligor  is  obligated  to Bank under an  Installment  Note (the
"Note")  dated as of June 24,  1999,  in the  original  principal  amount of One
Million Seven Hundred Fifty-Two Thousand Dollars ($1,752,000).  Obligor and Bank
desire to amend the interest rate and payment schedule set forth in the Note.

     NOW THEREFORE,  FOR AND IN  CONSIDERATION  OF TEN DOLLARS ($10), the mutual
agreements  set forth  herein and other  good and  valuable  consideration,  the
receipt  and  sufficiency  of which are hereby  acknowledged,  Obligor and Bank,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

     1. Recitals;  Definitions.  The foregoing  provisions and recitals are true
and correct and are hereby  incorporated herein by this reference as an integral
part hereof.  All  capitalized  terms  utilized  herein,  not defined herein but
defined in the Note shall have the definitions ascribed thereto in the Note.

     2.  Interest  Rate.  The section of the Note  entitled  "Interest  Rate" is
hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

     "INTEREST RATE The above-stated sum shall accrue interest as follows:

          Interest  shall accrue on the  above-stated  sum through and including
          maturity (whether by acceleration,  notice of prepayment or otherwise)
          at the per annum rate equal to the "LIBOR Rate" defined below plus 250
          basis points (one hundred  [100] basis points equals one percent [1%])
          . "LIBOR  Rate," as used  herein,  means a per annum rate of  interest
          (rounded upwards, if necessary,  to the nearest 1/16th of one percent)
          equal to the "London  Interbank  Offered Rate  (LIBOR)" for  contracts
          with a maturity date of thirty (30) days, as quoted in the MONEY RATES
          section of The Wall Street Journal as effective for contracts  entered
          into on the first day of the applicable  interest period (expressed as
          a decimal). The applicable LIBOR Rate shall be initially calculated on



<PAGE>

          the  date  hereof  and  shall  be   recalculated  by  Holder  on  each
          regularly-scheduled payment date thereafter, notwithstanding that such
          recalculation  date is more or less  than  thirty  (30)  days from the
          previous  calculation date. If the recalculation  date falls on a date
          upon which Holder is not open for business,  the  recalculation  shall
          occur on the next business day on which Holder is open for business."

     3. Payment Schedule. The section of the Note entitled "Payment Schedule" is
hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

     "PAYMENT SCHEDULE The above-stated principal sum and interest thereon shall
     be paid as follows:

               "Principal  shall  be  due  and  payable  in  consecutive   equal
               installments  each in the amount of  $23,716.35  beginning on the
               24th day of February,  2003,  and  continuing  on the same day of
               each month thereafter, through and including May 24, 2006, and in
               a final  installment equal to the unpaid principal amount of this
               Note,  which shall be due and payable on June 24,  2006.  Accrued
               interest on the unpaid amount shall be due and payable in full on
               each  date  on  which  an  installment  of  principal  is due and
               payable."

     4. General Provisions.

          (a) Legal Counsel.  Obligor acknowledges and agrees that legal counsel
to Bank does not  represent  Obligor as  Obligor's  attorney,  that  Obligor has
retained (or has had an opportunity to retain) counsel of its own choice and has
not and will not rely upon any advice  from  Bank's  counsel.  In no event shall
Obligor's reimbursement of expenses pursuant to this Amendment (even if effected
by payment  directly by Obligor to Bank's  counsel) be deemed to  establish  any
attorney-client relationship between Obligor and Bank's counsel.

          (b) No Waiver.  The execution and delivery of this  Amendment does not
constitute, and shall not be construed as, a waiver by Bank of any default under
any  document,  agreement  or  instrument.  No delay or  omission of Bank or any
subsequent  holder of the  obligations of Obligor to Bank to exercise any right,
remedy,  power or  privilege  after  the  occurrence  of such  default  shall be
construed as a waiver of any such default, or acquiescence therein.

          (c) Headings. The headings of the articles,  sections,  paragraphs and
subdivisions of this Amendment are for convenience of reference only, are not to
be considered a part hereof,  and shall not limit or otherwise affect any of the
terms hereof.

                                       2

          (d)  Reaffirmation;  No Novation.  Obligor reaffirms and restates each
and every  provision of the Note, as amended by this  Amendment.  This Amendment
shall  not  constitute  a  novation  of the Note or the  indebtedness  evidenced
thereby.

          (e) Continuing  Obligation;  Benefits.  This  Amendment,  and each and
every provision hereof, is a continuing obligation and shall (i) be binding upon
each  of  the  parties  hereto  and  their  respective  heirs,  representatives,
successors  and assigns,  and (ii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties hereto and their respective heirs,  representatives,  successors and
assigns; provided, that Obligor may not assign all or any part of or interest in
this Amendment  without the prior written consent of Bank,  which consent may be
granted or withheld in the sole discretion of Bank.

          (f) Controlling Law. This Amendment shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia.

          (g)  Miscellaneous.  This  Amendment  may not be varied,  altered,  or
amended except by a written instrument  executed by an authorized officer of the
Bank.  This  Amendment  may be executed in any number of  counterparts,  each of
which, when executed and delivered,  shall be an original, but such counterparts
shall  together  constitute one and the same  instrument.  Any provision in this
Amendment  which  may be  unenforceable  or  invalid  under  any  law  shall  be
ineffective  to the  extent  of  such  unenforceability  or  invalidity  without
affecting the enforceability or validity of any other provisions hereof.

          (h) Loan Documents.  From and after the date hereof, all references to
the Note in any other agreement or instrument  shall hereafter mean and refer to
the Note as amended by this Amendment.

          (j)  Representation  and  Warranty.   Obligor,   and  the  individuals
executing  this  Amendment on behalf of Obligor,  represent  and warrant to Bank
that (a)  Obligor is in  existence  and in good  standing  under the laws of the
states of Delaware and Georgia,  (b) the  Articles of  Incorporation  of Obligor
have  not been  amended  or  terminated  since  November  1,  2001,  and (c) the
execution and delivery of this Amendment  have been  authorized by all requisite
corporate action by and on behalf of Obligor.
