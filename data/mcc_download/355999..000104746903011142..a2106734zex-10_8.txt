     all proceeds (including, without limitation, whatever is received upon the
     sale, exchange, collection or other disposition of the foregoing and all
     "proceeds" as defined in Section 9-102 of the UCC as in effect in the State
     of New York) thereof, including all Recoveries relating thereto;

                  (b)   The Company hereby transfers, assigns, sets over and
otherwise conveys to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders, and grants to
the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders, a first priority perfected security
interest in, all its right, title and interest in, to and under the following:
each Receivables Sale Agreement and the Servicing Agreement, including in
respect of each such agreement, (A) all property assigned thereunder and all
rights of the Company to receive monies due and to become due under or pursuant
to such agreement, whether payable as fees, expenses, costs or otherwise, (B)
all rights of the Company to receive proceeds of any insurance, indemnity,
warranty or guaranty with respect to such agreement, (C) claims of the Company
for damages arising out of or for breach of or default under such agreement, (D)
the right of the Company to amend, waive or terminate such agreement, to perform
thereunder and to compel performance and otherwise exercise all remedies
thereunder, (E) all other rights, remedies, powers,

                                       30
<Page>

privileges and claims of the Company under or in connection with such agreement
(whether arising pursuant to such agreement or otherwise available to the
Company at law or in equity), including the rights of the Company to enforce
such agreement and to give or withhold any and all consents, requests, notices,
directions, approvals, extensions or waivers under or in connection therewith
and (F) all monies due or to become due and all amounts received with respect to
the items listed in clauses (A) through (F) and all proceeds (including, without
limitation, whatever is received upon the sale, exchange, collection or other
disposition of the foregoing and all "proceeds" as defined in Section 9-102 of
the UCC as in effect in the State of New York) thereof, including all Recoveries
relating thereto (all of the foregoing set forth in subclauses (A)-(F),
inclusive, the "TRANSFERRED AGREEMENTS");

Such property described in the foregoing paragraphs (a) and (b), together with
all investments and all monies on deposit in any other bank account or accounts
maintained for the benefit of any Holders for payment to Holders shall
constitute the assets of the Trust (the "TRUST ASSETS").

          Subject to Section 5.9, although it is the intent of the parties to
this Agreement that the conveyance of the Company's right, title and interest
in, to and under the Receivables and the other Trust Assets described in
paragraph (a) pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute either a purchase and
sale or a loan, in the event that such conveyance is deemed to create a loan
this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law in
favor of the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders. For this purpose and
without being in derogation of the parties' intent stated in the immediately
preceding sentence, the Company hereby grants to the Trustee, for the benefit of
the Holders, a perfected first priority security interest in all of the
Company's present and future right, title and interest in, to and under the
Receivables and such other Trust Assets to secure the payment of the applicable
Invested Amounts, interest thereon and the other fees and expenses and other
amounts due to the Trustee and the Holders.

                  (c)   The assignment, set over and conveyance to the Trust
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) shall be made to the Trustee, on behalf of the Trust,
and each reference in this Agreement to such assignment, set over and conveyance
shall be construed accordingly. In connection with the foregoing assignment,
except as expressly provided otherwise in the Transaction Documents, the Company
and the Servicer agree to deliver to the Trustee each Trust Asset (including any
original documents or instruments included in the Trust Assets as are necessary
to effect such assignment) in which the transfer of an interest is perfected
under the UCC or otherwise solely by possession and not by filing a financing
statement or similar document.

                                       31
<Page>

          Notwithstanding the assignment of the Transferred Agreements set forth
in Section 2.1(b), the Company does not hereby assign or delegate any of its
duties or obligations under the USFS Receivables Sale Agreement to the Trust or
the Trustee and neither the Trust nor the Trustee accepts such duties or
obligations, and the Company shall continue to have the right and the obligation
to purchase Receivables from USFS from time to time. The foregoing assignment,
set-over and conveyance does not constitute and is not intended to result in a
creation or an assumption by the Trust, the Trustee, any Investor
Certificateholder or the Company, in its capacity as a Holder, of any obligation
of the Servicer, USFS, the Company, any Seller or any other Person in connection
with the Receivables or under any agreement or instrument relating thereto,
including, without limitation, any obligation to any Obligor.

          In connection with such assignment, the Company agrees to record and
file, at its own expense, any financing statements (and continuation statements
with respect to such financing statements when applicable) or, where applicable,
registrations in the appropriate records, (i) with respect to the Receivables
now existing and hereafter created, including those conveyed to it pursuant to
the USFS Receivables Sale Agreement and (ii) with respect to any other Trust
Assets a security interest in which may be perfected under the relevant UCC,
legislation or similar statute by such filing or registration, as the case may
be, in each case meeting the requirements of applicable law in such manner and
in such jurisdictions as are necessary to perfect and maintain perfection of the
assignment of the Receivables and such other Trust Assets to the Trust, and to
deliver a file-stamped copy or certified statement of such financing statement
or registration or other evidence of such filing or registration to the Trustee
on or prior to the date of issuance of any Certificates. The Trustee shall be
under no obligation whatsoever to file such financing statement, or a
continuation statement to such financing statement, or to make any other filing
or other registration under the UCC, other relevant legislation or similar
statute in connection with such transfer. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on the filings or registrations made by or on behalf of the Company
without any independent investigation and the Company's obligation to make such
filings as evidence that such filings have been made.

          In connection with such assignment, the Company further agrees, at its
own expense, on or prior to the Initial Closing Date to indicate, or to cause to
be indicated, in its computer files containing its master database of
Receivables and to cause USFS and each Seller to indicate in its records
containing its master database of Receivables that Receivables have been
conveyed to USFS or Company, as the case may be, pursuant to the applicable
Receivables Sale Agreement or conveyed to the Trust for the benefit of the
Holders pursuant to this Agreement.

          Section 2.3   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY RELATING
TO THE COMPANY. The Company hereby represents and warrants to the Trustee and
the Trust, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates of each Outstanding
Series, as of the Closing Date and as of the Issuance Date of such Series, that:

                  (a)   ORGANIZATIONAL EXISTENCE: COMPLIANCE WITH LAW;
GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS. The Company (i) is a limited liability company duly
formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the Cayman

where the failure to comply would not reasonably be expected to have a Material

Transaction Documents or its memorandum and articles of association.

                  (b)   ORGANIZATIONAL POWER: AUTHORIZATION. The Company has the
requisite power and authority, and the legal right, to execute, deliver and

necessary to perfect the Company's or the Trust's interest in the Trust Assets,
(iii) those that may be required under state securities or "blue sky" laws in
connection with the offering or sale of certificates and (iv) those the failure
of which to obtain or make would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. This Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which the
Company is a party have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the
Company.

                  (c)   ENFORCEABILITY. This Agreement and each of the other
Transaction Documents to which the Company is a party (i) constitute the legal,
valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against it in
accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,

at law or in equity) and (ii) are effective and all action has been taken to
cause compliance with paragraph (n) of the definition of Eligible Receivables.

                  (d)   NO LEGAL BAR. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Company is a
party will not violate any Requirement of Law, and will not result in, or
require, the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than Liens contemplated
or permitted hereby) on any of its properties or revenues pursuant to any such
Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation.

                  (e)   NO MATERIAL LITIGATION. There are no actions, suits,
investigations or proceedings at law or in equity (including, without
limitation, injunctions, writs or restraining orders) by or before any
arbitrator, court or Governmental Authority now pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any material
properties, revenues or rights of the Company which (i) involve this Agreement
or any of the other Transaction Documents or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or (ii) could, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The transactions
contemplated hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not violate any
Requirement of Law.

                  (f)   NO DEFAULT. The Company is not in default under or with
respect to any of its Contractual Obligations. No Early Amortization Event or
Potential Early Amortization Event has occurred and is continuing.

                  (g)   TAX RETURNS. The Company has filed or caused to be filed
all Federal and all other tax returns which are required to have been filed by
it and has paid or caused to be paid all taxes shown thereon to be due and
payable, and

                                       34
<Page>

any material assessments made against it or any of its property. No tax Lien has
been filed, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no material claim is being
asserted, with respect to any such taxes. For purposes of this paragraph,
"taxes" shall mean any present or future tax, levy, impost, duty, charge,
assessment or fee of any nature (including interest, penalties and additions
thereto) that is imposed by any Governmental Authority.

                  (h)   LOCATION OF RECORDS: CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICE. The offices
at which the Company keeps its records concerning the Receivables either (x) are
located at the addresses set forth on Schedule II of the USSC Receivables Sale
Agreement or (y) have been reported to the Trustee in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.8(1) of this Agreement. The chief executive office and
principal place of business of the Company is located at one of the addresses
set forth on Schedule 4, the Company's jurisdiction of organization is the
Cayman Islands and the place where the Company is "located" for the purposes of
Section 9-307 of the UCC is the State of Illinois. The Company's organizational
identification number assigned to it by its jurisdiction of organization in the
Cayman Islands is CR-80735 and the Company's legal name is "USS Receivables
Company, Ltd.". The Company has not, within the period of twelve months prior to
the date of the Original Agreement, (i) changed the location of its principal
place of business and chief executive office, its legal name or its
organizational structure, (ii) changed its "location" (within the meaning of
Section 9-307 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) or (iii) become a "new
debtor" (as defined in Section 9-102(a)(56) of the UCC of all applicable
jurisdictions) with respect to a currently effective security agreement
previously entered into by any other Person. The Company is a Cayman Islands
limited liability company and has not changed its jurisdiction of organization.

                  (i)   SOLVENCY. Both prior to and after giving effect to the
transactions occurring on each Issuance Date, (i) the fair value of the assets
of the Company at a fair valuation will exceed the debts and liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, of the Company; (ii) the present fair
salable value of the property of the Company will be greater than the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of the Company on its
debts and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such
debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; (iii) the Company will be
able to pay its debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as
such debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (iv) the Company
will not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the business in
which it is engaged as such business is now conducted and is proposed to be
conducted. For all purposes of clauses (i) through (iv) above, the amount of
contingent liabilities at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in the
light of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the
amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.
The Company does not intend to, nor does it believe that it will,

                                       35
<Page>

incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature, taking into
account the timing of and amounts of cash to be received by it and the timing of
and amounts of cash to be payable in respect of its Indebtedness.

                  (j)   NOT A HOLDING COMPANY OR AN INVESTMENT COMPANY. Each of
the Company and the Trust is not a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company"
of a "holding company" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended, or any successor statute. Each of the Company and the
Trust is not and, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
will not be required to be registered as, an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or any successor
statute.

                  (k)   OWNERSHIP, SUBSIDIARIES. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Company are owned, legally and beneficially, by USFS
or a nominee for USFS, free and clear of any Lien, other than any Lien in favor
of the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement. The Company will remain
at all times a two-member limited liability company and USFS will not transfer
its ownership interest in the Company at any time (except to a nominee who is an
independent director of the Company). The Company has no Subsidiaries.

                  (l)   NAMES. The legal name of the Company is as set forth in
this Agreement. The Company has not had, nor does it have, any trade names,
fictitious names, assumed names or "doing business as" names.

                  (m)   LIABILITIES. Other than, (i) the liabilities,
commitments or obligations (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise)
arising under or in respect of the Transaction Documents and (ii) immaterial
amounts due and payable in the ordinary course of business of a special-purpose
company, the Company does not have any liabilities, commitments or obligations
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise), whether due or to become
due.

                  (n)   USE OF PROCEEDS; FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REGULATION. No
proceeds of the issuance of any Investor Certificates will be used by the
Company to purchase or carry any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as in effect from time to
time). The Company is in compliance with all applicable regulations of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (including, without limitation,
Regulation U and with respect to "margin stock").

                  (o)   COLLECTION PROCEDURES. The Company, USFS and each Seller
have in place procedures pursuant to the Transaction Documents which are either
necessary or advisable to ensure the timely collection of Receivables,

                                       36
<Page>

including, without limitation, those procedure necessary to comply with Sections
2.7(f) and 2.7(h) of this Agreement.

Servicing Agreement have at all times been satisfied and duly performed in all
material respects. The names and addresses of all Lockbox Processors, together

jurisdictions) of any Lockbox or Lockbox Account or of the Collection Account or
the Securities Account, or the right to take dominion and control or "control"
(within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions)
of any such Lockbox or Lockbox Account or of the Collection Account or the
Securities Account at a future time or upon the occurrence of a future event.
The Company has taken all steps necessary to ensure that the Trustee has
"control" (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC of all applicable
jurisdictions) over all Lockboxes and Lockbox Accounts, the Collection Account
and the Securities Account. Each Lockbox Agreement to which the Company is party
is in full force and effect and each Lockbox Account set forth in Schedule III
to the USSC Receivables Sale Agreement, the Collection Account and the
Securities Account are free and clear of any Lien (other than any right of
set-off expressly provided for in the applicable Lockbox Agreement).

                  (q)   NO CONFLICT. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the USFS Receivables Sale Agreement, the performance of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the issuance of the Certificates)

transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the fulfillment of or terms
hereof and thereof, have been obtained.

                  (s)   BULK SALES. The execution, delivery and performance of

to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents, or (C) the
collectibility of the Receivables generally or any material portion of the
Receivables.

                  (u)   ACCURACY OF INFORMATION. All information furnished on or
after January 1, 2003 by the Company or any of its Affiliates to the Trustee,
any Agent or any Holder for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement,
any of the other Transaction Documents or any transaction contemplated hereby or
thereby is, and all such information hereafter furnished by the Company or any
of its Affiliates to the Trustee, any Agent or any Holder will be, true and
accurate in every material respect on the date such information is stated or
certified and does not and will not contain any material misstatement of fact or
omit to state a material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements
contained therein not misleading.

          The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 2.3 shall
survive after the date made and the transfer and assignment of the Trust Assets
to the Trust. Upon discovery by a Responsible Officer of the Company or the
Servicer or by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of a breach of any of the
foregoing representations and warranties with respect to any Outstanding Series
as of the Issuance Date of such Series, the party discovering such breach shall
give prompt written notice to the other parties and to each Agent with respect
to all Outstanding Series. The Trustee's obligations in respect of any breach
are limited as provided in Section 8.2(g).

          Section 2.4   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY RELATING
TO THE RECEIVABLES. The Company hereby represents and warrants to the Trustee
and the Trust, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates of each
Outstanding Series, (x) as of the Closing Date, and (y) with respect to each
Receivable transferred to the Trust after the Closing Date, as of the related
Receivables Purchase Date, unless, in either case, otherwise stated in the
applicable Supplement or unless such representation or warranty expressly
relates only to a prior date, that:

                                       38
<Page>

                  (a)   [Intentionally Omitted].

                  (b)   Each Receivable existing on the Initial Closing Date or,
in the case of Receivables transferred to the Trust after the Initial Closing
Date, on the date that each such Receivable shall have been transferred to the
Trust, has been conveyed to the Trust free and clear of any Lien.

                  (c)   On the Initial Closing Date, each Receivable transferred
to the Trust that was included in the calculation of the initial Aggregate
Receivables Amount was an Eligible Receivable and, in the case of Receivables
transferred to the Trust after the Initial Closing Date, on the date such
Receivable shall have been transferred to the Trust, each such Receivable that
is included in the calculation of the Aggregate Receivables Amount on such date
is an Eligible Receivable. Each Receivable classified as an "ELIGIBLE
RECEIVABLE" by the Company in any document or report delivered hereunder
satisfies the requirements of eligibility contained in the definition of
Eligible Receivable.

                  (d)   The Company has made an election to be treated as a
disregarded entity for United States federal income tax purposes.

                  (e)   The representations and warranties of USFS in the USFS
Receivables Sale Agreement are true and correct in all material respects.

                  (f)   Each Receivable, together with any contract, instrument
and/or agreement with respect thereto, is the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the related Obligor thereon, enforceable against such Obligor to
pay the full Principal Amount thereof (and any accrued interest thereon) in
accordance with its terms.

                  (g)   Each Receivable, together with any contract, instrument
and/or agreement related thereto, does not contravene any applicable law, rule
or regulation (including, without limitation, laws, rules or regulations
relating to truth in lending, fair credit billing, fair credit reporting, equal
credit opportunity, fair debt collection practices or privacy), which in any way
renders such Receivable (or any contract, instrument and/or agreement related
thereto) unenforceable or would otherwise impair in any material respect the
collectibility of such Receivable.

                  (h)   The Company has complied in all material respects with
the applicable Policies with regard to each Receivable and the related
contracts, instruments and/or agreements, and has not made any material change
to the Policies, except in accordance with Section 2.8(j).

                  (i)   The Company has determined that, immediately after
giving effect to each transfer to the Trust hereunder, the Aggregate Receivables
Amount is at least equal to the Aggregate Target Receivables Amount.

                                       39
<Page>

                  (j)   PAYMENTS TO USFS. With respect to each Receivable
transferred to the Company under the USFS Receivables Sale Agreement, the
Company has given reasonably equivalent value to USFS in consideration therefor
and such transfer was not made for or on account of an antecedent debt. No
transfer by USFS of any Receivable under the USFS Receivables Sale Agreement is
or may be voidable under any section of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.

          The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 2.4 shall
survive after the date made and the transfer and assignment of the Trust Assets
to the Trust. Upon discovery by a Responsible Officer of the Company or the
Servicer or a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of a breach of any of the
representations and warranties with respect to each Outstanding Series as of the
Issuance Date of such Series, the party discovering such breach shall give
prompt written notice to the other parties and to each Agent with respect to all
Outstanding Series. The Trustee's obligations in respect of any breach are
limited as provided in Section 8.2(g).

          Section 2.5   TRANSFER OF INELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES.

                  (a)   TRANSFER OBLIGATION. If (i) any representation or
warranty under Sections 2.4(a), (b) or (c) is not true and correct in any
material respect as of the date specified therein with respect to any Receivable
transferred to the Trust, (ii) there is a breach of any covenant under Section
2.8(c) with respect to any Receivable and such breach has a material adverse
effect on the Certificateholders' Interest in such Receivable, (iii) the Trust's
interest in any Receivable is not a first priority perfected ownership or
security interest at any time as a result of any action taken by, or any failure
to take action by, the Company, (iv) there is a breach of any covenant under
Section 2.8(p) or (v) any Dilution Adjustment is made (any Receivable as to
which the conditions specified in any of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (v) of this
Section 2.5(a) exists is referred to herein as an "INELIGIBLE RECEIVABLE") then,
upon the earlier (the date on which such earlier event occurs, the "TRANSFER
OBLIGATION DATE") of the discovery by the Company of any such event which
continues unremedied or receipt by the Company of written notice given by the
Trustee or the Servicer of any such event which continues unremedied (but in the
case of clause (iv), in no event later than 2 Business Days after such event
occurs), the Company shall become obligated to deposit or cause to be deposited
into the Collection Account the Transfer Deposit Amount with respect to such

remedy the breach under Section 2.8(p), deposit or cause to be deposited in the
Collection Account in immediately available funds on the Business Day following
the related Transfer Obligation Date an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the
amount by which the Aggregate Target Receivables Amount exceeds the Aggregate
Receivables Amount (after giving effect to the reduction thereof by the
Principal Amount of such Ineligible Receivable) and (y) the aggregate
outstanding Principal Amount of each such Ineligible Receivable (the "TRANSFER
DEPOSIT AMOUNT"). Upon transfer or deposit of the Transfer Deposit Amount, the
Trust shall automatically and without further action be deemed to transfer,
assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Company, without recourse,
representation or warranty, all the right, title and interest of the Trust in
and to such Ineligible Receivable, all monies due or to become due with respect
thereto and all proceeds thereof; and such transferred Ineligible Receivable
shall be treated by the Trust as collected in full as of the date on which it
was transferred. The Trustee shall execute such documents and instruments of
transfer or assignment prepared by and at the expense of the Company and take
such other actions as shall reasonably be requested by the Company to effect the
conveyance of such Receivables pursuant to this Section 2.5(b) free and clear of
the lien of this Agreement and all other liens created by the Trustee. Except as
otherwise specified in any Supplement, the obligation of the Company to deposit
or cause to be deposited the Transfer Deposit Amount with respect to any
Ineligible Receivable shall constitute the sole remedy respecting the event
giving rise to such obligation available to Investor Certificateholders (or the
Trustee on behalf of Investor Certificateholders).

          Section 2.6   PURCHASE OF INVESTOR CERTIFICATEHOLDERS' INTEREST IN
TRUST PORTFOLIO. (a) Upon the actual knowledge of a breach of any of the
representations and warranties set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d),
(e)(i) or (q) of Section 2.3, which breach has a material adverse effect on the
interests of the holders of an Outstanding Series (without giving effect to any
Enhancement) under or with respect to the Transaction Documents, then the
Trustee, at the written direction of holders evidencing more than 50% of the
Invested Amount of such Outstanding Series, subject to Section 8.2 hereof, shall
notify the Company to purchase such Outstanding Series and the Company shall be
obligated to make such purchase on the next Distribution Date occurring at least
five Business Days after receipt of such notice on the terms and conditions set
forth in Section 2.6(b) below; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such purchase shall be
required to be made if, by such Distribution Date, the representations and
warranties contained in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)(i) or (q) of Section
2.3 shall be satisfied in all material respects and any material adverse effect
on the holders of such Outstanding Series caused thereby shall have been cured.

                  (b)   As required under Section 2.6(a) above, the Company
shall deposit into the Collection Account for credit to the applicable
subaccount of

                                       41

the Collection Account on the Business Day preceding such Distribution Date an
amount equal to the purchase price (as described in the next succeeding
sentence) for the Certificateholders' Interest for such Outstanding Series on
such day. The purchase price for any such purchase will be equal to (i) the
Adjusted Invested Amount of such Outstanding Series on the date on which the
purchase is made plus (ii) an amount equal to all interest accrued but unpaid on
such Series up to the Distribution Date on which the distribution of such
deposit is scheduled to be made pursuant to Section 9.2 plus (iii) any other
amount required to be paid in connection therewith pursuant to any Supplement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the entire amount of
the purchase price deposited in the Collection Account shall be distributed to
the related Investor Certificateholders on such Distribution Date pursuant to
Section 9.2. If the Trustee gives notice directing the Company to purchase the
Certificates of an Outstanding Series as provided above, except as otherwise
specified in any Supplement, the obligation of the Company to purchase such
Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall constitute the sole remedy
respecting an event of the type specified in the first sentence of this Section
2.6 available to the applicable Investor Certificateholders (or the Trustee on
behalf of such Investor Certificateholders).

                                  SERIES 2003-1

          Section 3.1   ESTABLISHMENT OF COLLECTION ACCOUNT; CERTAIN
ALLOCATIONS. (a) The Servicer, for the benefit of the Holders as their interests
appear in this Agreement, shall cause to be established and maintained in the
name of the Company with an Eligible Institution or with the corporate trust
department of the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee, a segregated trust
account (the "COLLECTION ACCOUNT"), bearing a designation clearly indicating
that the funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of the Holders.
Schedule 2, which is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement,
identifies the Collection Account by setting forth the account number of such
account, the account designation of such account and the name of the institution
with which such account has been established. The Collection Account shall be
divided into individual subaccounts for each Outstanding Series (each,
respectively, a "SERIES COLLECTION SUBACCOUNT" and, collectively, the "SERIES
COLLECTION SUBACCOUNTS") and for the Company (the "COMPANY COLLECTION
SUBACCOUNT").

                  (b)   AUTHORITY OF THE TRUSTEE IN RESPECT OF THE COLLECTION

Collection Account, including the Series Collection Subaccounts and any
investment subaccount thereof, and all funds and other property from time to
time on deposit therein or credited thereto, pursuant to the terms of a Lockbox
Agreement. If, at any time, the Servicer has actual notice or knowledge that any
institution holding the Collection Account is other than the corporate trust
department of the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee, or that the
institution holding the Collection Account has ceased to be an Eligible
Institution, the Servicer shall, with the consent of the Trustee, establish
within 30 days a substitute account therefor with an Eligible Institution,
transfer any cash and/or any instruments to such new account and from the date
any such substitute accounts are established, such account shall be the
Collection Account, provided that such new account shall be first become subject
to a Lockbox Agreement. Neither the Company nor the Servicer, nor any person or
entity claiming by, through or under the Company or Servicer, shall have any
right title or interest in, except to the extent expressly provided under the
Transaction Documents, or any right to withdraw any amount from, the Collection
Account. Pursuant to the authority granted to the Servicer in Section 2.2(a) of
the Servicing Agreement, the Servicer shall have the power, revocable by the
Trustee for cause, to make withdrawals from and payments to the Collection
Account for the purposes of carrying out the Servicer's or the Trustee's duties
hereunder. The Trustee shall not be responsible for funds that are not on
deposit with the Trustee.

                         (ii)  Each Series of Investor Certificates shall

     accounts maintained for the benefit of the Investor Certificateholders or
     paid to the Investor Certificateholders (with respect to all outstanding
     Series, the "CERTIFICATEHOLDERS' INTEREST"). The "Exchangeable Company
     Interest" shall be the interest in the Trust not represented by any Series
     of Investor Certificates then outstanding or Series Subordinated Interests
     then in existence, including the right to receive Collections and other
     amounts at the times and in the amounts specified in this Article III to be

     related Supplement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such Exchangeable Company
     Interest or Series Subordinated Interest shall include any interest in any
     Trust Account or any other accounts maintained for the benefit of the
     Investor Certificateholders, except as specifically provided in this
     Article III.

ACCOUNT") subject to a securities control agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to the Trustee. All income or other gain from investment of monies
deposited in or credited to the Securities Account shall be deposited in or
credited to the Securities Account immediately upon receipt, and any loss
resulting from such investment shall be charged to the Securities Account. Funds
on deposit in the Securities Account shall be invested in Eligible Investments
that will mature no later than the Business Day immediately preceding the next
Distribution Date. None of the Trustee, any Agent or any Holder shall be held
liable in any way by reason of any insufficiency in the Securities Account
resulting from any investment loss on any Eligible Investments.

     provided in a Supplement, the Servicer shall transfer to the Company
     Collection Subaccount from Aggregate Daily Collections deposited into the
     Collection Account pursuant to subsection (d)(i) above on such Deposit Date
     an amount equal to the aggregate Reinvestment Amount for all Outstanding
     Series (less an amount equal to the costs and expenses, if any, incurred by

Section 8.5, if the Company shall fail to make a payment as provided in this
Agreement or any Supplement, the Servicer or the Trustee may set off and apply

validity of such set-off.

                         (ii)  In addition to the provisions of Section 8.5, in
     the event the Servicer shall fail to make a payment as provided in any
     Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Trustee may set off and apply any
     amounts otherwise payable to the Servicer in its capacity as Servicer under
     the Transaction Documents on account of such obligation. The Servicer
     hereby waives demand, notice or declaration of such set-off and
     application; PROVIDED that notice will promptly be given to the Servicer of

the Trustee in authorized denominations equal to (in the aggregate) the Initial
Invested Amount and the interests evidenced thereby, together with any Series
Subordinated Interest and the Exchangeable Company Interest, shall constitute
the entire ownership of the Trust. Upon a Company Exchange as provided in
Section 5.10 and the satisfaction of certain other conditions specified therein,
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the Certificates of additional Series
(with the designation provided in the applicable Supplement) (or, if provided in
any Supplement, the additional Investor Certificates of an existing Series),
upon the written order of the Company, to the Persons designated in such
Supplement. Upon the order of the Company, the Investor Certificates of any
Series shall be duly authenticated by or on behalf of the Trustee, in authorized
denominations equal to (in the aggregate) the Initial Invested Amount of such
Series of Investor Certificates.

          Section 5.3   REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.
(a) The Trustee shall cause to be kept at the office or agency to be maintained
by a transfer agent and registrar (which may be the Trustee) (the "Transfer
Agent and Registrar") in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.16 a
register (the "Certificate Register") in which, subject to such reasonable
regulations as the Trustee may prescribe, the Transfer Agent and Registrar shall
provide for the registration of the Investor Certificates and of transfers and
exchanges of the Investor Certificates as herein provided. The Company hereby
appoints the Trustee as the initial Transfer Agent and Registrar for the purpose
of registering the Investor Certificates and transfers and exchanges of the
Investor Certificates as herein provided. The Company, or the Trustee, as agent
for the Company, may revoke such appointment as Transfer Agent and Registrar and
remove the then-acting Transfer Agent and Registrar if the Trustee or the
Company (as applicable) determines in its sole discretion that the then-acting
Transfer Agent and Registrar has failed to perform its obligations under this
Agreement in any material respect. The then-acting Transfer Agent and Registrar
shall be permitted to resign as Transfer Agent and Registrar upon 30 days'
written notice to the Company, the Trustee and the Servicer; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that such resignation shall not be effective and the Trustee shall continue to
perform its duties as Transfer Agent and Registrar until the Trustee has
appointed a successor Transfer Agent and Registrar reasonably acceptable to the
Company and such successor Transfer Agent and Registrar has accepted such
appointment. The provisions of Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.5 and 10.19 shall apply
to the Trustee also in its role as Transfer Agent and Registrar for so long as
the Trustee shall act as Transfer Agent and Registrar.

          The Company hereby agrees to provide the Trustee from time to time
sufficient funds, on a timely basis and in accordance with and subject to
Section 8.5, for the payment of any reasonable compensation payable to the
Transfer Agent and Registrar for its services under this Section 5.3. The
Company, Trustee and Transfer Agent and Registrar shall agree on such
compensation in writing. The Trustee hereby agrees that, upon the receipt of
such funds from the Company, it shall promptly pay the Transfer Agent and
Registrar such amounts.

          Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Investor
Certificate at any office or agency of the Transfer Agent and Registrar
maintained for such purpose, the Company shall execute, and, upon the written
request of the Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name
of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Investor
Certificates in authorized denominations of the same Series representing like
aggregate Fractional Undivided Interests and which bear numbers that are not
contemporaneously outstanding.

          At the option of an Investor Certificateholder, Investor Certificates
may be exchanged for other Investor Certificates of the same Series in
authorized

                                       61
<Page>

denominations of like aggregate Fractional Undivided Interests, bearing numbers
that are not contemporaneously outstanding, upon surrender of the Investor
Certificates to be exchanged at any such office or agency of the Transfer Agent
and Registrar maintained for such purpose.

          Whenever any Investor Certificates of any Series are so surrendered
for exchange, the Company shall execute, and, upon the written request of the
Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and (unless the Transfer Agent and
Registrar is different from the Trustee, in which case the Transfer Agent and
Registrar shall) deliver, the Investor Certificates of such Series which the
Investor Certificateholder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Every
Investor Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer substantially
in the form attached to the form of such Investor Certificate and duly executed
by the holder thereof or his attorney-in-fact duly authorized in writing
delivered to the Trustee (unless the Transfer Agent and Registrar is different
from the Trustee, in which case to the Transfer Agent and Registrar) and
complying with any requirements set forth in the applicable Supplement.

          No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or
exchange of Investor Certificates, but the Transfer Agent and Registrar may
require any Investor Certificateholder that is transferring or exchanging one or
more Certificates to pay a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental
charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of
Investor Certificates.

          All Investor Certificates surrendered for registration of transfer and
exchange shall be cancelled and disposed of in a customary manner satisfactory
to the Trustee.

          The Company shall execute and deliver Certificates to the Trustee or
the Transfer Agent and Registrar in such amounts and at such times as are
necessary to enable the Trustee and the Transfer Agent and Registrar to fulfill
their respective responsibilities under this Agreement and the Certificates.

          No interest of any Investor Certificateholder in the Receivables may
be transferred other than by means of a transfer of an Investor Certificate.

                  (b)   The Transfer Agent and Registrar will maintain at its
expense in Chicago, Illinois and, subject to Section 5.3(a), if specified in the
related Supplement for any Series, any other city designated in such Supplement,
an office or offices or agency or agencies where Investor Certificates may be
surrendered for registration or transfer or exchange.

<Page>

                  (c)   Unless otherwise stated in any related Supplements,
registration of transfer of Certificates containing a legend relating to
restrictions on transfer of such Certificates (which legend shall be set forth
in the Supplement relating to such Investor Certificates) shall be effected only
if the conditions set forth in the related Supplement are complied with.

          Certificates issued upon registration or transfer of, or in exchange
for, Certificates bearing the legend referred to above shall also bear such
legend unless the Company, the Servicer, the Trustee and the Transfer Agent and
Registrar receive an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to each of them, to the
effect that such legend may be removed.

                  (d)     (i)  The Company may not transfer, assign, exchange or
otherwise pledge or convey the Series Subordinated Interest of any Series or the
Exchangeable Company Interest except, with respect to the Exchangeable Company
Interest, pursuant to Section 5.10.

                         (ii)  Neither the Company nor the Servicer shall at any
     time participate in the listing of any Targeted Investor Certificate (as
     defined below) on an "established securities market" within the meaning of
     Section 7704(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code and any proposed, temporary
     or final treasury regulation thereunder as of the date hereof, including,
     without limitation, an over-the-counter or interdealer quotation system
     that regularly disseminates firm buy or sell quotations. "TARGETED INVESTOR
     CERTIFICATE" shall mean any Certificate representing a right to receive
     interest or principal with respect to any Class or Series of Investor
     Certificates with respect to which an Opinion of Counsel has not been
     rendered that such Certificates will be treated as debt for federal income
     tax purposes (it being understood that any Certificate with respect to
     which an Opinion of Counsel has been rendered that such Certificate will be
     treated either as debt or as an interest in a partnership for federal
     income tax purposes shall be a Targeted Investor Certificate).

                  (e)     (i)  No transfer of a Targeted Investor Certificate or
grant of a participation therein shall be permitted if (A) such transfer or
grant would cause the number of Targeted Holders (as defined below) to exceed 75
or (B) the transferee or grantee, as the case may be, is a trust, partnership or
"S corporation" (within the meaning of Section 1361(a) of the Code) (a
"FLOW-THROUGH ENTITY"), unless less than 50% of the value of any beneficial
ownership interest in such flow-through entity is attributable to such
flow-through entity's direct or indirect interest in Targeted Investor
Certificates. "TARGETED HOLDER" shall mean each Holder of or participant in

                                       63
<Page>

a Targeted Investor Certificate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any Person holding more
than one interest with respect to the Investor Certificates or the Trust, each
of which separately would cause such Person to be a Targeted Holder, shall be
treated as a single Targeted Holder.

                         (ii)  Any determination by the Transfer Agent and
     Registrar (in accordance with the information contained in the Certificate
     Register and the certifications made by each transferee and participant
     pursuant to the applicable Supplement, upon which information the Transfer
     Agent and Registrar may conclusively rely) that the event described in
     either clause (i)(A) or (i)(B) of this Section 5.3(e) would occur as the
     result of a transfer of a Targeted Investor Certificate or the grant of a
     participation therein shall be (X) communicated in writing to the
     transferring or granting Investor Certificateholder prior to the effective
     date set out in the notice of transfer or participation required by, or
     otherwise provided for under, the related Supplement and (Y) binding upon
     the parties absent manifest error.

          Section 5.4   MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST OR STOLEN CERTIFICATES. If
(a) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Transfer Agent and
Registrar, or the Transfer Agent and Registrar receives evidence in the form of
a certification by the holder thereof of the destruction, loss or theft of any
Certificate and (b) there is delivered to the Transfer Agent and Registrar and
the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save the
Trust and each of them harmless, then, in the absence of actual notice to a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee or Transfer Agent and Registrar that such
Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall
execute and, upon the written request of the Company, the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like tenor and
aggregate Fractional Undivided Interest and bearing a number that is not
contemporaneously outstanding. In connection with the issuance of any new
Certificate under this Section 5.4, the Trustee or the Transfer Agent and
Registrar may require the payment by the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental expenses (including the fees and expenses of the
Trustee and Transfer Agent and Registrar) connected therewith. Any duplicate
Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall constitute conclusive and
indefeasible evidence of ownership in the Trust, as if originally issued,
whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any
time.

          Section 5.5  PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. At all times prior to due
presentation of a Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company, the
Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and Registrar, any Agent and any
agent of any

                                       64
<Page>

of them may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered as the
owner of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to
Article IV of the related Supplement and for all other purposes whatsoever, and
neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and Registrar, any
Agent nor any agent of any of them shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5, in
determining whether the holders of the requisite Fractional Undivided Interests
have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or
waiver hereunder, Certificates owned by the Company, the Servicer or any
Affiliate thereof shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except
that, in determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying upon any
such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver; only
Certificates which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows to be so
owned shall be so disregarded. Certificates so owned by the Company, the
Servicer or any Affiliate thereof which have been pledged in good faith shall
not be disregarded and may be regarded as outstanding if the pledgee establishes
to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to
such Certificates and that the pledgee is not the Company, the Servicer or an
Affiliate thereof.

          Section 5.6   APPOINTMENT OF PAYING AGENT. The Paying Agent shall make
distributions to Investor Certificateholders from the Collection Account (and/or
any other account or accounts maintained for the benefit of Holders as specified
in the related Supplement for any Series) pursuant to Articles III and IV. The
Trustee may revoke such power and remove the Paying Agent if the Trustee
determines in its sole discretion that the Paying Agent shall have failed to
perform its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect. Unless
otherwise specified in the related Supplement for any Series and with respect to
such Series, the Paying Agent shall initially be the Trustee and, if the Trustee
so chooses, any co-paying agent chosen by the Trustee. Each Paying Agent shall
have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. The Paying Agent
shall be permitted to resign upon 30 days' written notice to the Trustee. In the
event that the Paying Agent shall so resign, the Trustee shall appoint a
successor to act as Paying Agent (which shall be a depositary institution or
trust company) reasonably acceptable to the Company which appointment shall be
effective on the date on which the Person so appointed gives the Trustee written
notice that it accepts the appointment. Any resignation or removal of the Paying
Agent and appointment of successor Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 5.6
shall not become effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor
Paying Agent, as provided in this Section 5.6. The Trustee shall cause such
successor Paying Agent or any additional Paying Agent appointed by the Trustee
to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such successor
Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee that as
Paying Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent will hold
all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the Investor Certificateholders in
trust for the benefit

                                       65
<Page>

of the Investor Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be
paid to such Holders. The Paying Agent shall return all unclaimed funds to the
Trustee and upon removal of a Paying Agent such Paying Agent shall also return
all funds in its possession to the Trustee. The provisions of Sections 8.1, 8.2,
8.3, 8.5 and 10.19 shall apply to the Trustee also in its role as Paying Agent,
for so long as the Trustee shall act as Paying Agent. Any reference in this
Agreement to the Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent, if any, unless
the context requires otherwise.

          The Company hereby agrees to provide the Trustee from time to time
sufficient funds, on a timely basis and in accordance with and subject to
Section 8.5, for the payment of any reasonable compensation payable to the
Paying Agent for its services under this Section 5.6. The Trustee hereby agrees
that, upon the receipt of such funds from the Company, it shall promptly pay the
Paying Agent such amounts.

          Section 5.7   ACCESS TO LIST OF INVESTOR CERTIFICATEHOLDERS' NAMES AND
ADDRESSES. The Trustee will furnish or cause to be furnished by the Transfer
Agent and Registrar to the Company, the Servicer or the Paying Agent, within ten
Business Days after receipt by the Trustee of a written request therefor from
the Company, the Servicer or the Paying Agent, respectively, in writing, a list
of the names and addresses of the Investor Certificateholders as then recorded
by or on behalf of the Trustee. If three or more Investor Certificateholders of
record or any Investor Certificateholder of any Series or a group of Investor
Certificateholders of record representing Fractional Undivided Interests
aggregating not less than 10% of the Invested Amount of the related Outstanding
Series (the "Applicants") apply in writing to the Trustee, and such application
states that the Applicants desire to communicate with other Investor
Certificateholders of any Series with respect to their rights under this
Agreement or under the Investor Certificates and is accompanied by a copy of the
communication which such Applicants propose to transmit, then the Trustee, after
having been adequately indemnified by such Applicants for its costs and
expenses, shall transfer or shall cause the Transfer Agent and Registrar to
transmit, such communication to the Investor Certificateholders reasonably
promptly after the receipt of such application.

          Every Investor Certificateholder, by receiving and holding an Investor
Certificate, consents to the disclosure of its name and address as provided
above and agrees with the Trustee that neither the Trustee, the Transfer Agent
and Registrar, nor any of their respective agents, officers, directors or
employees shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure or mailing of
any such information as to the names and addresses of the Investor
Certificateholders hereunder, regardless of the sources from which such
information was derived.

                                       66
<Page>

          As soon as practicable following each Record Date, the Trustee shall
provide to the Paying Agent or its designee, a list of Investor
Certificateholders in such form as the Paying Agent may reasonably request.

          Section 5.8   AUTHENTICATING AGENT. (a) The Trustee may appoint one or
more authenticating agents with respect to the Certificates which shall be
authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee in authenticating the Certificates in
connection with the issuance, delivery, registration of transfer, exchange or
repayment of the Certificates. Whenever reference is made in this Agreement to
the authentication of Certificates by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate
of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication on
behalf of the Trustee by an authenticating agent and a certificate of
authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an authenticating agent.
Each authenticating agent must be acceptable to the Company.

                  (b)   Any institution succeeding to the corporate trust
business of an authenticating agent shall continue to be an authenticating agent
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
the Trustee or such authenticating agent.

                  (c)   An authenticating agent may at any time resign by giving
written notice of resignation to the Trustee. Upon the receipt by the Trustee of
any such notice of resignation and upon the giving of any such notice of
termination by the Trustee, the Trustee shall immediately give notice of such
resignation or termination to the Company. Any resignation of an authenticating
agent shall not become effective until acceptance of appointment by the
successor authenticating agent as provided in this Section 5.8. The Trustee may
at any time terminate the agency of an authenticating agent by giving notice of
termination to such authenticating agent. Upon receiving such a notice of
resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time an authenticating
agent shall cease to be acceptable to the Trustee or the Company, the Trustee
promptly shall appoint a successor authenticating agent. Any successor
authenticating agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become
vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with
like effect as if originally named as an authenticating agent. No successor
authenticating agent (other than an Affiliate of the Trustee) shall be appointed
unless reasonably acceptable to the Trustee and the Company.

                  (d)   The Company hereby agrees to provide the Trustee from
time to time sufficient funds, on a timely basis and in accordance with and
subject to Section 8.5, for the payment of any reasonable compensation payable
to each authenticating agent for its services under this Section 5.8. The
Trustee hereby

                                       67
<Page>

agrees that, upon the receipt of such funds from the Company it shall pay each
authenticating agent such amounts.

                  (e)   The provisions of Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and 8.5 shall
be applicable to any authenticating agent.

                  (f)   Pursuant to an appointment made under this Section 5.8,
the Certificates may have endorsed thereon, in lieu of the Trustee's certificate
of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in substantially
the following form:

          "This is one of the Certificates described in the Second Amended and
     Restated Pooling Agreement, dated as of March 28, 2003, among USS
     Receivables Company, Ltd., United Stationers Financial Services LLC, as
     Servicer, and Bank One, NA (Main Office Chicago), as Trustee.

as Authenticating Agent
for the Trustee

     By
       --------------------------------
       Authorized Signatory"

          Section 5.9   TAX TREATMENT. It is the intent of the Servicer, the
Company, the Investor Certificateholders and the Trustee that, for federal,
state and local income and franchise tax purposes, the Investor Certificates be
treated as evidence of indebtedness secured by the Trust Assets and the Trust
not be characterized as a "publicly traded partnership" or an association
taxable as a corporation. The Company and the Trustee, by entering into this
Agreement, and each Investor Certificateholder, by its acceptance of its
Investor Certificate, agree to treat the Investor Certificates for federal,
state and local income and franchise tax purposes as indebtedness. The parties
hereto agree that they shall not cause or permit the making, as applicable, of
any election under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 whereby the Trust or
any portion thereof would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes and, except as required by Section 8.11, shall not file tax returns or
obtain any federal employer identification number for the Trust but shall treat
the Trust as a security device for such purposes. The provisions of this
Agreement and all related Transaction Documents shall be construed to further
these intentions of the parties. This SECTION 5.9 shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and shall be binding on all transferees of any of the
foregoing persons.

          Section 5.10  COMPANY EXCHANGES. (a) The Company may, in accordance
with the procedures set forth below, call for an adjustment of the Exchangeable
Company Interest in exchange for (i) an increase in the Invested Amount of a
Class of Investor Certificates of an Outstanding Series and an increase in the
related Series Subordinated Interest or (ii) one or more newly issued Series of
Investor Certificates and the related newly created Series Subordinated Interest
(a "NEW SERIES") (any such exchange, a "COMPANY EXCHANGE"). The Company may
perform a Company Exchange by notifying the Trustee, in writing at least 30 days
in advance (an "EXCHANGE NOTICE") of the date upon which the Company Exchange is
to occur (an "EXCHANGE DATE"). Any Exchange Notice shall state the designation
of any Series (and/or Class, if applicable) to be issued (or supplemented) on
the Exchange Date and, with respect to each such Series (and/or Class, if
applicable): (a) its additional or Initial Invested Amount, as the case may be,
if any, which in the aggregate at any time may not be greater than the current
value of the Exchangeable Company Interest, if any, at such time, (b) its
Certificate Rate (or the method for allocating interest payments or other cash
flow to such Series), if any, and (c) whether such New Series will be a
companion series to an Outstanding Series (an "EXISTING COMPANION SERIES"; and
together with the New Series, a "COMPANION SERIES"). On the Exchange Date, the
Trustee shall, upon the written order of the Company, authenticate and deliver
any Certificates evidencing an increase in the Invested Amount of a Class of
Investor Certificates or a newly issued Series only upon delivery by the Company
to the Trustee of the following (together with the delivery by the Company to
the Trustee of any additional agreements, instruments or other documents as are
specified in the related Supplement): (a) a Supplement executed by the Company
and specifying the Principal Terms of such Series (PROVIDED that no such
Supplement shall be required for any increase in the Invested Amount of a Class
of Investor Certificates unless it is so required by the related Supplement),
(b) a Tax Opinion addressed to the Trustee and the Trust, (c) a General Opinion
addressed to the Trustee and the Trust and (d) written confirmation from each
Rating Agency that the Company Exchange will not result in the Rating Agency's
reducing or withdrawing its rating on any then Outstanding Series rated by it.
Upon the delivery of the items listed in clauses (a) through (d) above, the
existing Exchangeable Company Interest and the applicable Series Subordinated
Interests, as the case may be, shall be deemed cancelled, the Trustee shall
issue the applicable Series of Investor Certificates, dated the Exchange Date,
and the applicable Series Subordinated Interests and the new Exchangeable
Company Interest shall be deemed duly created, in each case as provided above.
There is no limit to the number of Company Exchanges that the Company may
perform under this Agreement. If the Company shall, on any Exchange Date, retain
any Investor Certificates issued on such Exchange Date, it shall, prior to
transferring any such Certificates to another Person, obtain a Tax Opinion.
Additional restrictions relating to a Company Exchange may be set forth in any
Supplement.

                                       69
<Page>

                  (b)   Upon any Company Exchange, the Trustee, in accordance
with the written directions of the Company, shall issue to the Company under
Section 5.1, for execution and redelivery to the Trustee for authentication
under Section 5.2, (i) one or more Certificates representing an increase in the
Invested Amount of an Outstanding Series or (ii) one or more new Series of
Investor Certificates. Any such Certificates shall be substantially in the form
specified in the applicable Supplement and each shall bear, upon its face, the
designation for such Series to which each such certificate belongs so selected
by the Company.

                  (c)   In conjunction with a Company Exchange, the parties
hereto shall, except as otherwise provided in subsection (a) above, execute a
supplement to this Agreement, which shall define, with respect to any additional
Investor Certificates or newly issued Series, as the case may be: (i) its name
or designation, (ii) its additional or initial principal amount, as the case may
be (or method for calculating such amount), (iii) its coupon rate (or formula
for the determination thereof), (iv) the interest payment date or dates and the
date or dates from which interest shall accrue, (v) the method for allocating
Collections to Holders, including the applicable Investor Percentage, (vi) the
names of any accounts to be used by such Series and the terms governing the
operation of any such accounts, (vii) the issue and term of a letter of credit
or other form of Enhancement, if any, with respect thereto, (viii) the terms, if
any, on which the Certificates of such Series may be repurchased by the Company
or may be remarketed to other investors, (ix) the Series Termination Date, (x)
any deposit account maintained for the benefit of Holders, (xi) the number of
Classes of such Series, and if more than one Class, the rights and priorities of
each such Class, (xii) the rights of the owner of the Exchangeable Company
Interest that have been transferred to the holders of such Series, (xiii) the
designation of any Series Accounts and the terms governing the operation of any
such Series Accounts, (xiv) provisions acceptable to the Trustee concerning the
payment of the Trustee's fees and expenses and (xv) other relevant terms (all
such terms, the "PRINCIPAL TERMS" of such Series). The Supplement executed in
connection with the Company Exchange shall contain administrative provisions
which are reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

                  (d)   In order for a New Series to be part of a Companion
Series, the Supplement for the related Existing Companion Series must provide
for or permit the Amortization Period to commence on the Issuance Date for such
New Series, and on or prior to the Issuance Date for the New Series the Servicer
and the Company shall take all actions, if any, necessary to cause the
Amortization Period for such Existing Companion Series to commence on such
Issuance Date. The proceeds from the issuance of the New Series shall be
deposited in the applicable Series Collection Sub-account and the Company shall,
on the Issuance Date for such New Series, deposit into the applicable Series
Collection Sub-account the amount of interest that will accrue on the New Series
over a period specified in the related

                                       70
<Page>

Supplement for such New Series. On each day on which principal is paid to the
holders of the Existing Companion Series, the Trustee shall distribute to the
Company from the applicable Series Collection Sub-account of the New Series an
amount (up to the amount of available funds in such account) equal to the amount
distributed on such day to the Investor Certificateholders of any Existing
Companion Series; PROVIDED that, after giving effect to such distributions, the
Aggregate Receivables Amount shall equal or exceed the sum of (i) the Target
Receivables Amount with respect to such Existing Companion Series on such day,
plus (ii) the Target Receivables Amount with respect to the New Series on such
day, plus (iii) the Target Receivables Amount with respect to any other
Outstanding Series on such day; PROVIDED FURTHER that the Trustee may
conclusively rely on the calculations of the Servicer of such amounts.

                  (e)   Except as specified in any Supplement for a related
Series, all Investor Certificates of any Series shall be equally and ratably
entitled as provided herein to the benefits hereof without preference, priority
or distinction on account of the actual time or times of authentication and
delivery, all in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and
the applicable Supplement.

          Section 5.11  BOOK-ENTRY CERTIFICATES. If specified in any related
Supplement, the Investor Certificates, or any portion thereof, upon original
issuance, shall be issued in the form of one or more typewritten Certificates
representing the Book-Entry Certificates, to be delivered to the depository
specified in such Supplement (the "DEPOSITORY") which shall be the Clearing
Agency, specified by, or on behalf of, the Company for such Series. The Investor
Certificates shall initially be registered on the Certificate Register in the
name of the nominee of such Clearing Agency, and no Certificate Book-Entry
Holder will receive a definitive certificate representing such Certificate
Book-Entry Holder's interest in the Investor Certificates, except as provided in
Section 5.13. Unless and until definitive, fully registered Investor
Certificates ("DEFINITIVE CERTIFICATES") have been issued to Holders pursuant to
Section 5.13 or the related Supplement:

                  (a)   the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall be in full
force and effect;

                  (b)   the Company, the Servicer and the Trustee may deal with
each Clearing Agency for all purposes (including the making of distributions on
the Investor Certificates) as the Holder without respect to whether there has
been any actual authorization of such actions by the Certificate Book-Entry
Holders with respect to such actions;

                                       71
<Page>

                  (c)   to the extent that the provisions of this Section 5.11
conflict with any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this
Section 5.11 shall control; and

                  (d)   the rights of Certificate Book-Entity Holders shall be
exercised only through the Clearing Agency and the related Clearing Agency
Participants and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements
between such related Certificate Book-Entry Holders and the Clearing Agency
and/or the Clearing Agency Participants. Pursuant to the Depository Agreement,
the initial Clearing Agency will make book-entry transfers among the Clearing
Agency Participants and receive and transmit distributions of principal and
interest on the Investor Certificates to such Clearing Agency Participants.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Class or Series of Investor Certificates may
be issued as Book Entry Certificates (but, instead, shall be issued as
Definitive Certificates) unless at the time of issuance of such Class or Series
the Company and the Trustee receive an opinion of independent counsel that the
Certificates of such Class or Series will be treated as indebtedness for federal
income tax purposes.

          Section 5.12  NOTICES TO CLEARING AGENCY. Whenever notice or other
communication to the Holders is required under this Agreement, unless and until
Definitive Certificates shall have been issued to Certificate Book-Entry Holders
pursuant to Section 5.13, the Trustee shall give all such notices and
communications specified herein to be given to the Investor Certificateholders
to the Clearing Agencies.

          Section 5.13  DEFINITIVE CERTIFICATES. If (a) (i) the Company advises
the Trustee in writing that any Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to
properly discharge its responsibilities under the applicable Depository
Agreement, and (ii) the Company is unable to locate a qualified successor, (b)
the Company, at its option, advises the Trustee in writing that it elects to
terminate the book-entry system through the Clearing Agency or (c) after the
occurrence of a Servicer Default, Certificate Book-Entry Holders representing
Fractional Undivided Interests aggregating more than 50% of the Invested Amount
held by such Certificate Book-Entry Holders of each affected Series then issued
and outstanding advise the Clearing Agency through the Clearing Agency
Participants in writing, and the Clearing Agency shall so notify the Trustee,
that the continuation of a book-entry system through the Clearing Agency is no
longer in the best interests of the Certificate Book-Entry Holders, the Trustee
shall notify the Clearing Agency, which shall be responsible to notify the
Certificate Book-Entry Holders, of the occurrence of any such event and of the
availability of Definitive Certificates to Certificate Book-Entry Holders
requesting the same. Upon surrender to the Trustee of the Book-Entry
Certificates by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration

                                       72
<Page>

instructions from the Clearing Agency for registration, the Trustee shall issue
the Definitive Certificates. Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be liable
for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and
shall be protected in relying on, such instructions.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                             OTHER MATTERS RELATING
                                 TO THE COMPANY

          Section 6.1   LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY. The Company shall be liable
for all obligations, covenants, representations and warranties of the Company
arising under or related to this Agreement or any Supplement. Except as provided
in the preceding sentence and otherwise herein, the Company shall be liable only
to the extent of the obligations specifically undertaken by it hereunder.

provided in Sections 6.1 or otherwise provided herein, neither the Company nor
any of its directors or officers or employees or agents, in their capacity as
transferor of, or in connection with the transfer of, Receivables and Related
Property hereunder, shall be under any liability to the Trust, the Trustee, the
Holders or any other Person for any action taken or for refraining from the
taking of any action pursuant to this Agreement, whether or not such action or
inaction arises from express or implied duties under this Agreement; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that this provision shall not protect the Company against any liability
which would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misconduct, bad faith or
gross negligence in the performance of any duties or by reason of reckless
disregard of any obligations and duties hereunder; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that this
provision shall not protect any such director, officer, employee or agent
against any liability which would otherwise be imposed on such Person pursuant
to applicable law or the Company's memorandum or articles of association by
reason of willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance
of such Person's duties or by reason of reckless disregard of such Person's
obligations and duties hereunder. The Company and any director or officer or
employee or agent of the Company may rely in good faith on any document of any
kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person (other than, in
the case of the Company, the Company or the Servicer) respecting any matters
arising hereunder.

to any Series of Investor Certificates by any related Supplement, if any one of
the following events (each, an "EARLY AMORTIZATION EVENT") shall occur:

                  (a)     (i)  the Company shall commence any case, proceeding

corporation;

                  (d)   the Trustee shall be appointed as Successor Servicer
pursuant to Section 6.2(b) of the Servicing Agreement; or

                  (e)   [Intentionally Omitted];

                  (f)   there shall have been a breach of the covenant contained
in Section 5.1(u) of either of the Receivables Sale Agreements, without regard
for any applicable grace or cure period.

then: (i) in the case of the occurrence of an event described in clause (a)(ii)
above, the Trustee may, and at the direction of Investor Certificateholders
evidencing more than 50% of the Aggregate Invested Amount with respect to all
Outstanding Series,

                                       74

or (ii), an "Early Amortization Period"). The Servicer shall notify each Rating
Agency and the Trustee in writing of the occurrence of any Early Amortization
Period, specifying the cause thereof. Further, upon the commencement against the
Company of a case, proceeding or other action described in clause (a)(ii) or
(iii) above, the Company shall not purchase Receivables from any Seller, or
transfer Receivables to the Trust, until such time, if any, as such case,

be set forth in each Supplement with respect to the Series relating thereto.

          Section 7.2   ADDITIONAL RIGHTS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS.
If an Early Amortization Event specified in paragraph (a) of Section 7.1(a) with
respect to the Company occurs, the Company shall immediately cease to transfer
Receivables to the Trust and shall promptly give notice to the Trustee of such
occurrence. Notwithstanding any cessation of the transfer to the Trust of
additional Receivables, Receivables transferred to the Trust prior to the
occurrence of such Insolvency Event and Collections in respect of such
Receivables and interest, whenever created, accrued in respect of such
Receivables, shall continue to be a part of the Trust.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   THE TRUSTEE

          Section 8.1   DUTIES OF TRUSTEE. (a) The Trustee, prior to the
occurrence of a Servicer Default or Early Amortization Event of which a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge and after the curing of
all Servicer Defaults and Early Amortization Events which may have occurred,
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set
forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreements or any Supplement and no implied
covenants or obligations shall be read into such Pooling and Servicing
Agreements against the Trustee. After the occurrence of a Servicer Default or
Early Amortization Event to the actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the
Trustee (which has not been cured or waived), the Trustee shall exercise such of
the rights and powers vested in it in its capacity as Trustee by any Pooling and
Servicing Agreement and any Supplement and shall use the same degree of care and
skill in their exercise as a

                                       75
<Page>

prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of
such person's own affairs. The provisions of this Section shall be applicable to
the Trustee in its capacity as Trustee hereunder. If the Trustee shall have
succeeded to the obligations of the Servicer, the provisions of the Servicing
Agreement shall govern the actions of the Trustee as Successor Servicer. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Trustee is hereby authorized (and, by its acceptance
of a Certificate or an interest in the Trust, each Holder hereby agrees) to
enter into the Intercreditor Agreement.

                  (b)   The Trustee may conclusively rely as to the truth of the
statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein upon
resolutions, certificates, statements, opinions, reports, documents, orders or
other instruments furnished to the Trustee and believed by it to be genuine and
to have been signed or presented to it pursuant to any Pooling and Servicing
Agreement by the proper party or parties and the Trustee shall not be
responsible for the accuracy of or verification of any information contained in
any report, including any calculation contained therein, provided to it pursuant
to this Agreement; provided in the case of any of the above which are
specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee pursuant to any provision
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreements, the Trustee shall, subject to Section
8.2, examine them to determine whether they substantially conform to the
requirements of this Agreement.

                  (c)   Subject to Section 8.1(a), no provision of this
Agreement or any Supplement shall be construed to relieve the Trustee, from
liability for its own grossly negligent action, its own grossly negligent
failure to act or its own misconduct; provided, however, that:

                          (i)  The Trustee shall not in its individual capacity
     be liable for an error of judgment unless it shall be proved that the
     Trustee was grossly negligent, or acted in bad faith, in ascertaining the
     pertinent facts;

                         (ii)  The Trustee shall not in its individual capacity
     be liable with respect to any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken
     by it in good faith in accordance with this Agreement or at the direction
     of the Servicer or the holders of Investor Certificates evidencing in
     excess of 50% (or such lesser percentage as set forth in any applicable
     provision) of the Aggregate Invested Amount;

                        (iii)  The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge
     of any failure by the Servicer to comply with any of its obligations,
     unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives written notice of such
     failure from the Servicer, any Agent or any Investor Certificateholder;

                                       76
<Page>

                         (iv)  The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge
     of a Servicer Default or Early Amortization Event unless a Responsible
     Officer shall have received written notice of such default or event from
     the Servicer, any Agent or any Investor Certificateholder. In the absence
     of receipt of such notice, the Trustee may conclusively assume that there
     is no Servicer Default or Early Amortization Event;

                          (v)  So long as the Trustee has followed the
     instructions of the Servicer, the Trustee shall not in any way be held
     liable by reason of any insufficiency in any Account or subaccount thereof
     held by or on behalf of the Trustee resulting from any investment loss on
     any Eligible Investment included therein; and

                         (vi)  The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the
     performance of the Servicer, nor shall it have any liability in connection
     with malfeasance or nonfeasance by the Servicer. The Trustee shall have no
     liability in connection with compliance of the Servicer or the Company with
     statutory or regulatory requirements related to the Receivables.

                  (d)   The Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk its
own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any
of its duties under any Pooling and Servicing Agreement or in the exercise of
any of its rights or powers, if the Trustee has reason to believe that the
repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is
not assured to it (to the Trustee's satisfaction), and none of the provisions
contained in any Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall in any event require the
Trustee to perform, or be responsible for the manner of performance of, any
obligations of the Servicer under such Agreement except during such time, if
any, as the Trustee shall be the successor to, and be vested with the rights,
duties, powers and privileges of, the Servicer in accordance with the terms of
such Agreement.

                  (e)   Except as expressly provided in any Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, the Trustee shall have no power to vary the corpus of the
Trust.

                  (f)   [Intentionally Omitted].

                  (g)   [Intentionally Omitted].

                  (h)   Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement and
without limiting the generality of this Section 8.1, the Trustee shall have no
duty (i)

                                       77
<Page>

to see to any insurance with respect to the Trust Assets, or (ii) to see to the
payment or discharge of any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge or any
lien or encumbrance of any kind owing with respect to, assessed or levied
against, any part of the Trust Assets other than from funds available in the
Collection Account.

                  (i)   The right of the Trustee to perform its obligations
enumerated in this Agreement shall not be construed as a duty, and the Trustee
shall not be answerable for other than its gross negligence or willful
misconduct in the performance of such act.

                  (j)   The Trustee shall not be required to give any bond or
surety in respect of the execution of the Trust created hereby or the powers
granted hereunder.

          Section 8.2   RIGHTS OF THE TRUSTEE. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 8.1:

                  (a)   The Trustee may conclusively rely on and shall be
protected in acting on, or in refraining from acting in accord with, any
resolution, Officer's Certificate, certificate of auditors or any other
certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction,
consent, order, appraisal, bond, note or other paper or document believed by it
to be genuine and to have been signed or presented to it pursuant to any Pooling
and Servicing Agreement by the proper party or parties;

                  (b)   The Trustee may consult with counsel of its choice (at
the Company's expense) and any Opinion of Counsel or any advice of such counsel
shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action
taken or suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance
with such Opinion of Counsel;

                  (c)   The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any
of the rights or powers vested in it by any Pooling and Servicing Agreement, or
to institute, conduct or defend any litigation hereunder or in relation hereto,
at the request, order or direction of any of the Holders, pursuant to the
provisions of any Pooling and Servicing Agreement, unless such Holders shall
have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity to the Trustee's satisfaction
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred therein or
thereby; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall relieve the
Trustee of the obligations, upon the occurrence of a Servicer Default or Early
Amortization Event of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has written
notice (which has not been cured), to exercise such of the rights and powers
vested in it by any Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and to use the same degree
of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent

                                       78
<Page>

person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such
person's own affairs. The right of the Trustee to perform its obligations
enumerated in this Agreement shall not be construed as a duty, and the Trustee
shall not be answerable for other than its gross negligence or willful
misconduct in the performance of any such act;

                  (d)   The Trustee shall not be personally liable for any
action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be
authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by any
Pooling and Servicing Agreement; provided that the Trustee shall be liable for
its gross negligence or willful misconduct;

                  (e)   The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation
into the facts of matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, direction, order,
approval, bond, note or other paper or document, or to recompute the amount of
any allocations or distributions contained in any direction from the Servicer
provided for under the Agreement, unless requested in writing so to do by the
holders of Investor Certificates evidencing Fractional Undivided Interests
aggregating more than 50% of the Invested Amount of any Series which could be
adversely affected if the Trustee does not perform such acts; provided, however,
that such holders of Investor Certificates shall reimburse the Trustee for any
reasonable expense resulting from any such investigation requested by them;
provided, further, that the Trustee shall be entitled to make such further
inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may reasonably see
fit, and if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or
investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books and records of the
Company pursuant to Section 2.7(d), personally or by agent or attorney, at the
sole cost and expense of the Company;

                  (f)   The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers
hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through
affiliates, agents or attorneys or a custodian or nominee, and the Trustee shall
not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of, or for the
supervision of, any such affiliate, agent, attorney, custodian or nominee
appointed with due care by it hereunder;

                  (g)   The Trustee shall not be required to make any initial or
periodic examination of any documents or records related to the Receivables or
the Accounts for the purpose of establishing the presence or absence of defects,
the compliance by the Company with its representations and warranties or for any
other purpose; and

                                       79
<Page>

                  (h)   In the event that the Trustee is also acting as Paying
Agent or Transfer Agent and Registrar hereunder, the rights and protections
afforded to the Trustee pursuant to this Article VIII shall also be afforded to
such Paying Agent or Transfer Agent and Registrar.

          Section 8.3   TRUSTEE NOT LIABLE FOR RECITALS IN CERTIFICATES. The
Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the recitals contained
herein and in the Certificates (other than the certificate of authentication on
the Certificates). The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or
sufficiency of any Pooling and Servicing Agreement or of the Certificates (other
than the certificate of authentication on the Certificates) or of any Receivable
or related document. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or
application by the Company of any of the Certificates or of the proceeds of such
Certificates, or for the use or application of any funds paid to the Company in
respect of the Receivables or deposited in or withdrawn from the Accounts or
other accounts hereafter established to effectuate the transactions contemplated
herein and in accordance with the terms of any Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

          The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the
Servicer of any of the Certificates or of the proceeds of such Certificates, or
for the use or application of any funds paid to the Servicer in respect of the
Receivables or deposited in or withdrawn from the Accounts or any Lockbox by or
at the direction of the Servicer or the Lockbox Processor, in each case unless
the Trustee, acting in its capacity as Successor Servicer, itself makes such use
or application. The Trustee shall at no time have any responsibility or
liability for or with respect to the legality, validity and enforceability of
any Receivable.

          Section 8.4   TRUSTEE MAY OWN CERTIFICATES. The Trustee in its
individual or any other capacity (a) may become the owner or pledgee of Investor
Certificates with the same rights as it would have if it were not the Trustee
and (b) may transact any banking and trust business with the Company, the
Servicer or any Seller as it would were it not the Trustee.

          Section 8.5   TRUSTEE'S FEES AND EXPENSES. The Trustee shall be
entitled to reimbursement from the Servicer or the Company upon the Trustee's
request for all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, expenses
incurred in connection with notices, requests for documentation or other
communications to or directions from Holders), disbursements, losses,
liabilities, damages and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance
with any of the provisions of any Pooling and Servicing Agreement or by reason
of its status as Trustee under any Pooling and Servicing Agreement (including
the reasonable fees and expenses of its agents, any co-trustee and counsel)
except any such expense, disbursement, loss, liability, damage or advance as may
arise from its gross negligence or bad faith or

                                       80
<Page>

willful misconduct. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
in no event shall the Trustee be liable for special, indirect or consequential
loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost
profits), even if the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or
damage and regardless of the form of action. The Trustee shall be entitled to
reimbursement for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in
connection with the review, negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of
any of the Transaction Documents or in connection with the issuance of any
Certificates on the Initial Closing Date. To the extent that the Trustee has not
been paid for any of the foregoing items, the Trustee shall be entitled to be
paid for such items from amounts which otherwise would be distributable to the
Company under Article III of this Agreement. In addition, to the extent not so
reimbursed, the Certificateholders shall reimburse and indemnify the Trustee for
such amounts ratably in accordance with their pro rata shares of the Aggregate
Invested Amount and for expenses incurred in connection with the administration
and enforcement of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. If the
Trustee is appointed Successor Servicer in accordance with the Servicing
Agreement, the Trustee, in its capacity as Successor Servicer, shall also be
entitled to be paid the Servicing Fee and any other compensation to which the
Servicer is expressly entitled hereunder. The provisions of this Section 8.5
shall apply to the reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances made or
incurred by the Trustee, or any other Person, in its capacity as liquidating
agent, to the extent not otherwise paid. The covenants and agreements contained
in this Section 8.5 (including, without limitation, the covenants to pay the
expenses, disbursements, losses, liabilities, damages and advances provided for
in this Section 8.5) shall survive the termination of any Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and shall be binding, as applicable, on (i) the Servicer and any
Successor Servicer and (ii) the Company.

          Section 8.6   ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR TRUSTEE. The Trustee
hereunder shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under
the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof and authorized
under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having (or having a holding
company parent with) a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 and
subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such
corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or
to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then,
for the purpose of this Section 8.6, the combined capital and surplus of such
corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth
in its most recent report of condition so published. In case at any time the
Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 8.6, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the
effect specified in Section 8.7.

                                       81
<Page>

          Section 8.7   RESIGNATION OR REMOVAL OF TRUSTEE. (a) Subject to
paragraph (c) below, the Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from
the trust hereby created by giving written notice thereof to the Company, the
Servicer and the Rating Agencies. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the
Company shall promptly appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in
duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning
Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee. If no successor trustee shall
have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the
giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any
court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee
acceptable to the Company (which acceptance will not unreasonably be withheld);
provided that such right of the Company to approve a successor trustee shall
terminate upon the occurrence of an Early Amortization Event.

                  (b)   If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of Section 8.6 hereof and shall fail to resign
after written request therefor by the Servicer, or if at any time the Trustee
shall be legally unable to act, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or
if a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any
public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or
affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then the
Company may remove the Trustee and promptly appoint a successor trustee by
written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be
delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee.

                  (c)   Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and
appointment of a successor trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this
Section 8.7 shall not become effective until acceptance of appointment by the
successor trustee as provided in Section 8.8.

                  (d)   The obligations of the Company described in Section 8.5
hereof and the obligations of the Servicer described in Section 8.5 hereof and
Section 5.2 of the Servicing Agreement shall survive the removal or resignation
of the Trustee as provided in this Agreement.

                  (e)   No Trustee under this Agreement shall be personally
liable for any action or omission of any successor trustee.

          Section 8.8   SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE. (a) Any successor trustee appointed
as provided in Section 8.7 shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company
and to its predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment
hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee
shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed
or

                                       82
<Page>

conveyance, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and
obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally
named as Trustee herein. The predecessor Trustee shall deliver to the successor
trustee all documents or copies thereof, at the expense of the Servicer, and
statements held by it hereunder; and the Company and the predecessor Trustee
shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things as may
reasonably be required for fully and certainly vesting and confirming in the
successor trustee all such rights, power, duties and obligations.

                  (b)   No successor trustee shall accept appointment as
provided in this Section 8.8 unless at the time of such acceptance such
successor trustee shall be eligible under the provisions of Section 8.6.

                  (c)   Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as
provided in this Section 8.8, such successor trustee shall mail notice of such
succession hereunder to each Rating Agency and to all Holders at their addresses
as shown in the Certificate Register.

          Section 8.9   MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION OF TRUSTEE. Any Person into
which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to
the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the
Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be eligible under the
provisions of Section 8.6, without the execution or filing of any paper or any
further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding. The Trustee (unless the Trustee is Bank One, NA (Main
Office Chicago)) shall promptly give notice (except to the extent prohibited
under any Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation), but in no event less
than ten days prior to any such merger or consolidation, to the Company, the
Servicer and the Rating Agencies upon any such merger or consolidation of the
Trustee.

          Section 8.10  APPOINTMENT OF CO-TRUSTEE OR SEPARATE TRUSTEE. (a)
Notwithstanding any other provisions of any Pooling and Servicing Agreement, at
any time, for the purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction
in which any part of the Trust may at the time be located, the Trustee shall
have the power and may execute and deliver all instruments to appoint one or
more persons to act as a co-trustee or co-trustees, or separate trustee or
separate trustees, of all or any part of the Trust, and to vest in such Person
or Persons, in such capacity and for the benefit of the Holders, such title to
the Trust, or any part thereof, and, subject to the other provisions of this
Section 8.10, such powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Trustee
may consider necessary or desirable. No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder
shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor

                                       83
<Page>

trustee under Section 8.6 and no notice to Holders of the appointment of any
co-trustee or separate trustee shall be required under Section 8.8. The Trustee
shall promptly notify each Rating Agency of the appointment of any co-trustee.

                  (b)   Every separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the
extent permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the following
provisions and conditions:

                          (i)  all rights, powers, duties and obligations
     conferred or imposed upon the Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon
     and exercised or performed by the Trustee and such separate trustee or
     co-trustee jointly (it being understood that such separate trustee or
     co-trustee is not authorized to act separately without the Trustee joining
     in such act), except to the extent that under any statute of any
     jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed
     (whether as Trustee hereunder or as successor to the Servicer hereunder),
     the Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or
     acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations (including
     the holding of title to the Trust or any portion thereof in any such
     jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed singly by such separate
     trustee or co-trustee, but solely at the direction of the Trustee;

                         (ii)  no trustee hereunder shall be personally liable
     by reason of any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder; and

                        (iii)  the Trustee may at any time accept the
     resignation of or remove any separate trustee or co-trustee.

                  (c)   Any notice, request or other writing given to the
Trustee shall be deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees
and co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument
appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and
the conditions of this Article VIII. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon
its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or
property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the
Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions
of any Pooling and Servicing Agreement, specifically including every provision
of any Pooling and Servicing Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the
liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee. Every such instrument
shall be filed with the Trustee and a copy thereof given to the Servicer and the
Company.

                                       84
<Page>

                  (d)   Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time
constitute the Trustee, its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and
authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in
respect to any Pooling and Servicing Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If
any separate trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign
or be removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall
vest in and be exercised by the Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without
the appointment of a new or successor trustee.

          Section 8.11  TAX RETURNS. In the event the Trust shall be required to
file tax returns, the Company shall prepare and file or shall cause to be
prepared and filed (including, without limitation, by the Servicer) any tax
returns required to be filed by the Trust and shall remit such returns to the
Trustee for signature at least five Business Days before such returns are due to
be filed. The Trustee is hereby authorized to sign any such return on behalf of
the Trust. The Company shall also prepare or shall cause to be prepared
(including, without limitation, by the Servicer) all tax information required by
law to be distributed to Holders and shall deliver such information to the
Trustee at least five Business Days prior to the date it is required by law to
be distributed to the Holders. The Trustee, upon written request, will furnish
the Company, or the Company's designee, with all such information known to the
Trustee as may be reasonably required in connection with the preparation of all
tax returns of the Trust, and shall, upon request, execute such returns. In no
event shall the Trustee in its individual capacity be liable for any
liabilities, costs or expenses of the Trust, the Holders, the Company or the
Servicer arising under any tax law or regulation, including, without limitation,
federal, state or local income or excise taxes or any other tax imposed on or
measured by income (or any interest or penalty with respect thereto or arising
from any failure to comply therewith) and the Company hereby indemnifies and
holds the Trust harmless for any such liabilities, costs and expenses.

          Section 8.12  TRUSTEE MAY ENFORCE CLAIMS WITHOUT POSSESSION OF
CERTIFICATES. All rights of action and claims under any Pooling and Servicing
Agreement or the Certificates may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee
without the possession of any of the Certificates or the production thereof in
any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the
Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee. Any recovery of judgment
shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the
ratable benefit of the Holders in respect of which such judgment has been
obtained, in the manner specified in Article III hereof.

          Section 8.13  SUITS FOR ENFORCEMENT. If a Servicer Default shall occur
and be continuing, the Trustee may, as provided in Section 6.1 of the Servicing

                                       85
<Page>

Agreement, proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Holders under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document by suit, action
or proceeding in equity or at law or otherwise, whether for the specific
performance of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document or in aid of the execution of any power granted in
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or for the enforcement of any
other legal, equitable or other remedy as the Trustee, being advised by counsel,
shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of the rights of the
Trustee or the Holders. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize
the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any
Investor Certificateholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment
or composition affecting the Certificates or the rights of any holder thereof,
or authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Investor
Certificateholder in any such proceeding.

          Section 8.14  RIGHTS OF INVESTOR CERTIFICATEHOLDERS TO DIRECT TRUSTEE.
Investor Certificateholders evidencing more than 50% of the Invested Amount of
any Series affected by the conduct of any proceeding or the exercise of any
right conferred on the Trustee shall have the right to direct the time, method
and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee,
or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that, subject to Section 8.1, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to
follow any such direction if the Trustee being advised by counsel determines
that the action so directed may not lawfully be taken, or if the Trustee in good
faith shall, by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee,
determine that the proceedings so directed would be illegal or expose it to
personal liability or be unduly prejudicial to the rights of Investor
Certificateholders not party to such direction; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that
nothing in any Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall impair the right of the
Trustee to take any action deemed proper by the Trustee and which is not
inconsistent with such direction of the Investor Certificateholders.

          Section 8.15  TRUSTEE TO DIRECT COMPANY. Subject to Section 8.14
above, the Trustee on behalf of the Investor Certificateholders shall direct the
Company as follows:

                  (a)   pursuant to Section 9.13 of the USFS Receivables Sale
Agreement, to direct USFS to agree to or deny the request of any Subsidiary of
United Stationers Inc. desiring to become an additional Seller under the USSC
Receivables Sale Agreement pursuant to Section 9.13 thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that any action by the Trustee pursuant to this Section 8.15 shall be
conditioned upon the Trustee's receipt of any written request from a Subsidiary
of United Stationers Inc. delivered in accordance with Section 9.13 of the USSC
Receivables Sale Agreement.

                                       86
<Page>

                  (b)   pursuant to Section 9.14 of the USFS Receivables Sale
Agreement and subject to the second proviso of Section 9.14(b) of the USSC
Receivables Sale Agreement, to direct USFS to consent to or deny any Seller
Termination Request made pursuant to Section 9.14(b) of the USSC Receivables
Sale Agreement.

          Section 8.16  MAINTENANCE OF OFFICE OR AGENCY. The Trustee will
maintain at its expense in Chicago, Illinois, an office or offices or agency or
agencies where notices and demands to or upon the Trustee in respect of the
Certificates and the Pooling and Servicing Agreements may be served. The Trustee
will give prompt written notice to the Company, the Servicer and the Holders of
any change in the location of the Certificate Register or any such office or
agency.

          Section 8.17  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. The Certificates are executed
by the Trustee, not in its individual capacity but solely as Trustee of the
Trust, in the exercise of the powers and authority conferred and vested in it by
this Agreement. Each of the undertaking and agreements made on the part of the
Trustee in the Certificates is made and intended not as a personal undertaking
or agreement by the Trustee but is made and intended for the purpose of binding
only the Trust.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   TERMINATION

          Section 9.1   TERMINATION OF TRUST. The Trust and the respective
obligations and responsibilities of the Company, the Servicer and the Trustee
created hereby (other than the obligation of the Trustee to make payments to
Holders as hereafter set forth or of the Company to prepare or cause to be
prepared and filed tax or information reports as provided in Section 8.11
hereof) shall terminate, except with respect to any such obligations or
responsibilities expressly stated to survive such termination, on the earliest
of (i) April 1, 2018 (ii) at the option of the Company upon 10 Business Day's
prior written notice, at any time where the Aggregate Invested Amount is zero
(unless an Early Amortization Event as specified in Section 7.1 of this
Agreement shall have occurred and be continuing, in which case the Company shall
be deemed to elect to terminate the Trust pursuant to this clause (ii)) and
(iii) upon completion of distribution of the amounts referred to in Section
7.2(b) (the "TRUST TERMINATION DATE").

          Section 9.2   CLEAN-UP CALL AND FINAL TERMINATION DATE OF INVESTOR
CERTIFICATES OF ANY SERIES. (a) On the Distribution Date during the Amortization
Period with respect to any Series on which the Invested Amount (or such other
amount as may be set forth in the related Supplement) of such Series is reduced
to an amount equal to or less than the Clean-Up Call Percentage of the Invested
Amount

                                       87
<Page>

for such Series as of the day preceding the beginning of such Amortization
Period (or such other amount as may be set forth in the related Supplement), the
Servicer shall have the option to repurchase, and to the extent set forth in the
related Supplement, shall repurchase, the entire Certificateholders' Interest of
such Series, at a purchase price equal to (i) the outstanding Invested Amount of
the Investor Certificates of such Series PLUS (ii) accrued and unpaid interest
through the date of such purchase (after giving effect to any payment of
principal and monthly interest on such date of purchase) PLUS (iii) all other
amounts payable to all Investor Certificateholders of such Series under the
related Supplement (such purchase price, the "CLEAN-UP CALL REPURCHASE PRICE").
The amount of the Clean-Up Call Repurchase Price will be deposited into the
Collection Account for credit to the Series Collection Subaccount for such
Series on the Business Day prior to such Distribution Date in immediately
available funds and will be passed through in full to the applicable Investor
Certificateholders. Following any such repurchase, such Certificateholders'
Interest in the Trust Assets shall terminate and such interest therein will be
allocated to the Company Interest and such Holders will have no further rights
with respect thereto. In the event that the Servicer fails for any reason to
deposit the Clean-Up Call Repurchase Price for such Receivables, the
Certificateholders' Interest in the Receivables and the other Trust Assets will
continue and monthly payments will continue to be made to the Holders.

                  (b)   The amount deposited pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall be
paid to the Investor Certificateholders of the related Series pursuant to
Article III on the Distribution Date following the date of such deposit. All
Certificates of a Series which are purchased by the Servicer pursuant to Section
9.2(a) shall be delivered by the Servicer upon such purchase to, and be canceled
by (in accordance with the written directions of the Servicer), the Transfer
Agent and Registrar and be disposed of in a manner satisfactory to the Trustee
and the Servicer.

          Section 9.3   FINAL PAYMENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY SERIES. (a) Written
notice of any termination, specifying the Distribution Date upon which the
Investor Certificateholders of any Series may surrender their Investor
Certificates for payment of the final distribution with respect to such Series
and cancellation, shall be given (subject to at least 30 days' (or such shorter
period as is acceptable to the Trustee as determined in its sole and absolute
discretion) prior written notice from the Servicer to the Trustee containing all
information required for the Trustee's notice) by the Trustee to Investor
Certificateholders of such Series, mailed not later than the fifth Business Day
of the month of such final distribution and specifying (i) the Distribution Date
upon which final payment of the Investor Certificates will be made upon
presentation and surrender of Investor Certificates at the office or offices
therein designated, (ii) the amount of any such final payment and (iii) that the
Record Date otherwise applicable to such Distribution Date is not applicable,
payments being made only upon presentation and surrender of the Investor
Certificates at the

                                       88
<Page>

office or offices therein specified. The Servicer's notice to the Trustee in
accordance with the preceding sentence shall be accompanied by an Officer's
Certificate setting forth the information specified in Section 4.3 of the
Servicing Agreement covering the period during the then current calendar year
through the date of such notice. The Trustee shall give such notice to the
Transfer Agent and Registrar and the Paying Agent at the time such notice is
given to such Investor Certificateholders.

                  (b)   Notwithstanding the termination of the Trust pursuant to
Section 9.1(a) or the occurrence of the Series Termination Date with respect to
any Series pursuant to Section 9.2, all funds then on deposit in the Collection
Account (but only to the extent necessary to pay all outstanding and unpaid
amounts to Certificateholders) shall continue to be held in trust for the
benefit of the Certificateholders, and the Paying Agent or the Trustee shall pay
such funds to the Certificateholders upon surrender of their Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof. Any Certificate not surrendered on the date
specified in Section 9.3(a)(i) shall cease to accrue any interest provided for
such Certificate from and after such date. In the event that all of the Investor
Certificateholders shall not surrender their Certificates for cancellation
within six months after the date specified in the above mentioned written
notice, the Trustee shall give a second written notice to the remaining Investor
Certificateholders of such Series to surrender their Certificates for
cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect thereto. If within
one year after the second notice all the Investor Certificates of such Series
shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Trustee may take
appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to contact
the remaining Investor Certificateholders of such Series concerning surrender of
their Certificates, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the funds in the
Collection Account held for the benefit of such Investor Certificateholders. The
Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any monies
held by them for the payment of principal or interest that remains unclaimed for
two years. After payment to the Company, Holders entitled to the money must look
to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned
property law designates another Person.

                  (c)   All Certificates surrendered for payment of the final
distribution with respect to such Certificates and cancellation shall be
canceled by the Transfer Agent and Registrar and be disposed of in a customary
manner satisfactory to the Trustee.

          Section 9.4   COMPANY'S TERMINATION RIGHTS. Upon the termination of
the Trust pursuant to Section 9.1 and the surrender of the Exchangeable Company
Interest and payment to the Trustee (in its capacity as such and/or in its
capacity as Successor Servicer) of all amounts owed to it under any Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, the Trustee shall assign and convey to the Company (without
recourse,

                                       89
<Page>

representation or warranty) in exchange for the Exchangeable Company Interest
all right, title and interest of the Trust in the Trust Assets, whether then
existing or thereafter created, and all proceeds thereof except for amounts held
by the Trustee pursuant to Section 9.3(b). The Trustee shall execute and
deliver, at the Company's sole cost and expense, such instruments of transfer
and assignment, in each case without recourse, representation or warranty, as
shall be reasonably requested by the Company to vest in the Company all right,
title and interest which the Trust had in the Trust Assets.

                                    ARTICLE X

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

          Section 10.1  AMENDMENT. (a) Any Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
including any schedule or exhibit thereto, may be amended in writing from time
to time by the Servicer, the Company and the Trustee, without the consent of any
holder of any outstanding Certificate, (i) to cure any ambiguity therein, (ii)
to correct or supplement any provisions therein which may be inconsistent with
any other provisions therein or (iii) to add any other provisions thereto to
change in any manner or eliminate any of the provisions with respect to matters
or questions raised under any Pooling and Servicing Agreement which shall not be
inconsistent with the provisions of any other Pooling and Servicing Agreement;
provided, however, that such action shall not, as evidenced by an Officer's
Certificate from the Company and, to the extent, in the reasonable view of the
Company, a question of law exists, supported by an Opinion of Counsel delivered
to the Trustee, adversely affect in any material respect the interests of the
Investor Certificateholders. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to,
enter into any such amendment pursuant to this paragraph or paragraph (b) below
which affects the Trustee's rights, duties or immunities under any Pooling and
Servicing Agreement or otherwise.

                  (b)   Any Pooling and Servicing Agreement and any schedule or
exhibit thereto may also be amended in writing from time to time by the
Servicer, the Company and the Trustee with the consent of Investor
Certificateholders evidencing more than 50% of the Invested Amount of any Series
adversely affected by the amendment (or, if any such Series shall have more than
one Class of Investor Certificates adversely affected by the amendment, 50% or
more of the Invested Amount of each such Class) for the purpose of adding any
provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of
such Pooling and Servicing Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of
holders of any Series then issued and outstanding; provided, however, that no
such amendment shall (i) reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing
of, distributions which are required to be made on any Investor Certificate of
such Series without the consent of such Investor Certificateholder of such
Series; (ii) change the definition of or the manner

                                       90
<Page>

of calculating the interest of any Investor Certificateholder of such Series
without the consent of such Investor Certificateholder; or (iii) reduce the
aforesaid percentage of Fractional Undivided Interests the holders of which are
required to consent to any such amendment in each case without the consent of
all Holders of each Series adversely affected in any material respect.

                  (c)   Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.1 to the
contrary, the Supplement with respect to any Series may be amended on the terms
and with the procedures provided in such Supplement.

                  (d)   The Company or the Servicer shall deliver any proposed
amendment to each Agent at least five days prior to the execution and delivery
thereof.

                  (e)   Promptly after the execution of any such amendment or
consent the Trustee shall furnish written notification of the substance of such
amendment to each Holder of each Outstanding Series (or with respect to an
amendment of a Supplement, of the applicable Series), and the Servicer shall
furnish written notification of the substance of such amendment to each Rating
Agency. No such amendment (including, without limitation, the amendment of any
Supplement, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any
Supplement) shall be effective until the Rating Agency Condition has been
satisfied with respect thereto.

                  (f)   It shall not be necessary for the consent of Investor
Certificateholders under this Section 10.1 to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the
substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the
authorization of the execution thereof by Investor Certificateholders shall be
subject to such reasonable requirements as the Trustee may prescribe.

                  (g)   In executing or accepting any amendment pursuant to this
Section 10.1, the Trustee shall, upon request, be entitled to receive and rely
upon (i) an Opinion of Counsel (A) stating that such amendment is authorized
pursuant to a specific provision of a Pooling and Servicing Agreement and
complies with such provision, and (B) stating that all conditions precedent to
the execution and delivery of such amendment shall have been satisfied in full,
which opinion in the case of this clause (B) may, to the extent that such
opinion concerns questions of fact, rely on an Officer's Certificate with
respect to such questions of fact, (ii) a certificate from a Responsible Officer
of the Company stating that such amendment does not adversely affect the
interests of the holders of any outstanding Certificates in any material respect
except for holders of the Series whose consent to such amendment has been
obtained in accordance with clause (b) of this Section 10.1 and (iii) a Tax
Opinion.

          Section 10.2  PROTECTION OF RIGHT, TITLE AND INTEREST TO TRUST. (a)
The Servicer shall cause this Agreement, any Supplement, all amendments hereto
and/or all financing statements and continuation statements and any other
necessary documents covering the Certificateholders' and the Trustee's right,
title and interest to the Trust to be promptly recorded, registered and filed,
and at all times to be kept recorded, registered and filed, all in such manner
and in such places as may be required by law fully to preserve and protect the
right, title and interest of the Trustee hereunder to all property comprising
the Trust. The Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee file-stamped copies of, or
filing receipts for, any document recorded, registered or filed as provided
above, as soon as available following such recording, registration or filing.
The Company shall cooperate fully with the Servicer in connection with the
obligations set forth above and will execute any and all documents reasonably
required to fulfill the intent of this Section 10.2(a).

                  (b)   With respect to any prospective changes in its name,
jurisdiction of organization, identity or limited liability company or other
organizational structure or its "location" (within the meaning of Section 9-307
of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions), the Company shall comply fully with
Section 2.8(m) hereof and shall file such financing statements or amendments as
may be necessary to continue the perfection of the Trust's security interest in
the Receivables, Related Property (to the extent perfection therein may be
achieved by the filing of a financing statement in the jurisdiction of the
Company's location within the meaning of Section 9-307 of the UCC of the
applicable jurisdiction), Collections and the proceeds thereof. If the Company
determines that no refining is required, it shall provide to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel so stating.

                  (c)   If the Company or the Servicer fails to perform any of
its obligations under this Section 10.2, the Trustee may (but shall not be
required to) perform, or cause performance of, such obligations, and the
Trustee's costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be payable
as provided in SECTION 8.5. The authorization by the Company and the Servicer
set forth in the second sentence of this subsection (c) is intended to meet all

          Section 10.3  LIMITATION ON RIGHTS OF HOLDERS. (a) The death or
incapacity of any Holder shall not operate to terminate this Agreement or the
Trust, nor shall such death or incapacity entitle such Holder's legal

nor otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties
hereto or any of them.

                  (b)   Except with respect to the Investor Certificateholders
as expressly provided in any Pooling and Servicing Agreement, no Investor
Certificateholder, solely by virtue of its status as an Investor
Certificateholder, shall have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise
control the operation and management of the Trust, or the obligations of the
parties hereto, nor shall any Investor Certificateholder be under any liability
to any third person by reason of any action taken by the parties to this
Agreement pursuant to any provision hereof.

                  (c)   No Investor Certificateholder, solely by virtue of its
status as an Investor Certificateholder, shall have any right by virtue of any
provisions of this Agreement to institute any suit, action or proceeding in
equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Agreement, unless such
Investor Certificateholders previously shall have given to the Trustee written
request to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as Trustee
hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such indemnity as it may require
against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby,
and the Trustee, for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer
of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit
or proceeding; it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted
by each Investor Certificateholder with every other Investor Certificateholder
and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders shall have any right in any manner
whatever by virtue of or by availing itself or themselves of any provisions of
the Pooling and Servicing Agreements to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights
of any other of the Investor Certificateholders, or to obtain or seek to obtain
priority over or preference to any other such Investor Certificateholder, or to
enforce any right under this Agreement, except in the manner herein provided and
for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Investor Certificateholders.
For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section 10.3, each
and every Investor Certificateholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such
relief as can be given either at law or in equity.

                  (d)   By their acceptance of Certificates pursuant to this
Agreement and the applicable Supplement, the Holders expressly agree to the
provisions of this Section 8.5 and Section 10.3.

          Section 10.5  SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If any one or more of the
covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of any Pooling and Servicing
Agreement shall for any reason whatsoever be held invalid, then such covenants,
agreements, provisions or terms shall be deemed severable from the remaining

contained herein, except as provided in Section 5.3 of the Servicing Agreement,

          Section 10.7  CERTIFICATES NONASSESSABLE AND FULLY PAID. It is the
intention of the parties to each Pooling and Servicing Agreement that the
Investor Certificateholders shall not be personally liable for obligations of
the Trust, that the interests in the Trust represented by the Investor

for any reason whatsoever and that Investor Certificates upon authentication
thereof by the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.2 are and shall be deemed fully
paid.

          Section 10.8  FURTHER ASSURANCES. The Company and the Servicer agree

without limitation, the execution of any financing statements or continuation
statements relating to the Receivables for filing under the provisions of the
UCC of any applicable jurisdiction.

          Section 10.9  NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure to exercise
and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Trustee or the Investor
Certificateholders, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and
not exhaustive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

          Section 10.10 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts (and by different parties on separate counterparts), each of
which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and
the same instrument.

the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, the Holders and their

any Supplement.

          Section 10.12 ACTIONS BY HOLDERS. (a) Wherever in any Pooling and
Servicing Agreement a provision is made that an action may be taken or a notice,

                  (b)   Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other act by an Investor Certificateholder shall bind such
Investor Certificateholder and every subsequent holder of such Certificate
issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in
lieu thereof in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by the Trustee,
the Company or the Servicer in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such
action is made upon such Certificate.

otherwise herein, this Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of the
parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and all prior understandings,
written or oral, are superseded by this Agreement and the Servicing Agreement.

or supplemented except as provided herein.

          Section 10.14 HEADINGS. The headings herein are for purposes of
reference only and shall not otherwise affect the meaning or interpretation of

interest in all of the Company's right, title and interest in, to and under the
Receivables and the other Trust Assets now existing and hereafter created, all
monies due or to become due and all amounts received with respect thereto and
all "proceeds" thereof (including Recoveries), to secure all of the Company's
and the Servicer's obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, the
Company's obligation to sell or transfer Receivables hereafter created to the
Trust.

                  (b)   This Agreement shall constitute a security agreement
under applicable law.

          Section 10.16 NO SET-OFF. Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement and specifically in SECTION 3.1(g), the Trustee agrees that it shall
have no right of set-off or banker's lien against, and no right to otherwise
deduct from, any funds held in the Collection Account for any amount owed to it
by the Company, the Servicer or any Investor Certificateholder.

          Section 10.17 NO BANKRUPTCY PETITION. The Servicer hereby covenants
and agrees that, prior to the date which is one year and one day after the date
of the end of the Amortization Period with respect to all Outstanding Series, it
will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, the
Company any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
proceedings,

                                       96
<Page>

or other proceedings under any federal or state bankruptcy law or Cayman Islands
bankruptcy law or similar law.

          Section 10.18 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. It is expressly understood and
agreed by the parties hereto that (a) each Pooling and Servicing Agreement is
executed and delivered by the Trustee, not individually or personally but solely
as Trustee of the Trust, in the exercise of the powers and authority conferred
and vested in it, (b) the representations, undertakings and agreements herein
made on the part of the Trust are made and intended not as personal
representations, undertakings and agreements by the Trustee, but are made and
intended for the purpose of binding only the Trust, (c) nothing herein contained
shall be construed as creating any liability of the Trustee, individually or
personally, to perform any covenant either expressed or implied contained
herein, all such liability, if any, being expressly waived by the parties who
are signatories to this Agreement and by any Person claiming by, through or
under such parties; provided, however, the Trustee shall be liable in its
individual capacity for its own willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence and
(d) under no circumstances shall the Trustee be personally liable for the
payment of any indebtedness or expenses of the Trust or be liable for the breach
or failure of any obligation, representation, warranty or covenant made or
undertaken by the Trust under any Pooling and Servicing Agreement; provided
further, that the foregoing clauses (a) through (d) shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Trustee.

          Without limiting any other rights that the Trustee or any Holder may
have hereunder or under applicable law, (A) the Company hereby agrees to
indemnify (and pay upon demand to) the Trustee and the Trust for the benefit of
the Holders, and their respective assigns, officers, directors, agents and
employees (each an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against any and all damages,
losses, claims, taxes, liabilities, costs, expenses and for all other amounts
payable, including reasonable attorneys' fees (which attorneys may be employees
of the Indemnified Party, provided that such fees of attorneys that are
employees of any Indemnified Party shall not be duplicative of the fees of any
third-party attorneys retained by such Indemnified Party) and disbursements (all
of the foregoing being collectively referred to as "INDEMNIFIED AMOUNTS")
awarded against or incurred by any of them arising out of or as a result of any
Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the
acquisition, either directly or indirectly, by the Trustee or a Holder of an
interest in the Trust or Trust Assets, and (B) the Servicer hereby agrees to
indemnify (and pay upon demand to) each Indemnified Party for Indemnified
Amounts awarded against or incurred by any of them arising out of the Servicer's
activities as Servicer hereunder excluding, however, in all of the foregoing
instances under the preceding clauses (A) and (B):

                                       97
<Page>

                          (i)  Indemnified Amounts to the extent a final
     judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction holds that such Indemnified
     Amounts resulted from gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
     the Indemnified Party seeking indemnification;

                         (ii)  Indemnified Amounts to the extent the same
     includes losses in respect of Receivables that are uncollectible on account
     of the insolvency, bankruptcy or lack of creditworthiness of the related
     Obligor; or

                        (iii)  Excluded Taxes to the extent that the computation
     of such taxes is consistent with the intended characterization for income
     tax purposes of the acquisition by the Holders of the Certificates (or any
     interest therein) as a loan or loans by the Holders to the Company secured
     by the Receivables, and other Trust Assets;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained in this sentence shall limit the
liability of the Company or the Servicer or limit the recourse of the Trustee or
any Holder to the Company or the Servicer for amounts otherwise specifically
provided to be paid by the Company or the Servicer, as applicable, under the
terms of any Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing indemnification, the Company shall indemnify each Indemnified
Party for Indemnified Amounts (including, without limitation, losses in respect
of uncollectible receivables, regardless of whether reimbursement therefor would
constitute recourse to the Company or the Servicer) relating to or resulting
from:

                          (i)  any representation or warranty made by the
     Company, the Servicer, the Support Provider or any Seller (or any officers
     of any such Person) under or in connection with any Pooling and Servicing
     Agreement or any other Transaction Document or any other information or
     report delivered by any such Person pursuant hereto or thereto, which shall
     have been false or incorrect when made or deemed made;

                         (ii)  the failure by the Company, the Servicer, the
     Support Provider or any Seller to comply with any applicable law, rule or
     regulation with respect to any Receivable or contract, agreement or
     instrument related thereto, or the nonconformity of any Receivable or
     contract, agreement or instrument related thereto included therein with any
     such applicable law, rule or regulation or any failure of any Seller to
     keep or perform any of its obligations,

                                       98
<Page>

     express or implied, with respect to any contract, agreement or instrument
     related thereto;

                        (iii)  any failure of the Company, the Servicer, the
     Support Provider or any Seller to perform its duties, covenants or other
     obligations in accordance with the provisions of any Pooling and Servicing
     Agreement or any other Transaction Document;

                         (iv)  any products liability, personal injury or damage
     suit, or other similar claim arising out of or in connection with
     merchandise, insurance or services that are the subject of Receivable or
     any contract, agreement or instrument related thereto;

                          (v)  any dispute, claim, offset or defense (other than
     discharge in bankruptcy of the Obligor) of the Obligor to the payment of
     any Receivable (including, without limitation, a defense based on such
     Receivable or the related contract, agreement or instrument not being a
     legal, valid and binding obligation of such Obligor enforceable against it
     in accordance with its terms), or any other claim resulting from the sale
     of the merchandise or service related to such Receivable or the furnishing
     or failure to furnish such merchandise or services;

                         (vi)  the commingling of Collections of Receivables at
     any time with other funds;

                        (vii)  any investigation, litigation or proceeding
     related to or arising from any Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any other
     Transaction Document, the transactions contemplated hereby, the ownership
     of the Certificates (or any interest therein) or any other investigation,
     litigation or proceeding relating to the Company, the Servicer, the Support
     Provider or any Seller in which any Indemnified Party becomes involved as a
     result of any of the transactions contemplated hereby;

                       (viii)  any inability to litigate any claim against any
     Obligor in respect of any Receivable as a result of such Obligor being
     immune from civil and commercial law and suit on the grounds of sovereignty
     or otherwise from any legal action, suit or proceeding;

                         (ix)  any Bankruptcy Event relating to the Company, the
     Servicer, the Support Provider, any Seller or any of their respective
     Subsidiaries;

                                       99
<Page>

                          (x)  any failure of the Company to acquire and
     maintain legal and equitable title to, and ownership of any Receivable and
     the Related Property and Collections with respect thereto from USFS, free
     and clear of any Lien (other than as created hereunder); or any failure of
     the Company to give reasonably equivalent value to USFS under the USFS
     Receivables Sale Agreement in consideration of the transfer by USFS of any
     Receivable, or any attempt by any Person to void such transfer under
     statutory provisions or common law or equitable action;

                         (xi)  any failure of USFS to acquire and maintain legal
     and equitable title to, and ownership of any Receivable and the Related
     Property and Collections with respect thereto from any Seller, free and
     clear of any Lien (other than as created hereunder); or any failure USFS to
     give reasonably equivalent value to any Seller under the USSC Receivables
     Sale Agreement in consideration of the transfer by such Seller of any
     Receivable, or any attempt by any Person to void such transfer under
     statutory provisions or common law or equitable action;

                        (xii)  any failure to vest and maintain vested in the
     Trustee for the benefit of the Trust and the Holders, or to transfer to the
     Trustee for the benefit of the Trust and the Holders, legal and equitable
     title to, and ownership of, a first priority perfected undivided percentage
     ownership interest or security interest in the Receivables, the Related
     Property and the Collections, free and clear of any Lien (except as created
     by the Transaction Documents);

                       (xiii)  the failure to have filed, or any delay in
     filing, financing statements or other similar instruments or documents

     respect to any Receivable, the Related Property and Collections with
     respect thereto, and the proceeds of any thereof;

                        (xiv)  any action or omission by the Company, the
     Servicer, the Support Provider or any Seller which reduces or impairs the
     rights of the Trustee or the Holders with respect to any Receivable or the
     value of any such Receivable;

                         (xv)  any attempt by any Person to void the transfer of
     the Trust Assets hereunder under statutory provisions or common law or
     equitable action; and

                                      100
<Page>

                        (xvi)  the failure of any Receivable included in the
     calculation of the Series 2003-1 Allocated Receivables Amount as an

IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY THE COMPANY
OR THE SERVICER AGAINST THE TRUSTEE OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE TRUSTEE INVOLVING,

          Section 10.23 CURRENCY CONVERSION AND CURRENCY INDEMNITY.

                  (a)   PAYMENTS IN AGREED CURRENCY. The Company shall make
payment relative to any monetary obligation (a "MONETARY OBLIGATION") under any
Transaction Document in Dollars (the "AGREED CURRENCY"). If any payment is
received on account of any Monetary Obligation in any currency (the "OTHER
CURRENCY") other than the Agreed Currency (whether voluntarily or pursuant to an
order or judgment or the enforcement thereof or the realization of any
collateral or the liquidation of the Company or otherwise howsoever), such
payment shall constitute a discharge of the liability of the Company hereunder
and under the other Transaction Documents in respect of such Monetary Obligation
only to the extent of the amount of the Agreed Currency which the relevant
Holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, is able to purchase with the amount
of the Other Currency received by it on the Business Day next following such
receipt in accordance with its normal procedures and after deducting any premium
and costs of exchange.

                  (b)   CONVERSION OF AGREED CURRENCY INTO JUDGMENT CURRENCY.
If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment in any court in any
jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into a particular currency (the
"JUDGMENT CURRENCY") any amount due in the Agreed Currency then the conversion
shall be made on the basis of the rate of exchange prevailing on the next
Business Day following the date such judgment is given and in any event the
Company shall be obligated to pay the Trustee and the Holders any deficiency in
accordance with subsection (c) below. For the foregoing purposes "rate of
exchange" means the rate at which the Holder or the Trustee, as applicable, in
accordance with its normal banking procedures is able on the relevant date to
purchase the Judgment Currency with the Agreed Currency after deducting any
premium and costs of exchange.

                  (c)   CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO INDEMNITY. To the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, if (i) any Holder or the Trustee receives
any payment or payments on account of the liability of the Company hereunder
pursuant to any judgment or order in any Other Currency, and (ii) the amount of
the Agreed Currency which the relevant Holder or the Trustee, as applicable, is
able to purchase on the Business Day next following such receipt with the
proceeds of such payment or payments in accordance with its normal procedures
and after deducting any premiums and costs of exchange is less than the amount
of the Agreed Currency due in respect of such liability immediately prior to
such judgment or order, then the

                                      102
<Page>

Company, within five (5) Business Days of demand shall, and the Company hereby
agrees to, indemnify the Holders and the Trustee from and against any loss, cost
or expense arising out of or in connection with such deficiency.

                  (d)   INDEMNITY SEPARATE OBLIGATION. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the agreement of indemnity provided for in
subsection (c) above shall constitute an obligation separate and independent
from all other obligations contained in this Agreement, shall give rise to a
separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any
indulgence granted by the Holders or the Trustee or any of them from time to
time, and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment
or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any
judgment or order.

          Section 10.24 CONFIRMATION AND RATIFICATION OF TERMS. The effect of
this Agreement is to amend and restate the Original Agreement, and to the extent
that any rights, benefits or provisions in favor of any party to the Original

          Section 3.    ACCESS TO LOCKBOX. The Lockbox Agent shall have
unrestricted and exclusive access to the Lockbox for the purpose of retrieving

herein.

          Section 4.    BAILMENT. The removal of checks, drafts, notes, money
orders or other orders for payment (hereinafter referred to collectively as
"ITEMS") or cash from the Lockbox shall create a bailment, with the Lockbox
Agent as bailee and the Trustee as bailor, and in connection therewith, the
Lockbox Agent hereby agrees and acknowledges that it will hold possession of all
such Items and cash for the benefit of the Trustee. Such bailor-bailee
relationship shall continue until such Items or cash are received at the Branch

this Agreement, at which time the Trustee shall be a depositor of the Lockbox
Agent with respect to the Lockbox Account. The Lockbox Agent further agrees that
if the Lockbox Agent receives any instruction originated by the Trustee

will comply with such instruction without further consent of the Company,
USSRecCo or any other person or entity, and the Trustee shall have "control"
over the Lockbox Account as provided in the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in
the State of New York. In addition to the cash and Items removed from the
Lockbox, the bailor-bailee relationship described above shall also apply to the
any other contents removed from the Lockbox.

received in the Lockbox, and will open such envelopes and remove the contents
thereof, at the frequency and times specified in Section 6 hereof. Items
contained in the envelopes will be inspected and handled in accordance with the
Lockbox Procedures unless otherwise instructed in writing by the Trustee (with
notice to the Company five (5) Business Days prior to the implementation of such
changes).

          Items that are not acceptable for deposit under this Section 4 will
not be deposited into the Lockbox Account, but will be handled as provided in
the Lockbox Procedures.

          Section 6.    DEPOSIT OF ITEMS. Each Item acceptable for deposit under
Section 4 hereof and all cash will be deposited, for collection, into the
Lockbox Account, and the proceeds of such collection will be credited to the
Lockbox Account upon receipt. In accordance with the Lockbox Procedures, a
photocopy will be taken of each Item and attached to the corresponding envelope
and accompanying

                                        3
<Page>

papers. Photocopies of Items will be accompanied by an adding machine tape or
other detailed listing for each deposit.

          Section 7.    FREQUENCY OF DEPOSIT. In order to maximize daily
receipts and funds availability, the Lockbox Agent will retrieve and open the

Lockbox Account in accordance with the Lockbox Procedures:

     "Credited to the account of the within-named payee, absence of
      endorsement guaranteed (Lockbox Agent)."

          Section 10.   TREATMENT OF NON-DEPOSITED ITEMS; OTHER MAIL. The
following Items will be batched separately and will be forwarded with the daily
remittance materials as provided in Section 10 hereof:

     A.   Items which, pursuant to the Lockbox Procedures, are not deposited for
          collection into the Lockbox Account, and accompanying papers and
          envelopes; and

Company with a copy to the Trustee (unless Trustee shall otherwise notify the
Lockbox Agent), by express mail (or other overnight delivery service) to the
appropriate address set forth on Exhibit A hereto or such other address notified
to the Lockbox Agent in writing. In addition, the Lockbox Agent will provide the

Trustee at its office at 1 Bank One Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60670, or to such

Lockbox Agent from, and hold the Lockbox Agent harmless against, any and all
losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by the Lockbox Agent

<Page>

Seller to, notify each account debtor that has not already been so notified to
send remittances owing to the Company, USSRecCo or any Seller to the Lockbox
(unless such account debtor has otherwise been notified to send such remittance

no event shall the Lockbox Agent be liable to the Company or the Trustee for
failure to follow any of the procedures set forth herein, including, without

failure; strikes or lock-outs; fire or other casualty; riot or civil commotion;
earthquakes, floods, or other acts of God; delay in transportation; or any other

ANYTIME AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE TRUSTEE. ANY REPLACEMENT OF THE LOCKBOX
AGENT SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE TRUSTEE WHICH IN TURN SHALL SERVE AT THE
TRUSTEE'S PLEASURE.

credit

                                        6
<Page>

of the Lockbox Account and that the Lockbox Agent shall be the Trustee's agent
for the purpose of holding and collecting such collateral security. As provided
herein, the Lockbox Account shall be under the control of the Trustee, and the

or USSRecCo shall have any right to withdraw or transfer any amount from the
Lockbox Account. The Lockbox Agent shall take instructions with respect to the
Lockbox Account from no person other than the Trustee and shall comply with any

consent of Company, USSRecCo or any other person or entity.

case given or addressed as aforesaid.

          Section 20.   GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the
State of Illinois. Each of the parties hereto hereby submits to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of any United States Federal or Illinois State court sitting in
Chicago, Illinois for the purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of
the venue of any such proceeding brought in such court and any claim that any
such proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

          Section 21.   MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement shall be effective as of
the date first above written, upon the due execution of this Agreement by each
party hereto. Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be modified or
waived orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the parties

adverse effect on the rights of the Trustee hereunder. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the Lockbox Procedures,
the provisions of this Agreement shall control. This Agreement shall terminate
