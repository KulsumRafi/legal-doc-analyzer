<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.	The Bank made a loan to the Maker evidenced by a certain Revolving Note dated
October 8, 1999 signed by the Maker and payable to the order of the Bank, in the amount of
$15,000,000, as modified by the Modification Revolving Note date June 26, 2000 in the amount
of $25,000,000, a Modification Revolving Note dated November 1, 2000 in the amount of
$25,000,000 and a Modification Revolving Note dated November 1, 2001 in the amount of
$12,000,000 (the "Original Note") (collectively, the Original Note, as extended from time to time
and as extended by this Modification Note, is referred to herein as the "Note"); and</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.	Maker desires to extend the maturity date of the loan and make certain other
modifications, and the Bank is willing, subject to certain conditions, to such extension and other
modifications in accordance with the terms of this Modification Note.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the conditions and
covenants contained herein, the parties agree as follows:</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indebtedness initially evidenced by the Original Note shall be re-evidenced by this
Modification Note and shall continue to be secured by all collateral securing the Original Note,
including, without limitation, 100% of the common stock of Great Southern Bank and any stock
splits, substitutions, proceeds or dividends thereon.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Modification Note is not being delivered in payment for the Original Note and is not
intended to constitute a novation therefor.  To the extent the provisions of this Modification Note
are inconsistent or conflict with the terms of the Original Note or any other prior note evidencing
the same indebtedness, the provisions of this Modification Note shall govern and control.  In all
other respects, the existing terms, conditions and provisions of the Original Note, including,
without limitation, any late charges or expenses, remain in full force and effect and shall be
incorporated by reference herein.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday
under the laws of the United States or the State of Illinois, the due date hereof shall be extended
to the next succeeding business day, and interest shall be payable thereon at the rate specified
during such extension period.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the occurrence of any one or more of the following: (a) default in the payment of
any installment when due hereunder, or (b) default under the Original Note, any prior note
evidencing the same indebtedness, this Modification Note or any of the Loan Documents, or (c)
default under any other agreement now existing or hereafter entered into between the Maker and
the Bank, the holder of the Note, in its sole discretion, may declare the entire remaining balance
on the Note, including all accrued and unpaid interest to be immediately due and payable.
Failure to exercise this option shall not waive the right of the holder to exercise the same in the
event of a later default.</P>

Maker.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Modification Note has been delivered and shall be deemed to have been made at
Chicago, Illinois and shall be interpreted and the rights and liabilities of the parties hereto
determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois.  Whenever possible each
provision of the Note shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under

law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without

respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, shall be, jointly and severally,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	<U>Minimum Loan Advances</U>. All loan advances under this Note shall be in a
minimum amount of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000).</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	<U>Interest Rate</U>.  The outstanding principal amount of this Note outstanding from
time to time shall bear interest at the Interest Rate (as defined below).  Interest shall be calculated
on the basis of a year consisting of 360 days and shall be paid for the actual number of days
elapsed.  As used herein, the phrase "Interest Rate" shall mean, as applicable, the Prime Rate or
the LIBOR Rate plus one and one-quarter of one percent (1.25%), provided that in no event shall
the Interest Rate hereunder be less than three percent (3%) per annum.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.	<U>Prime Rate</U>.  Subject to the right of Maker to convert the interest rate as provided
in Section 4 below, the principal balance of this Note outstanding from time to time shall bear
interest at the Prime Rate per annum.  As used herein, the phrase "Prime Rate" means the rate in
effect from time to time as set by the Bank and called its Prime Rate.  The effective date of any
change in the Prime Rate shall for purposes hereof be the date the rate is changed by the Bank.
The Bank shall not be obligated to give notice of any change in the Prime Rate.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.	<U>Interest Rate Conversion Option</U>.  (a)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Maker
shall provide the Bank with written or oral notice to elect the LIBOR Rate (as defined below)
plus one and one-quarter of one percent (1.25%).</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)	<U>LIBOR Rate</U>.  (i)  For purposes hereof, the phrase "LIBOR Rate" means the per
annum rate of interest at which U.S. dollar deposits in an amount comparable to the amount of
the relevant LIBOR Rate loan and for a period equal to the relevant "Interest Period" (hereinafter
defined) are offered generally to the Bank (rounded upward if necessary, to the nearest 1/16 of
1.00%) in the London Interbank Eurodollar market at 11:00 a.m. (London time) two banking
days prior to the commencement of each Interest Period, such rate to remain fixed for such
Interest Period; and "Interest Period" shall mean successive one, two or three month periods as
selected from time to time by the Maker by notice <br>

<br><br>
<center>2</center><a href="#3">NEXT PAGE</a><br><br><br><br>
<a name="3"></a>

given to the Bank not less than three banking
days prior to the first day of each respective Interest Period; provided that: (a) each such one, two
or three month period occurring after such initial period shall commence on the day on which the
next preceding period expires; (b) the final Interest Period shall be such that its expiration occurs
on or before the stated maturity date of the Note; and (c) if for any reason the Maker shall fail to
select an Interest Period on a timely basis, then it shall be deemed to have selected a one month
Interest Period, with the exception that if at any time an Interest Period expires less than one
month before the maturity date of the Note, then, for the period commencing on such expiration
date and ending on the maturity date, such LIBOR Rate loan shall convert to a loan bearing
interest at the Prime Rate.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)	The Bank's determination of LIBOR as provided above shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error.  Furthermore, if the Bank determines, in good faith (which determination
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error), prior to the commencement of any Interest Period that
(a) U.S. dollar deposits of sufficient amount and maturity for funding any LIBOR Rate loan are
not available to the Bank in the London Interbank Eurodollar market in the ordinary course of
business, or (b) by reason of circumstances affecting the London Interbank Eurodollar market,
adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the rate of interest to be applicable to the
relevant LIBOR Rate loan, the Bank shall promptly notify the Maker and such LIBOR Rate loan
shall automatically convert on the last day of its then-current Interest Period to a loan bearing
interest at the Prime Rate <U>minus</U> one and four-tenths of one percent (-1.40%).  If after the date
hereof either (a) the introduction of, or any change in any applicable law, treaty, rule, regulation
or guideline or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental regulation or
any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority having jurisdiction over the Bank or
its lending office (a "Regulatory Change"), shall, in the opinion of counsel to the Bank, makes it
unlawful for the Bank to make or maintain any LIBOR Rate loan evidenced hereby or (b) for any
other reason the LIBOR Rate loan funding becomes unavailable to the Bank, then the Bank shall
promptly notify the Maker and such LIBOR Rate loan shall automatically convert on the last day
of its then-current Interest Period to a loan bearing interest at the Prime Rate <U>minus</U> one and four-tenths of one percent (-1.40%).</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)	If, for any reason, any LIBOR Rate loan is paid prior to the last banking day of its
then-current Interest Period, the Maker agrees to indemnify the Bank against any loss (including
any loss on redeployment of the funds repaid), cost or expense incurred by the Bank as a result of
such prepayment.  Of any Regulatory Change (whether or not having the force of law) shall (a)
impose, modify or deem applicable any assessment, reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of or loans by, or any other
acquisition of funds or disbursements by, the Bank; (b) subject the Bank or any LIBOR Rate loan
to any tax, duty, charge, stamp tax or fee or change the basis of taxation of payment to the Bank
of principal or interest due from the Maker to the Bank hereunder (other than a change of the
taxation of the overall net inform of the Bank); or (c) impose on the Bank any other condition
regarding such LIBOR Rate loan or the Bank's funding thereof, and the Bank shall determine
(which determination shall be conclusive, absent manifest error) that the result of the foregoing is
to increase the cost to the Bank of making or maintaining such LIBOR Rate loan or to reduce the
amount of principal or interest received by the Bank hereunder, then the Maker shall pay the
Bank, on demand, such additional amounts as the Bank shall, from time to time, determine are
sufficient to compensate and indemnify the Bank for such increased cost or reduced amount.</P>


<P>If Maker shall fail to indicate an interest rate option as aforesaid for any loan advance, such
advance shall be deemed to bear interest at the Prime Rate option as set forth above.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.	<U>Payments</U>.   This Note shall be repaid as follows:</P>
