<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This CONSULTING AGREEMENT is entered into effective as of November 1, 2002, between Questar Market Resources, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the
laws of the state of Utah, with its principal place of business at 180 East 100 South, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111, herein referred to as the "Company," and Gary L. Nordloh of 4058 County Road 57, Box
194, Granby, Colorado 80446, herein referred to as "Mr. Nordloh." (As defined, the term "Company" refers to the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Recitals  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.
Nordloh has retired as an employee of Questar Exploration and Production Company, an affiliate of the Company, and no longer serves as an officer of the Company. He
has substantial knowledge of certain areas of the Company's business and operations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due
to Mr. Nordloh's knowledge regarding Company business and operations, the Company has requested that he perform consulting and advisory services on an irregular,
part-time basis for a one-year period following his retirement. Mr. Nordloh desires to perform such services subject to the terms and conditions set forth below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THEREFORE,
THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section I&#151;Services  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Nordloh will perform consulting and advisory services to the Company as requested from time to time by Mr. Keith O. Rattie or Mr. Charles B. Stanley as
representatives of the Company. Specifically, Mr. Nordloh may be requested to review the Company's strategies and plans and new business and merger/acquisition opportunities, to assist in the
identification and analysis of potential asset and corporate acquisitions, and to advise the Company concerning industry trends and their impact on the Company. He may also be asked to serve as a
witness in litigation or administrative proceedings involving the Company. Mr. Nordloh understands that the Company respects his intelligence, forthrightness and insightful integration of information
and that the Company expects him to exhibit the same characteristics when performing services under this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section II&#151;Place of Work  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company will not provide Mr. Nordloh with a permanent office or other place of work. However, the Company will permit Mr. Nordloh to use an office at the
Company's facilities in Denver, Colorado and access to secretarial services for his work on Company affairs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section III&#151;Time Devoted to Work  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing services under this Agreement, Mr. Nordloh is generally able to establish his own work schedule. He, however, is expected to attend and participate
in meetings of the Company's management team that will be held in Denver, Colorado on a quarterly or bi-monthly basis and that last from four to eight hours. In addition, Mr. Nordloh agrees to make
himself available by telephone for periodic discussions on various business issues, with the frequency of such calls decreasing over time as the Company adjusts to the transition caused by Mr.
Nordloh's retirement. The Company agrees to give Mr. Nordloh reasonable advance notice of meetings in or other travel requirements to Salt Lake City, Utah, or other locations within the Company's area
of operations. Mr. Nordloh agrees to be </FONT></P>

communications. Mr. Nordloh also agrees to devote the necessary time to serve the Company as a director and to attend quarterly Board meetings as long as he remains a director of the Company. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section IV&#151;Payment  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company agrees to pay Mr. Nordloh a retainer of $10,000.00 per month, which is payable on or before the 15th day of each month with the first payment made on
or before November 15, 2002 and
with the last payment made on or before October 15, 2003. The Company will mail or electronically deposit these monthly retainer checks in accordance with Mr. Nordloh's instructions. The Company will
also reimburse Mr. Nordloh for any out-of-pocket expenses he incurs while performing services under this Agreement. Examples of such expenses are the cost of transportation, meals, and lodging if Mr.
Nordloh is required to perform services outside the area of his domicile or if sudden transportation is needed to return to Denver, Colorado. The Company will reimburse reasonable mileage expenses if
Mr. Nordloh is requested to travel out of town to perform responsibilities pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section V&#151;Status  </I></FONT></P>

the Company for any purpose and shall not represent himself as an employee or officer of the Company to third parties. He will not be eligible to participate in any pension or welfare benefit programs
or incentive compensation programs that are provided for employees of the Company other than benefits available to him as a retired employee. Mr. Nordloh understands that he is a retired employee for
purposes of exercising stock options granted by Questar Corporation ("Questar"). The sole benefits for which Mr. Nordloh shall be eligible are benefits available to retirees of Questar or available to
non-employee directors of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As

proposed termination date. Termination of this Agreement prior to October 31, 2003 shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to reimburse Mr. Nordloh for any expenses incurred by him to perform

or attempt to influence any Company employee to terminate his employment to work for Mr. Nordloh directly or any competitor of the Company. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company is not interested in having Mr. Nordloh perform full-time consulting services for it during the term of this Agreement, but the Company's consent is
necessary for Mr. Nordloh to engage in provide consulting services to any customer or competitor of the Company during the term of this Agreement or the non-compete period following its termination.
The Company will not unreasonably withhold such consent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
period of time that this non-competition provision shall remain in effect shall be dependent on the termination of the Agreement. If the Agreement remains in effect

expire on a date that is determined by adding the number of months the Agreement was in effect to the termination date. If Mr. Nordloh terminates the Agreement prior to November 1, 2003, the

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The

and the Company may grant, at its sole discretion, waivers to the foregoing restrictions on a case-by-case basis where the applicability of this Section XI may be in question. Recognizing that
reasonable people may differ in making this determination, the parties agree that, if the scope of enforceability of this provision is disputed at any time, a court or other trier of fact may modify
and enforce this provision to the extent that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances existing at that time. </FONT></P>
