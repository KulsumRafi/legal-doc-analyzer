         orders shall describe the Products ordered and the quantities thereof,
         shall request delivery dates, shall set forth prices and shall provide

         such acceptance, SUPPLIER shall confirm the Requested Shipment Date or
         specify an Alternative Shipment Date ("Acknowledged Shipment Date"). In
         no event shall the delivery date be in excess of six (6) weeks after
         the order is entered by FUTURE.

   (b)   METHOD OF SHIPPING. In the absence of specified instructions from
         FUTURE, the shipping and packaging method will be in the discretion of
         SUPPLIER. SUPPLIER shall, consistent with sound business practice,
         select a method of shipping and packaging which is suitable for the

         Acknowledged Shipment Date, FUTURE shall have the right in its
         discretion to accept or reject any such delivery. If SUPPLIER is

5. PRICES

   The prices for Products purchased under this Agreement shall be at negotiated
   market prices. Should FUTURE purchase any product at prices in SUPPLIER's
   published Distributor Price List, such prices subject to change upon thirty
   (30) calendar days prior written notice, the following shall apply:

   (a)   PRICE INCREASES. Prior to the effective date of a price increase,
         FUTURE may order Products before the price increase takes effect at the
         prior (i.e. lower) price. Furthermore, all Products entered by FUTURE
         prior to notification of a price increase are exempt from the increase
         and will be shipped and invoiced at the price in effect at the time of
         order placement.

   (b)   PRICE DECREASES. In the event SUPPLIER decreases the price of any
         Product, FUTURE shall be entitled to a credit equal to the difference
         between the price paid for the Product by FUTURE (less any prior
         credits granted by SUPPLIER on such Products) and the new decreased
         price for the Product multiplied by the quantity of such Product in
         FUTURE'S inventory on the effective date of the decrease. Similar price
         adjustment, if appropriate, will also be made on all Products in
         transit to FUTURE on the effective date of the price decrease. In order
         to claim such credit, FUTURE shall submit to SUPPLIER, within
         forty-five (45) calendar days following the effective date of such
         price decrease, a report of the Products subject to the price decrease
         and in FUTURE's inventory as of the effective date of the price
         decrease. All Products shipped after the effective date of any price
         decrease will be shipped and invoiced at the price in effect at the
         time of shipment. Credits will be applied to future purchases of
         SUPPLIER Product or to FUTURE's Accounts Receivable with SUPPLIER.

   (c)   DELTA PRICE PROTECTION. In the event SUPPLIER decreases the price of
         any Product below the Market Price for product in FUTURE's inventory,
         than FUTURE shall be entitled to a credit equal to the difference
         between the Market Price paid for the product (less any prior credits
         granted by SUPPLIER on such Products) and the new decreased price for
         the product multiplied by the quantity of such product in FUTURE's
         inventory on the effective date of the decrease. The balance of
         paragraph 5(b) above shall apply as well.

   (d)   SHIP FROM STOCK AND DEBIT. In the event that it should become
         necessary, and on a by exception basis only, FUTURE shall be permitted
         to sell Product to customers on a meet competition basis where FUTURE's
         current costs are not competitive enough for FUTURE to secure the
         orders. Upon receipt of the approval from the SUPPLIER, FUTURE shall be
         entitled to ship from stock a defined quantity and part number(s) to a
         specific customer at or below FUTURE's cost and issue a debit to the
         SUPPLIER for the difference between FUTURE's current cost of the
         Product (less any prior credits granted by SUPPLIER on such Products)
         and the approved new cost issued by the SUPPLIER multiplied by the
         quantity of such Product shipped to the specific customer. In order to
         claim such credit, FUTURE shall submit to SUPPLIER within forty-five
         (45) calendar days after the sale took place, a debit note in
         conjunction with FUTURE's monthly POS and Inventory Reports as
         specified in Paragraph 2 (e). Credits will be applied to future
         purchases of SUPPLIER Product or to FUTURE's Accounts receivable with
         SUPPLIER.

   (e)   REPRESENTATION. SUPPLIER represents and warrants that the prices and
         discounts, if any, extended to FUTURE in connection with the Products
         comply with all applicable laws.

   (f)   F.O.B. All prices are F.O.B. FUTURE's receiving facility.

   (g)   SALES TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES. FUTURE will pay any and all applicable
         sales or use taxes pertaining to its purchase of the Products.

   (h)   RISK OF LOSS. FUTURE shall assume all risk of loss and pay all costs of
         insurance for the Products upon SUPPLIER's delivery thereof to the
         Common Carrier.

6. TERMS OF PAYMENTS

   SUPPLIER will invoice FUTURE upon shipment of each order. Such invoices shall
   be due and payable in full by FUTURE within thirty (30) calendar days
   following date of invoice. FUTURE shall be entitled to a two (2%) percent
   deduction on the net amount of payment when invoices dated the first (1st)
   through the fifteenth (15th) are paid by the twenty-fifth (25th) day of the
   same month, and invoices dated the sixteenth (16th) through the end of the
   month are paid by the tenth (10th) day of the following month, inclusive of
   any month. In the event invoices are not paid within these discount dates,
   then the net thirty (30) day terms shall apply.

7. RETURN OF PRODUCT

   (a)   SEMI-ANNUAL ROTATION. Within forty-five (45) calendar days following
         each period of six (6) consecutive months during the Term, FUTURE may
         return to SUPPLIER, for credit, a quantity of Products the value of ten
         percent (10%) of the net sales dollars invoiced by SUPPLIER to FUTURE
         for all Products purchased by FUTURE during the previous six (6) month
         period. Credit issued for such returned Products will be based upon the
         price paid by FUTURE, less any prior credits granted by SUPPLIER on the
         returned Product and applied against future purchases of Products from
         SUPPLIER. FUTURE may make such returns from one or more stocking
         location(s). The foregoing return privilege shall be subject to the
         following conditions:

         (i)    The Products are returned in merchantable condition;

         (ii)   Prior to returning any Products, FUTURE obtains a Return
                Material Authorization from SUPPLIER.

   (b)   INITIAL STOCK ORDER. Within twelve (12) months following the date of
         this Agreement or the date of any New Product is added hereunder, as
         the case may be, FUTURE may elect to return to SUPPLIER, for credit,
         any and all of such New Products in its inventory. Such return is
         subject to all of the conditions of paragraph (a), (i) and (ii) above.

   (c)   NEW PRODUCTS. For purposes hereof, the term "New products" shall mean
         any and all Products:

         (i)    Ordered by FUTURE under its initial stocking order; or

         (ii)   Added to the Products listed on the Distributor Cost List and
                ordered within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of such
                addition.

8. PRODUCT CHANGES

   (a)   DISCONTINUANCE AND OBSOLESCENCE. SUPPLIER reserves the right to
         discontinue the manufacture or sale of, or otherwise render or treat as
         obsolete, any or all of the Products covered by this Agreement upon at
         least forty-five (45) calendar days prior written notice to FUTURE.
         FUTURE may, in its discretion, within sixty (60) calendar days
         following receipt of such notice, notify SUPPLIER in writing of its
         intention to return any or all Products so discontinued or rendered
         obsolete which remain in FUTURE's inventory and shall receive a credit
         for such Products equal to the price paid by FUTURE for the same
         provided that said Products are returned within forty-five (45)
         calendar days of the date of SUPPLIER's Return Material Authorization.
         SUPPLIER shall pay all freight and shipping charges in connection with
         any such returns. Returns of Products under this paragraph (a) shall
         not be counted as "stock rotation" for purposes of computing the amount
         of Products returnable by FUTURE under paragraph 7 (a).

   (b)   FUTURE shall be granted the exclusive first right of refusal to
         purchase any or all product discontinued or made obsolete as per
         paragraph 8 (a) above. This includes all existing SUPPLIER inventory
         (including recent distributor returns) as well as FUTURE's final
         lifetime buy at quantity levels which are mutually agreeable.

   (c)   MODIFICATION OF PRODUCTS. SUPPLIER shall give FUTURE written notice of
         all engineering modifications that will affect Products in FUTURE's
         inventory if such changes materially affect form, fit, or function. If
         these modifications preclude or materially limit FUTURE's inventory
         from selling once the engineering modifications are implemented,
         SUPPLIER will work with FUTURE to move the affected inventory through
         resale or repurchase. If after the above efforts, affected Product
         still remains in FUTURE's inventory, SUPPLIER agrees to replace it with
         upgraded Products. SUPPLIER shall pay all freight and shipping charges
         in connection with any such returns or replacements. FUTURE returns of
         Product under this paragraph (b) shall not be counted as "stock
         rotation" for purposes of computing the amount of Products returnable
         by FUTURE under paragraph 7 (a).

   (d)   RETURN MATERIAL AUTHORIZATION. A Return Material Authorization shall be
         issued by SUPPLIER no later than fifteen (15) calendar days of any
         request for the same by FUTURE when required in connection with any
         legitimate return under this Agreement.

9. WARRANTY, COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS

   (a)   STANDARD WARRANTY. The Products shall be covered by SUPPLIER's standard
         warranty terms and provisions, provided, however, that the warranty
         coverage shall be no less than the following:

         INITIAL:          /s/ [ILLEGIBLE]             /s/ [ILLEGIBLE]
                           ---------------             ---------------
                              SUPPLIER                      FUTURE

                                       -6-

<PAGE>

(i)      The warranty period set forth therein shall run for one (1) year
         following FUTURE's shipment of the Product to the customer;

(ii)     SUPPLIER shall extend such warranty directly to the customer as if such
         customer had purchased the Products directly from SUPPLIER.

(iii)    SUPPLIER shall warrant the Products against defects in material and
         workmanship under normal use and service, repair or replace at
         SUPPLIER's cost any defective Product (or issue a credit or refund, as
         the case may be, based on the purchase price paid therefor); and

(iv)     SUPPLIER shall pay (or refund the amount of) all freight and shipping
         charges for any defective Products returned under this paragraph.

(b)      COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
         contained by SUPPLIER's standard warranty terms and provisions or
         elsewhere in this Agreement, SUPPLIER shall indemnify FUTURE against,
         and hold it harmless from, any cost, loss, damage or liability
         (including reasonable legal fees) arising from or related to the
         failure of the Products, as manufactured and sold to FUTURE, to fully
         comply with all applicable laws, standards, codes, specifications and
         regulations or the failure of the Products to be suitable thereunder
         for resale or other distribution by FUTURE as contemplated by this
         Agreement. The warranty and indemnification provisions of this
         Agreement shall survive the termination hereof.

10.      INDEMNIFICATION

         SUPPLIER will indemnify, defend and otherwise hold harmless, FUTURE,
         its affiliates and customers from all cost, loss, damage or liability
         arising from any proceeding (legal or equitable) or claim brought or
         asserted against FUTURE, its affiliates or customers, to the extent
         such proceeding or claim is based on an allegation that the Products,
         or any part thereof, or their distribution or use constitute an
         infringement of any United States or Canadian patent, copyright,
         trademark secret or violation of any legislation now or hereafter
         enacted, or like or similar claim, if FUTURE promptly notifies SUPPLIER
         of any such proceeding or claim after it becomes known to FUTURE and
         FUTURE provides all the assistance and cooperation to SUPPLIER that is
         reasonably requested including the right of SUPPLIER to select and
         instruct legal counsel for the purposes of any defence of FUTURE within
         the meaning of this provision. SUPPLIER shall not be liable to FUTURE
         under any provision of this paragraph to the extent that any claim is
         based upon;

(i)      a use for which the Product or part was not designated; or

(ii)     an alteration of the Product or part by FUTURE or a third party under
         FUTURE's direction and which alteration has caused the infringement
         action.

11. TERM AND TERMINATION

   (a)   TERM. The initial effective period of this Agreement is for one (1)
         year commencing on the date indicated on page (1) one. At the
         expiration of such initial effective period or any extended period,
         this Agreement will automatically be renewed and extended indefinitely
         for additional periods of one (1) year unless either SUPPLIER or FUTURE
         shall give the other at least ninety (90) calendar days prior written
         notice of its intention not to have the Agreement so renewed.

   (b)   TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE. Either SUPPLIER or FUTURE may at any time
         terminate this Agreement with or without cause and solely for its own
         convenience by giving ninety (90) calendar days prior written notice to
         the other. Both SUPPLIER and FUTURE represent that they have considered
         the making of expenditures in preparing to perform under this
         Agreement, as well as the possible losses which might result in the
         event of any termination of the Agreement. In that regard, both parties
         acknowledge that neither party shall in any way be liable to the other
         for any loss, expense or damage (including special, consequential, or
         incidental damages) by reason of any termination of this Agreement
         without cause.

   (c)   RETURN OF INVENTORY. In the event SUPPLIER terminates this Agreement
         with or without cause or elects not to renew the same, SUPPLIER shall
         repurchase from FUTURE all unsold Products from FUTURE's inventory at
         the price paid by FUTURE, less any prior credits granted by SUPPLIER on
         such Products. SUPPLIER shall pay all freight and shipping charges in
         connection with such repurchases.

         In the event FUTURE terminates this Agreement with or without cause or
         elects not to renew same, SUPPLIER shall repurchase from FUTURE all
         unsold Products from FUTURE's inventory at the same price as set forth
         in the paragraph (c) above. FUTURE shall pay all freight and shipping
         charges in connection with such purchases. In the event of any
         termination, SUPPLIER shall, if requested to do so by FUTURE, honor any
         open FUTURE purchase orders for customers of SUPPLIER Product then
         outstanding.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, SUPPLIER shall be required to accept
         only those Products which are in good merchantable condition. No
         termination of this Agreement shall affect any obligation of either
         party to pay amounts due to the other hereunder and all such payments
         shall be made when due.

12. COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING

    To assist FUTURE in advertising and promoting the Products, SUPPLIER will
    accrue into a special cooperative advertising fund two percent (2%) of the
    net sales dollars invoiced to FUTURE in a consecutive twelve (12) month
    period. Amounts in such fund shall be used by FUTURE in connection with
    advertising and other promotional efforts approved by both FUTURE and
    SUPPLIER. All unexpended funds for any calendar year in the SUPPLIER portion
    will automatically be carried forward into the next year.

13. WAIVER

    Except as otherwise herein expressly provided, the failure of SUPPLIER to
    enforce at any time or for any period of time the provisions of this
    Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of any such provisions or
    the right of SUPPLIER thereafter to enforce each and every such provision.

14. NOTICES

    Notices and other communications by either party under this Agreement shall
    be deemed given when deposited in the mail system as certified mail, postage
    prepaid, addressed as indicated on page (1) one.

15. TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES

    This Agreement shall not create, and SUPPLIER shall have no right in, or to
    the use of, any trademark, trade name, logo, service mark or other mark,
    identification or name of FUTURE. FUTURE recognizes SUPPLIER's ownership of,
    and right to use, certain trademarks, trade names, logos and other marks and
    names and acknowledges that, except as herein set forth, FUTURE has no right
    in, or to use, any thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, FUTURE is hereby
    granted permission to refer to SUPPLIER's trademarks, trade names, logos and
    other marks and names for the purposes of identifying itself to the public
    as an AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTOR of the Products and for advertising and
    otherwise promoting the resale, lease or servicing of any Products purchased
    under this Agreement, but subject always to SUPPLIER's right to control or
    otherwise direct or instruct FUTURE with regard to the proper authorized use
    thereof.

 16. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

     SUPPLIER and FUTURE shall each receive and maintain in confidence all
     proprietary information, trade secrets or other knowhow  belonging to the
     other (including but not limited to knowledge of manufacturing or technical
     processes, financial and systems data and customer lists) provided that any
     such information, secrets or knowhow is required by any law or governmental
     regulation or the decree of a court having competent jurisdiction or enters
     into the public domain without the act of the party obligated to maintain
     such confidentiality hereunder). Without limiting the foregoing, all books,
     documents, records and other material and information made known to the
     parties by each other are hereby designated as Confidential. Furthermore,
     SUPPLIER shall at all times retain the copyright in SUPPLIER's works
     whether literary, artistic or otherwise, supplied to FUTURE.

17. SPECIAL PURCHASES

    SUPPLIER and FUTURE may at any time during the Term enter into separate
    Agreements for the special purchase of other Products including non-standard
    Products not set forth in SUPPLIER's then current Published Distributor
    Price List and such Agreements shall be subject to all terms and conditions
    hereof unless inconsistent with the terms of such Special Agreement or
    otherwise agreed upon.

18. INVALIDITY OF PROVISIONS

    In the event that any term or provision of this Agreement shall be deemed by
    a court of competent jurisdiction to be overly broad in scope, duration or
    area of applicability, the court considering the same shall have the power
    and is hereby authorized and directed to modify such term or provision to
    limit such scope, duration or area, or all of them, so that such term or
    provision is no longer overly broad and to enforce the same as so limited.
    Subject to the foregoing sentence, in the event any provision of this
    Agreement shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such
    invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to such provision and shall
    not affect or render invalid or unenforceable any other provision of this
    Agreement.

19. CREDITS

    In the event FUTURE is entitled to a credit from SUPPLIER hereunder, the
    amount of such credit will be applied to the purchase of Product or FUTURE's
    Accounts Receivable with SUPPLIER.

20. CONSENT NOT UNREASONABLY WITHHELD

    Whenever any consent, action or authorization is requested of SUPPLIER
    hereunder, such consent, action or authorization will not be unreasonably
    withheld or delayed.

21. FORCE MAJEURE

    Nonperformance under this Agreement shall be excused, and neither party
    shall be liable for any loss, damage, penalty or expense, to the extent that
    such performance is rendered impossible or delayed by fire, flood, acts of
    God or the public enemy, acts of the Government, labour difficulties, riot,
    inability to obtain materials or any other cause where the failure to
    perform or delay is beyond the reasonable control of the nonperforming party
    and without the negligence of such party.

22. RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES

    The relationship between the parties hereto shall be that of independent
    contractors, each being in full control of their own business. Under no
    circumstances shall either party have the right or authority to act or make
    any commitment on behalf of or bind the other or represent the other as its
    agent in any way.
