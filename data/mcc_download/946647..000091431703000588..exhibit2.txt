     As   consideration for the purchase of the Branches:

     (a)  Buyer shall pay Seller a purchase price equal to the sum of the
          following:

     (1)  the "Net Book Value" (as defined in Section 2.2(d) hereof) of the
          Ottawa and McComb Real Property and the Personal Property as of the
          Effective Time;

     (2)  $1,065,000 (an amount equal to the agreed fair market value of the
          Findlay Real Property);

     (3)  a premium for the "Deposit Liabilities" (as defined in Section 2.3(a)
          hereof) and franchise value assigned to the Branches equal to (A)
          10.5% of the average of the daily balances of the total Deposit
          Liabilities, excluding brokered deposits and certificates of deposit,
          for the 20 business days ending the business day before the Closing
          Date (excluding for such purpose of calculation the 15 day extension
          option provided to Buyer in Section 3.1(a)) plus (B) 10.5% of the
          total Deposit Liabilities which are certificates of deposit, excluding
          brokered deposits, at the Closing Date (excluding for such purpose of
          calculation the 15 day extension option provided to Buyer in Section
          3.1(a)), and less (C) $300,000.

     (4)  the "Net Book Value" (as defined in Section 2.2(d) hereof) of the
          Transferred Loans as described in Section 2.4 hereof as of the
          Effective Time; and

     (5)  the face amount of the Coins and Currency.

     (b) Buyer shall assume, as of the Effective Time, all of the duties,
obligations and liabilities of Seller relating to the Deposit Liabilities and to
any of the following accruing or arising on or after the Effective Time: (i) the
Real Property; (ii) the Equipment Leases; (iii) the Safe Deposit Contracts; and
(iv) each contract or written agreement listed on Exhibit 2.2(b) hereto.
Specifically excluded from the above are:

     (1)  liabilities or obligations with respect to any litigation, suits,
          claims, demands or governmental proceedings arising from any fact,
          circumstance or event occurring prior to the Effective Time and
          related to the Branches; and

     (2)  any and all obligations arising under any service agreements entered
          into between Seller and its affiliates.

<PAGE>


     (c) Seller shall prepare a statement (the "Pre-Closing Statement") in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2(b)(14) using the date which is 30 calendar
days prior to the Effective Time anticipated by the parties, instead of the
Effective Time (the "Pre-Closing Statement Date"), as the date for valuing the
assets to be sold and assigned hereunder and the liabilities to be transferred
and assumed hereunder. Seller shall deliver the Pre-Closing Statement not less
than five days before the Closing Date. Seller agrees to pay to Buyer at the
Closing, in immediately available funds, the net cash due to Buyer, if any, as
reflected by the Pre-Closing Statement. Buyer agrees to pay Seller at the
Closing, in immediately available funds, the net cash due to Seller, if any, as
reflected by the Pre-Closing Statement. The payment by Seller to Buyer or by
Buyer to Seller shall be subject to subsequent adjustment based on the
Post-Closing Statement (as defined in Section 3.3 hereof).

     (d) The "Net Book Values" of the Ottawa and McComb Real Property and the
Personal Property are the values at which the relevant assets are carried on
Seller's general ledger and used to compute the values listed on Seller's
balance sheet (net of depreciation) as of the Effective Time. The "Net Book
Value" of the Transferred Loans is the aggregate principal amount of the
Transferred Loans, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as of the Effective
Time, but such value shall not include any loan loss reserves or general
reserve.

     (e) Seller and Buyer agree to allocate the purchase price in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
At the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall reduce the allocation to writing,
including jointly and properly executing a draft Internal Revenue Service Form
8594, subject to post-Closing adjustment to reflect adjustments to the purchase
price as provided in Section 3.3 of this Agreement. Within 90 days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to Seller a proposed allocation of the
purchase price as finally determined and paid by Buyer hereunder. Within 30 days
after the receipt of such allocation, Seller shall propose to Buyer any changes
to such allocation or otherwise shall be deemed to have agreed with such
allocation. Seller and Buyer shall reduce such allocation to writing, including
jointly and properly executing a final, completed Internal Revenue Service Form
8594, and any other forms or statements required by the Code, the treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder or the Internal Revenue Service, together
with any and all attachments required to be filed therewith. Seller and Buyer
shall file timely any such forms and statements with the Internal Revenue
Service. To the extent consistent with applicable law, Seller and Buyer shall
not file any tax return or other documents or otherwise take any position with
respect to taxes which is inconsistent with such allocation of the final
purchase price; provided, however, that neither Seller nor Buyer shall be
obligated to litigate any challenge to such allocation of the final purchase
price by a governmental authority. Seller and Buyer shall promptly inform one
another of any challenge by any governmental authority to any allocation made
pursuant to this Section and agree to consult with and keep one another informed
with respect to the state of, and any discussion, proposal or submission with
respect to, such challenge.

     Section 2.3. Deposit Liabilities.
     ------------ --------------------

     (a) "Deposit Liabilities" shall mean all of Seller's duties, obligations
and liabilities relating to the deposit accounts of the Branches as of the
Effective Time (including accrued but unpaid or uncredited interest thereon).

     (b) Except for those liabilities and obligations specifically assumed by
Buyer under this Agreement, Buyer is not assuming any other liabilities or
obligations. Liabilities not assumed include, but are not limited to, the
following:

     Seller's cashier checks, money orders, traveler's checks, interest checks
     and expense checks issued prior to the Effective Time, consignments of U.S.
     Government "E" and "EE" bonds and any cash items paid by Seller and not
     cleared prior to the Effective Time.

     (c) Seller does not represent or warrant that any deposit customers whose
accounts are assumed by Buyer will continue to be customers of Buyer after the
Effective Time.

     (d) Buyer agrees to pay in accordance with law and customary banking
practices all properly drawn and presented checks, drafts and withdrawal orders
presented to Buyer by mail, over the counter or through the check clearing
system of the banking industry, by depositors of the accounts assumed, whether
drawn on the checks, withdrawal order or draft forms provided by Seller or by
Buyer, and in all other respects to discharge, in the usual course of the
banking business, the duties and obligations of Seller with respect to the
balances due and owing to the depositors whose accounts are assumed by Buyer;
provided that Buyer shall not be obligated to honor or pay any item if there are
insufficient funds in the customer's account when presented.

     (e) If, after the Effective Time, any depositor, instead of accepting the
obligation of Buyer to pay the Deposit Liabilities assumed, shall demand payment
from Seller for all or any part of any such assumed Deposit Liabilities, Seller
shall not be liable or responsible for making any such payment; provided, that
if Seller shall pay the same, Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for any such
payment, and Seller shall not be deemed to have made any representations or
warranties to Buyer with respect to any such check, draft or withdrawal order
and any such representations or warranties implied by law are hereby expressly
disclaimed. Seller and Buyer shall make arrangements to provide for the daily
settlement with immediately available funds by Buyer of checks, drafts,
withdrawal orders, returns and other items presented to and paid by Seller
within 60 calendar days after the Effective Time and drawn on or chargeable to
accounts that have been assumed by Buyer; provided, however, that Seller shall
                                          --------  -------
be held harmless and indemnified by Buyer for acting in accordance with such
arrangements.

     (f) Buyer agrees, at its cost and expense, (i) to notify such depositors,
on or before the Effective Time, in a form and on a date mutually acceptable to
Seller and Buyer, of Buyer's assumption of Deposit Liabilities, (ii) to furnish
such depositors with checks on the forms of Buyer and with instructions to
utilize Buyer's checks and to destroy unused check, draft and withdrawal order
forms of Seller (if Buyer so elects, Buyer may offer to buy from such depositors
their unused Seller check, draft and withdrawal order forms), (iii) to reissue
all automated teller machine and debit cards associated with the assumed Deposit
Liabilities, (iv) to replace all line of credit checks with checks on the forms

<PAGE>

of Buyer with instructions to utilize Buyer's checks and to destroy the unused
checks of Seller and (v) to disable and to notify customers of its disabling of
all credit card overdraft protection or notify the customers of alternative
overdraft protection through a different credit card or line of credit. At its
expense, Seller will prepare and deliver to Buyer two sets of its normal
customer mailing labels relating to the Deposit Liabilities. In addition,
subsequent to regulatory approval, Seller will notify its affected customers by
letter of the pending assignment of Seller's Deposit Liabilities to Buyer, which
notice shall be at Seller's cost and expense and shall be in a form and on a
date mutually agreeable to Seller and Buyer.

     (g) Buyer agrees to pay promptly to Seller an amount equivalent to the
amount of any checks, drafts or withdrawal orders credited to any assumed
Deposit Liabilities as of the Effective Time that are returned to Seller after
the Effective Time.

     (h) As of the Effective Time, Buyer will assume and discharge Seller's
duties and obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions and laws,
rules and regulations that apply to the Deposit Liabilities assumed under this
Agreement.

     (i) As of the Effective Time, Buyer will maintain and safeguard in
accordance with applicable law and sound banking practices all account
documents, deposit contracts, signature cards, deposit slips, canceled items and
other records related to the Deposit Liabilities assumed under this Agreement,
subject to Seller's right of access to such records as provided in this
Agreement.

     (j) Seller will render a final statement to each depositor of an account
assumed under this Agreement as to transactions occurring through the Effective
Time and will comply with all laws, rules and regulations regarding tax
reporting of transactions of such accounts through the Effective Time. Seller
will be entitled to impose normal fees and service charges on a per-item basis,
but Seller will not impose periodic fees or blanket charges in connection with
such final statements. Buyer will comply with all laws, rules and regulations
regarding tax reporting of transactions of such accounts after the Effective
Time.

     (k) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer, at its
expense, will notify all Automated Clearing House ("ACH") originators of the
transfers and assumptions made pursuant to the Agreement; provided, however,
                                                          --------  -------
that, prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with all information
necessary to make such notifications and, provided further, that, at Buyer's
request, Seller will notify all such originators (on behalf of Buyer) also at
the expense of Buyer. For a period of 60 calendar days beginning on the
Effective Time, Seller will honor all ACH items related to accounts assumed
under this Agreement which are mistakenly routed or presented to Seller. Seller
will make no charge to Buyer for honoring such items, and will electronically
transmit such ACH data to Buyer. If Buyer cannot receive an electronic
transmission, Seller will make available to Buyer at Seller's operations center
receiving items from the ACH tapes containing such ACH data. Items mistakenly
routed or presented after the 60-day period will be returned to the presenting
party. Seller and Buyer shall make arrangements to provide for the daily

Seller, and Seller shall be held harmless and indemnified by Buyer for acting in
accordance with this arrangement to accept ACH items.

     (l) For a period of 60 calendar days beginning on the Effective Time, Buyer
will use reasonable efforts consistent with its normal business practices to
collect from Buyer's customers amounts equal to any Visa or MasterCard charge
backs under the MasterCard and Visa Merchant Agreements between Seller and its
customers or amounts equal to any deposit items returned to Seller after the
Effective Time which were honored by Seller prior to the Effective Time and
remit such amounts so collected to Seller. To the extent permitted under
applicable law, Buyer agrees that for a period of 60 calendar days beginning on
the Effective Time, Buyer will promptly freeze and remit to Seller any funds, up
to the amount of the charged back or returned item that had been previously
credited by Seller, if such funds are available in the account to which such
item had previously been credited at the time of notification by Seller to Buyer
of the charged back or returned item. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall
have no duty to remit funds for any item or charge that has been improperly
returned or charged to Seller. Solely for the purposes of this Section 2.3(l),
all references to Seller shall be deemed to include Seller and its assignees.

     (m) As of the Effective Time, Seller shall transfer, assign and deliver to
Buyer all files, documents and records related to the Deposit Liabilities,
including such information held in electronic form, and Buyer will be
responsible for maintaining and safeguarding all such materials in accordance
with applicable law and sound banking practices.

     Section 2.4. Transferred Loans.
     ------------ ------------------

     (a) Seller will transfer to Buyer as of the Effective Time, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, all of Seller's right, title and
interest in (including accrued but unpaid interest and late charges and
collateral relating thereto) the loans identified on Exhibit 2.4(a) hereto and
loans originated at the Branches by Seller after the date of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.9 ("Transferred Loans"). The following shall be
adjustments to the Transferred Loans:

     (1)  up until fourteen (14) calendar days before the Closing Date, Buyer
          may (A) remove loans from Transferred Loans (and thereby make such
          loans retained by Seller (the "Retained Loans")) so long as the
          aggregate Net Book Value of the Retained Loans (the "Retained Loan
          Difference") does not exceed Four Million Five Hundred Thousand
          Dollars ($4,500,000), or (B) include as Transferred Loans under this
          Agreement additional loans ("New Loans") from the pool of Seller loans
          that originally were not made available for purchase and Buyer may add
          loans to the loans retained by Seller in an amount that is not greater
          than the Net Book Value of the New Loans to be included as Transferred
          Loans (for the purpose of this Section any loan shall be valued at its
          Net Book Value as of 14 calendar days before the Closing Date);

     (2)  loans with respect to which foreclosure proceedings have been filed
          prior to the Effective Time shall be excluded from Transferred Loans;

<PAGE>


     (3)  any and all servicing rights on loans sold by Seller in the secondary
          market shall be excluded from Transferred Loans; and

     (4)  the loans described on Exhibit 2.4(a)(4), unless the conditions to be
          satisfied by Seller with respect to each such loan as stated on such
          exhibit are satisfied by Seller, shall be excluded from Transferred
          Loans.

The Transferred Loans (as well as any lien or security interest related thereto)
shall be transferred by means of a blanket (collective) assignment and not
individually (except as may be otherwise required by law or by the policies and
procedures of the office of the recorder in the counties in which the mortgages
securing Transferred Loans are recorded).

     (b) Seller and Buyer agree that Buyer will become the beneficiary of credit
life insurance written on direct consumer installment loans included in the
Transferred Loans and coverage will continue to be the obligation of the current
insurer after the Effective Time and for the duration of such insurance as
provided under the terms of the policy or certificate. Seller agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to assign such policies and certificates to
Buyer, and Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate in good faith to develop a
mutually satisfactory method by which the current insurer will make rebate
payments to and satisfy claims of the holders of such certificates of insurance
after the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, Seller will promptly deliver
to Buyer the proceeds of any credit life insurance received by it and that
relates to Transferred Loans. The parties' obligations under this Section 2.4(b)
are subject to any restrictions contained in existing insurance contracts as
well as applicable laws and regulations.

     (c) In connection with the transfer of any Transferred Loans requiring
notice to the borrower, servicer and/or guarantor, Buyer and Seller will comply
with all notice and reporting requirements of the documents associated with the
Transferred Loans or of any law or regulation.

     (d) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, all Transferred Loans
will be transferred without recourse and without any warranties or
representations whatsoever.

     (e) Buyer will at its expense issue new coupon books or other forms of
payment identification for payment of Transferred Loans for which Seller
provides coupon books with instructions to utilize Buyer's coupons or forms and
to destroy coupons furnished by Seller.

     (f) For a period of 60 calendar days after the Effective Time, Seller will
forward to Buyer payments received by Seller in respect of the Transferred
Loans. Seller shall have the right to return to the borrower any payments
received by it subsequent to 60 days after the Effective Time. Seller shall
promptly notify Buyer of any such payments. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for
checks returned on payments forwarded to Buyer.

     (g) As of the Effective Time, Seller shall transfer, assign and deliver to
Buyer all files, documents and records related to the Transferred Loans,
including such information held in electronic form, and Buyer will be
responsible for maintaining and safeguarding all such materials in accordance
with applicable law and sound banking practices.

<PAGE>


     (h) If a payment by check on a Transferred Loan received prior to the
Effective Time is returned after the Effective Time, the check shall be
delivered to Buyer and Buyer shall promptly remit to Seller the amount
represented by such check.

     (i) Seller shall grant to Buyer as of the Effective Time a limited power of
attorney, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 2.4(i) (the
"Power of Attorney").

     Section 2.5. Safe Deposit Business.
     ------------ ---------------------

     (a) As of the Effective Time, Buyer will assume and discharge Seller's
obligations with respect to the safe deposit box business at the Real Property
in accordance with the terms and conditions of contracts or rental agreements
related to such business, and Buyer will maintain all facilities necessary for
the use of such safe deposit boxes by persons entitled to use them.

     (b) As of the Effective Time, Seller shall transfer, assign and deliver to
Buyer the records related to such safe deposit box business, and Buyer shall
maintain and safeguard all such records and be responsible for granting access
to and protecting the contents of safe deposit boxes at the Real Property.

     (c) Safe deposit box rental payments collected by Seller before the
Effective Time shall be prorated as of the Effective Time.

     Section 2.6. Employee Matters.
     ------------ ----------------

     (a) Buyer may offer employment to those employees of Seller listed on
Exhibit 2.6(a) hereof (the "Employees"), subject to Buyer's standard hiring
procedures, including, but not limited to, drug testing. Buyer will be afforded
an opportunity to meet with and interview the Employees following execution of
this Agreement; however, Buyer shall not extend any offers of employment or
otherwise announce or notify the Employees of Buyer's intentions regarding the
Employees who will be offered employment by Buyer until after receipt of all
necessary regulatory approvals of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The base salary for each Employee who receives an offer of employment
from Buyer and accepts such offer (the "Hired Employees") shall not be less than
the base salary provided by Seller immediately prior to the Effective Time,
subject to changes due to employment classification. With respect to Buyer's
qualified plans, the Hired Employees will be treated as new hires; however,
Hired Employees will immediately participate in welfare benefit plans maintained
by Buyer without regard to pre-existing conditions or waiting periods, if and to
the extent that such employees are participating in Seller's welfare benefit
plans immediately prior to the Closing Date. Hired Employees will be required to
satisfy the deductible and employee payments (if any) required by Buyer's plans.
Hired Employees shall receive full credit for prior service with Seller for
purposes of determining their eligibility and vesting (but not the accrual of
any benefit) under Buyer's employee benefit plans. Hired Employees will be
eligible for severance benefits consistent with Buyer's severance policies or
plans, provided that all service with the Seller shall be taken into account in
determining benefits under Buyer's severance policies or plans. Buyer shall not

<PAGE>

be responsible or liable for any benefits accrued under the pension or welfare
plans of Seller. Buyer will assume and be responsible for any and all accrued
but not paid vacation for Hired Employees for January 1, 2003 through the
Closing Date.

     (b) After the execution of this Agreement, Seller will continue its normal
employment practices in staffing the Branches; however, Seller makes no
representations or warranties about whether any of the Employees will remain
employed at the Branches after the Effective Time. Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) maintain the Employees as employees of Seller at the
Branches until the Effective Time, (ii) refrain from dissuading any Employee
from accepting an offer of employment with Buyer or (iii) refrain from
recruiting Employees for alternate positions with Seller or any of Seller's
affiliates; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.6(b) shall prevent
Seller or any of its affiliates from hiring, transferring or reassigning any
Employee who has applied or posted for an opening with Seller or any of Seller's
affiliates after the date of this Agreement. Seller shall advise Employees that
their current positions will terminate as of the Effective Time. Any Employee
whose employment shall be terminated for any reason prior to the Effective Time
shall be dealt with by Seller in its sole and absolute discretion, provided,
however, that Seller shall notify Buyer of any such terminations. Any Employee
who, for any reason, elects not to accept Buyer's offer of employment shall be
deemed to be part of Seller's pool of unassigned employees and may, after the
Effective Time, be assigned to any openings of Seller or Seller's affiliates or
be terminated by Seller. Seller shall be responsible for any severance owed to
an Employee who is terminated by Seller.

     (c) Except as instructed by any Hired Employee consistent with Seller's
customary policies and practices, Seller will not make any transfer of pension
or other employee benefit plan assets to Buyer.

     (d) Seller and Buyer each with respect to its respective plans, programs
and policies described in this Section 2.6 shall give any notices required by
applicable law and take whatever other actions as may be necessary to carry out
the arrangements described in this Section 2.6.

     (e) If any of the arrangements described in this Section 2.6 are determined
by the Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental authority to be
prohibited by law, Seller and Buyer shall modify such arrangements to as closely
as possible reflect their expressed intent and retain the allocation of economic
benefits and burdens to the parties contemplated herein in a manner that is not
prohibited by law.

     (f) Except as set forth in Section 2.6(c) above, Buyer shall not have any
responsibility, liability or obligation to any current or former employees of
Seller, their beneficiaries or to any other person, with respect to any employee
plans of Seller (including the establishment, operation or termination thereof
and the notification and provision of COBRA coverage extension).

     (g) Seller shall not have any liability with respect to any Hired Employee
or other employee, contractor or service provider of or for Buyer arising out of
or relating to any services provided to Buyer.

     Section 2.7. Records and Data Processing, Etc.
     ------------ ---------------------------------

     (a) As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall become responsible for
maintaining the files, documents and records referred to in this Agreement.
Buyer will preserve and hold them in safekeeping as required by applicable law
and sound banking practice. After the Effective Time, Buyer will permit Seller
and its representatives, for reasonable cause, at reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice, to examine, inspect, copy and reproduce any such files,
documents or records as Seller deems reasonably necessary and to have similar
access to such records and Seller's former employees for purposes of preparation
of records and reports (including regulatory and tax reports and returns) and as
Seller requires in connection with third party litigation.

     (b) As of the Effective Time, Seller will permit Buyer and its
representatives, for reasonable cause, at reasonable times and upon reasonable
notice, to examine, inspect, copy and reproduce files, documents or records
retained by Seller regarding the assets and liabilities transferred under this
Agreement as Buyer deems reasonably necessary.

     (c) For a period of 90 days after the Effective Time, the party providing
copies of records shall do so without charge; thereafter, it may charge its
customary rate for such copies.

     (d) It is understood that certain of Seller's records, including
certificates of deposit, may be available only in electronic form or in the form
of photocopies, film copies or other non-original and non-paper media.

     (e) After the execution of this Agreement, Seller will work with Buyer to
prepare mutually satisfactory schedules of Transferred Assets and contracts to
be sold hereunder.

     Section 2.8. Security and Insurance.
     ------------ -----------------------

     As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall be solely responsible for the
security of and insurance on all persons and property located in or about the
Real Property.

     Section 2.9. Taxes and Fees; Proration of Certain Expenses.
     ------------ ----------------------------------------------

     (a) Buyer shall not be responsible for, or have any liability with respect
to, taxes on any income to Seller arising out of this transaction. Buyer shall
not be responsible for any income tax liability of Seller arising from the
Deposit Liabilities, the Transferred Assets or the business or operations of the
Branches before the Effective Time, and Seller shall not be responsible for any
tax liabilities of Buyer arising from the Deposit Liabilities, the Transferred
Assets or the business or operations of the Branches after the Effective Time.
Utility payments, telephone charges, real property taxes, non-delinquent
assessments, personal property taxes, lease payments, salaries, deposit
insurance premiums or assessments, maintenance items, other ordinary operating
expenses of the Branches and other expenses related to the liabilities assumed

<PAGE>

or assets purchased hereunder shall be prorated between the parties as of the
Effective Time. To the extent any such item has been prepaid by Seller for a
period extending beyond the Effective Time, there shall be a proportionate
monetary adjustment in favor of Seller. Real estate taxes shall be prorated on a
calendar year basis, based upon the current valuation, maximum allowable
discount and other applicable exemptions. Prior to the Effective Time, Seller
will pay all real property taxes due and payable prior to the Effective Time.
The real property tax proration as of the Effective Time shall be final.

     (b) Seller and Buyer shall each be responsible for their own costs with
respect to the preparation and filing of any tax returns and, except as
otherwise provided in Section 3.3(b), the preparation, review and analysis of
the allocation statements and any forms or statements prepared in connection
with the allocation of the final purchase price.

     Section 2.10. Title to Real Property.
     ------------- -----------------------

     (a) Seller agrees to deliver to Buyer within ten (10) days after execution
of this Agreement, copies of all title information in possession of Seller,
including, but not limited to, title insurance policies, attorneys' opinions on
title, surveys, covenants, deeds and easements relating to the Real Property.
Such delivery shall constitute no warranty by Seller as to the accuracy or
completeness thereof or that Buyer is entitled to rely thereon.

     (b) Buyer shall have the right to obtain, at Buyer's sole cost and expense:

     (1)  a title insurance commitment from a title insurance company selected
          by Buyer and an owner's policy of title insurance insuring Buyer's
          title to the Real Property and related easements and rights
          appurtenant thereto; and

     (2)  a survey as is required by the title insurer to remove the survey
          exception in the title insurance policy, to be conducted by a surveyor
          selected by Buyer.

     (c) Buyer agrees to notify Seller, in writing within 45 calendar days after
the date of this Agreement, of any mortgages, pledges, material liens,
encumbrances, reservations, tenancies, encroachments, overlaps or other title
exceptions, survey objections, or zoning or similar land use violations
(excluding legal but nonconforming uses) or material engineering or structural
problems related to the Real Property to which Buyer reasonably objects (the
"Title Defects"). If Buyer does not notify Seller of Title Defects within such
time period, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its rights under this Section
2.10. Buyer agrees that Title Defects shall not include real property taxes not
yet due and payable, legal highways, zoning ordinances, easements, restrictions,
tenancies, survey matters, and rights of way which do not materially interfere
with the use of the Real Property as such facility is currently utilized
("Permitted Encumbrances"; the term "Permitted Encumbrances" shall also include
any title defects, deficiencies, exceptions or encumbrances to which Buyer fails
to object within said 45-day period, or to which Buyer objects within said
45-day period but which Seller does not correct and which Buyer accepts in
writing.) For a period of 30 days after Seller's receipt of such notice of Title
Defects from Buyer, Seller shall make a good faith effort to correct any such
Title Defect to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction; provided, however, that Seller
shall not be obligated to bring any lawsuit or make any payments of money
(except payments to pay liens that Seller does not dispute in good faith) to
cure a Title Defect. If Seller is unable or, as to Title Defects that Seller is
not obligated to cure pursuant to the proviso contained in the preceding
sentence, unwilling to cure any such Title Defect to Buyer's reasonable

<PAGE>

satisfaction, Buyer shall have the option either to receive title in its then
existing condition or to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Seller
(subject to Seller's option to lease the Branch affected by the Title Defect to
Buyer pursuant to Section 2.10(e)). Upon termination of this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 2.10(c), neither party shall have any further liability to the
other party under this Agreement.

     (d) Buyer shall have the right to request that the title insurance company
update title matters up to the Closing Date for any changes which may have
arisen between the date of the original title search and the Closing Date. If
such update indicates that any Title Defects have been placed of record since
the date of Buyer's original title search, and Buyer reasonably objects thereto
in writing, then Seller shall make a good faith effort to cure any such Title
Defect to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction; provided that Seller shall not be
obligated to bring any lawsuit or make any payments of money (except payments to
pay liens that Seller does not dispute in good faith) to cure a Title Defect. If
Seller is unable or, as to Title Defects that Seller is not obligated to cure
pursuant to the proviso contained in the preceding sentence, unwilling to cure
any such Title Defect, Buyer shall have the option to receive title in its then
existing condition or to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Seller
(subject to Seller's option to lease the Branch affected by the Title Defect to
Buyer pursuant to Section 2.10(e)). Upon termination of this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 2.10(d), neither party shall have any further liability to the
other party under this Agreement.

     (e) In the event Buyer notifies Seller of its intent under this Section
2.10 to terminate this Agreement due to an unacceptable Title Defect, Seller may
elect to lease the Branch affected by the Title Defect to Buyer at a reasonable
rent, based on a valuation of the Branch at its purchase price under Section
2.2(a) of this Agreement, for a term of five years, in which event Buyer will
have no right to terminate this Agreement. If Buyer leases any Branch under this
Section 2.10(e) and if, following the Closing and at any time during the term of
such lease, Seller cures the unacceptable Title Defect, Seller shall promptly
sell and convey the Branch to Buyer, upon the terms specified in this Agreement
(provided, however, for this purpose, Net Book Value and appropriate expense and
tax prorations shall be computed as of the actual conveyance date), whereupon
such lease shall terminate.

     Section 2.11. Environmental Matters.
     ------------- ----------------------

     (a) Seller agrees to deliver to Buyer as soon as reasonably possible, upon
Buyer's request, copies of all environmental studies, reports and audits in
Seller's possession related to the Real Property.

     (b) Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, at its sole cost
and expense, to cause such investigations and tests to be made as it deems
necessary to determine whether there has been any soil, surface water,
groundwater or building space contamination on or under the Real Property.

<PAGE>

Seller shall provide reasonable assistance to Buyer and/or its agents or
contractors in their evaluation and testing of the Real Property, and Seller
shall provide Buyer and/or its agents or contractors access to pertinent records
and documents. Seller authorizes Buyer and/or its agents or contractors to
contact governmental agencies regarding the environmental status of the Real
Property. Buyer shall report the results of any such investigations or tests to
Seller no later than 45 calendar days after the date of this Agreement;
provided, however, that without the prior written consent of Seller, which
--------  -------
consent will not unreasonably be withheld, and execution of a reasonable
property access agreement, Buyer shall not conduct subsurface testing, any
ground water monitoring or install any test well or undertake any other
investigation which requires a permit or license from, or the reporting of the
investigation or the results thereof to, a local or state environmental
regulatory authority or the United States Environmental Protection Agency. If
Buyer objects to any material adverse environmental condition which impacts the
Branches, Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any such
material adverse environmental condition which is discovered by Buyer's
investigation. If Seller is unable or unwilling to cure such problem within 30
days of Seller's receipt of Buyer's report, Buyer shall have the option to
accept the premises in its then existing condition or to terminate this
Agreement upon written notice to Seller. Upon termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 2.11(b), neither party shall have any further liability
to the other under this Agreement.

     Section 2.12. Facilitating Loan by Buyer.

It is understood that the items listed in items (6), (7), (9), (10) and (11)

     (c) At the Closing, subject to all the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Buyer shall execute and deliver to Seller:

     (1)  the Assignment and Assumption Agreement;

     (2)  the proceeds of the Facilitating Loan;

     (3)  a certificate and receipt acknowledging the delivery and receipt of
          possession of the Transferred Assets and records referred to in this
          Agreement;

     (4)  immediately available funds in the net amount shown as owing to Seller
          by Buyer on the Pre-Closing Statement, if any;

     (5)  a certificate of a proper officer of Buyer, dated as of the Closing

<PAGE>

          of Buyer set forth in this Agreement remain true and correct in all
          material respects as of the Effective Time;

     (6)  a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors of Buyer approving
          the purchase contemplated herein;

     (7)  such certificates and other documents as Seller and its counsel may
          reasonably require to evidence the receipt by Buyer of all necessary
          regulatory authorizations and approvals for the consummation of the
          transactions provided for in this Agreement; and (8) the draft
          Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 required by Section 2.2(e) hereof.

     (d) All instruments, agreements and certificates described in this Section
3.2 shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the parties'
respective legal counsel.

     Section 3.3. Post-Closing Adjustments.
     ------------ -------------------------

     (a) Not later than 30 days after the Effective Time (the "Post-Closing
Statement Delivery Date"), Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement dated as of
the Effective Time reflecting the assets sold and assigned and the liabilities
transferred and assumed hereunder (the "Post-Closing Statement"), including, but
not limited to, the specific items described in Section 2.2(a)(1) through (5)
above, as adjusted, together with a copy of Seller's calculation of the adjusted
purchase price and amounts payable thereunder. Additionally, not later than five
(5) days after the Effective Time, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a final list of
the Transferred Loans purchased, individually identified by account number.
Seller shall afford Buyer and its accountants and attorneys the opportunity to
review all work papers and documentation used by Seller in preparing the
Post-Closing Statement. Within 15 days following the Post-Closing Statement
Delivery Date (the "Adjustment Payment Date"), Seller and Buyer shall effect the
transfer of any funds as may be necessary to reflect changes between the
Pre-Closing Statement and the Post-Closing Statement and resulting changes in
the purchase price, together with interest thereon computed from the Effective
Time to the Adjustment Payment Date at the applicable Federal Funds Rate (as
hereinafter defined).

     (b) In the event that a dispute arises as to the appropriate amounts
to be paid to either party on the Adjustment Payment Date, each party shall pay
to the other on such Adjustment Payment Date all amounts other than those as to
which a dispute exists, and the disputed amounts shall be submitted to Spilman,
Hills & Heidebrink Limited, Toledo, Ohio or other mutually acceptable
independent certified public accountant (the "Neutral Auditor") within ten (10)
days after the Adjustment Payment Date. Each party hereto agrees to execute, if
requested by the Neutral Auditor, a reasonable engagement letter. All fees and
expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditor
shall be borne pro rata by Seller and Buyer in proportion to the allocation of
the dollar amount of the disputed amounts between Buyer and Seller made by the
Neutral Auditor such that the party with whom the Neutral Auditor, in the
aggregate, agrees more closely pays a lesser proportion of the fees and
expenses. The Neutral Auditor shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based
solely on the provisions of this Section 3.3 and the presentations by Seller and
Buyer, and not by independent review, only the resolution of the disputed
amounts. The Neutral Auditor's resolution of such disputed amounts, which for

<PAGE>

each of the disputed amounts shall be within the range of values of the amount
claimed by either party as to any of the disputed amounts, shall be made within
thirty (30) days of the submission of the disputed amounts thereto, shall be set
forth in a written statement delivered to Seller and Buyer and shall be deemed
to be mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller for all purposes of this
Agreement. Any disputed amounts retained by a party which are later found to be
due to the other party by the Neutral Auditor shall be paid to such other party
promptly with interest thereon from the Effective Time to the date paid at the
applicable Federal Funds Rate.

     (c) The Federal Funds Rate shall mean, for any period, a fluctuating
interest rate per annum equal for each day during such period to the weighted
average of the rates on overnight federal funds by federal funds brokers, as
published for such day (or if such day is not a business day, for the next
preceding business day) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

     ------------ ---------------------

     (a) A claim for indemnity under Section 4.1 or 4.2 of this Agreement may be
made by the claiming party at any time prior to 18 months after the Effective
Time, by the giving of written notice thereof to the other party. Such written
notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis upon which such claim for
indemnity is made. In the event that any such claim is made within the
prescribed period, the indemnity relating to such claim shall survive until such
claim is resolved. Claims not made within such period shall cease and no
indemnity shall be made therefor.

     (b) In the event that any person or entity not a party to this Agreement
shall make any demand or claim or file or threaten to file any lawsuit, which
demand, claim or lawsuit may result in any liability, damage or loss to one
party hereto of the kind for which such party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2 hereof, then, after written notice is provided by
the indemnified party to the indemnifying party of such demand, claim or
lawsuit, the indemnifying party shall have the option, at its cost and expense,
to retain counsel for the indemnified party to defend any such demand, claim or
lawsuit. In the event that the indemnifying party shall fail to respond within
seven (7) calendar days after receipt of such notice of any such demand, claim
or lawsuit, then the indemnified party may retain counsel and conduct the
defense of such demand, claim or lawsuit as it may in its discretion deem
proper, at the cost and expense of the indemnifying party. In effecting the
settlement of any such demand, claim or lawsuit, an indemnified party shall act
in good faith, shall consult with the indemnifying party and shall enter into

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article IV, no
indemnification shall be required to be made by either party until the aggregate
amount of all such claims by a party exceeds $50,000; provided, however, that
such limitation shall not apply to Buyer's or Seller's failure to pay the
consideration due under Section 2.2 or Section 3.3. Once such aggregate amount
exceeds $50,000, such party shall thereupon be entitled to indemnification for
all amounts in excess of such $50,000. IN ADDITION, THE PARTIES SHALL HAVE NO
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS ARTICLE IV FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL LIABILITY, DAMAGE OR
LOSS THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY MAY SUFFER AS THE RESULT OF ANY DEMAND, CLAIM OR
LAWSUIT.

Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C.A. ss. 9601 ("CERCLA").

including (but not limited to) the Truth in Savings Act and regulations
promulgated thereunder; (ii) were acquired in the ordinary course of Seller's

mature into claims against the respective Deposit Liabilities.

     Seller has delivered a true and complete copy of each contract or other
written agreement described in Section 2.2(b) that is to be assumed by Buyer,
all of which are listed on Exhibit 2.2(b) hereto. Each such contract or other
written agreement is valid and enforceable according to its terms and Seller is
not in default thereunder and there has been no event which, with notice or the
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under any such contract or
other written agreement by Seller.

     Section 5.15. Tax Matters.
     ------------- ------------

     Seller has complied with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Service
regarding taxpayer identification number certification, interest information

warranty as to the creditworthiness of the obligors or guarantors thereunder, or
the value or adequacy of the collateral associated therewith.

sufficient remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Article XI, and
the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of this Article
XI by specific performance and injunctive relief. Such remedies shall not be
deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach or threatened breach of this
