    AMENDMENT NUMBER THREE (3) TO TERRY EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

     Subject  to  ratification by the Board of Directors  at  its
next  regular meeting, this Amendment Number Three (3) is entered
into  this  31st  day  of  December  2002,  ("Amended  Employment
Agreement")  by and between COMTEX News Network, Inc. ("COMTEX"),
a  Delaware corporation, with its principal executive offices  at
4900  Seminary Road, Alexandria, Virginia 22311 ("Company"),  and
CHARLES W. TERRY, whose address is 13201 Dodie Drive, Darnestown,

                      W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS,  COMTEX and the Employee entered into an employment
agreement on the 1st day of October 1998 and amended on  the  1st
day   of  October  2001  and  the  10th  day  of  September  2002
(hereinafter "Agreement"); and

     WHEREAS, COMTEX and the Employee wish to amend the terms  of
the Agreement;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
agreements  set forth herein below, the parties hereto  agree  as
follows:

   1.  The term of the Agreement shall be extended through June 30,
       2003.

   2.  A bonus pool for FY03 performance is hereby incorporated
       into the Agreement:

       A bonus pool for FY03 of $130,000 for Employee (split 2/3 - 1/3
       between achieved revenues and achieved EBITDA) shall hereby be
       established and administered consistent with the bonus
       arrangement employed during FY02, modified as follows to reflect
       the current Board-approved FY03 Budget (i.e., a revenue target of
       $11.9 million and EBITDA target of $503 thousand):

       FY03 Revenue Bonus Component = $86,667
       FY03 Revenue         $10.9M    $11.9M    $12.9M    $16M
       % Component Payable     0%        69%      100%     200%


       FY03 EBITDA Bonus Component = $43,333
       FY03 EBITDA           $200K     $503K     $929K     $1.56M
       % Component Payable      0%        69%       100%      200%

       *The intervals between the four break points stipulated
       above shall be interpolated such that the resulting
       percentage that is applied to any excess revenue or
       EBITDA above the lower threshold shall result in a linear
       bridge to the next higher threshold.

   3.  For the purpose of clarity, the following existing terms of
       the Agreement are hereby reaffirmed:

       a. Employee's annual base salary shall continue unchanged at
          $195,000
       b. Employee shall continue to be eligible for a discretionary
          bonus of up to $50,000, at the sole and complete discretion of
          the Board.
       c. Employee shall continue to be eligible for a twelve month
          severance payment, in lieu of any other severance stipulated in
          the Agreement, which shall be payable evenly over an equal number
          of months, if Employee is terminated within the first six months
          of the effective date of a change of control of the Company,
          defined as a sale or merger of the Company.

   4.  All conditions of the Agreement not amended herein shall
       remain in full force and effect.
