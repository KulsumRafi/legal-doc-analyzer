Rental and Tenant's share of Operating Expenses under this Lease will abate as
of the sixth (6th) business day and continue abated until the service is

     4.    ADJUSTMENT OF BASE RENTAL. The Base Rental payable pursuant to this
Lease shall be adjusted upward from time to time in accordance with the
following provisions:

     (a)   Tenant's Base Rental is based, in part, upon the assumption that
Landlord is contributing as its share of the annual Operating Expenses [as
defined in Paragraph 4(e) hereof] of the Building an amount up to the Base
Expense Amount. Tenant shall during the term of this Lease pay, as an adjustment
to Base Rental pursuant to this Lease, an amount equal to the product of the
following: (i) the excess (the "EXCESS"), if any, from time to time of the
Operating Expenses in the Building over the Base Expense Amount, times (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the net rentable space in the Premises and
the denominator of which is the net rentable space in the Building. Prior to the
commencement of each calendar year of Tenant's occupancy. Landlord shall make a
good faith estimate of the Excess, if any, for such upcoming calendar year and
upon thirty (30) days' written notice to Tenant shall require the monthly
payment of Base Rental to be adjusted in accordance with such estimate. Tenant's
proportionate share of any such estimated Excess shall be payable in equal
monthly installments over the remaining months of the calendar year after notice
of such estimate is delivered to Tenant. Any amounts paid based on such an
estimate shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to Paragraph 4(b) when actual
Operating Expenses are available for each calendar year.

     (b)   By April 1 of each calendar year during Tenant's occupancy, or as
soon thereafter as practical, Landlord shall furnish to Tenant a statement of
Landlord's actual Operating Expenses for the previous calendar year. If any
additional Base Rental collected for a prior year, as a result of Landlord's
estimate of the Excess, is in excess of the additional Base Rental actually due
during such prior year, then Landlord shall refund to Tenant any overpayment (or
at Landlord's option, apply such amount against rentals due or to become due
hereunder). Likewise, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, on demand, any underpayment
with respect to the prior year.

     (c)   Tenant shall have the right at any time within 180 days after
Tenant's receipt of Landlord's statement of the previous year's Operating
Expenses (but not after such 180-day period), to perform an annual audit at
Tenant's expense on Landlord's books and records to the extent necessary to
verify Landlord's calculation of the Excess, if any, and Tenant's actual
additional rent for such previous year, provided (i) that such audit is
conducted by a national or regional certified public accounting firm, (ii) that
the auditor's fee structure is based upon an hourly rate (as opposed to a
contingency fee arrangement), (iii) that both Tenant and the auditor sign a
confidentiality agreement in favor of Landlord, agreeing not to disclose to any
other party the information obtained in the audit (subject to the requirements
of litigation and to exception for information which is clearly and obviously
known to the public, e.g., the number of floors in the Premises), and (iv) that
the auditor's report reflecting the results of such audit are promptly delivered
to Landlord. Any such audit shall be conducted, if at all, (A) within one
hundred eighty (180) days after Tenant's receipt of the annual statement from
Landlord. (B) during Landlord's normal business hours, (C) at the place in
Dallas County, Texas where Landlord maintains its records (or such other place
in such County as Landlord shall deliver the appropriate records) and

                                        4
<Page>

(D) only after Landlord has received twenly (20) days prior written notice. If
the audit report reflects that Tenant was overcharged or undercharged in the
audited calendar year, and provided Landlord does not dispule the audit results
within ninety (90) days after having received a written copy of the audit report
("Landlord's Review Period"), Tenant will within twenty (20) days after
Landlord's Review Period pay to Landlord the amount of any underpayment or, if
applicable, Landlord shall pay to Tenant the amount of any overpayment. If the
amount evidenced by an audit performed on behalf of Tenant evidences that Tenant
was overcharged by more than 5% of the total amount for additional rent
authorized under this Lease, then if (1) Landlord fails to dispute such finding
within Landlord's Review Period, or (2) Landlord agrees with such finding or (3)
following a dispute of Tenant's audit by Landlord, the reconciled audits still
evidence that Tenant was overcharged by more than 5% of the additional rent
authorized under this Lease, Landlord will pay all of Tenant's reasonable costs
of Tenant's audit. Landlord, within Landlord's Review Period, may elect to
dispute Tenant's audit by giving written notice to Tenant of Landlord's
election. Upon giving notice of Landlord's dispute of Tenant's audit. Landlord
will retain a certified public accountant or other person experienced in
auditing operating expenses in office buildings to audit the additional rent,
and upon completion of said audit, Landlord's and Tenant's respective auditors
will meet to reconcile all material differences in the audit. Failure by Tenant
to exercise an audit right or Landlord to dispute any Tenant audit within the
specified time period or the failure of either party to otherwise fail to
contest or dispute the allocation of additional rent as provided above, is
deemed a waiver of the applicable audit or dispute right and any right to
contest the additional rent charges (undercharges or overcharges) for the
applicable Lease year and, accordingly, is deemed acceptance of the additional
rent charges as submitted to and reviewed by Tenant.

     (d)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the
Building is not fully occupied during any calendar year of the Lease Term,
Operating Expenses and the Excess for purposes of Paragraphs 4(a) and 4(b)
hereof shall be determined as if the Building had been fully occupied during
such year and Operating Expenses had been in an amount which would be normal if
the Building were 100% occupied.

     (e)   The term "Operating Expenses" shall mean all costs of management,
operation, and maintenance of the Land, the Building, and all other improvements

     (f)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Paragraph
4, Tenant's share of Operating Expenses shall not increase by more than six
percent (6%) per year for any year during the Term of this Lease; to the extent
attributable to any and all controllable expenses, i.e., with the limitation

increases in expenses such as utilities, taxes and insurance cause the Operating
Expenses to increase by more than six percent per year.

     5.    ELECTRICITY. (a) Tenant agrees that in addition to Tenant's
obligations to pay Base Rental (Paragraph l(e) of this Lease) and to make
escalation payments resulting from Operating Expenses (Paragraph 4 of this
Lease), as well as Tenant's obligations pursuant to other provisions in this
Lease, Tenant shall pay all electrical expenses attributable to the Premises, as
follows: (i) if and to the extent that all or portions of the Premises are
separately metered for electrical consumption. Tenant shall promptly pay all
charges for electrical consumption directly to the utility company which
supplies electricity to the Premises: (ii) for that portion of electrical
consumption which is allocable to rented space (e.g. within the Premises
itself), Tenant shall promptly reimburse Landlord for Tenant's prorata share
(i.e., a fraction the numerator of which is the Rentable Space in the Premises
and the denominator of which is the Rentable Space in all occupied leased
premises in the Building) of such charges for electrical consumption paid by
Landlord to the utility company which supplies electricity to the Building, and
(iii) for all other electricity consumed in connection with the Building, Tenant
shall promptly reimburse Landlord for Tenant's prorata share (i.e., a fraction
the numerator of which is the Rentable Space in the Premises and the denominator
of which is the Rentable Space in the Building, whether or not occupied) of such
charges for electrical consumption paid by Landlord to the utility company which
supplies electricity to the Building; moreover, with regard to Tenant's
obligations pursuant to items (ii) and (iii) above. Landlord may, at or before
the commencement of each calendar year, make a good faith reasonable estimate of
the cost for such electrical consumption for the upcoming calendar year and
Tenant's respective shares of such total cost, and upon thirty (30) days'
written notice to Tenant may require the monthly payment of such estimated cost
in advance. In such event, Tenant's proportionate share of any such estimated
cost shall be payable in equal monthly installments over the remaining months of
the calendar year after notice of such estimate is delivered to Tenant. Any
amounts paid based on such an estimate shall be subject to adjustment between
Landlord and Tenant (i.e., in the same manner as the potential adjustment of
Operating Expenses payments pursuant to Paragraph 4(c) above) when actual costs
are determined for the applicable calendar year.

     (b)   Without Landlord's prior written consent, Tenant shall not install
any equipment in the Premises that will require any electrical current or

manner herein provided, without any setoff, deduction or counterclaim
whatsoever. Should this Lease commence on a day other than the First day of a
calendar month or terminate on a day other than the last day of a calendar
month, the rent for such partial month shall be proportionately reduced. The
Base Rental for the First partial month, if any, shall be payable at the
beginning of said period or as Prepaid Rental. The obligation of Tenant to pay
such rent is an independent covenant, and no act or circumstance whatsoever,
whether such act or circumstance constitutes a breach of covenant by Landlord or
not, shall release Tenant from the obligation to pay rent. Time is of the
essence in the performance of all of Tenant's obligations hereunder. Any amount
which becomes owing by Tenant to Landlord hereunder shall bear interest at the
highest lawful rate per annum from the fifth (5th) day after the due date until
paid, unless there is no maximum rate of interest provided by law with respect
to such amount, in which event such amount shall bear interest at the rate of
eighteen percent (18%) per annum from the fifth (5th) day after the due date
until paid. Any such accrued interest shall be payable on demand as additional
rental In addition, if rental is paid by a check which is returned for
insufficient funds. Tenant shall immediately make the required payment to
Landlord in good funds: moreover, in such event Tenant shall also pay to
Landlord not only the interest specified above in this Paragraph 6 (i.e., if and
to the extent that such dishonored check causes the rental to become past due by
more than Five days), but also an additional fee of $l00.00 to compensate
Landlord for its expense and effort in connection with the dishonored check.

     7.    INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS; ADA COMPLIANCE. All improvements to be
installed in the Premises at the commencement of this Lease shall be installed
as specified in the

                                        6
<Page>

Leasehold Improvements Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit D and made a part
hereof. Tenant will assure that the plans and specifications for its
improvements, as well as its business operations within the Premises, comply
with the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended and all related
state and local laws (collectively, the "ADA"), and Landlord agrees that the
remainder of the Building, i.e., other than the Premises, shall be in compliance
with the ADA (taking into account both the fact that the Building was
constructed before the effective date of the ADA and the fact of any and all
renovations being effected pursuant to this Lease).

     8.    COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS AND COMMENCEMENT OF RENT. If the Premises
are not ready for occupancy by Tenant on the Lease commencement date, the
obligations of Landlord and Tenant shall nevertheless continue in full force and
effect, including the obligation of Tenant to commence paying rent on the
Commencement Date stated in Paragraph l(d): provided, however, that if the
Premises are not ready for occupancy for any reason other than Tenant's Delay
(as defined in EXHIBIT D), then (i) the rent shall abate and not commence until
the date the leasehold improvements to the Premises are substantially complete,
and (ii) the Lease Term shall be extended to be the number of months provided in
Paragraph l(d) above, i.e., after the Commencement Date, as extended. Any such
abatement of rent, however, shall constitute full settlement of all claims that
Tenant might otherwise have against Landlord by reason of the Premises not being
ready for occupancy by Tenant on the Lease commencement date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if Tenant, with Landlord's consent, occupies the Premises after
substantial completion of Tenant's leasehold improvements but prior to the
beginning of the Lease Term set forth herein, all of the terms and provisions of
this Lease shall be in full force and effect from the commencement of such
occupancy and the Lease Term shall commence on the date on which Tenant First
occupies the Premises and shall expire the same period of months thereafter as
shown in Paragraph l(d); no change shall occur in the length of the Lease Term.

     9.    LIMITED RIGHT TO CALCULATE RENTABLE SPACE: SUBSEQUENT LIQUIDATION.
(a) Landlord and Tenant agree that at any time within one hundred eighty (180)
days after the date of this Lease, either party may, at its sole expense, employ
a licensed architect to calculate the "Rentable Space" of the Initial Used
Space, the First Floor Space, and/or the entire Premises. If the architect
performing any such services should issue a written statement within two hundred
ten (210) days after the date of this Lease, which indicates that the "Rentable
Space specified for the Initial Used Space, the First Floor Space, and/or the
entire Premises should be modified (a "Modification Statement"), and if the
other party to this Lease agrees with such Modification Statement, then Landlord
and Tenant shall execute a written Amendment to Lease confirming the mutually
agreed information and the appropriate rental adjustment which results from the
corrected information (e.g., increasing or decreasing the Base Rental
proportionate with the increase or decrease in the "Rentable Space"). If the
architect performing any such services should issue a Modification Statement
within two hundred ten (210) days after the date of this Lease, and if the other
party to this Lease does not agree with such Modification Statement, then the
other party may, at its sole expense, within sixty (60) days after the date of
the Modification Statement, employ a licensed architect to review and respond to
the Modification Statement (the "Response"). If the two architects fail to reach
agreement within thirty (30) days after the date of the Response, then they
shall select a third licensed architect (either by agreement between the two
architects or, if they fail to agree on the third architect, by requesting that
the Dallas chapter of the American Institute of Architects provide the third
architect), with the fees of the third architect to be shared equally by
Landlord and Tenant. Upon agreement between the two architects selected by the
parties, or upon the final decision of the third architect, Landlord and Tenant
shall execute a written Amendment to Lease confirming the final determination
and, if necessary, the appropriate rental adjustment.

     (b)   Notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the contrary,
both Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and confirm their mutual desire to have all
financial obligations under this Lease fixed and liquidated as soon as possible
so that they can account for and plan such obligations with greater certainty.
Accordingly, the parties agree that if neither party employs a licensed
architect to perform any of the above-listed services within one hundred eighty
(180) days after the date of this Lease, or if no Modification Statement is
delivered within two hundred ten (210) days after the date of this Lease, then
the provisions of Paragraph 9(a) shall be null and void and of no further force
or effect; and in such event (i) so that both parties to this Lease can be
assured that they will not have to expend monies for professional fees regarding
Rentable Space

                                        7
<Page>

determinations after the deadlines established in Paragraph 9(a), they hereby
agree that the Rentable Space For the Initial Used Space, the First Floor Space
and the entire Premises, as specified in Paragraph l(c) and Paragraph l(e)
above, shall conclusively be deemed to be applicable to this Lease: and (ii) so
that both parties to this Lease can be assured as to their financial obligations
after the deadlines established in Paragraph 9(a), they further agree that Base
Rental, the Allowance, rental adjustments and all other aspects of this Lease
which are based in whole or in part upon Rentable Space shall be deemed to be
liquidated and no longer subject to adjustment based upon inaccuracies and/or
errors, if any, in the Rentable Space determinations specified in Paragraph l(c)
and Paragraph l(e).

     10.   REPAIRS AND REENTRY. Tenant will, at Tenant's own cost and expense,
maintain and keep the Premises and any alterations and additions thereto in
sound condition and good repair, and shall pay for the repair of any damage or
injury done to the Building or any part thereof by Tenant or Tenant's agents,
employees and invitees: provided, however, that Tenant shall make no material
repairs to the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord. The
performance by Tenant of its obligation to maintain and make material repairs
shall be conducted only by contractors approved by Landlord after plans and
specifications have been approved by Landlord. Tenant will not commit or allow
any waste or damage to be committed on any portion of the Premises, and upon the
termination of this Lease by lapse of lime or otherwise, Tenant shall deliver up
the Premises to Landlord in as good condition as at date of possession, ordinary
wear and tear excepted. Upon such termination of this Lease, Landlord shall have
the right to reenter and resume possession of the Premises. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 10, any repairs to the Premises or the
Building that are necessitated because of any damage caused by fire or other
casualty shall be governed by the provisions of Paragraph 18 below. Landlord
shall be responsible for maintenance to the exterior, structural and common
areas of the Building.

alterations (e.g., structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing) in or additions
to the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord; and all

fixtures of Tenant) shall be deemed a part of the Building and the property of
the Landlord at the time they are placed in or upon the Premises, and they shall
remain upon and be surrendered with the Premises as a part thereof at the
termination of this Lease, unless Landlord shall elect otherwise, whether such
termination shall occur by the lapse of time or otherwise. In the event Landlord
shall elect that certain alterations, additions and improvements made by Tenant
in the Premises shall be removed by Tenant, Tenant shall remove them and Tenant
shall restore the Premises to its original condition, at Tenant's own cost and
expense, prior to the termination of the Lease Term; provided, however, that
Tenant shall not be obligated to remove any improvements which are specified in
the Approved Working Drawings contemplated in EXHIBIT D-l and EXHIBIT D-2.

Tenant's cost and expense.

     12.   ENTRY FOR REPAIRS AND INSPECTION. Landlord and its agents and
representatives shall have the right to enter into and upon any and all parts

reduction of rent by reason thereof. During the period of 180 days prior to the
expiration date of this Lease, Landlord and Landlord's agents may exhibit the
Premises to prospective tenants at reasonable hours and upon prior notice to
Tenant.

     13.   MECHANIC'S LIENS. Nothing contained in this Lease shall authorize
Tenant to do any act which shall in any way encumber the title of Landlord in
and to the Premises or the Building or any part thereof; and if any mechanic's
or materialman's lien is Filed or claimed against the Premises or Building or
any part thereof in connection with any work performed, materials furnished or
obligation incurred by or at the request of Tenant, Tenant will promptly pay

notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant. Landlord shall have the right and
privilege at Landlord's option of paying the same or any

portion thereof without inquiry as to the validity thereof, and any amounts so
paid, including expenses and interest, shall be repaid to Landlord immediately
on demand therefor.

     14.   LEGAL USE: VIOLATIONS OF INSURANCE COVERAGE; NUISANCE. Tenant will
be solely responsible for obtaining all necessary certificates (e.g..
Certificate of Occupancy) and licenses necessary for Tenant's occupancy of the
Premises and conducting its business therein. Tenant will not occupy or use any

manner as not to create any nuisance or interfere with, annoy or disturb other
tenants or Landlord in the management of the Building.

expense will maintain the Premises in a clean and healthful condition and will

<Page>


the Premises or any part thereof, or occasioned wholly or in part by any action
or omission of Tenant, its agents, contractors, employees, invitees, or

amount not less than $1,000,000.00 with respect to injuries to or death of any
one person and in an amount of not less than $1,000,000.00 with respect to any
one accident or disaster, and shall furnish evidence satisfactory to Landlord of
the maintenance of such insurance. Tenant shall obtain a written obligation on
the part of each insurance company to notify Landlord at lease 10 days prior to
cancellation of such insurance. It is recommended that Tenant carry fire and
extended coverage insurance on its personal property, as Landlord shall in no
event be required to rebuild, repairer replace any part of the furniture,
equipment, fixtures and other improvements which may have been placed by Tenant
on or within the Premises.

     18.   FIRE AND CASUALTY. (a) If the Premises are damaged by Fire or Other
casualty and if such damage is not susceptible of repair within 180 days (as
estimated, as soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of such
damage, by an architect of recognized good reputation selected by Landlord),
then in such event this Lease, at the option of Landlord exercised by giving
written notice thereof to Tenant within 30 days after receipt of a certificate
of the architect so selected, shall terminate as of the date of such loss, and
Tenant shall pay the rent hereunder apportioned to the time of such loss and
shall pay all other obligations of Tenant owing on the date of termination, and
Tenant shall immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord.

     (b)   If the damage described above is susceptible of repair within 180
days, or if the damage is not susceptible of repair within 180 days but Landlord
fails to exercise its option to terminate this Lease, Landlord shall enter and
make the necessary repairs without affecting this Lease, but the rent hereunder
shall be reduced or abated as shall be equitable, in the good faith judgment of
Landlord, until such repairs are made, unless such damage has been so slight
that Tenant's occupancy of the Premises is not materially interfered with, in
which case the rent hereunder shall not be abated or reduced. Notwithstanding
the foregoing. Landlord shall have the option to terminate this Lease and shall
not be obligated to repair the Premises or the Building if the damage is not
covered by insurance or if Landlord's mortgagee applies any portion of the
insurance proceeds to the unpaid balance of its loan.

     (c)   In the event the Building is so badly damaged or injured by Fire or
other casualty even though the Premises may not be affected, that Landlord
decides, within 90 days after such destruction, not to rebuild or repair the
Building (such decision being vested exclusively in the discretion of Landlord),
then in such event Landlord shall so notify Tenant in writing and this Lease
shall terminate as of the date of such loss, and the Tenant shall pay rent
hereunder apportioned to the date of such loss and shall pay all other
obligations of Tenant owing on the date of termination, and Tenant shall
immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord.

                                       10
<Page>

     (d)   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 18,
Tenant agrees that if the Premises or any other portion of the Building is
damaged by Fire or other casualty resulting from the gross negligence of Tenant
or any of its agents, employees, or invitees, then there shall be no abatement
of rent before or during the repair of such damage.

     19.   CONDEMNATION. If all of the Premises, or so much thereof as would
materially interfere with Tenant's use of the remainder, shall be taken or
condemned for any public use or purpose by right of eminent domain, with or
without litigation, or be transferred by agreement in connection with or in lieu
of or under threat of condemnation, then the term of this Lease and the
leasehold estate created hereby shall terminate as of the date title shall vest
in the condemnor or transferee. If only a portion of the Building, but not the
Premises, is taken or condemned or transferred as aforesaid. Landlord shall have
the option to terminate this Lease effective as of the date title shall vest in
the condemnor or transferee. Landlord shall receive the entire award from any
taking or condemnation (or the entire compensation paid because of any transfer
by agreement), and Tenant shall have no claim thereto.

     20.   FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEM. Landlord agrees that if at any time during the
Lease Term, or any extensions thereof, the Fire sprinkler system in the Building
needs to be replaced. Landlord shall give Tenant written notice of Landlord's
decision to replace the Fire sprinkler system. Landlord further agrees that if
within fifteen (15) days after Tenant's receipt of Landlord's notice Tenant
gives Landlord written notice that Tenant will promptly supply, at Tenant's sole
expense, all parts and components necessary for such replacement of the fire
sprinkler system, then Tenant shall promptly supply all such parts and
components at its sole expense and at no cost to Landlord; and upon Landlord's
receipt of all parts and components at the Building, Landlord shall supply all
labor necessary to effect the replacement at no labor cost to Tenant.

     21.   ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING. (a) In the event that Tenant desires to
assign this Lease or sublet all or any part of the Premises or grant any
license, concession or other right of occupancy of any portion of the Premises,
Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing (a "Proposal Notice") and shall state in
the Proposal Notice the name of the proposed assignee, sublessee or other
transferee and the terms of the proposed assignment, sublease or transfer. In
the Proposal Notice Tenant shall also provide Financial information and state
the nature and character of the business of the proposed assignee, sublessee or
transferee. Notwithstanding such Proposal Notice to Landlord, Tenant shall not
assign or mortgage this Lease or any right hereunder or interest herein, and
Tenant shall not sublet the Premises in whole or in part or grant any license,
concession or other right of occupancy of any portion of the Premises, without
the prior written consent of Landlord (which, subject to subsections (b) and (c)
below, shall not be unreasonably withheld). Any such assignment, mortgage or
subletting without such consent shall be void and shall, at the sole option of
the Landlord, be deemed a breach of this Lease. Notwithstanding any assignment
or subletting consented to by Landlord, Tenant and each assignee shall at all
times remain fully responsible and liable for the payment of the rent herein
specified and for compliance with all of Tenant's other covenants and
obligations under this Lease. No consent to any assignment or mortgage of this
Lease or any subletting of the Premises shall constitute a waiver of the
provisions of this paragraph except as to the specific instance covered thereby.
In the event that the monthly rental per square foot of space subleased which is
payable by any sublessee to Tenant shall exceed the monthly rental per square
foot for the same space payable for the same month by Tenant to Landlord
(including any bonuses or any other consideration paid directly or indirectly by
the sublessee to Tenant), Tenant shall be obligated to pay the amount of such
excess to Landlord as additional rent hereunder within twenty (20) days after it
is received by Tenant from the sublessee. In the event Tenant shall receive any
consideration from an assignee other than the assumption by the assignee of
Tenant's obligations hereunder, Tenant shall be obligated to pay the amount of
such consideration to Landlord as additional rent hereunder within twenty (20)
days after the date it is received by Tenant. Landlord, at Landlord's option,
may elect to require that rental payable by any sublessee be paid directly to
Landlord and offset Tenant's rent obligations accordingly. If Tenant is a
corporation or partnership, an assignment prohibited by this Paragraph 21 shall
be deemed to include one or more sales or transfers, by operation of law or
otherwise, or creation of new stock or partnership interests, by which a
majority of the voting shares of the corporation or interests in the partnership
shall be vested in a party or parties who are not owners of a majority of the
voting shares or partnership interests of Tenant as of the date hereof;
provided, however, that the foregoing provisions of this sentence shall not be
applicable

                                       11
<Page>

If (i) Tenant's stock is listed on a recognized security exchange or (ii) at
least 80% of Tenant's stock is owned by a corporation whose stock is listed on a
recognized security exchange. For the purposes hereof, stock ownership shall be
determined in accordance with the principles set forth in section 544 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended to the date hereof. Any transfer by
operation of law shall also constitute an assignment prohibited by this
Paragraph 21. Unless Landlord's withholding of consent is attributable primarily
to a malicious intent to injure Tenant (i.e., as opposed to a difference of
opinion between Landlord and Tenant), Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for
wrongfully withholding its consent to an assignment or subletting under this
Lease and Tenant's sole remedy on account thereof shall be to enforce specific
performance of Landlord's obligation to consent.

     (b)   Landlord and Tenant hereby agree that the granting of consent by
Landlord (i.e., if such consent is granted) shall, at a minimum, be
preconditioned upon the fulfillment of the following requirements of Landlord,
as well as any other reasonable requirements of Landlord:

           (1)  Landlord shall be entitled to review Tenant's Proposal Notice
     for at least twenty (20) days after receiving same from Tenant;

           (2)  Tenant shall remain primarily liable under this Lease and shall
     guaranty the Lease if Landlord so requests;

           (3)  Any proposed assignee or sublessee shall assume, in a written
     instrument acceptable to Landlord, all of the obligations of Tenant
     hereunder;

           (4)  No use shall be employed in connection with the Premises other
     than the sole Permitted Use set forth in this Lease;

           (5)  The Premises shall remain intact and shall not be altered in any
     manner whatsoever unless Tenant and the prospective assignee or sublessee
     shall pay the entire cost thereof, and Landlord's prior written approval is
     obtained pursuant to Paragraph 10 above;

           (6)  The tangible net worth of the proposed subtenant/assignee must
     be reasonably sufficient for the obligations under this Lease;

           (7)  Any use of the Premises permitted hereunder by the proposed
     sublessee/assignee will not violate or create any potential violation of
     any laws, nor will it violate any other agreements affecting the Premises,
     the Building or Landlord;

           (8)  The proposed subtenant/assignee will not create traffic
     congestion or an unreasonable burden on existing parking; and

           (9)  Tenant shall pay any and all reasonable attorney's fees or other
     costs associated with Landlord's review and approval of a prospective
     assignee or sublessee, not to exceed $500.00.

     (c)   Notwithstanding anything contained above in this Paragraph 21, Tenant
agrees that after Landlord receives a Proposal Notice from Tenant regarding
Tenant's proposed assignment of its rights under this Lease, then in addition to
the rights granted to Landlord in subsections (a) and (b) immediately above,
Landlord shall also be entitled to terminate this Lease; moreover, in the event
of a Proposal Notice from Tenant regarding a proposed sublease or license by
Tenant as to all or any portion of the Premises (subject, however, to the final
sentence of this subsection) Landlord shall be entitled either to terminate this
Lease as to that particular space designated in the Proposal Notice-with all
rights and obligations of the parties under this Lease thereafter being
equitably prorated based upon the remaining space which continues to be leased
by Tenant-or, as a further option, to become Tenant's subtenant or licensee
under the same terms and conditions as were set forth in the Proposal Notice.
The options granted to Landlord pursuant to this subsection (c) are cumulative
with the rights granted to Landlord pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this
Paragraph 21. However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, this
subsection (c) shall not be applicable (although subsections (a) and (b) shall
continue to be

                                       12
<Page>

applicable) to a proposed sublease or license which, if effected, would result
in all or any portion of the First Floor Space being subleased or licensed but
no space other than the First Floor Space.

     22.   HOLDING OVER. Should Tenant continue to hold the Premises after this
Lease terminates, whether by lapse of time or otherwise, such holding over
shall, unless otherwise agreed by Landlord in writing, constitute and be
construed as a tenancy at will at a daily rental equal to one-thirtieth (1/30)
of an amount equal to 150% of the amount of the monthly rental payable during
the last month prior to the termination of this Lease, and upon and subject to
all of the other terms and provisions set forth herein except any right to renew
this Lease. This provision shall not be construed, however, as permission by
Landlord for Tenant to hold over.

     23.   ABANDONED PROPERTY. All personal property of Tenant remaining in the
Premises after the expiration of the Lease Term or after the abandonment of the
Premises by Tenant may be treated by Landlord as having been abandoned by
Tenant, and Landlord shall have the right to remove such personal properly from
the Premises without any obligation to deliver such personal property to Tenant
and without any liability to Tenant whatsoever, it being agreed that Tenant
shall have no right to reclaim such property. Landlord shall have no duty to
notify Tenant that Landlord may dispose of Tenant's property. Tenant shall be
presumed conclusively to have abandoned the Premises if the amount of Tenant's
property removed or being removed by Tenant from the Premises is substantial
enough to indicate a probable intent to abandon the Premises, and such removal
is not within the normal course of Tenant's business, or if Tenant removes or is
removing any material amount of Tenant's personal property from the Premises at
a time when Tenant is in default in the payment of rental due hereunder and such
removal is not within the normal course of Tenant's business. Nothing contained
in this paragraph shall prejudice or impair Landlord's rights as a lienholder
and secured party under Paragraph 28 hereof, and the rights granted to Landlord
under this paragraph shall be cumulative of its rights as a lienholder and
secured party.

     24.   TAXES. (a) Tenant shall be liable for all taxes levied or assessed
against all personal property, furniture and fixtures placed by Tenant, or on
Tenant's behalf, in the Premises. If any such taxes for which Tenant is liable
are levied or assessed against Landlord or Landlord's property and if Landlord
elects to pay the same or if the assessed value of Landlord's property is
increased by inclusion of personal property, furniture or fixtures placed by
Tenant in the Premises, and Landlord elects to pay the taxes based on such
increase. Tenant shall pay Landlord upon demand that part of such taxes for
which Tenant is primarily liable hereunder.

     (b)   Tenant agrees that, as between Tenant and Landlord, Landlord has the
sole and absolute right to contest taxes levied against the Premises and the
Building (other than taxes levied directly against Tenant's personal property
within the Premises). Accordingly, Tenant, to the maximum extent permitted by
law, irrevocably waives any and all rights that Tenant may have to receive from
Landlord a copy of notices received by Landlord regarding the appraisal or
reappraisal, for tax purposes, of all or any portion of the Premises or the
Building (including, without limitation, any rights set forth in Section.41.413
of the Texas Property Tax Code, as such section may be amended and/or
supplemented from time to time). Additionally, Tenant, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, hereby assigns to Landlord any and all rights of Tenant to
protest or appeal any governmental appraisal or reappraisal of the value of all
or any portion of the Premises or the Building (including, without limitation,
any rights set forth in Section 41.413 and Section 42.015 of the Texas Property
Tax Code, as such sections may be amended and/or supplemented from time to
time). To the maximum extent permitted by law, Tenant agrees that it will not
protest or appeal any such appraisal or reappraisal before a governmental taxing
authority without the express written authorization of Landlord.

     25.   TRANSFER OF LANDLORD'S RIGHTS. In the event Landlord transfers its
interest in the Building, Landlord shall thereby be released from any further
obligations hereunder, and Tenant agrees to look solely to the successor in
interest of the Landlord for the performance of such obligations.

     26.   DEFAULT. (a) The following events shall be deemed to be events of
default by Tenant under this Lease: (i) Tenant shall fail to pay any rental or
other sums payable by Tenant hereunder as and when such rental or other sums
become due and payable and any such failure

                                       13
<Page>

<Page>

shall continue for a period of ten (10) days after written notice from Landlord
to Tenant (provided, however, that if in any calendar year Landlord has given at
least two written notices of rental defaults to Tenant, then for the remainder
of that particular calendar year the grace period shall be reduced to five days
and there shall be no requirement of written notice from Landlord to Tenant);
(ii) Tenant shall fail to comply with any other provision, condition or covenant
of this Lease and any such failure shall continue for a period of twenty (20)
days after Landlord gives written notice thereof to Tenant, (iii) Tenant shall
abandon, vacate or fail to physically occupy any substantial portion of the
Premises; (iv) any petition shall be Filed by or against Tenant or any guarantor
of Tenant's obligations under this Lease pursuant to any section or chapter of
the present federal Bankruptcy Act or under any future federal Bankruptcy Act or
under any similar law or statute of the United States or any state thereof, and
such petition shall not be dismissed within ninety (90) days after its filing,
or Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant's obligations under this Lease shall be
adjudged bankrupt or insolvent in proceedings filed under any section or chapter
of the present federal bankruptcy act or under any future federal bankruptcy act
or under any similar law or statute of the United Stales or any state thereof;
(v) Tenant or any guarantor of Tenant's obligations under this Lease shall
become insolvent or make a transfer in fraud of creditors: (vi) Tenant or any
guarantor of this Lease shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors;
or (vii) a receiver or trustee shall be appointed for Tenant or any of the
assets of Tenant.

     (b)   Upon the occurrence of any event of default, Landlord shall have the
option to do any one or more of the following without any further notice or
demand, in addition to and not in limitation of any other remedy permitted by
law or by this Lease:

     (1)   Landlord may enforce, by all legal suits and other means, its rights
           hereunder, including the collection of Base Rental and any other sums
           payable by Tenant hereunder, without reentering or resuming
           possession of Premises and without terminating this Lease.

     (2)   Landlord may do whatever Tenant is obligated to do by the provisions
           of this Lease and may enter the Premises, by force if necessary, in
           order to accomplish this purpose. Tenant hereby waives any and all
           claims for damages caused by Landlord's actions pursuant to this
           subparagraph (b)(2). and Tenant also agrees to reimburse Landlord
           immediately upon demand for any expenses which Landlord may incur in
           thus effecting compliance with this Lease on behalf of Tenant.

     (3)   If (but only if) Tenant is in arrears in its rentals by more than one
           month. Landlord may enter upon and take possession of the Premises
           without terminating this Lease and expel or remove Tenant and its
           effects therefrom without being liable to prosecution of any claims
           for damages therefor, and Landlord may relet the Premises for (he
           account of Tenant. Tenant shall pay to Landlord all arrearages of
           Base Rental and other sums due and owing by Tenant to Landlord, and
           Tenant shall also pay to Landlord during each month of the unexpired
           Lease Term the installments of Base Rental and other sums due
           hereunder, less such part, if any, that Landlord shall have been able
           to collect from a new tenant upon reletting: provided, however, that
           although Landlord shall use its reasonable efforts to relet the
           Premises, Landlord shall have no obligation to agree to any lease
           terms which it deems to be unacceptable, nor shall Landlord be
           obligated (i) to travel outside a radius of thirty (30) miles from
           its principal office in order to meet with a prospective tenant, (ii)
           to accept a prospective tenant for the Premises (or any portion
           thereof) which is an existing or prospective tenant elsewhere in the
           Building, or (iii) to expend monies for finish-out requested by a
           prospective tenant unless Landlord in its sole and absolute
           discretion, approves both the lease terms and the credit of such
           prospective tenant. In the event Landlord exercises the rights and
           remedies afforded to it under this Paragraph 26(b)(3) and then
           subsequently elects to terminate this Lease. Tenant shall be liable
           to Landlord for damages as set forth in Paragraph 26(b)(2) above and
           Landlord shall have the right at any lime to demand final settlement
           as provided therein.

                                       14
<Page>

     (4)   If (but only if) Tenant is in arrears in its rentals by more than one
           month, Landlord may enter upon the Premises and change, alter, or
           modify the door locks on all entry doors of the Premises, and
           permanently or temporarily exclude Tenant and its agents, employees,
           representatives and invitees, from the Premises, but only to the
           extent permitted by, and subject to the requirements of, Texas
           statutory law in effect at the time of the rental delinquency.

     (5)   If (but only if) Tenant is in arrears in its rentals by more than one
           month. Landlord may terminate this Lease, in which event Tenant shall
           immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord, but if Tenant shall
           fail to do so. Landlord may without notice and without prejudice to
           any other remedy Landlord may have, enter upon and take possession of
           the Premises and expel or remove Tenant and its effects without being
           liable to prosecution or any claim for damages therefor; and upon any
           such termination. Tenant agrees that in addition to its liability for
           the payment of arrearages of Base Rental and other sums due and owing
           by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease upon such termination. Tenant
           shall be liable to Landlord for damages. Tenant shall pay to Landlord
           as damages on the same days as Base Rental and other payments are
           expressed to be due under the provisions of this Lease, the total
           amount of such Base Rental and other payments, less such part, if
           any, of such payments that Landlord shall have been able to collect
           from a new tenant upon reletting; provided, however, that although
           Landlord shall use its reasonable effort to relet the Premises,
           Landlord shall have no obligation to agree to any lease terms
           which it deems to be unacceptable, nor shall Landlord be obligated
           (i) to travel outside a radius of thirty (30) miles from its
           principal office in order to meet with a prospective tenant, (ii) to
           accept a prospective tenant for the Premises (or any portion thereof)
           which is an existing or prospective tenant elsewhere in the Building,
           or (iii) to expend monies for finish-out requested by a prospective
           tenant unless Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion, approves
           both the lease terms and the credit of such prospective tenant.
           Landlord shall have the right at any time to demand final settlement.
           Upon demand for a Final settlement, Landlord shall have the right to
           receive, and Tenant hereby agrees to pay, as damages for Tenant's
           breach, the difference between the total rental provided for in this
           Lease for the remainder of the Lease Term and the reasonable rental
           value of the Premises for such period, such difference to be
           discounted to present value at a rate equal to the rate of interest
           allowed by law (at the time the demand for Final settlement is made)
           when the parties to a contract have not agreed on any particular rate
           of interest (or, in the absence of such law, at the rate of 6% per
           annum).

Pursuit of any of the foregoing remedies shall not preclude pursuit of any of
the other remedies herein provided or any other remedies provided by law or
equity. Any entry by Landlord upon the Premises may be by use of a master or
duplicate key or electronic pass card or any locksmith's entry procedure or
other peaceable means. Any reletting by Landlord shall be without notice to
Tenant, and if Landlord has not terminated this Lease, the reletting may be in
the name of Tenant or Landlord, as Landlord shall elect. Any reletting shall be
for such term or terms (which may be greater or less than the period which
constitutes the balance of the Lease Term) and on such terms and conditions
(which may include free rent, rental concessions or tenant inducements of any
nature) as Landlord in its absolute discretion may determine, and Landlord may
collect and receive any rents payable by reason of such reletting. In the event
of any reletting, Tenant shall pay to Landlord on demand the cost of renovating,
repairing and altering the Premises for a new tenant or tenants, and the cost of
advertisements, brokerage fees, reasonable attorney's fees and other costs and
expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with such reletting. In the event
any rentals actually collected by Landlord upon any such reletting for any
calendar month are in excess of the amount of rental payable by Tenant under
this Lease for the same calendar month, the amount of such excess shall belong
solely to Landlord and Tenant shall have no right with respect thereto (except,
however, same shall be applied to Tenant's deficiency, if any). In the event it
is necessary for Landlord to institute suit against Tenant in order to collect
the rental or any other sum due hereunder or any deficiency between the rental
and any other sum provided for by this Lease for a calendar month and the rental
and any other sum actually collected by Landlord for such calendar month.
Landlord shall have the right to allow such deficiency to accumulate and to

                                       15
<Page>

bring an action upon several or all of such rental deficiencies at one time. Any
suit shall not prejudice in any way the right of Landlord to bring a similar
action for any subsequent rental deficiency or deficiencies.

     27.   [Intentionally deleted].

     28.   [Intentionally deleted].

     29.   REMEDIES. No act or thing done by Landlord or its agents during the
term hereof shall be deemed an acceptance of an attempted surrender of the
Premises, and no agreement to accept a surrender of the Premises shall be valid
unless made in writing and signed by Landlord. No reentry or taking possession
of the Premises by Landlord shall be construed as an election on its part to
terminate this Lease, unless a written notice of such intention is given to
Tenant. Notwithstanding any such reletting or reentry or taking possession.
Landlord may at any time thereafter elect to terminate this Lease for a previous
default. Landlord's acceptance of rent following an event of default hereunder
shall not be construed as Landlord's waiver of such event of default. No waiver
by Landlord of any violation or breach of any of the terms, provisions and
covenants herein contained shall be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver
of any other violation or breach of any of the terms, provisions and covenants
herein contained. Forbearance by Landlord to enforce one or more of the remedies
herein provided upon an event of default shall not be deemed or construed to
constitute a waiver of any other violation or default. The failure of Landlord
to enforce the rules described in Paragraph 15 against Tenant or any other
tenant in the Building shall not be deemed a waiver of any such rules. No
provisions of this Lease shall be deemed to have been waived by Landlord unless
such waiver is in writing and is signed by Landlord. The rights granted to
Landlord in this Lease shall be cumulative of every other right or remedy which
Landlord may otherwise have at law or in equity, and the exercise of one or more
rights or remedies shall not prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent
exercise of other rights or remedies. If either Landlord or Tenant brings any
action under this Lease for the enforcement of any rights hereunder, the losing
party agrees to pay to the prevailing party the reasonable attorney's fees and
other costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with
such litigation.

     30.   JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY. If there are two or more parties
comprising Tenant, the obligations imposed upon Tenant pursuant to this Lease
shall be joint and several. If there is a guarantor of Tenant's obligations
under this Lease, the obligations of Tenant shall be joint and several
obligations of Tenant and such guarantor, and Landlord need not first proceed
against Tenant hereunder before proceeding against such guarantor; nor shall any
such guarantor be released from its guarantee for any reason whatsoever,
including, without limitation, any amendment of this Lease, any forbearance by
Landlord or waiver of any of Landlord's rights, the failure to give Tenant or
such guarantor any notices, or the release of any party liable for the payment
of Tenant's obligations hereunder.

     31.   CONSTRUCTIVE EVICTION. Tenant shall not be entitled to claim a
constructive eviction from the Premises unless Tenant shall have first notified
Landlord in writing of the condition or conditions giving rise thereto, and, if
the complaints be justified, unless Landlord shall have failed to remedy such
conditions within a reasonable time after receipt of said notice.

     32.   BUILDING NAME. Landlord reserves the right at any time to change the
name by which the Building is designated, and Landlord shall have no obligation
or liability whatsoever for costs or expenses incurred by Tenant as a result of
such name change of the Building.

     33.   SUBORDINATION. This Lease and all rights of Tenant hereunder are
subject and subordinate to any deeds of trust, mortgages or other instruments of
security which do now or may hereafter cover the Building and the Land or any
interest of Landlord therein, and to any and all advances made on the security
thereof, and to any and all increases, renewals, modifications, consolidations,
replacements and extensions of any of such deeds of trust, mortgages or
instruments of security. This provision is hereby declared by Landlord and
Tenant to be self-operative and no further instrument shall be required to
effect such subordination of this Lease. Tenant shall, however, upon demand at
any time or times execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord any and all
instruments and certificates that, in the judgment of Landlord, may

                                       16
<Page>

be necessary or proper to confirm or evidence such subordination, and Tenant
hereby irrevocably appoints Landlord as Tenant's agent and attorney-in-fact for
the purpose of executing, acknowledging and delivering any such instruments and
certificates. However, notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing
provisions of this Paragraph 33, Tenant agrees that any such mortgagee shall
have the right at any time to subordinate any such deeds of trust, mortgages or
other instruments of security to this Lease on such terms and subject to such
conditions as such mortgagee may deem appropriate in its discretion. Tenant
further covenants and agrees upon demand by Landlord's mortgagee at any time,
before or after the institution of any proceedings for the foreclosure of
any such deeds of trust, mortgages or other instruments of security, or sale of
the Building pursuant to any such deeds of trust, mortgages or other instruments
of security or voluntary sale, to attorn to such purchaser upon any such sale
and to recognize and attorn to such purchaser as Landlord under this Lease. The
agreement of Tenant to attorn upon demand of Landlord's mortgagee contained in
the immediately preceding sentence shall survive any such foreclosure sale or
trustee's sale. Tenant hereby agrees to execute, acknowledge and deliver to
Landlord's mortgagee any and all instruments and certificates that in the
judgment of Landlord's mortgagee may be necessary or proper to confirm or
evidence such attornment, and Tenant hereby irrevocably appoints Landlord's
mortgagee as Tenant's agent and attorney-in-fact for the purpose of executing,
acknowledging and delivering any such instruments and certificates.

     34.   LEASE CERTIFICATES: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Tenant agrees to furnish
from time to time, within ten (10) days after requested by Landlord or any
successor to Landlord or by the holder of any deed of trust or mortgage covering
the Land and Building or any interest of Landlord therein, a certificate signed
by Tenant to the effect that this Lease is then presently in full force and
effect and specifying any modifications; that the term of this Lease has
commenced and the full rental is then accruing hereunder; that Tenant has
accepted possession of the Premises and that any improvements required by the
terms of this Lease to be made by Landlord have been completed to the
satisfaction of Tenant; that no rent under this Lease has been paid more than
thirty (30) days in advance of its due date; that the address for notices to be
sent to Tenant is as set forth in this Lease; that Tenant, as of the date of
such certificate, has no charge, lien or claim of offset under this Lease or
otherwise against rents or other charges due or to become due hereunder; and
that to the knowledge of Tenant, Landlord is not then in default under this
Lease. The certificate shall also contain an acknowledgment by Tenant of receipt
of notice of the assignment of this Lease to such holder and the agreement by
Tenant with such holder that from and after the date of such certificate, Tenant
will not pay any rent under this Lease more than 30 days in advance of its due
date, will not surrender or consent to the modification of any of the terms of
this Lease nor to the termination of this Lease by Landlord, and will not seek
to terminate this Lease by reason of any act or omission of Landlord until
Tenant shall have given written notice of such act or omission to the holder of
such deed of trust or mortgage (at such holder's last address furnished to
Tenant) and until a reasonable period of time shall have elapsed following the
giving of such notice, during which period such holder shall have the right, but
shall not be obligated, to remedy such act or omission: provided, however,
that (i) the agreement of Tenant described in this sentence will be of no effect
under such certificate unless Tenant is furnished by such holder with a copy of
any assignment to such holder of Landlord's interest in this Lease within ninety
(90) days after the date of such certificate, and (ii) the agreement of Tenant
with such holder that is embodied in such certificate shall terminate upon the
subsequent termination of any such assignment. Tenant shall also furnish to
Landlord when requested by Landlord, but no more often than one time per
calendar year, a statement of the financial condition of Tenant prepared by an
independent Certified Public Accountant and in form reasonably satisfactory to
Landlord.

     35.   LIMITATION OF LANDLORD LIABILITY. The liability of Landlord to tenant
for any default by Landlord under the terms of this Lease shall be limited to
the interest of Landlord in the Building and the Land, and Landlord shall not be
personally liable for any deficiency. This clause shall not be deemed to limit
or deny any remedies which Tenant may have in the event of default by Landlord
hereunder which do not involve the personal liability of Landlord.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, in the event
Landlord sells, assigns, transfers or conveys its interest in the Land, Landlord
shall have no liability for any acts or omissions that occur after the date of
said sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance.

                                       17
<Page>

     36.   CONSENTS. In all circumstances under this Lease where the prior
consent of one party (the "consenting party"), whether i( be Landlord or Tenant,
is required before the other party (the "requesting party") is authorized to
take any particular type of action, such consent shall not be withheld in a
wholly unreasonable and arbitrary manner; however, the requesting party agrees
that its exclusive remedy if it believes that consent has been withheld
improperly (including, but not limited to, consent required from Landlord
pursuant to Paragraph 11 or Paragraph 21 of this Lease) shall be to institute
litigation either for a declaratory judgment or for a mandatory injunction
requiring that such consent be given (with the requesting party hereby waiving
any claim for damages, attorneys fees or any other remedy unless the consenting
party refuses to comply with a court order or judgment requiring it to grant its
consent).

     37.   NOTICES. Any notice required or permitted to be given hereunder by
one party to the other shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United
States mail, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, with
sufficient postage prepaid, or hand delivered, addressed to the respective party
to whom notice is intended to be given at the address of such party set forth
below its name where it has executed this Lease. Either party hereto may at any
time by giving written notice to the other party in the aforesaid manner
designate any other address in substitution of the foregoing address to which
any such notice shall be given.

     38.   BROKERAGE. Landlord and Tenant warrant to each other that they have
not had any dealings with any broker or agent in connection with the negotiation
or execution of this Lease except for the Leasing Agent, or Agents, if any,
listed in Paragraph l(j) of this Lease; and each party agrees to indemnify the
other party and hold the other party harmless from and against any and all
costs, expenses or liability for commissions or other compensation or charges
claimed by any other broker or agent, through commitments of the indemnifying
party with respect to this Lease.

     39.   FORCE MAJEURE. Whenever a period of time is herein prescribed for
action to be taken by Landlord or Tenant, the party taking the action shall not
be liable or responsible for, and there shall be excluded from the computation
for any such period of time, any reasonable delays due to strikes, riots, acts
of God, shortages of labor or materials, war, governmental laws, regulations or
restrictions or any other causes of any kind whatsoever which are beyond the
reasonable control of such party; provided, however, in no event shall the
foregoing apply to the financial obligations of either Landlord or Tenant to the
other under this Lease, including Tenant's obligation to pay Base Rentals and
all other amounts payable to Landlord hereunder.

     40.   NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY. This Lease is for the sole benefit of
Landlord, its successors and assigns, and Tenant, its permitted successors and
assigns, and it is not for the benefit of any third party.

     41.   SEVERABILITY. If any clause or provision of this Lease is illegal,
invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws effective during the term
of this Lease, then and in that event, it is the intention of the parties hereto
that the remainder of this Lease shall not be affected thereby, and it is also
the intention of the parties to this Lease that in lieu of each clause or
provision that is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, there be added as a part of
this Lease a clause or provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable clause or provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and
enforceable.

     44.   ENTIRE AGREEMENT: NO WARRANTIES. This Lease contains the entire
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes any and all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings,
promises, and representations made by either party to the other concerning the
subject matter hereof and the terms applicable hereto. It is expressly agreed by
Tenant, as a material consideration for the execution of this Lease that there
have been no agreements pertaining to the Premises, the Building or this Lease
not incorporated in writing herein and that this Lease shall not be altered,
waived, amended or extended, except by a written agreement signed by the parties
hereto, unless otherwise expressly provided herein. Landlord's duties and
warranties are limited to those set forth in this Lease, and shall not include
any implied duties or warranties, all of which are hereby disclaimed by Landlord
and waived by Tenant. In particular, Landlord disclaims, and Tenant waives, any
warranty that the Premises are suitable or fit for any particular purpose or
use.

     45.   NO IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS. LANDLORD AND TENANT HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT THEY ARE NOT RELYING UPON ANY BROCHURE, RENDERING, INFORMATION,
REPRESENTATION, PROMISE OR UNDERSTANDING OF THE OTHER, OR OF ANY LEASING AGENT,
EXCEPT AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LEASE.

     46.   CONTINGENCY; REIMBURSEMENT; EFFECTIVE DATE. (a) The submission by
Landlord of this instrument to Tenant for examination, negotiation or signature
does not constitute an option for, or a representation by Landlord regarding, a
prospective lease. This Lease shall be effective if and when (and only if and
when) both (i) this Lease has been signed on behalf of both Landlord and Tenant
AND (ii) Tenant has delivered a written notice to Landlord (the "Approval
Notice) that this Lease has been approved by Tenant's Board of Directors. When
both such conditions have been satisfied, the effective date of this Lease (the
"Effective Date") shall be the date of the Approval Notice. If for any reason
whatsoever the Effective Date of this Lease has not occurred on or before June
15, 1997, then subject to subparagraphs (b) and (c) of this Paragraph 46, this
Lease shall be null and void and of no force or effect.

     (b)   If this Lease is signed on behalf of both Landlord and Tenant but the
Effective Date fails to occur because the Approval Notice is not delivered by
June 15, 1997, then Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for Landlord's legal fees in
connection with this Lease and for Landlord's expenses relating to space
planning for the Premises.

     (c)   Notwithstanding anything contained in subparagraph (a) of this
Paragraph 46, the parties hereby agree that if the Effective Date does not occur
on or before June 15, 1997, but this Lease nevertheless is in fact signed on
behalf of both parties and either (i) Landlord and Tenant mutually agree to
Approved Working Drawings for leasehold improvements to the Initial Used Space
(as contemplated in Paragraph 3 of EXHIBIT D-l), or (ii) Tenant occupies the
Premises, or both, then subparagraphs (a) and (b) immediately above shall be
inoperative, the remainder of this Lease shall be in full force and effect and
the Effective Date of this Lease shall be deemed to be the earlier of the dates
contemplated in alternatives (i) and (ii) of this sentence.

     AGREEMENT is made as of the 13th day of November, 1997, by and between AGF

the Lease;

     WHEREAS, Tenant now knows the exact amount of Rentable Space for the

     the first (1st) floor of the Building (the "First Floor Space").

2.   Paragraph 1(d) of the Lease is hereby amended by substituting the date

     the "Lease Term", and by deleting the words "subject to the possibility of
     adjustment as explained in Paragraph 8 below." Accordingly, the Lease Term
     shall be a period of 120 months commencing on November 15, 1997 and ending

                    in the First Floor Space.

4.   Paragraph 1(m) and EXHIBITS D-1 and D-2 of the Lease are hereby modified to
     provide as follows:

               Space and the Initial Occupied First Floor Space, but also an
               additional $211,217.00 (the "Additional Allowance Increment").

          (b)  In consideration for the Additional Allowance Increment, Tenant

               which may be approved by Tenant), for construction related to the
               Building and the Premises.

     prefers for the carport, and (ii) Landlord obtains the necessary approvals
     contemplated in the Carport Provision.

6.   The terms of this First Amendment to Lease shall be binding upon and inure
     to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
     assigns.
