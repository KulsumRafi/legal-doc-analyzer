        <TD width="93%"><FONT size="2">Section&nbsp;3.1.4 is modified by adding the following to the end of the
Section: &#147;Subject to Borrower&#146;s receipt from Lender of $450,000 on or
prior to February&nbsp;19, 2003, and $200,000 on or prior to March&nbsp;15, 2003,
representing the entire remaining balance of the Second Advance, Lender
shall be entitled to convert the aggregate principal amount of the First
Advance and the Second Advance that have been provided to Borrower, as
well as $6,888.89 of interest that has accrued prior to this Amendment,
into shares of NextNet Wireless, Inc. (&#147;<B>NextNet</B>&#148;) Series&nbsp;A Preferred
Stock held by Borrower (the &#147;<B>Shares</B>&#148;) at a per share conversion price
that is the lesser of $6.00 per share or such lower initial per share
price (on a common share equivalent basis, without giving effect to
differences in rights or to anti-dilution provisions or any other
purchase price adjustments set forth in the NextNet financing agreement)
that NextNet agrees to receive for any sale of other preferred stock in
an amount that is at least one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) before
June&nbsp;30, 2003. A prior election by Lender to convert the Advances it
provided and eligible interest under this Agreement shall not affect
its eligibility to receive the benefit of conversion at a lower initial
per share price from a subsequent NextNet financing agreement if Lender
would have otherwise been eligible pursuant to this Agreement to obtain
such lower initial per share price if it had waited until the NextNet
financing agreement was completed to exercise its conversion rights. If
Borrower does not receive the entire remaining balance of the Second
Advance by remittances from Lender to Borrower of the amounts of
$450,000 on or prior to February&nbsp;19, 2003, and $200,000 on or prior to
March&nbsp;15, 2003, the remedies set forth above that have not already been
effectuated pursuant to provisions of this Amendment shall apply.
Notwithstanding the above, each party acknowledges that Lender&#146;s receipt
of the Shares, at any price, may be subject to the rights of first
refusal on the parts of NextNet and certain of its investors as set
forth in the Right of First Refusal Agreement.&#148;</FONT></TD>
