GUARANTY (this &#147;<U>Guaranty</U>&#148;) is executed as of the 31st day of
December, 2002 (the &#147;<U>Effective Date</U>&#148;), by Entrust Mortgage,
Inc., a Colorado corporation (&#147;<U>Guarantor</U>&#148;), for the benefit
of<B> </B>BBSB, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company
(&#147;<U>Lender</U>&#148;). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
on the Effective Date, Entrust Financial Services, Inc., a Colorado corporation
(the &#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;), delivered to Lender a promissory note in the
amount of $2,000,000 (the &#147;<U>Note</U>&#148;) to evidence a loan made by
Lender to the Company (the &#147;<U>Loan</U>&#148;); </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Guarantor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in order to induce Lender to make the Loan, Guarantor has agreed to guaranty the
full and punctual payment of (a) all amounts due under the Note, when and as
due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise; and (b) all other
obligations of the Company to Lender under the Note, together with the full and
prompt payment of any and all costs and expenses of and incidental to the
collection of the Guaranteed Obligations (as defined below) or the enforcement
of this Guaranty, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#146; fees
and the allocated cost of in-house legal services; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Guarantor has also agreed to grant to Lender a security interest in all of its
assets to secure this Guaranty pursuant to a Security Agreement (the
&#147;<U>Security Agreement</U>&#148;) delivered by Guarantor to Lender on the
Effective Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, as an inducement to Lender to make the Loan and accept the Note, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and legal sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties do hereby agree as follows: </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>NATURE AND
SCOPE OF GUARANTY</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Guaranty
of Obligation</U>.  Guarantor hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees the payment and performance of the Note as and when
the same shall be due and payable (the &#147;<U>Guaranteed
</U>Obligations&#148;). Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
covenants and agrees that he is liable for the Guaranteed Obligations as a
primary obligor.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Nature
of Guaranty</U>. This Guaranty is an irrevocable, absolute,
continuing guaranty of payment and performance and not a guaranty of collection.
This Guaranty may not be revoked by Guarantor and shall continue to be effective
with respect to any Guaranteed Obligations arising or created after any
attempted revocation by Guarantor and after Guarantor&#146;s death (in which
event this Guaranty shall be binding upon Guarantor&#146;s estate and
Guarantor&#146;s legal representatives and heirs). The fact that at any time or
from time to time the Guaranteed Obligations may be increased or reduced shall
not release or discharge the obligation of Guarantor to Lender with respect to
the Guaranteed Obligations. This Guaranty may be enforced by Lender and any
successor in interest to Lender and shall not be discharged by the assignment of
Lender&#146;s interest, rights, obligations and liabilities under the Note.
Guarantor&#146;s obligations to pay and perform the Guaranteed Obligations are
limited to the Collateral (as defined in the Security Agreement).</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Payment
By Guarantor</U>. If all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations
shall not be punctually performed or paid when due, whether at demand, maturity,
acceleration or otherwise, Lender may exercise its rights with respect to the
Collateral pursuant to the terms of the Security Agreement.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Waivers</U>.
Guarantor hereby waives (a) all notice of acceptance hereof, protest, demand and
dishonor, presentment, and demands of any kind now or hereafter provided for by
any statute or rule of law, (b) any right to require Lender to proceed against
the Company or to pursue any rights or remedies with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations including any other remedy whatsoever in Lender&#146;s power, (c)
any defense arising by reason of any bankruptcy, reorganization, discharge by
the filing of bankruptcy, or discharge in bankruptcy of the Company or of the
Guaranteed Obligations, (d) any defense arising by insolvency, lack of authority
or power, or dissolution of the Company (even though rendering the Guaranteed
Obligations void, unenforceable, or otherwise uncollectible), it being
understood that Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder, regardless of whether
the Company or any such other party be found not liable thereon for any of the
foregoing reasons or otherwise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Payment
of Expenses</U>. In the event that Guarantor should breach or fail to
timely perform any provisions of this Guaranty, Guarantor shall, immediately
upon demand by Lender, pay Lender all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys&#146; fees) incurred by
Lender in the enforcement hereof or the preservation of Lender&#146;s rights
hereunder.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Effect
of Bankruptcy</U>. In the event that, pursuant to any insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership or other debtor relief law, or any
judgment, order or decision thereunder, Lender must rescind or restore any
payment, or any part thereof, received by Lender in satisfaction of the
Guaranteed Obligations, as set forth herein, any prior release or discharge from
the terms of this Guaranty given to Guarantor by Lender shall be without effect,
and this Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect. It is the intention of
Lender, the Company and Guarantor that Guarantor&#146;s obligations hereunder
shall not be discharged except by Guarantor&#146;s performance of such
obligations and then only to the extent of such performance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Waiver
of Subrogation, Reimbursement and Contribution</U>. Until such time
as the Guaranteed Obligations are satisfied in full, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Guaranty, Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably waives, releases and abrogates any and all rights it may now or
hereafter have under any agreement, at law or in equity (including, without
limitation, any law subrogating the Guarantor to the rights of Lender), to
assert any claim against or seek contribution, indemnification or any other form
of reimbursement from any other party liable for payment of any or all of the
Guaranteed Obligations for any payment made by Guarantor under or in connection
with this Guaranty or otherwise.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Events
and Circumstances Not Reducing or Discharging Guarantor&#146;s
Obligations</U>. Guarantor hereby agrees that (a) the sums due under
the Guaranteed Obligations may be modified, amended, extended, or terminated,
(b) any party that may become personally liable under the Note may hereafter be
released from such party&#146;s liability thereunder, or (c) Lender may take or
delay in taking or refuse to take any and all action with reference to the
Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty (regardless of whether any such action
might vary the risk or alter the rights, remedies, or recourses of the
Guarantor), including, without limitation, settling or compromising any amount
allegedly due hereunder or thereunder, all without notice to, consideration to,
or the consent of Guarantor, and no such acts shall in any way release,
diminish, or affect the absolute nature of the Guarantor&#146;s obligations and
liabilities hereunder.</FONT> </P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarantor
represents and warrants to Lender as of the Effective date as follows:</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Authority
and Validity</U>. Guarantor has the requisite power, authority and
capacity to execute and deliver, to perform his obligations under, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, this Guaranty. This Guaranty is the
valid and binding obligations of Guarantor, enforceable against Guarantor in
accordance with its terms, except insofar as enforceability may be affected by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors&#146; rights generally or by
principles governing the availability of equitable remedies.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Noncontravention</U>.
The execution, delivery and performance by Guarantor of this Guaranty will not
(a) require any consent, approval or authorization of, or any filing with or
notice to, any person, entity or agency, except for such consents, approvals,
authorizations, filings and notices as have been obtained, made or given or (b)
violate any law to which Guarantor is subject.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Litigation</U>.
There are no actions pending or, to the knowledge of Guarantor, threatened,
against Guarantor that have resulted or could reasonably be expected to result
in a material adverse effect on Guarantor or the Company or its assets, or that
question the validity of this Guaranty or of any action taken or to be taken
pursuant to or in connection with the provisions of this Guaranty.</FONT> </P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">MISCELLANEOUS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Waiver</U>.
No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of Lender, any
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right. The rights of Lender hereunder shall be in addition
to all other rights provided by law. No modification or waiver of any provision
of this Guaranty, nor consent to departure therefrom, shall be effective unless
in writing and no such consent or waiver shall extend beyond the particular case
and purpose involved. No notice or demand given in any case shall constitute a
waiver of the right to take other action in the same, similar or other instances
without such notice or demand.</FONT> </P>
