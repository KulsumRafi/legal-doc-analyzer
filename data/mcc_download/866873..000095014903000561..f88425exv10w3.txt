securities intermediary directing transfer or redemption of the financial assets
to which such Grantor has a security entitlement) originated by the Collateral
Agent without further consent of such Grantor, such authenticated record to be
in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto or otherwise in form and substance

security interest granted hereunder in such Control.

          (f)  Upon the request of the Collateral Agent, such Grantor will
notify each such issuer of Pledged Debt that such Pledged Debt is subject to the
security interest granted hereunder.

other Person from the Cash Collateral Account.

          (c)  The Collateral Agent may, at any time and without notice to, or

time to time (a) invest amounts received with respect to the Cash Collateral
Account in such Cash Equivalent Investments credited to (A) the Cash Collateral
Account as the Borrower may select and the Collateral Agent may approve or (B)
in the case of Cash Equivalent Investments consisting of Securities Collateral,
a securities account subject to a Securities Account Control Agreement, and (b)
invest interest paid on the Cash Equivalent Investments referred to in clause

   manner specified in Section 9-107 of the UCC; and

          (c)  Each Grantor will immediately give notice to the Collateral
   Agent of any commercial tort claim that such Guarantor has elected to
   prosecute and will promptly execute or otherwise authenticate a supplement to
   this Agreement, and otherwise take all necessary action, to subject such
   commercial tort claim to the first priority security interest created under
   this Agreement.

          Section 8.     Representations and Warranties. Each Grantor
represents and warrants as follows:

          (a)  Such Grantor's exact legal name, as defined in Section 9-503(a)
   of the UCC, is correctly set forth in Schedule I hereto. Such Grantor has
   only the trade names, domain names and marks listed on Schedule V hereto.

<PAGE>

organizational identification number from those set forth in SCHEDULE I hereto
except as disclosed in SCHEDULE III hereto.

     (b)  All of the Equipment and Inventory of such Grantor are located at the
places specified therefor in SCHEDULE III hereto, as such SCHEDULE III may be
amended from time to time pursuant to SECTION 10(a). Within the 5 years
preceding the execution of this Agreement, such Grantor has not previously
changed the location of its Equipment and Inventory except as set forth in
SCHEDULE V hereto. All Security Collateral consisting of certificated
securities and instruments have been delivered to the Collateral Agent.
Original copies of each Assigned Agreement and all originals of all tangible
chattel paper evidencing an aggregate principal amount, taken together with all
other electronic chattel paper, all tangible chattel paper, the aggregate face
amount of all letter of credit rights and the aggregate face amount of all
letters of credit owned by the Grantors, in excess of $10,000,000 that
evidence Receivables have been delivered to the Collateral Agent. None of the
Receivables or Agreement Collateral is evidenced by a promissory note or other
instrument that has not been delivered to the Collateral Agent.

     (c)  Such Grantor is the legal and beneficial owner of the Collateral of
such Grantor free and clear of any Lien, claim, option or right of others,
except for the security interest created under this Agreement and Permitted
Liens. No effective financing statement or other instrument similar in effect
covering all or any part of such Collateral or listing such Grantor or, to such
Grantor's knowledge, any trade name of such Grantor as debtor is on file in any
recording office, except such as may have been filed in favor of the Collateral
Agent relating to the Loan Documents or as otherwise permitted by the Credit
Agreement.

     (d)  Such Grantor has possession and control of the Equipment and
Inventory other than Equipment and Inventory stored at any leased premises or
warehouse for which the Collateral Agent and the Grantor have agreed that the
Grantor shall use its best efforts to obtain a landlord's or warehouseman's
agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral
Agent. Each such leased premises or warehouse is indicated by an asterisk on
SCHEDULE III hereto, as such SCHEDULE III may be amended from time to time
pursuant to SECTION 10(a). Except as may be disclosed to the Collateral Agent
in writing from time to time, in the case of Equipment and Inventory located on
leased premises or in warehouses, no lessor or warehouseman of any premises or
warehouse upon or in which such Equipment or Inventory is located has (i)
issued any warehouse receipt or other receipt in the nature of a warehouse
receipt in respect of any Equipment or Inventory, (ii) issued any document for
any of such Grantor's Equipment or Inventory, (iii) received notification of
any secured party's interest (other than the security interest granted
hereunder) in such Grantor's Equipment or Inventory or (iv) any Lien, claim or

Inventory.

     (e)  The Pledged Equity pledged by such Grantor hereunder has been duly
authorized and validly issued and is fully paid and non-assessable. With
respect to the Pledged Equity that is an uncertificated security, such Grantor
has caused the issuer thereof either (i) to register the Collateral Agent as
the registered owner of such security

                                       11






<PAGE>
or (ii) to agree in an authenticated record with such Grantor and the Collateral
Agent that such issuer will comply with instructions with respect to such
security originated by the Collateral Agent without further consent of such
Grantor. If such Grantor is an issuer of Pledged Equity, such Grantor confirms
that it has received notice of such security interest. To such Grantor's
knowledge, the Pledged Debt pledged by such Grantor hereunder has been duly
authorized, authenticated or issued and delivered and is the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the issuers thereof. To the extent such Pledged Debt is
evidenced by one or more promissory notes and evidence aggregate obligations,
taken together with all Security Collateral owned by the Grantors, in excess of
$10,000,000, such notes have been delivered to the Collateral Agent. To each
Grantor's knowledge, none of the Pledged Debt pledged by it is in default.

     (f)  The Initial Pledged Equity pledged by such Grantor constitutes the
percentage of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of the issuers thereof
indicated on Schedule II hereto. The Initial Pledged Debt constitutes all of the
outstanding indebtedness owed to such Grantor by the issuers thereof and is
outstanding in the principal amount indicated on Schedule II hereto.

     (g)  All of the investment property owned by such Grantor is listed on
Schedule 8.4(l) to the Credit Agreement.

     (h)  The Assigned Agreements to which such Grantor is a party have been
duly authorized, executed and delivered by such Grantor and, to such Grantor's
knowledge, by the counter-parties thereto.

     (i)  Such Grantor is not a beneficiary or assignee under any letter of
credit, other than the letters of credit described in Schedule VIII hereto, as
such Schedule VIII may be amended from time to time, and legal, binding and
enforceable Consents to Assignment of Letter of Credit Rights, in the form of
the Consent to Assignment of Letter of Credit Rights attached hereto as Exhibit
G, are in effect for each letter of credit that constitutes Collateral, except
to the extent control over any such letter-of-credit right is not required by
Section 7(b) hereof.

     (j)  This Agreement creates in favor of the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Secured Parties a valid security interest in the Collateral of
such Grantor, securing the payment of the Secured Obligations. When UCC
financing statements naming each Grantor, as debtor and the Collateral Agent, as
secured party, and identifying the Collateral have been filed with the Secretary
of State of the jurisdiction of incorporation of each Grantor, the security
interest created under this Agreement shall constitute a perfected security
interest in the Collateral described on such UCC financing statements to the
extent that a security interest therein may be perfected by filing pursuant to
the relevant UCC, prior to all other Liens and rights of others therein except
for Permitted Liens.

     (k)  No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or
filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or, to any Grantor's
knowledge, any other third party is required for (i) the grant by such Grantor
of the security interest


                                       12
<PAGE>
granted hereunder or for the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement by such Grantor, (ii) the perfection or maintenance of the security
interest created hereunder (including the first priority nature of such security
interest), except for the filing of financing and continuation statements under
the UCC, the recordation of the Intellectual Property Security Agreements
referred to in Section 13(f) with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the
U.S. Copyright Office and the actions described in Section 4 with respect to
Security Collateral or (iii) the exercise by the Collateral Agent of its voting
or other rights provided for in this Agreement or the remedies in respect of the
Collateral pursuant to this Agreement, except as may be required in connection
with the disposition of any portion of the Security Collateral by laws affecting
the offering and sale of securities generally.

     (l)  The Inventory that has been produced or distributed by such Grantor
has been produced in compliance with all requirements of applicable law,
including, without limitation, the Fair Labor Standards Act.

     (m)  As to itself and its Intellectual Property Collateral:

          (i)   To such Grantor's knowledge, the operation of such Grantor's
     business as currently conducted or as contemplated to be conducted and the
     use of the Intellectual Property Collateral in connection therewith do not
     conflict with, infringe, misappropriate, dilute, misuse or otherwise
     violate the intellectual property rights of any third party.

          (ii)  Such Grantor is the exclusive owner of all right, title and
     interest in and to such Grantor's interests in the Intellectual Property
     Collateral, and is entitled to use all Intellectual Property Collateral
     subject only to the terms of the IP Agreements.

          (iii) The Intellectual Property Collateral set forth on Schedule V
     hereto includes all of the registered patents, patent applications, domain
     names, trademark registrations and applications, copyright registrations
     and applications and IP Agreements owned by such Grantor.

          (iv)  The Intellectual Property Collateral is subsisting and has not
     been adjudged invalid or unenforceable in whole or part, and to the best of
     such Grantor's knowledge, is valid and enforceable. Such Grantor is not
     aware of any uses of any item of Intellectual Property Collateral that
     could be expected to lead to such item becoming invalid or unenforceable.

          (v)   Except for such items of Intellectual Property Collateral that
     such Grantor reasonably determines are of insignificant or immaterial
     economic value, such Grantor has made or performed all filings, recordings
     and other acts and has paid all required fees and taxes to maintain and
     protect its interest in each and every item of Intellectual Property
     Collateral in full force and effect throughout the world, and to protect
     and maintain its interest therein including, without limitation,
     recordations of any of its interests in the Patents and Trademarks with

                                       13


<PAGE>
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in corresponding national and
international patent offices, and recordation of any of its interests in the
Copyrights with the U.S. Copyright Office and in corresponding national and
international copyright offices. Such Grantor has used proper statutory notice
in connection with its use of each material patent, trademark and copyright in
the Intellectual Property Collateral.

     (vi)   No claim, action, suit, investigation, litigation or proceeding has
been asserted or is pending or to such Grantor's knowledge threatened against
such Grantor (i) based upon or challenging or seeking to deny or restrict the
Grantor's rights in or use of any of the Intellectual Property Collateral, (ii)
alleging that the Grantor's rights in or use of the Intellectual Property
Collateral or that any services provided by, processes used by, or products
manufactured or sold by, such Grantor infringe, misappropriate, dilute, misuse
or otherwise violate any patent, trademark, copyright or any other proprietary
right of any third party, or (iii) alleging that the Intellectual Property
Collateral is being licensed or sublicensed in violation or contravention of the
terms of any license or other agreement. To such Grantor's knowledge, no Person
is engaging in any activity that infringes, misappropriates, dilutes, misuses or
otherwise violates the Intellectual Property Collateral or the Grantor's rights
in or use thereof. Except as set forth on Schedule V hereto, such Grantor has
not granted any license, release, covenant not to sue, non-assertion assurance,
or other right to any Person with respect to any part of the Intellectual
Property Collateral. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents will not result in the termination or material impairment
of any of the Intellectual Property Collateral.

     (vii)  With respect to each IP Agreement: (A) to such Grantor's knowledge,
such IP Agreement is valid and binding and in full force and effect and
represents the entire agreement between the respective parties thereto with
respect to the subject matter thereof; (B) such IP Agreement will not cease to
be valid and binding and in full force and effect on terms identical to those
currently in effect as a result of the rights and interest granted herein, nor
will the grant of such rights and interest constitute a material breach or
default under such IP Agreement or otherwise give any party thereto a right to
terminate such IP Agreement; (C) such Grantor has not received any notice of
termination or cancellation under such IP Agreement; (D) such Grantor has not
received any notice of a breach or default under such IP Agreement, which breach
or default has not been cured; (E) such Grantor has not granted to any other
third party any adverse rights under such IP Agreement; and (F) neither such
Grantor nor to such Grantor's knowledge, any other party to such IP Agreement is
in breach or default thereof in any material respect, and to such Grantor's
knowledge, no event has occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or both,

acceleration under such IP Agreement.

     (viii) To the best of such Grantor's knowledge, (A) none of the Trade
Secrets of such Grantor has been used, divulged, disclosed or appropriated to
the

                                       14

<PAGE>
          detriment of such Grantor for the benefit of any other Person other
          than such Grantor; (B) no employee, independent contractor or agent of
          such Grantor has misappropriated any trade secrets of any other Person
          in the course of the performance of his or her duties as an employee,
          independent contractor or agent of such Grantor; and (C) no employee,
          independent contractor or agent of such Grantor is in default or
          breach of any term of any employment agreement, non-disclosure
          agreement, assignment of inventions agreement or similar agreement or
          contract relating in any way to the protection, ownership,
          development, use or transfer of such Grantor's Intellectual Property
          Collateral.

               (ix) No Grantor or Intellectual Property Collateral is subject to
          any outstanding consent, settlement, decree, order, injunction,
          judgment or ruling restricting the use of any Intellectual Property
          Collateral or that would impair the validity or enforceability of such
          Intellectual Property Collateral.

     Schedule VIII hereto.

          Section 9.     Further Assurances. (a) Each Grantor agrees that from
time to time, at the expense of such Grantor, such Grantor will promptly execute
and deliver, or otherwise authenticate, all further instruments and documents,
and take all further action that may be necessary or desirable, or that the
Collateral Agent may request, in order to perfect and protect any pledge or
security interest granted or purported to be granted by such Grantor hereunder

similar effect) of such Grantor, in each case without the signature of such
Grantor, and regardless of whether any particular asset described in such
financing statements falls within the scope of the UCC or the granting clause of
this Agreement. A photocopy or other reproduction of this Agreement or any

maintain with financially sound and reputable independent insurers, insurance
with respect to the Equipment and Inventory of such Grantor against loss or
damage of the kinds customarily insured against by Persons engaged in the same
or similar business, of such types and in such amounts as are customarily
carried under similar circumstances by such other Persons. Each policy for
property damage insurance shall provide for all losses (except for losses of
less than $5,000,000 per occurrence) to be paid directly to the Collateral
Agent. Each such policy shall in addition (i) name such Grantor and the
Collateral Agent as insured parties thereunder (without any representation or
warranty by or obligation upon the Collateral Agent) as their interests may
appear, (ii) provide that there shall be no recourse against the Collateral
Agent for payment of premiums or other amounts with respect thereto and (iii)
provide that at least 10 days' prior written notice of cancellation or of lapse
shall be given to the Collateral Agent by the insurer. Each Grantor will, if so
requested by the Collateral Agent, deliver to the Collateral Agent original or
duplicate policies of such insurance and, as often as the Collateral Agent may
reasonably request (which shall not be more often than once in any calendar year
unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing), a report of a
reputable insurance broker with respect to such insurance. Further, each Grantor
will, at the request of the Collateral Agent after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, duly execute and deliver instruments of
assignment of such insurance policies to comply with the requirements of Section
10 and cause the insurers to acknowledge notice of such assignment.

          (b) Reimbursement under any liability insurance maintained by any
Grantor pursuant to this Section 11 may be paid directly to the Person who shall
have incurred liability covered by such insurance. In case of any loss involving
damage to Equipment or Inventory when subsection (c) of this Section 11 is not
applicable, the applicable Grantor will make or cause to be made the necessary
repairs to or replacements of such Equipment or Inventory, and any proceeds of
insurance properly received by or released to such Grantor shall be used by such
Grantor, except as otherwise required hereunder or by the Credit Agreement, to
pay or as reimbursement for the costs of such repairs or replacements.

          (c) So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, all insurance payments received by the Collateral Agent in
connection with any loss, damage or destruction of any Inventory or Equipment
will be released by the Collateral Agent to the Applicable Grantor for the
repair, replacement or restoration thereof. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of a Default, to the extent that (i) the amount of any such
insurance payments exceeds the cost of any such repair, replacement or
restoration, or (ii) such insurance payments are not otherwise required by the
applicable Grantor to complete any such repair,


                                       17
<PAGE>
replacement or restoration required hereunder, the Collateral Agent will not be
required to release the amount thereof to such Grantor and may hold or continue
to hold such amount in the Cash Collateral Account as additional security for
the Secured Obligations of such Grantor (except that the Collateral Agent will
release to such Grantor any such amount if and to the extent that any prepayment
of Obligations is required under the Credit Agreement in connection with the
receipt of such amount and such prepayment has been made). Upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of any Event of Default or the actual or constructive
total loss (in excess of $5,000,000 per occurrence) of any Equipment or
Inventory, all insurance payments in respect of such Equipment or Inventory
shall be paid to the Collateral Agent and shall, in the Collateral Agent's sole
discretion, (i) be released to the applicable Grantor to be applied as set forth
in the first sentence of this subsection (c) or (ii) be held as additional
collateral hereunder or applied as specified in Section 22(b).

     Section 12. Post-Closing Changes; Bailees; Collections on Assigned
Agreements, Receivables and Related Contracts. (a) No Grantor will change its
name, type of organization, jurisdiction of organization, organizational
identification number or location from those set forth in Section 8(a) of this
Agreement without first giving at least 30 days' prior written notice to the
Collateral Agent and taking all action required by the Collateral Agent for the
purpose of perfecting or protecting the security interest granted by this
Agreement. Each Grantor will hold and preserve its records relating to the
Collateral, including, without limitation, the Assigned Agreements and Related
Contracts, and will permit representatives of the Collateral Agent at any time
upon reasonable prior notice during normal business hours to inspect and make
abstracts from such records and other documents. If the Grantor does not have an
organizational identification number and later obtains one, it will forthwith
notify the Collateral Agent of such organizational identification number.

     (b) If any Collateral of any Grantor is at any time in the possession or
control of a warehouseman, bailee or agent, and if the Collateral Agent so
requests such Grantor will (i) notify such warehouseman, bailee or agent of the
security interest created hereunder, (ii) instruct such warehouseman, bailee or
agent to hold all such Collateral solely for the Collateral Agent's account
subject only to the Collateral Agent's instructions (which shall permit such
Collateral to be removed by such Grantor in the ordinary course of business
until the Collateral Agent notifies such warehouseman, bailee or agent that an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), (iii) use best efforts, to
cause such warehouseman, bailee or agent to authenticate a record acknowledging
that it holds possession of such Collateral for the Collateral Agent's benefit
and shall act solely on the instructions of the Collateral Agent without the
further consent of the Grantor or any other Person, and (iv) make such
authenticated record available to the Collateral Agent.

     (c) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (c), each Grantor will
continue to collect, at its own expense, all amounts due or to become due such
Grantor under the Assigned Agreements, Receivables and Related Contracts. In
connection with such collections, such Grantor may take (and, at the Collateral
Agent's written direction after the occurrence and during the continuance of a
Default, will take) such action as such Grantor or the Collateral Agent may deem
necessary or advisable to enforce collection of the Assigned Agreements,
Receivables and Related Contracts; provided, however, that the Collateral Agent
shall have the right at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance
of an Event of Default, upon


                                       18
<PAGE>
written notice to such Grantor of its intention to do so, to notify the account
debtors under any Assigned Agreements, Receivables and Related Contracts of the
assignment of such Assigned Agreements, Receivables and Related Contracts to the
Collateral Agent and to direct such account debtors to make payment of all
amounts due or to become due to such Grantor thereunder directly to the
Collateral Agent and, upon such notification and at the expense of such Grantor,
to enforce collection of any such Assigned Agreements, Receivables and Related
Contracts, to adjust, settle or compromise the amount or payment thereof, in the
same manner and to the same extent as such Grantor might have done, and to
otherwise exercise all rights with respect to such Assigned Agreements,
Receivables and Related Contracts, including, without limitation, those set
forth in Section 9-607 of the UCC. After receipt by any Grantor of the notice
from the Collateral Agent referred to in the proviso to the preceding sentence,
(i) all amounts and proceeds (including, without limitation, instruments)
received by such Grantor in respect of the Assigned Agreements, Receivables and
Related Contracts of such Grantor shall be received in trust for the benefit of
the Collateral Agent hereunder, shall be segregated from other funds of such
Grantor and shall be forthwith paid over to the Collateral Agent in the same
form as so received (with any necessary indorsement) to be deposited in the Cash
Collateral Amount and either (A) released to such Grantor so long as no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing or (B) if any Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, applied as provided in Section 22(b) and
(ii) such Grantor will not adjust, settle or compromise the amount or payment of
any Receivable or amount due on any Assigned Agreements, Receivables and Related
Contract, release wholly or partly any Obligor thereof or allow any credit or
discount thereon. No Grantor will permit or consent to the subordination of its
right to payment under any of the Assigned Agreements, Receivables and Related
Contracts to any other indebtedness or obligations of the account debtor or
obligor thereof unless such Grantor deems such subordination advisable in the
exercise of its reasonable business judgment.
<PAGE>
          Section 13.    As to Intellectual Property Collateral. (a) With
respect to each item of its Intellectual Property Collateral, each Grantor
agrees to take, at its expense, all necessary steps, including, without
limitation, in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S. Copyright Office
and any other governmental authority, to (i) maintain the validity and
enforceability of such Intellectual Property Collateral and maintain such
Intellectual Property Collateral in full force and effect, and (ii) pursue the
registration and maintenance of each material patent, trademark, or copyright
registration or application, now or hereafter included in such Intellectual
Property Collateral of such Grantor, including, without limitation, the payment
of required fees and taxes, the filing of responses to office actions issued by
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S. Copyright Office or other
governmental authorities, the filing of applications for renewal or extension,
the filing of affidavits under Sections 8  and 15 of the U.S. Trademark Act, the
filing of divisional, continuation, continuation-in-part, reissue and renewal
applications or extensions, the payment of maintenance fees and the
participation in interference, reexamination, opposition, cancellation,
infringement and misappropriation proceedings. No Grantor shall, without the
written consent of the Collateral Agent, discontinue use of or otherwise abandon
any Intellectual Property Collateral, or abandon any right to file an
application for patent, trademark, or copyright, unless such Grantor shall have
previously determined that such use or the pursuit or maintenance of such
Intellectual Property Collateral is no longer desirable in the conduct of such
Grantor's business and that the loss thereof would not be reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (b)  Each Grantor agrees promptly to notify the Collateral Agent if
such Grantor becomes aware (i) that any item of the Intellectual Property
Collateral may have become abandoned, placed in the public domain, invalid or
unenforceable, or of any adverse determination or development regarding such
Grantor's ownership of any of the Intellectual Property Collateral or its right
to register the same or to keep and maintain and enforce the same, or (ii) of
any adverse determination or the institution of any proceeding (including,
without limitation, the institution of any proceeding in the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office or any court) regarding any item of the Intellectual Property
Collateral.

          (c)  In the event that any Grantor becomes aware that any material
item of the Intellectual Property Collateral is being infringed or
misappropriated by a third party, such Grantor shall promptly notify the
Collateral Agent and shall take such actions, at its expense, as such Grantor or
the Collateral Agent deems reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances to
protect or enforce such Intellectual Property Collateral, including, without
limitation, suing for infringement or misappropriation and for an injunction
against such infringement or misappropriation.

          (d)  Each Grantor shall use proper statutory notice in connection with
its use of each material item of its Intellectual Property Collateral. No
Grantor shall do or permit any act or knowingly omit to do any act whereby any
of its material Intellectual Property Collateral may lapse or become invalid or
unenforceable or placed in the public domain.

          (e)  Each Grantor shall take all steps which it or the Collateral
Agent deems reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances to preserve and
protect each material item of its Intellectual Property Collateral, including,
without limitation, maintaining the quality of any and all products or services
used or provided in connection with any of the Trademarks,

                                       20

<PAGE>
consistent with the quality of the products and services as of the date hereof,
and taking all steps necessary to ensure that all licensed users of any of the
Trademarks use such consistent standards of quality.

          (f)  With respect to its registered Intellectual Property Collateral
and applications therefor, each Grantor agrees to execute or otherwise
authenticate an agreement, in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit E
hereto or otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Collateral Agent (an "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SECURITY AGREEMENT"), for recording
the security interest granted hereunder to the Collateral Agent in such
Intellectual Property Collateral with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the
U.S. Copyright Office and any other governmental authorities necessary to
perfect the security interest hereunder in such Intellectual Property
Collateral.

          (g)  Each Grantor agrees that should it obtain an ownership interest
in any item of the type set forth in Section 1(g) that is not on the date hereof
a part of the Intellectual Property Collateral ("AFTER-ACQUIRED INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY") (i) the provisions of this Agreement shall automatically apply
thereto, and (ii) any such After-Acquired Intellectual Property and, in the case
of trademarks, the goodwill symbolized thereby, shall automatically become part
of the Intellectual Property Collateral subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement with respect thereto. Within ten (10) days after the end of each
fiscal quarter, each Grantor shall give written notice to the Collateral Agent
identifying the After-Acquired Intellectual Property acquired since the delivery
of the last such report, and such Grantor shall contemporaneously therewith
execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent with such written notice, or
otherwise authenticate, an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit F
hereto or otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Collateral Agent (an "IP SECURITY AGREEMENT SUPPLEMENT") covering such
After-Acquired Intellectual Property which IP Security Agreement Supplement
shall be recorded with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S. Copyright
Office and any other governmental authorities necessary to perfect the security
interest hereunder in such After-Acquired Intellectual Property.

          Section 14.    Voting Rights; Dividends; Etc. (a) So long as no Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing:

          (i)  Each Grantor shall be entitled to exercise, in the use of its
reasonable business judgment, any and all voting and other consensual rights
pertaining to the Security Collateral of such Grantor or any part thereof for
any purpose.

          (ii) Each Grantor shall be entitled to receive and retain any and all
dividends, interest and other distributions paid in respect of the Security
Collateral of such Grantor if and to the extent that the payment thereof is not
otherwise prohibited by the terms of the Loan Documents; provided, however, that
any and all

               (A)  dividends, interest and other distributions paid or payable
other than in cash in respect of, and instruments and other property received,
receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of, or in exchange for, any
Security Collateral,

                                       21

<PAGE>
               (B)  dividends and other distributions paid or payable in cash in
          respect of any Security Collateral in connection with a partial or
          total liquidation or dissolution or in connection with a reduction of
          capital, capital surplus or paid-in-surplus, and

               (C)  cash paid, payable or otherwise distributed in respect of
          principal of, or in redemption of, or in exchange for, any Security
          Collateral

     shall be, and shall be forthwith delivered to the Collateral Agent to hold
     as, Security Collateral and shall, if received by such Grantor, be received
     in trust for the benefit XXXX Collateral Agent, be segregated from the
     other property or funds of such Grantor and forthwith delivered to the
     Collateral Agent as Security Collateral in the same form as received (with
     any necessary indorsement).

          (iii)  The Collateral Agent will execute and deliver (or cause to be
     executed and delivered) to each Grantor all such proxies and other
     instruments as such Grantor may reasonably request for the purpose of
     enabling such Grantor to exercise the voting and other rights that it is
     entitled to exercise pursuant to paragraph (i) above and to receive
     dividends or interest payments that it is authorized to receive and retain
     pursuant to paragraph (ii) above.

          (b)  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
     Default:

          (i)  All rights of each Grantor (x) to exercise or refrain from
     exercising theXXXX voting and other consensual rights that it would
     otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 14(a)(i) shall, upon
     written notice to such Grantor by the Collateral Agent, cease and (y) to
     receive the dividends, interest and other distributions that it would
     otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to Section 14(a)(ii)
     shall automatically cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become
     vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall thereupon have the sole right
     to exercise or refrain from exercising such voting and other consensual
     rights and to receive and hold as Security Collateral such dividends,
     interest and other distributions.

          (ii)  All dividends, interest and other distributions that are
     received by any Grantor contrary to the provisions of paragraph (i) of this
     Section 14(b) shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Collateral
     Agent, shall be segregated from other funds of such Grantor and shall be
     forthwith paid over to the Collateral Agent as Security Collateral in the
     same form as so received (with any necessary indorsement).

          (iii)  The Collateral Agent shall be authorized to send to each
     Securities Intermediary or Commodity Intermediary as defined in and under
     any Security Control Agreement a Notice of Exclusive Control as defined in
     and under such Security Control Agreement.

          Section 15.  As to the Assigned Agreements. (a) Except to the extent
that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, each Grantor will at its expense:


                                       22
<PAGE>
          (i) perform and observe all terms and provisions of the Assigned
     Agreements to be performed or observed by it, maintain the Assigned
     Agreements to which it is a party in full force and effect, enforce the
     Assigned Agreements to which it is a party in accordance with the terms
     thereof and take all such action to such end as may be reasonably requested
     from time to time by the Collateral Agent; and

          (ii) furnish to the Collateral Agent promptly upon receipt thereof
     copies of all material notices, requests and other documents received by
     such Grantor under or pursuant to the Assigned Agreements to which it is a
     party, and from time to time (A) furnish to the Collateral Agent such
     information and reports regarding the Assigned Agreements and such other
     Collateral of such Grantor as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request
     and (B) upon the reasonable request of the Collateral Agent make to each
     other party to any Assigned Agreement to which it is a party such demands
     and requests for information and reports or for action as such Grantor is
     entitled to make thereunder.


          (b) Except to the extent that failure to comply with the provisions of
this clause (b) could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, each Grantor agrees that it will not, except to the extent otherwise
permitted under the Credit Agreement:

          (i) cancel or terminate any Assigned Agreement to which it is a party
     or consent to or accept any cancellation or termination thereof;

          (ii) amend, amend and restate, supplement or otherwise modify any such
     Assigned Agreement or give any consent, waiver or approval thereunder;

          (iii) waive any default under or breach of any such Assigned
     Agreement; or

          (iv) take any other action in connection with any such Assigned
     Agreement that would impair the value of the interests or rights of such
     Grantor thereunder or that would impair the interests or rights of any
     Secured Party.

          (c) Each Grantor hereby consents on its behalf and on behalf of its
Subsidiaries to the assignment and pledge to the Collateral Agent for benefit of
the Secured Parties of each Assigned Agreement to which it is a party by any
other Grantor hereunder.

          Section 16. Payments Under the Assigned Agreements. (a) Each Grantor
agrees that, after the occurrence of any payment default or after the Lenders
have elected to exercise their remedies under Section 9.2 of the Credit
Agreement, all payments due or to become due under or in connection with such
Assigned Agreement will be made directly to the Cash Collateral Account.

          (b) All moneys received or collected pursuant to above shall be
applied as provided in Section 22(b).

          Section 17. As to Letter-of-Credit Rights. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor will, promptly upon
written request by the Collateral Agent, (i) notify (and such Grantor hereby
authorizes the Collateral Agent to notify)


                                       23
<PAGE>
the issuer and each nominated person with respect to each of the Related
Contracts consisting of letters of credit that the proceeds thereof have been
assigned to the Collateral Agent hereunder and any payments due or to become due
in respect thereof are to be made directly to the Collateral Agent or its
designee and (ii) arrange for the Collateral Agent to become the transferee
beneficiary of letter of credit.

          Section 18.    Transfers and Other Liens; Additional Shares. (a) Each
Grantor agrees that it will not (i) sell, assign or otherwise dispose of, or
grant any option with respect to, any of the Collateral, other than sales,
assignments and other dispositions of Collateral, and options relating to
Collateral, and options relating to Collateral, permitted under the terms of the
Credit Agreement, or (ii) create or suffer to exist any Lien upon or with
respect to any of the Collateral of such Grantor except for the pledge,
assignment and security interest created under this Agreement and as otherwise
permitted by the Credit Agreement.

          (b)  Each Grantor agrees that it will (i) cause each issuer of the
Initial Pledged Equity pledged by such Grantor not to issue any Equity Interests
or other securities in addition to or in substitution for the Initial Pledged
Equity issued by such issuer, except to such Grantor, and (ii) pledge hereunder,
immediately upon its acquisition (directly or indirectly) thereof, any and all
additional Equity Interests or other securities.

          Section 19. Collateral Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. Each Grantor
hereby irrevocably appoints the Collateral Agent such Grantor's
attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and
in the name of such Grantor or otherwise, from time to time in the Collateral
Agent's discretion, to take any action and to execute any instrument that the
Collateral Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of
this Agreement, including, without limitation:

          (a)  if such Grantor has failed to do so, to obtain and adjust
     insurance required to be paid to the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section
     11

          (b)  to ask for, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compromise,
     receive and give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become due
     under or in respect of any of the Collateral,

          (c)  to receive, indorse and collect any drafts or other instruments,
     documents and chattel paper, in connection with clause (a) or (b) above,
     and

          (d)  to file any claims or take any action or institute any
     proceedings that the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or desirable for
     the collection of any of the Collateral or otherwise to enforce compliance
     with the terms and conditions of any Assigned Agreement or the rights of
     the Collateral Agent with respect to any of the Collateral.

          Section 20. Collateral Agent May Perform. If any Grantor fails to
perform any agreement contained herein, the Collateral Agent may, but without
any obligation to do so and without notice, itself perform, or cause performance
of, such agreement, and the expenses of the Collateral Agent incurred in
connection therewith shall be payable by such Grantor under Section 23.


                                       24
<PAGE>
     Section 21.    THE COLLATERAL AGENT'S DUTIES. (a) The powers conferred on
the Collateral Agent hereunder are solely to protect the Secured Parties'
interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any
such powers. Except for the safe custody of any Collateral in its possession and
the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Collateral
Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral, as to ascertaining or taking
action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or
other matters relative to any Collateral, whether or not any Secured Party has
or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or as to the taking of any
necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties or any other rights
pertaining to any Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have
exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral in
its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to
that which it accords its own property.

     (b)  Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Collateral Agent may from time to time, when the Collateral Agent deems it to
be necessary, appoint one or more subagents (each a "SUBAGENT") for the
Collateral Agent hereunder with respect to all or any part of the Collateral.
In the event that the Collateral Agent so appoints any Subagent with respect to
any Collateral, (i) the assignment and pledge of such Collateral and the
security interest granted in such Collateral by each Grantor hereunder shall be
deemed for purposes of this Security Agreement to have been made to such
Subagent, in addition to the Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the
Secured Parties, as security for the Secured Obligations of such Grantor, (ii)
such Subagent shall automatically be vested, in addition to the Collateral
Agent, with all rights, powers, privileges, interests and remedies of the
Collateral Agent hereunder with respect to such Collateral, and (iii) the term
"Collateral Agent," when used herein in relation to any rights, powers,
privileges, interests and remedies of the Collateral Agent with respect to such
Collateral, shall include such Subagent; provided, however, that no such
Subagent shall be authorized to take any action with respect to any such
Collateral unless and except to the extent expressly authorized in writing by
the Collateral Agent.

     Section 22.    REMEDIES. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing:

     (a)  The Collateral Agent may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in
  addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise
  available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party upon default
  under the UCC (whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral) and
  also may: (i) require each Grantor to, and each Grantor hereby agrees that it
  will at its expense and upon request of the Collateral Agent forthwith,
  assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by the Collateral Agent and
  make it available to the Collateral Agent at a place and time to be designated
  by the Collateral Agent that is reasonably convenient to both parties; (ii)
  without notice except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part
  thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the
  Collateral Agent's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future
  delivery, and upon such other terms as the Collateral Agent may deem
  commercially reasonable; (iii) occupy any premises owned or leased by any of
  the Grantors where the Collateral or any part thereof is assembled or located
  for a reasonable period in order to effectuate its rights and remedies
  hereunder or under law, without obligation to such Grantor in respect of such
  occupation; and (iv) exercise any and all rights and remedies of any of the
  Grantors under or in connection with the Collateral, or



                                       25



<PAGE>
otherwise in respect of the Collateral, including, without limitation, (A) any
and all rights of such Grantor to demand or otherwise require payment of any
amount under, or performance of any provision of, the Assigned Agreements, the
Receivables, the Related Contracts and the other Collateral, (B) withdraw, or
cause or direct the withdrawal, of all funds with respect to the Account
Collateral and (C) exercise all other rights and remedies with respect to the
Assigned Agreements, the Receivables, the Related Contracts and the other
Collateral, including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 9-607 of
the UCC. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be
required by law, at least ten days' notice to such Grantor of the time and place
of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall
constitute reasonable notification. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated
to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given.
The Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by
announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without
further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.

     (b) Any cash held by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent and all cash
proceeds received by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent in respect of any sale
of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral
may, in the discretion of the Collateral Agent, be held by the Collateral Agent
as collateral for, and/or then or at any time thereafter applied (after payment
of any amounts payable to the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 23) by the
Collateral Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties against, all or
any part of the Secured Obligations, in the following manner:

          (i) first, paid to the Agents for any amounts then owing to the Agents
     pursuant to Section 11.04 of the Credit Agreement or otherwise under the
     Loan Documents, ratably in accordance with such respective amounts then
     owing to the Agents; and

     over to the Collateral Agent in the same form as so received (with any
     necessary indorsement).

          (d)  The Collateral Agent may, without notice to any Grantor except as
     required by law and at any time or from time to time, charge, set-off and

     therein, and such Grantor shall supply to the Collateral Agent or its
     designee such Grantor's know-how and expertise, and documents and things
     relating to any Intellectual Property Collateral subject to such sale or
     other disposition, and such Grantor's customer lists and other records and
     documents relating to such Intellectual Property Collateral and to the
     manufacture, distribution, advertising and sale of products and services of
     such Grantor.

          (f)  The Collateral Agent is authorized, in connection with any sale
     of the Security Collateral pursuant to this Section 22, to deliver or
     otherwise disclose to any prospective purchaser of the Security Collateral
     any information in its possession relating to such Security Collateral.

          Section 23.  Indemnity and Expenses.  (a) Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each Grantor shall indemnify
and hold the Indemnified Persons harmless from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, charges, expenses and disbursements (including Attorney
Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever (excluding costs and expenses
specifically referred to in Section 12.4) of the Credit Agreement which may at
any time (including at any time following repayment of the Loans, the
termination of the Letters of Credit and the termination, resignation or
replacement of any Agent or replacement of any Lender) be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against any such Indemnified Person in any way relating to or
arising out of or in connection with the execution, delivery, enforcement,
performance or administration of this Agreement or any other agreement, letter
or instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory (including


                                       27
<PAGE>
any investigation of, preparation for, or defense of any pending or threatened
claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding) and regardless of whether any
Indemnified Person is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"), in all cases, whether or not caused by or arising,
in whole or in part, out of the negligence of any Indemnified Person; provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnified Person, be available to the
extent that such Indemnified Liabilities are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted directly and
primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified
Person. No Indemnified Person shall be liable for any damages arising from the
use by others of any information or other materials obtained through IntraLinks
or other similar information transmission systems in connection with this
Agreement, nor shall any Indemnified Person have any liability for any indirect
or consequential damages relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
or arising out of its activities in connection herewith or therewith (whether
before or after the date hereof). In the case of an investigation, litigation or
other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 23 applies, such
indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by any Loan Party, its directors, shareholders or
creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other Person, whether or not an
Indemnified Person is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not any of the
transactions contemplated hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents are
consummated. All amounts due under this Section 23 shall be payable within five
Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements in this Section shall
survive the resignation of any Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the
termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of
all the other Obligations. Each Agent-Related Person and each lender agrees that
in the event that any investigation, litigation or proceeding is asserted or
threatened in writing or instituted against it or any other Indemnified Person,
or any remedial, removal or response action which is requested of it or any
other Indemnified Person, for which any Agent-Related Person or Lender may
desire indemnity or defense hereunder, such Agent-Related Person or such Lender
shall notify the Company in writing of such event; provided that failure to so
notify the Company shall not affect the right of any Agent-Related Person or
Lender to seek indemnification under this Section.

          (b)  Each Grantor will upon demand pay to the Collateral Agent the
amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel and of any experts and agents, that
the Collateral Agent may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this
Agreement, (ii) the custody, preservation, use or operation of, or the sale of,
collection from or other realization upon, any of the Collateral of such
Grantor, (iii) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the
Collateral Agent or the other Secured parties hereunder or (iv) the failure by
such Grantor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof.

          Section 24.    Amendments; Waivers; Additional Grantors; Etc. (a) No
failure on the part of any Secured Party to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive
of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.
