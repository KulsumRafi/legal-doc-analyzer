     subject to satisfaction of all applicable terms and conditions of this
     Agreement, to make a Loan to the Borrower to fund up to ninety percent
     (90%) of the Total Cost of the Asset Pool, as set forth in such Accepted
     Borrowing Request; provided, however, that the Lender's commitment to make
     a Loan to the Borrower to finance the purchase of an Asset Pool shall not
     constitute a revolving commitment and the Borrower shall have no right to
     reborrow any amounts repaid to the Lender pursuant to an Accepted Borrowing
     Request. An Accepted Borrowing Request shall expire and shall have no
     further force or effect if (i) the Borrower is not the successful bidder
     for the specified Asset Pool at a purchase price which is not in excess of
     the anticipated purchase price described in such Borrowing Request, (ii)
     the Borrower does not consummate its purchase of such Asset Pool pursuant
     to the terms and conditions of the related Purchase Agreement and as
     contemplated in the related Accepted Borrowing Request within thirty (30)
     calendar days following issuance of the Accepted Borrowing Request by the
     Lender (unless (A) such period of time is extended in writing by the Lender
     or (B) the Asset Pool Seller has unilaterally extended the closing date for
     purchase of an Asset Pool and the Borrower is unable to contest any such
     extension) or (iii) a Default or Event of Default shall occur and shall be
     continuing under this Agreement.

         (c) Additional Provisions Relating to Accounts and other Assets
     Purchased under Forward Flow Purchase Agreements. The Borrower and the
     Lender contemplate that certain of the Purchase Agreements will provide for
     the purchase by the Borrower from an Asset Pool Seller of Accounts and
     other Assets on a periodic basis for a specified period of time (for
     example, the monthly purchase of Accounts and other Assets during a
     specified period of time) (each such Purchase Agreement is herein called a
     "Forward Flow Purchase Agreement"). All Accounts and other Assets purchased
     by the Borrower during a period of twelve (12) months (or such shorter
     period as the Lender shall agree to in writing) under a Forward Flow
     Purchase Agreement shall constitute a single Asset Pool for all purposes of
     this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Loan made by the Lender
     with respect to an Asset Pool purchased by the Borrower under a Forward
     Flow Purchase Agreement shall be made in multiple advances, with each such
     advance of the Loan occurring on the date that the Borrower makes one of
     the periodic purchases of the Accounts and other Assets under such Forward
     Flow Purchase Agreement; provided, that, advances shall be made no more



                                      -11-

     often than once per month for any Asset Pool. In addition to the items
     required by Section 2.1(a), a Borrowing Request related to a Forward Flow
     Purchase Agreement shall contain the Borrower's good faith estimate of the
     total amount of all Accounts and other Assets to be purchased under the
     Forward Flow Purchase Agreement for a period not to exceed twelve (12)
     months (or such shorter period as the Lender shall agree to in writing)
     (regardless of the duration of the purchasing period under the Forward Flow
     Purchase Agreement) and the Borrower's good faith estimate of the Total
     Cost of all Accounts and other Assets to be purchased under the Forward
     Flow Purchase Agreement for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months (or
     such shorter period as the Lender shall agree to in writing) (regardless of
     the duration of the purchasing period under the Forward Flow Purchase
     Agreement). The Lender shall accept or reject a Borrowing Request related
     to a period of twelve (12) months (or such shorter period as the Lender
     shall agree to in writing) under a Forward Flow Purchase Agreement in
     accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.1(a) and (b); provided,
     however, an Accepted Borrowing Request related to a Forward Flow Purchase
     Agreement shall only constitute the Lender's commitment to make a Loan to
     fund ninety percent (90%) of the Total Cost of the Asset Pool being
     purchased under such Forward Flow Purchase Agreement for such period of
     twelve (12) months (or such shorter period as the Lender shall agree to in
     writing) as estimated by the Borrower in the Accepted Borrowing Request
     related to such Forward Flow Purchase Agreement. In the event that the
     Borrower determines that the actual Total Cost of the Asset Pool being
     purchased under a Forward Flow Purchase Agreement during such period of
     twelve (12) months (or such shorter period as the Lender shall agree to in
     writing) will exceed the estimated Total Cost of the Asset Pool as
     specified in the Accepted Borrowing Request or if the Borrower wishes the
     Lender to continue financing its purchase of Accounts and other Assets
     after the expiration of the currently approved period of twelve (12) months
     (or such shorter period as the Lender shall agree to in writing), the
     Borrower shall submit to the Lender a supplemental Borrowing Request, and
     the Lender may accept or reject such supplemental Borrowing Request in
     accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.1(a) and (b). Upon the
     Lender's rejection of such supplemental Borrowing Request, the Lender shall
     have no obligation to provide any funding to the Borrower in excess of that
     agreed to in any Accepted Borrowing Request in connection with the
     applicable Forward Flow Purchase Agreement and the Borrower shall be
     permitted to seek financing from a third party in connection with the
     amount of accounts and assets to be purchased under such Forward Flow
     Purchase Agreement which exceed that set forth in any Accepted Borrowing
     Request in connection therewith and such excess shall not be considered an
     Asset or Asset Pool subject to this Agreement.

         (d) General Funding Procedures. The Borrower shall provide the Lender
     with not less than three (3) Business Days prior written notice of the
     scheduled closing date for purchase of an Asset Pool described in an
     Accepted Borrowing Request and shall request funding of the related Loan on
     such date (each a "Borrowing Date"). On the Business Day immediately


                                      -12-
<PAGE>


     preceding a Borrowing Date, the Borrower shall transfer to the Lender the
     Borrower's Asset Pool Equity Contribution for the related Asset Pool, net
     of all Purchase Expenses paid or incurred by the Borrower. Upon receipt by
     the Lender of such funds from the Borrower and upon satisfaction of all
     applicable conditions set forth in Article IV and elsewhere in this
     Agreement, the Lender shall make the Loan to the Borrower as specified in
     the related Accepted Borrowing Request by transferring the amount of the
     Loan, together with that portion of the Borrower's Asset Pool Equity
     Contribution received by the Lender, to the Asset Pool Seller (or in whole
     or in part to the Parent or a Purchase Affiliate, as applicable, in
     connection with an assignment under Section 2.1(g), but only as specified
     in an Accepted Borrowing Request) in purchase of the related Asset Pool on
     (or immediately prior to) the closing date for purchase of such Asset Pool.

         (e) Special Funding Procedures in connection with Forward Flow Purchase
     Agreements. In connection with a periodic purchase of a portion of an Asset
     Pool under a Forward Flow Purchase Agreement, the Borrower shall provide
     the Lender with not less than three (3) Business Days prior written notice
     of the Borrowing Date for the purchase of such portion of an Asset Pool
     under such Forward Flow Purchase Agreement, the Total Cost of such portion
     of the Asset Pool to be purchased on the Borrowing Date and the amount of
     the advance of the Loan which the Borrower requests the Lender to fund on
     the Borrowing Date in connection with such portion of the Asset Pool to be
     purchased on the Borrowing Date. On the Business Day immediately preceding
     a Borrowing Date for the purchase of a portion of an Asset Pool under a
     Forward Flow Purchase Agreement, the Borrower shall transfer to the Lender
     the Borrower's Asset Pool Equity Contribution for such portion of the Asset
     Pool to be purchased on such Borrowing Date net of all Purchase Expenses
     paid or incurred by the Borrower with respect to such portion of the Asset
     Pool to be purchased on such Borrowing Date. Upon receipt by the Lender of
     such funds from the Borrower and upon satisfaction of all applicable
     conditions set forth in Article IV and elsewhere in this Agreement, the
     Lender shall make the applicable advance of the Loan to the Borrower by
     transferring the amount of such advance of the Loan, together with that
     portion of the Borrower's Asset Pool Equity contribution received by the
     Lender, to the Asset Pool Seller (or in whole or in part to the Parent or a
     Purchase Affiliate, as applicable, in connection with an assignment under
     Section 2.1(g), but only as specified in an Accepted Borrowing Request) in
     purchase of that portion of the related Asset Pool on (or immediately prior
     to) the closing date for the purchase of such portion of such Asset Pool.

         (f) Combination of Asset Pools upon Mutual Written Consent of Borrower
     and Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
     Agreement, upon the mutual written consent of the Borrower and the Lender,
     two (2) or more Asset Pools may be combined into a single Asset Pool
     subject to such terms and conditions as the Borrower and the Lender shall
     specify in writing.

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

         (g) Asset Pools Purchased by Borrower From Parent or Purchase
     Affiliate. The Borrower may from time to time purchase an Asset Pool from
     the Parent or a Purchase Affiliate if: (i) the Parent or Purchase
     Affiliate, as applicable, has complied with the applicable provisions
     therefor contained in the Exclusivity Agreement, (ii) the Borrower has
     submitted a Borrowing Request to the Lender in connection therewith in
     accordance with this Section 2.1, which Borrowing Request shall detail the
     assignment of a Purchase Agreement and/or other security documents to the
     Borrower in connection with the Parent's or Purchase Affiliate's, as
     applicable, purchase of the accounts or other assets constituting such
     Asset Pool from another Person (who shall not be an Affiliated Party) and
     such other information as the Lender shall require, and (iii) such
     Borrowing Request has been accepted by the Lender in accordance with this
     Section 2.1.

         Section 2.2 Obligation to Repay Loans; Issuance of Notes. Each Loan
made by the Lender with respect to an Asset Pool under Section 2.1 shall be
evidenced by a separate promissory note of the Borrower payable to the order of
the Lender in the amount determined in accordance with the related Accepted
Borrowing Request, dated as of the Borrowing Date and otherwise in substantially
the form of Exhibit B-1 (each a "Note"). With respect to a Loan made by the
Lender to the Borrower in connection with an Asset Pool purchased under a
Forward Flow Purchase Agreement, the initial advance of such Loan shall be
evidenced by a Note, dated as of the Borrowing Date for such initial advance, in
the amount of such initial advance and otherwise in substantially the form of
Exhibit B-1. The second and each subsequent advance of a Loan made in connection
with an Asset Pool purchased under a Forward Flow Purchase Agreement shall be
evidenced by a replacement Note, dated as of the Borrowing Date for such second
or subsequent advance, as applicable, in the aggregate amount of all advances
made of the Loan (without reflecting any repayments of such Loan) and otherwise
in substantially the form of Exhibit B-2. Each such replacement Note issued in
connection with a Loan made in connection with an Asset Pool purchased under a
Forward Flow Purchase Agreement shall be issued in replacement of and
substitution for, but not in payment of, the previous Note related to such Loan.
Upon the Lender's receipt of a written request to return to the Borrower a
replaced note following the Borrower's execution and delivery to the Lender of a
replacement Note acceptable to the Lender, the Lender shall return the replaced
Note to the Borrower marked "Replaced by Substitution Note". The aggregate
unpaid principal amount of each Note shall bear interest, be payable and be
secured as provided therein and herein.

         Section 2.3 Interest on Loans. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay
interest on the unpaid principal balance of each Loan with respect to an Asset
Pool for the period commencing on the Borrowing Date for such Loan and
continuing thereafter until the Loan is paid in full, in accordance with the
following:

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

         (a) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the outstanding
     principal balance of each Loan shall bear interest at an annual rate at all
     times equal to the Floating Rate applicable to such Loan

         (b) From and after the occurrence of an Event of Default and continuing
     thereafter until such Event of Default shall be remedied to the written
     satisfaction of the Lender, the outstanding principal balance of each Loan
     shall bear interest at an annual rate at all times equal to the sum of (i)
     the Floating Rate applicable to such Loan and (ii) two percent (2%) (the
     "Default Rate").

         (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
     Agreement or any other Loan Document, all agreements with respect to
     interest in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents between the
     Borrower and the Lender are hereby limited so that in no contingency or
     event whatsoever shall the total liability for payments in the nature of
     interest exceed the applicable limits imposed by any applicable usury laws.
     If any payments in the nature of interest made under this Agreement or any
     other Loan Document are held to be in excess of the limits imposed by any
     applicable usury laws, it is agreed that any such amount held to be in
     excess shall be considered payment of principal in respect of the
     applicable Loan, and the aggregate indebtedness under this Agreement and
     the other Loan Documents shall be reduced by such amount so that the total
     liability for payments in the nature of interest shall not exceed the
     applicable limits imposed by any applicable usury laws, in compliance with
     the desires of the Borrower and the Lender.

         Section 2.4 Computation of Interest. Interest accruing on each Loan, on
each Asset Pool Equity Contribution and on each Affiliate Subordinated Loan, as
applicable, shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
in a year of three hundred and sixty (360) days and shall accrue on the
outstanding principal balance of each Loan, on each Asset Pool Equity
Contribution and on each Affiliate Subordinated Loan, as applicable, on a daily
basis. Interest accrued on each Loan, on each Asset Pool Equity Contribution and
on each Affiliate Subordinated Loan shall be capitalized on each Distribution
Date if funds are not available for payment thereof on such Distribution Date.

         Section 2.5 Payment of Principal and Interest on Loans. All interest on
a Loan which has accrued, but is unpaid as of the day preceding a Distribution
Date for a related Asset Pool, shall be due and payable on such Distribution
Date, but only to the extent available in accordance with Section 2.8. If not
paid in full on a Distribution Date, all accrued and unpaid interest shall be
capitalized as of such date in accordance with Section 2.4. Principal of each
Loan shall be finally due and payable on the Loan Maturity Date for such Loan,
as specified in the Note evidencing payment of such Loan. In addition, each Loan
shall be subject to mandatory prepayment on each Distribution Date for the
related Asset Pool in an amount equal to the Asset Pool Proceeds available for
such prepayment on such date, as provided in Section 2.8. The Borrower may
prepay any Loan, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, without
premium or penalty; provided, however, that (i) no such prepayment shall


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

terminate or satisfy the Borrower's obligation to pay Contingent Payments with
respect to the related Asset Pool for any such Loan, and (ii) any such
prepayment can only be made from Asset Pool Proceeds received with respect to
the Asset Pool for such Loan and not with any other proceeds or funds from any
other source, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Lender.

         Section 2.6 Contingent Payments. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Lender a Contingent Payment with respect to each Asset Pool, payable on each
Distribution Date for such Asset Pool in an amount equal to that portion of the
Asset Pool Proceeds available for payment thereof as provided in Section 2.8(j).
Payment in full of any Loan made in respect of an Asset Pool shall in no way
affect the obligation of the Borrower to pay to the Lender the Contingent
Payments with respect to such Asset Pool as provided herein. The Borrower and
the Lender agree that all Contingent Payments with respect to an Asset Pool will
be treated as interest for United States federal income tax purposes and that
the Borrower's interest deductions and the Lender's interest income with respect
thereto shall accrue in accordance with the Projected Accrual Schedule for such
Asset Pool delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and accepted by
the Lender pursuant to Section 2.1, as required and determined in accordance
with the non-contingent bond method described in Treasury Regulation
1.1275-4(b).

         Section 2.7 Collection and Deposit of Asset Pool Proceeds. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 2.9, each Loan shall be paid out of Asset Pool
Proceeds collected with respect to the related Asset Pool. All Asset Pool
Proceeds received by the Servicer or the Borrower will be deposited not later
than the next Business Day following receipt thereof, to a collection account
maintained by the Servicer, and not later than two (2) Business Days thereafter
(or earlier if checks in such collection account clear earlier), shall be
transferred to a separate Collateral Account for the Asset Pools opened and
maintained by the Collateral Agent, in the name of the Lender, pursuant to the
Collateral Account Agreement (the "Collateral Account"). Except for the days on
which Asset Pool Proceeds are on deposit in the Servicer's collection account,
neither the Servicer nor the Borrower shall commingle any Asset Pool Proceeds
collected with respect to the Asset Pools with any moneys or other funds which
are not Asset Pool Proceeds. The Collateral Account shall be an interest bearing
account and all interest earned on amounts on deposit therein shall constitute,
and be treated as, Asset Pool Proceeds collected with respect to the Asset
Pools. All Asset Pool Proceeds shall be held in the Collateral Account until the
next occurring Distribution Date. Not later than 3:00 p.m., Minneapolis,
Minnesota time, on the Business Day preceding each Distribution Date, the
Servicer shall deliver to the Lender a report for the preceding Collection
Period setting forth, by Asset Pool, the Asset Pool Proceeds, Servicing Fees,
outstanding balances of Loans and other relevant information to determine the
use and application of the Asset Pool Proceeds deposited to the Collateral
Account during the Collection Period ending on the Sunday immediately preceding
such Distribution Date (each, a "Distribution Report") and the Lender will make
distributions in accordance with Section 2.8 on each Distribution Date. In no
event shall any Asset Pool Proceeds be withdrawn from the Collateral Account
without the prior written consent of the Lender as to each such withdrawal or
transfer.

         Section 2.8 Distribution of Asset Pool Proceeds. Upon delivery to the
Collateral Agent of the Lender's written authorization for distributions to be
made from the Collateral Account as contemplated in Section 2.7, Asset Pool
Proceeds on deposit in the Collateral Account with respect to an Asset Pool
shall be distributed on the next succeeding Distribution Date for such Asset
Pool, in accordance with the following:

         (a) first, in connection with all Asset Pool acquisitions, to the
     Lender or the Borrower, an amount equal to all unpaid Loan Costs and
     Purchase Expenses paid or incurred by the Lender or the Borrower with
     respect to the making or collection of a Loan secured by such Asset Pool,
     except for the expenses of the Borrower in connection with the preparation,
     execution and delivery of the Loan Documents;

         (b) second, to the Collateral Agent, an amount equal to all fees and
     expenses due and owing to the Collateral Agent with respect to such Asset
     Pool;

         (c) third, to the Servicer, an amount equal to the Servicing Fee, if
     any, payable to the Servicer with respect to such Asset Pool Proceeds;

         (d) fourth, to the Lender, an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid
     interest on the related Loan for such Asset Pool;

         (e) fifth, to the Servicer, an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid
     Deferred Servicing Fees, as defined in the Servicing Agreement, but only to
     the extent no Asset Pool Shortfall then exists with respect to such Asset
     Pool;

         (f) sixth, to the Lender, an amount equal to the outstanding principal
     of the related Loan for such Asset Pool, until such Loan shall have been
     paid in full;

         (g) seventh, to the Lender, an amount equal to any Asset Pool Shortfall
     Amount then outstanding, for application to payment of such Asset Pool
     Shortfall Amount;

         (h) eighth, to the Borrower, an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid
     interest on (i) the Borrower's Asset Pool Equity Contribution with respect
     to such Asset Pool and (ii) any Affiliate Subordinated Loan, which interest
     shall be at the Floating Rate and shall be calculated in accordance with
     Section 2.4 hereof;

         (i) ninth, to the Borrower, an amount equal to (i) the Asset Pool
     Equity Contribution made by the Borrower with respect to such Asset Pool
     and (ii) the principal amount of any Affiliate Subordinated Loan, until
     such Asset Pool Equity Contribution and all such Affiliate Subordinated
     Loans shall have been repaid in full;

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

         (j) tenth, to the Lender, its Contingent Payment for such Asset Pool;
     and

         (k) eleventh, to the Borrower, the remainder of the Asset Pool Proceeds
     for such Asset Pool.

         Section 2.9 Asset Pool Shortfalls. If, (a)(i) as of any date on or
after six months following the Borrowing Date with respect to an Asset Pool, the
Asset Pool Proceeds received through such date with respect to an Asset Pool are
less than eighty percent (80%) of the projected Asset Pool Proceeds to be
received through such date (as set forth in the bid package submitted by the
Borrower as a part of the Borrowing Request for such Asset Pool), and the Lender
determines that, in its reasonable judgment, the remaining Asset Pool Proceeds
projected to be received and applied to the related Loan will be insufficient to
repay the related Loan and all accrued interest thereon on the applicable Loan
Maturity Date or (ii) as of any date, an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, or (b) in connection with the NCOP Lakes Credit Agreement (i) as of
any date on or after six months following the Borrowing Date under the NCOP
Lakes Credit Agreement with respect to an asset pool financed under the NCOP
Lakes Credit Agreement, the Asset Pool Proceeds (as defined in the NCOP Lakes
Credit Agreement) received through such date with respect to an asset pool
financed under the NCOP Lakes Credit Agreement are less than eighty percent
(80%) of the projected Asset Pool Proceeds (as defined in the NCOP Lakes Credit
Agreement) to be received through such date (as set forth in the bid package
submitted by NCOP Lakes as a part of the Borrowing Request under the NCOP Lakes
Credit Agreement) for such asset pool), and the Lender determines that, in its
reasonable judgment, the remaining Asset Pool Proceeds (as defined in the NCOP
Lakes Credit Agreement) projected to be received and applied to the related Loan
issued with respect thereto under the NCOP Lakes Credit Agreement will be
insufficient to repay the related Loan issued with respect thereto under the
NCOP Lakes Credit Agreement and all accrued interest thereon on the applicable
Loan Maturity Date (as defined in the NCOP Lakes Credit Agreement) or (ii) as of
any date, an Event of Default under the NCOP Lakes Credit Agreement has occurred
and is continuing, then the amount of such estimated deficiency (herein, the
"Asset Pool Shortfall Amount") shall be paid from:

         (a) Asset Pool Proceeds collected with respect to (i) other Asset Pools
as provided in Section 2.8(g) of this Agreement and (ii) other Asset Pools under
the NCOP Lakes Credit Agreement as provided in Section 2.8(g) of the NCOP Lakes
Credit Agreement, which amounts so paid shall constitute a subordinated loan
from NCOP Lakes to the Borrower and shall bear interest and be repaid only as
provided in Section 2.8(k) and (l) hereof (each, an "Affiliate Subordinated
Loan"); and

         (b) the Borrower's own funds (and not from borrowed money) and any
amount so paid shall be treated hereunder as an Asset Pool Equity Contribution
on behalf of the Borrower for the Asset Pool for which such payment was made
(with interest accruing in accordance with Section 2.4 only from the date of
such payment).

                              COLLATERAL FOR LOANS;
                       CUSTODY, SERVICING AND COLLECTIONS

         Section 3.1 Pledge of Asset Pool Collateral. To secure the due and
prompt payment of each Loan, together with all interest thereon and Contingent
Payments payable in connection therewith, and all other Obligations hereunder,
the Borrower shall grant to the Lender a first and prior security interest in,
lien on and pledge of all assets of the Borrower (subject only to Permitted
Liens), including all right, title, claim and interest of the Borrower in and to
all Assets of or related to each and every Asset Pool, of any kind, nature or
description, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, wherever located,
howsoever arising or created and whether now existing or hereafter arising,
including without limitation each and every Account and any and all liens,
claims and property securing payment of the indebtedness evidenced by such
Account (if any), and all property realized, collected or obtained in connection
with or as a result of collections made on account of any Account, and any and
all Asset Pool Proceeds paid or received with respect to any Asset Pool, whether
deposited to or held in the Collateral Account or otherwise, and all rights of
the Borrower under each and every Purchase Agreement (or Forward Flow Purchase
Agreement) related to an Asset Pool, together with such additional property of
the Borrower as is set forth and described in the Security Agreement, as the
same may be amended and supplemented from time to time by the Borrower as
additional Asset Pools are purchased by the Borrower (herein the "Loan
Collateral").

         Section 3.2 Perfection of Security Interests in Personal Property
Collateral. The Borrower agrees to deliver to the Lender (or its designated
custodial agent), at any time upon the Lender's request, each original Account
file of or relating to any Account and each promissory note, chattel paper,
installment sales agreement or other instrument with respect to which perfection
may be obtained by possession, and shall authorize or execute such financing
statements, together with any and all other instruments, assignments or
documents and take such other actions as may be required, to perfect and to
continue the perfection of the Lender's security interest in all Loan
Collateral.

         Section 3.3 Servicing of Asset Pools. The Borrower, the Servicer and
the Lender shall enter into a Servicing Agreement, in form and content
acceptable to the Lender, to provide for the servicing and collection of all
Assets (the "Servicing Agreement"). Immediately upon the occurrence of a
Servicer Default as defined in the Servicing Agreement, the Lender may terminate
the Servicer then acting in such capacity under the Servicing Agreement and may
appoint a replacement servicer, and enter into a replacement servicing
agreement, reasonably acceptable to the Borrower and the Lender.

         Section 3.4 Authority to Settle or Sell Loan Collateral. The Borrower
shall be authorized to finally compromise, settle, sell, liquidate, collect or
write-down the balance of, any Asset in its discretion; provided, however, that
in no event will any such compromise, settlement, sale, liquidation, collection
or write-down reduce the remaining unpaid principal balance thereof, together


                                      -19-
<PAGE>


with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to an aggregate amount less than three
hundred percent (300%) of the allocated purchase price paid by the Borrower to
acquire such Asset, without first obtaining the prior consent of the Lender. The
Borrower shall not, without first obtaining the Lender's prior written consent,
agree to any sale, assignment or other bulk transfer of Accounts (whether in one
or more Asset Pools). In the event the Lender consents to a bulk transfer of
Accounts, the Servicer will be paid a sales fee not to exceed the lesser of (a)
the actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Servicer (and approved by the
Lender) in connection with such bulk sale and (b) five percent (5%) of the net

         Section 8.2 Rights and Remedies Upon the Occurrence of an Event of
Default. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or at any time thereafter

the Lender, the Lender may exercise any or all of the following rights and
remedies with respect to outstanding Loans:

         (a) by notice to the Borrower, (i) declare that the Lender will no
     longer consider Borrowing Requests and (ii) declare the entire unpaid
     principal amount of all Notes, or any of them, all interest accrued and
     unpaid thereon, and all other Obligations under this Agreement to be
     forthwith due and payable whereupon such Note or Notes, as the case may be,
     all such accrued interest, all such Obligations (including, but not limited
     to and all Contingent Payments to the extent funds are available therefor
     in accordance with Section 2.6) shall become and be forthwith due and

         (c) direct the Servicer then in place to take all steps necessary to
     collect or otherwise liquidate the Loan Collateral in accordance with such
     procedures and for such sale prices as the Lender shall specify and apply

     provided that each Asset Pool shall be deemed to have an Asset Pool
     Shortfall Amount in an amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of, and
     all accrued interest on, the related Loan therefor; and

         (d) exercise and enforce any and all rights and remedies available to
     the Lender under any Loan Document (or otherwise by law or agreement),

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         Section 9.1 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure or delay on the
part of the Lender in exercising any right, power or remedy under the Loan
Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy under the
Loan Documents. The remedies provided in the Loan Documents are cumulative and
not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

         Section 9.2 Amendments, Requested Waivers, Etc. No amendment,
modification, termination or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or
consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall be effective unless the
same shall be in writing and signed by the Lender. Any waiver or consent given
hereunder shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case
shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar
or other circumstances.

         Section 9.3 Severability Clause. Any part, provision representation or
warranty of this Agreement which is prohibited or which is held to be void or
unenforceable shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof. Any part,
provision, representation or warranty of this Agreement which is prohibited or
unenforceable or is held to be void or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall,
as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, the parties hereto waive any provision of law which
prohibits or renders void or unenforceable any provision hereof. If the
invalidity of any part, provision, representation or warranty of this Agreement
shall deprive any party of the economic benefit intended to be conferred by this
Agreement, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to develop a structure the
economic effect of which is as nearly as possible the same as the economic
effect of this Agreement without regard to such invalidity.

         Section 9.4 Notices. Any notices, consents, directions, demands or
other communications given under this Agreement (unless otherwise specified
herein) shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when
delivered in person or by overnight delivery at, or telecopied to the respective

other address or telecopy numbers as either party shall give notice to the other

         Section 9.5 Reimbursement of the Lender's Costs and Expenses. The
Borrower and the Lender agree that (a) all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by the Lender in connection with the preparation, execution and
delivery of the Loan Documents (including without limitation reasonable legal
fees and expenses of counsel), UCC searches, recording fees, and other similar
expenses paid or incurred by the Lender in connection with obtaining, perfecting
or maintaining its security interest or lien on or priority in any Loan
Collateral shall constitute Purchase Expenses with respect to an Asset Pool and
the Lender and the Borrower shall be payable as such from Asset Pool Proceeds in
accordance with Section 2.8, provided, however, that in the event (i) any such
costs and expenses are incurred by the Lender with respect to an Asset Pool that
the Lender has committed to finance pursuant to an Accepted Borrowing Request,
but which is not financed with proceeds of a Loan, or which is not purchased by
the Borrower, the Borrower will reimburse the Lender for all such costs and
expenses, and (ii) the Borrower does not submit any Borrowing Requests to the
Lender during the first six (6) months following the execution of this Agreement
or all of the Borrowing Requests submitted by the Borrower during the first six
(6) months following the execution of this Agreement are rejected by the Lender,
then the Lender and the Borrower will reimburse each other for fifty percent
(50%) of such other party's legal fees incurred in the preparation, execution
and delivery of this Agreement; (b) all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by the Lender in connection with the administration, amendment,
documentation, recording, filing, insuring, or enforcing any Loan Document or
any Loan Collateral, or perfecting or maintaining the priority of any lien on or
security interest in any Loan Collateral, incurred after funding of the related
Loan shall constitute Loan Costs with respect to the related Asset Pool for
which they were incurred (or pro rata among all Asset Pools if not attributable
to one such Asset Pool) and shall be payable as such as Asset Pool Proceeds in


                                      -35-
<PAGE>

accordance with Section 2.8; and (c) the Borrower shall reimburse the Lender,
from Asset Pool Proceeds for any and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the Lender in connection with the enforcement by the Lender
of any of the rights or remedies available to the Lender hereunder or under any
of the Loan Documents or under applicable law, whether or not suit is filed with
respect thereto.

         Section 9.6 Indemnity. In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant
to Section 9.5, the Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Lender and each of its respective participants, parent corporations, subsidiary
corporations, affiliated corporations, successor corporations, and all present
and future officers, directors, employees and agents (the "Indemnitees"), from
and against (a) any and all transfer taxes, documentary taxes, assessments or
charges made by any governmental authority by reason of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or the making of any
Loans (except for income or franchise taxes based on the Lender's income) and
(b) any and all liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, judgments, suits,
claims, costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without
limitations, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) in connection
with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceedings, whether or not
such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto, which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against such Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or
arising out of or in connection with, the making of any Loans or entering into
this Agreement or any other Loan Documents or the use or intended use of the
proceeds of the Loans or the collection of Assets, excepting, however, from the
foregoing any such liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, judgments, suits,
claims, costs and expenses resulting from collection actions undertaken by the
Lender, or by a replacement servicer appointed by the Lender, or the unlawful
conduct, willful misconduct or gross negligence of an Indemnitee. If any
investigative, judicial or administrative proceeding arising from any of the
foregoing is brought against any Indemnitee, upon request of such Indemnitee,
the Borrower, or counsel designated by the Borrower and satisfactory to the
Indemnitee, will resist and defend such action, suit or proceeding to the extent
and in the manner directed by the Indemnitee, at the Borrower's sole cost and
expense. Each Indemnitee will use its best efforts to cooperate in the defense
of any such action, suit or proceeding. If the foregoing undertaking to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless may be held to be unenforceable because it
violates any law or public policy, the Borrower shall nevertheless make the
maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the indemnified
liabilities contemplated hereby which is permissible under applicable law. The
obligations of the Borrower under this Section 9.6 shall survive termination of
this Agreement.

         Section 9.7 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement and other Loan
Documents may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
counterparts, taken together, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

         Section 9.8 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

         (a) Governing Law. Except as otherwise provided in the Security
     Agreement, the Loan Documents shall be governed by, and construed in
     accordance with, the laws of the State of Minnesota.

         (b) Jurisdiction. The Borrower hereby irrevocably submits to the
     non-exclusive jurisdiction of any federal court sitting in Minneapolis or
     St. Paul, Minnesota, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
     to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the Borrower
     hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or
     proceeding may be heard and determined in such federal court. The Borrower
     hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so,
     the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
     proceeding. The Borrower irrevocably consents to the service of copies of
     the summons and complaint and any other process which may be served in any
     such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies of such process, by
     certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Borrower at its addresses
     specified in Section 9.4 above. The Borrower agrees that a final judgment
     in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
     other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
     by law. Nothing in this Section 9.8(b) shall affect the right of either
     party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect
     the right of either party to bring any action or proceeding against the
     other party or its property in the courts of other jurisdictions.

         (c) WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER AND THE LENDER HEREBY
     IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
     COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR ANY
     INSTRUMENT OR DOCUMENT DELIVERED THEREUNDER.

         Section 9.9 Integration. This Agreement comprises the final and
complete integration of all prior expressions by the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof and shall constitute the entire agreement among the
parties hereto with respect to such subject matter, superseding all prior oral
or written understandings.

         Section 9.10 Agreement Effectiveness. This Agreement shall become
effective upon delivery of fully executed counterparts hereof to each of the
parties hereto.

         Section 9.11 Headings Descriptive. The headings of the sections and
subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in
any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.

         Section 9.12 Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
Borrower and the Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that
the Borrower may not transfer or assign any or all of its rights or obligations


                                      -37-
<PAGE>

hereunder without the prior written consent of the Lender. The Lender may sell,
transfer, assign and convey any Note or any portion thereof and any or all of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement or with respect to any Loan or
Note, including without limitation the right to sell undivided participating
interests in any Loan or Note (provided that such sales of participating
interests shall not provide for a transfer or change of decision-making control
with respect to the administration and enforcement of this Agreement except in
the event of a default by the Lender under the related participation interest
sale agreement), to any Lender Affiliate without any prior notice to or consent
of the Borrower. So long as no default has occurred pursuant to the Exclusivity
Agreement, the Lender shall not make any such assignment to any Person who is
not a Lender Affiliate without the prior written consent of the Borrower.

         Section 9.13 Advice from Independent Counsel. Each party hereto
understands that this Agreement is a legally binding agreement that may affect
such party's rights. Each party hereto represents to the other that it has
received legal advice from counsel of its choice regarding the meaning and legal
significance of this Agreement and that it is satisfied with its legal counsel
and the advice received from it.

         Section 9.14 Judicial Interpretation. Should any provision of this
Agreement require judicial interpretation, it is agreed that a court
interpreting or construing the same shall not apply a presumption that the terms
hereof shall be more strictly construed against any person by reason of the rule
of construction that a document is to be construed more strictly against the
person who itself or through its agent prepared the same, it being agreed that
all parties hereto have participated in the preparation of this Agreement.

         Section 9.15 Use of Lender's Name. The Borrower hereby agrees that
neither the Borrower nor the Servicer shall refer to or use the name "CFSC
Capital Corp. XXXIV," "Cargill Financial Services Corporation," "CFSC",
"Cargill, Incorporated" or "Cargill", or any such name in any manner in any
collection or enforcement activities with respect to any Asset or in any
advertising, printed material, electronic medium or other medium, without first
obtaining the Lender's prior written consent. The Lender shall have no
obligation to give any such written consent and may withhold the same in its
sole and absolute discretion.

         Section 9.16 Confidentiality of Information. Each of the Lender and the
Borrower hereby acknowledges that it will use the Confidential Information
(defined below) solely for the purposes of evaluating, administering and
enforcing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and making any
necessary business judgments with respect thereto and, in particular,
determining whether or not to make or obtain, as applicable, a Loan with respect
to an Asset Pool. In addition, neither the Lender nor the Borrower will disclose
any Confidential Information without the prior consent of the other, other than
to the directors, employees, auditors, counsel or affiliates of the Lender and
the Borrower, as applicable, each of whom shall be informed of the confidential
nature of the Confidential Information; provided, however, that the Lender and
the Borrower may disclose any such Confidential Information (i) to any party
contemplated in this Agreement or any other Loan Document for the purposes


                                      -38-
<PAGE>



contemplated hereunder or thereunder (including to any permitted assignee of a
Loan), (ii) as may be required by any municipal, state, federal or other
regulatory body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over such party, (iii)
in order to comply with any law, order, regulation, regulatory request or ruling
applicable to such party or (iv) in the event any such party is legally
compelled (by interrogatories, requests for information or copies, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any such Confidential
Information. For purposes of this Section 9.16, "Confidential Information" shall
include: (a) all information regarding one or more Asset Pools in connection
with a Borrowing Request (including, but not limited to the Borrower's, any
Excluded Party's or any Affiliated Party's pricing, bidding, collections,
returns and profitability) (the "Borrower Confidential Information"), and (b)
all information pertaining to the relationship between the Borrower and the
Lender evidenced by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (the "Lender
Confidential Information"). This Section 9.16 shall be inoperative as to (A) the
Borrower, with respect to the Borrower Confidential Information, (B) the Lender,
with respect to the Lender Confidential Information, and (C) those portions of
the Confidential Information which are or become generally available to the

by the other party.

         Section 9.17 Full Recourse Obligations; Non-Recourse as to Certain
Parties. All Obligations are full recourse obligations of the Borrower and as to
all Assets. No Affiliated Party or Excluded Party (other than the Borrower and,
as applicable, the Servicer) shall have liability to the Lender under this
Agreement or otherwise for performance of the Obligations or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that nothing in the
foregoing shall relieve any Affiliated Party or any Excluded Party from
liability to the Lender under the Exclusivity Agreement or for any
misapplication or misappropriation of any Asset Pool Proceeds or
misappropriation of any Loan Collateral, or for any act of fraud or any knowing
and intentional misrepresentation by or on behalf of the Borrower, the Servicer
or any such Affiliated Party or Excluded Party.

         Section 9.18 Effective Date and Termination. This Agreement shall

Re: Request for Loan under our Credit Agreement with you dated as of November
    26, 2002 (the "Credit Agreement")

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         Unless otherwise expressly indicated, all capitalized terms used herein
but not otherwise herein defined shall have the respective meanings ascribed to
them in the Credit Agreement. On _________________, we intend to submit an offer
to purchase a pool or pools of assets (the "Asset Pool"), which Asset Pool
includes consumer finance receivables and/or other delinquent or deficiency
consumer obligations (the "Assets") from _______________________________________
(the "Asset Pool Seller") for a purchase price not to exceed $ _______ (the
"Purchase Price"), such purchase to be effected pursuant to the terms and
conditions of a purchase agreement which, if available, is in substantially the
form attached hereto as Annex I (the "Purchase Agreement"). We anticipate that
the Total Cost of the Asset Pool will be $__________.

         Pursuant to Section 2.1 of the Credit Agreement, we hereby request that
you make a Loan in the amount of $ ______________, which amount is [ninety
percent (90%)] of the Total Cost of the Asset Pool. Our Asset Pool Equity
Contribution with respect to the Asset Pool will be $______________, which is
[ten percent (10%)] of the Total Cost of the Asset Pool.

         To induce you to make the Loans requested above, we hereby represent
and warrant to you the following:

         (a) No Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, or will result
     from the making of this Borrowing Request or the transactions contemplated
     hereby;

         (b) The conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.2 of the Credit
     Agreement are fully satisfied as of the date of the Borrowing Request; and


<PAGE>


         (c) The representations, warranties and covenants of the undersigned
     set forth in Article V and Section 4.3 of the Credit Agreement are true and
     correct as of the date of the Borrowing Request.

         Pursuant to Section 2.1 of the Credit Agreement, included with this
Borrowing Request is the following pertinent information and documentation
relating to the Asset Pool:

         (a) Attached hereto as Annex II is the related bid package as provided
     by the Asset Pool Seller; and

         (b) Attached hereto as Annex III is all relevant additional information
     regarding the Assets, including without limitation, the aggregate number of
     Accounts included in the Asset Pool, projections of Contingent Payments and
     projections of Asset Pool Proceeds, Purchase Expenses incurred to date, an
     estimate of future Purchase Expenses, a budget for the anticipated costs of
     collection to be incurred in collecting the Assets and all related cash
     flow models in sufficient detail to accurately describe the anticipated
     internal rate of return for the Assets, a projected payment schedule over
     the expected term of the Asset Pool as contemplated in Treasury Regulation
     ss. 1.12175-4(b) and other information material to our economic assumptions
     with respect to the Assets.

We will use our best efforts to promptly supply such additional pertinent
information and documentation as you may request.

         In accordance with Section 2.1 of the Credit Agreement, your failure to
accept this Borrowing Request within the Response Period shall be deemed a
rejection of this Borrowing Request by you.

                                         Very truly yours,

                                         NCOP CAPITAL, Inc.
