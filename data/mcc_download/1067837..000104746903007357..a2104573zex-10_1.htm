it is determined (as hereafter provided) that Executive would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section&nbsp;4999 to which Executive would
not have been subject but for any payment or stock option or restricted stock vesting (collectively a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Payment</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") occurring pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or otherwise as in connection with a change in the ownership or effective control of Employer or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Employer within the
meaning of Code Section&nbsp;280G(b)(2)(A)(i)&nbsp;(such tax, a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Parachute Tax</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), then Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment
or payments (a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Gross-Up Payment</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") in an amount such that, after payment by Executive of all taxes (including any Parachute Tax) imposed
upon the Gross-Up Payment, Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to two-thirds (<SUP>2</SUP>/<SMALL>3</SMALL>) of the Parachute Tax imposed upon the
Payment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the provisions of <U>Section&nbsp;11.1</U> hereof, all determinations required to be made under this
<U>Section&nbsp;11</U>, including whether a Parachute Tax is payable by Executive and the amount of such Parachute Tax and whether a Gross-Up Payment is required
and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by the nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Accounting
Firm</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") used by the Company prior to the Change in Control (or, if such Accounting Firm declines to serve, the Accounting Firm shall be a nationally recognized firm of certified
public accountants selected by the Company). For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section, the Accounting Firm may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning
applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> that
the Accounting Firm's determinations must be made with substantial authority (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;6662 of the Code). The Accounting Firm shall be directed by the Company or Executive
to submit its preliminary determination and detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and Executive within fifteen (15)&nbsp;calendar days after the determination date, if applicable, and
any other such time or times as may be requested by the Company or Executive. If the Accounting Firm determines that any Parachute Tax is payable by Executive, the Company shall pay the required
Gross-Up Payment to, or for the benefit of, Executive within five business days after receipt of such determination and calculations. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Parachute
Tax is payable by Executive, it shall, at the same time as it makes such determination, furnish Executive with an opinion that he has substantial authority not to report any Parachute Tax on his
federal tax return. Any good faith determination by the Accounting Firm as to the amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be binding upon the Company and Executive absent a contrary
determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent jurisdiction; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>,
that no such determination shall eliminate or reduce the Company's obligation to provide any Gross-Up Payments that shall be due as a result of such contrary determination. As a result of
the uncertainty in the application of Code Section&nbsp;4999 at the time of any determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have
been made by the Company should have been made (an "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Underpayment</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event of a
final determination by the Internal Revenue Service that an Underpayment has occurred, Executive shall direct the Accounting Firm to determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and to
submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and Executive as promptly as possible. Any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to, or for the
benefit of, Executive within five business days after receipt of such determination and calculations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company and Executive shall each provide the Accounting Firm access to and copies of any books, records and documents in the possession of the Company
