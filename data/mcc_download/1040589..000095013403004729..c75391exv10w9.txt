                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      8.2 No Guarantee of Employment. This Agreement is not an employment policy
or contract. It does not give the Executive the right to remain an employee of
the Company, nor does it interfere with the Company's right to discharge the
Executive. It also does not require the Executive to remain an employee nor
interfere with the Executive's right to terminate employment at any time.

      8.3 Non-Transferability. Benefits under this Agreement cannot be sold,
transferred, assigned, pledged, attached or encumbered in any manner.

      8.4 Tax Withholding. The Company shall withhold any taxes that are
required to be withheld from the benefits provided under this Agreement.

      8.5 Applicable Law. This Agreement and all rights hereunder shall be
construed and governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to
the principles of conflicts of law which might otherwise apply.

      8.6 Unfunded Arrangement. The Executive and beneficiaries are general
unsecured creditors of the Company for the payment of benefits under this
Agreement. The benefits represent the mere promise by the Company to pay such
benefits. The rights to benefits are not subject in any manner to anticipation,
alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or
garnishment by creditors. Any insurance on the Executive's life is a general
asset of the Company to which the Executive and beneficiary have no preferred or
secured claim.

      8.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the Company and the Executive as to the subject matter hereof. No rights
are granted to the Executive by virtue of this Agreement other than those
specifically set forth herein.


                                       14

      8.8 Administration. The Company shall have powers which are necessary to
administer this Agreement, including but not limited to:

            8.8.1 Interpreting the provisions of the Agreement;

            8.8.2 Establishing and revising the method of accounting for the
      Agreement;

            8.8.3 Maintaining a record of benefit payments; and

            8.8.4 Establishing rules and prescribing any forms necessary or
      desirable to administer the Agreement.

      8.9 Designated Fiduciary. For purposes of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, if applicable, the Company shall be the named fiduciary
and plan administrator under the Agreement. The named fiduciary may delegate to
others certain aspects of the management and operation responsibilities of the
plan including the employment of advisors and the delegation of ministerial
duties to qualified individuals.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive and a duly authorized Company officer
have signed this Agreement.

EXECUTIVE:                                COMPANY:
