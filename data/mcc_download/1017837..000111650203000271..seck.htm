Until Lender is able to effect a sale, lease, or other disposition of Collateral, Lender shall have the right to hold or use Collateral, or any part thereof, to the extent that it deems appropriate for the purpose of preserving Collateral or its value or for any other purpose deemed appropriate by Lender. Lender shall have no obligation to any Grantor to maintain or preserve the rights of such Grantor as against third parties with respect to Collateral while Collateral is in the possession of Lender. Lender may, if it so elects, seek the appointment of a receiver or keeper to take possession of Collateral and to enforce any of Lender&#146;s remedies (for the benefit of Lender), with respect to such appointment without prior notice or hearing as to such appointment. Lender shall apply the net proceeds of any such collection, recovery, receipt, appropriation, realization or sale to the Secured Obligations, and only after so paying over such net proceeds, and after the payment by Lender of any other amount required by any provision of law, need Lender account for the surplus, if any, to any Grantor. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages, and demands against Lender arising out of the repossession, retention or sale of the Collateral except such as arise solely out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lender as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Each Grantor agrees that ten (10) days prior notice by Lender of the time and place of any public sale or of the time after which a private sale may take place is reasonable notification of such matters. Grantors shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all Secured Obligations, including any attorneys&#146; fees and other expenses incurred by Lender to collect such deficiency.</P>

Each Grantor acknowledges that the purpose of this Section 7(c) is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions or omissions by the Lender would not be commercially unreasonable in the Lender's exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that other actions or omissions by the Lender shall not be deemed commercially unreasonable solely on account of not being indicated in this Section 7(c).
