Employee for whose benefit the Rollover Contribution is being made. Any Eligible Employee desiring to effect a Rollover Contribution to the Plan must execute and file with the Committee the form
prescribed by the Committee for such purpose. The Committee may require as a condition to accepting any Rollover Contribution that such Eligible Employee furnish any evidence that the Committee in its
discretion deems satisfactory to establish that the proposed Rollover Contribution is in fact eligible for rollover to the Plan and is made pursuant to and in accordance with applicable provisions of
the Code and Treasury regulations. All Rollover Contributions to the Plan must be made in cash. A Rollover Contribution shall be credited to the Rollover Contribution Account of the Eligible Employee
