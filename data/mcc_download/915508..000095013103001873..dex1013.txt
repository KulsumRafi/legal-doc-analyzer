<PAGE>


DEFINITIONS: As used on page 1, "[X]" means the terms that apply to this loan.
"I" "me" or "my" means each Borrower who signs this note and each other person
or legal entity (including guarantors, endorsers, and securities) who agrees to
pay this note (together referred to as "us"). "You" or "your" means the Lender
and its successors and assigns.
APPLICABLE LAW: The law of the state of Iowa will govern this note. Any term of
this note which is contrary to applicable law will not be effective, unless the
law permits you and me to agree to such a variation. If any provision of this
agreement cannot be enforced according to its terms this fact will not affect
the enforceability of the remainder of this agreement. No modification of this
agreement may be made without your express written consent. Time is of the
essence in this agreement.
COMMISSIONS OR OTHER REMUNERATION: I understand and agree that any insurance
premiums paid to insurance companies as part of this note will involve money
retained by you or paid back to you as commissions or other remuneration.
     In addition, I understand and agree that some other payments to third
parties as part of this note may also involve money retained by you or paid back
to you as commissions or other remuneration.
PAYMENTS: Each payment I make on this note will first reduce the amount I owe
you for charges which are neither interest nor principal. The remainder of each
payment will then reduce accrued unpaid interest, and then unpaid principal. If
you and I agree to a different application of payments, we will describe our
agreement on this note. I may prepay a part of, or the entire balance of this
loan without penalty, unless we specify to the contrary on this note. Any
partial prepayment will not excuse or reduce any later scheduled payment until
this note is paid in full (unless, when I make the prepayment, you and I agree
in writing to the contrary).
INTEREST: Interest accrues on the principal remaining unpaid from time to time,
until paid in full. If I receive the principal in more than one advance, each
advance will start to earn interest only when I receive the advance. The
interest rate in effect on this note at any given time will apply to the entire
principal advanced at that time. You and I may provide in this agreement for
accrued interest not paid when due to be added to principal. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, I do not agree to pay and you do not intend to charge
any rate of interest that is higher than the maximum rate of interest you could
charge under applicable law for the extension of credit that is agreed to here
(either before or after maturity). If any notice of interest accrual is sent and
is in error, we mutually agree to correct it, and if you actually collect more
interest than allowed by law and this agreement, you agree to refund it to me.
INDEX RATE: The index will serve only as a device for setting the rate on this
note. You do not guarantee by selecting this index, or the margin, that the rate
on this note will be the same rate you charge on any other loans or class of
loans to me or other borrowers.
ACCRUAL METHOD: The amount of interest that I will pay on this loan will be
calculated using the interest rate and accrual method stated on page 1 of this
note. For the purpose of interest calculation, the accrual method will determine
the number of days in a "year." If no accrual method is stated, then you may use
any reasonable accrual method for calculating interest.
POST MATURITY RATE: For purposes of deciding when the "Post Maturity Rate"
(shown on page 1) applies, the term "maturity" means the date of the last
scheduled payment indicated on page 1 of this note or the date you accelerate
payment on the note, whichever is earlier.
SINGLE ADVANCE LOANS: If this is a single advance loan, you and I expect that
you will make only one advance of principal. However, you may add other amounts
to the principal if you make any payments described in the "PAYMENTS BY LENDER"
paragraph below, or if we have agreed that accrued interest not paid when due
may be added to principal.
MULTIPLE ADVANCE LOANS: If this is a multiple advance loan, you and I expect
that you will make more than one advance of principal. If this is closed end
credit, repaying a part of the principal will not entitle me to additional
credit.
PAYMENTS BY LENDER: If you are authorized to pay, on my behalf, charges I am
obligated to pay (such as property insurance premiums), then you may treat those
payments as advances and add them to the unpaid principal under this note, or
you may demand immediate payment of the charges.
SET-OFF: I agree that you may set off any amount due and payable under this note
against any right I have to receive money from you.
     "Right to receive money from you" means:
     (1)  any deposit account balance I have with you;
     (2)  any money owed to me on an item presented to you or in your possession
          for collection or exchange; and
     (3)  any repurchase agreement or other nondeposit obligation.
     "Any amount due and payable under this note" means the total amount of
which you are entitled to demand payment under the terms of this note at the
time you set off. This total includes any balance the due date for which you
properly accelerate under this note.
     If my right to receive money from you is also owned by someone who has not
agreed to pay this note, your right of set-off will apply to my interest in the
obligation and to any other amounts I could withdraw on my sole request or
endorsement. Your right of set-off does not apply to an account or other
obligation where my rights are only as a representative. It also does not apply
to any Individual Retirement Account or other tax-deferred retirement account.
     You will not be liable for the dishonor of any check when the dishonor
occurs because you set off this debt against any of my accounts. I agree to hold
you harmless from any such claims arising as a result of your exercise of your
right of set-off.
REAL ESTATE OR RESIDENCE SECURITY: If this note is secured by real estate or a
residence that is personal property, the existence of a default and your
remedies for such a default will be determined by applicable law, by the terms
of any separate instrument creating the security interest and to the extent not
prohibited by law and not contrary to the terms of the separate security
instrument, by the "Default" and "Remedies" paragraphs herein.
DEFAULT: I will be in default if any one or more of the following occur:
(1) I fail to make a payment on time or in the amount due; (2) I fail to keep
the property insured, if required; (3) I fail to pay, or keep any promise, on
any debt or agreement I have with you; (4) I make an assignment for the
benefit of creditors, or become insolvent (either because my liabilities exceed
my assets or I am unable to pay my debts as they become due); (5) I make any
written statement or provide any financial information that is untrue or
inaccurate at the time it was provided; (6) I do or fail to do something which
causes you to believe that you will have difficulty collecting the amount I owe
you; (7) any collateral securing this note is used in a manner or for a purpose
which threatens confiscation by a legal authority; (8) I change my name or
assume an additional name without first notifying you before making such a
change;
REMEDIES: Except as provided in the next paragraph, if this note is secured by
agricultural land (as defined in Iowa Code Section 172C.1) and I am in default
on this note, you will give me notice of my right to cure. You may exercise your
remedies only if I fail to cure my default within 45 days after you mail the
notice (or 45 days after actual delivery if you use a means other than certified
mail).
     A notice of right to cure is not necessary and you may immediately
exercise your remedies if you have: a) given me the notice with respect to two
prior defaults, b) you have given me the notice with respect to a default
occurring within 12 months before the current default, or I voluntarily
surrender the agricultural land and you accept it in full satisfaction of the
debt.
     Subject to the above limitations and any limitations imposed by Iowa Code
Chapter 654A, if I am in default on this note you have, but are not limited to,
the following remedies:
     (1)  You may demand immediate payment of all I owe you under this note
          (principal, accrued unpaid interest and other accrued charges).
     (2)  You may set off this debt against any right I have to the payment of
          money from you, subject to the terms of the "set-off" paragraph
          herein.
     (3)  You may demand security, additional security, or additional parties to
          be obligated to pay this note as a condition for not using any other
          remedy.
     (4)  You may refuse to make advances to me or allow purchases on credit by
          me.
     (5)  You may use any remedy you have under state or federal law.
     By selecting any one or more of these remedies you do not give up your
right to later use any other remedy. By waiving your right to declare an event
to be a default, you do not waive your right to later consider the event as a
default if it continues or happens again.
COLLECTION COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES: I agree to pay all costs of collection,
replevin or any other or similar type of cost if I am in default. In addition,
if you hire an attorney to collect this note, I also agree to pay any fee you
incur with such attorney plus court costs (except where prohibited by law). To
the extent permitted by the United States Bankruptcy Code, I also agree to pay
the reasonable attorney's fees and costs you incur to collect this debt as
awarded by any court exercising jurisdiction under the Bankruptcy Code.
WAIVER: I give up my rights to require you to do certain things. I will not
require you to:
     (1)  demand payment of amounts due (presentment);
     (2)  obtain official certification of nonpayment (protest); or
     (3)  give notice that amounts due have not been paid (notice of dishonor).
     I waive any defenses I have based on suretyship or impairment of
collateral.
OBLIGATIONS INDEPENDENT: I understand that I must pay this note even if someone
else has also agreed to pay it (by, for example, signing this form or a separate
guarantee or endorsement). You may do so without any notice that it has not been
paid (notice of dishonor). You may without notice release any party to this
agreement without releasing any other party. If you give up any of your rights,
with or without notice, it will not affect my duty to pay this note. Any
extension of new credit to any of us, or renewal of this note by all or less
than all of us will not release me from my duty to pay it. (Of course, you are
entitled to only one payment in full). I agree that you may at your option
extend this note or the debt represented by this note, or any portion of the
note or debt, from time to time without limit or notice and for any term without
affecting my liability for payment of the note. I will not assign my obligation
under this agreement without your prior written approval.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION: I agree to provide you, upon request, any financial
statement or information you may deem necessary, I warrant that the financial
statements and information I provide to you are or will be accurate, correct and
complete.
NOTICE: Unless otherwise required by law, any notice to me shall be given by
delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail addressed to me at my last
known address. My current address is on page 1. I agree to inform you in
writing of any change in my address. I will give any notice to you by mailing it
first class to your address stated on page 1 of this agreement, or to any other
address that you have designated.
CREDIT AGREEMENT: A "credit agreement" under Iowa Code Section 535.17 means any
contract made or acquired by a lender to loan money or extend credit for any
purpose. A "credit agreement" does not mean a contract to extend credit by means
of a credit card, or open end credit, or a home equity line of credit.
     This note is not subject to Iowa Code Section 535.17 if it is a "credit
agreement" made primarily for a personal, family, or household purpose where the
credit extended is twenty thousand dollars or less.

                       EXHIBIT "A" ATTACHED TO LOAN #52577
                              DATED MARCH 17, 2003

1.   Future Advances. Future advances under this Loan are contingent upon bank
at all times having collateral in its control in the form of (a) cash, (b)
bonds, or (c) securities (listed on the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange)
[all collectively referred to as the "Collateral"], with a market value equal to
or greater than the amount outstanding and being advanced under this Loan. In
the event the market value of Collateral falls below the outstanding balance
owed on the Loan, bank has the right to require the Securityholders identified
in the Collateral Fee and Security Agreement dated March ______, 2003 (the
"Collateral Agreement") to provide bank with additional assets (acceptable to
bank) as additional Collateral to equal the then outstanding balance of the
Loan. Such additional Collateral may be provided by Pledgors in equal proportion
to the amounts originally pledged by the Pledgors at the inception of the Loan,
in accordance with the Collateral Agreement, or the Pledgors may agree to an
alternative proportional arrangement, as long as the total market value of the
Collateral equals or exceeds the outstanding balance of the Loan. No advances
will be made when such Collateral value does not equal or exceed the total
amount of the Loan, plus the amount being requested.

2.   Event of Default. Failure to provide sufficient Collateral within five days
of receipt of notice from bank constitutes a default under the terms of the
Loan, provided the notice period will be reduced to two days in the event the
market value of the Collateral is less than 90% of the outstanding balance of
the Loan, and to one day in the event the market value of Collateral is less
than 80% of the outstanding balance of the Loan.
