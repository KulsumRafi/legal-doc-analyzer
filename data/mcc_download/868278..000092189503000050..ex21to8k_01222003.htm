            (b) The  shares of  Suncoast's  Common  Stock  issued to  Quigley in
connection  herewith (the "Common  Shares")  shall,  once issued,  have the same
dividend rights, conversion rights, voting powers,  preferences,  priorities and

dissolution or winding up of Suncoast, the holders of the Preferred Shares shall
be entitled to receive out of the assets of Suncoast  available for distribution
to the  stockholders,  before any  distribution  of assets  shall be made to the
