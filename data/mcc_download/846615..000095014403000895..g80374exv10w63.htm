<FONT size="2">This Indemnification Agreement (this
&#147;Agreement&#148;), dated as of December&nbsp;9, 2002, is
made by and between JPS Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the &#147;Company&#148;),
and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(&#147;Indemnitee&#148;).

<FONT size="2">A.&nbsp;It is essential to the Company to retain
and attract as directors and officers the most capable persons
available.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">B.&nbsp;Indemnitee is a director and/or officer
of the Company.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">C.&nbsp;Both the Company and Indemnitee recognize
the increased risk of litigation and other claims being asserted
against directors and officers of companies in today&#146;s
environment.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">D.&nbsp;The Company&#146;s certificate of
incorporation (the &#147;Certificate&#148;) and by-laws (the
&#147;By-laws&#148;) provide that the Company will indemnify its
directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law
and will advance expenses in connection therewith, and
Indemnitee&#146;s willingness to serve as a director and/or
officer of the Company is based in part on Indemnitee&#146;s
reliance on such provisions.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">E.&nbsp;In recognition of Indemnitee&#146;s need
for substantial protection against personal liability in order
to enhance Indemnitee&#146;s continued service to the Company in
an effective manner, and Indemnitee&#146;s reliance on the
aforesaid provisions of the Certificate and By-laws, and in part
to provide Indemnitee with specific contractual assurance that
the protection promised by such provisions will be available to
Indemnitee (regardless of, among other things, any amendment to
or revocation of such provisions or any change in the
composition of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors or any
acquisition or business combination transaction relating to the
Company), the Company wishes to provide in this Agreement for
the indemnification of and the advancement of expenses to
Indemnitee as set forth in this Agreement, and, to the extent
insurance is maintained, for the continued coverage of
Indemnitee under the Company&#146;s directors&#146; and
officers&#146; liability insurance policies.

<FONT size="2">2.&nbsp;<I>Basic Indemnification Arrangement.</I>
In the event Indemnitee was, is or becomes a party to or witness
or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to
or witness or other participant in, a Claim by reason of (or
arising in whole or in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, the
Company will indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent
permitted by law as soon as practicable but in any event no
later than 30 calendar days after written demand is presented to
the Company, against any and all Expenses (including all
interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in
connection with or in respect of such Expenses) of such Claims.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Indemnitee will not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement in connection with any Claim initiated by
Indemnitee against the Company or any director or officer of the
Company unless the Company has joined in or consented to the
initiation of such Claim; provided, however, Company consent
will not be required with respect to any claim initiated by the
Indemnitee against the Company arising out of, or in connection
with, the enforcement of, or the alleged breach by the Company
of, this Agreement. If so requested by Indemnitee, the Company
will advance (within twenty (20) calendar days of such request)
any and all Expenses to Indemnitee; provided, however, if the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#147;DGCL&#148;) so
requires, an advancement of Expenses incurred by Indemnitee will
be made only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking (an
&#147;Undertaking&#148;), by or on behalf of Indemnitee, to
repay all amounts so advanced if it is ultimately determined by
final judicial decision from which there is no further right to
appeal (a &#147;Final Adjudication&#148;) that Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this
Section&nbsp;2 or otherwise.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">3.&nbsp;<I>Indemnification Procedures.</I> The
procedures to be followed with respect to providing
indemnification to the Indemnitee under the terms of this
Agreement will be consistent with those procedures set forth in
Article&nbsp;VIII of the By-laws of the Company.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">4.&nbsp;<I>No Presumption.</I> For purposes of
this Agreement, the termination of any claim, action, suit or
proceeding upon a plea of nolo contendre or its equivalent will
not create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not meet any
particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or
that a court has determined that indemnification is not
permitted by applicable law.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">5.&nbsp;<I>Non-Exclusivity, Etc.</I> The rights
of Indemnitee hereunder will be in addition to any other rights
Indemnitee may have under the Certificate, the By-laws or the
DGCL or otherwise; provided, however, that to the extent that
Indemnitee otherwise would have any greater right to
indemnification under any provision of the Certificate or
By-laws as in effect on the date hereof, Indemnitee will be
deemed to have such greater right hereunder; and provided
further that to the extent that any change is made to the DGCL
(whether by legislative action or judicial decision), the
Certificate and/or the By-laws which permits any greater right to

<P align="left">
<FONT size="2">indemnification than that provided under this
Agreement as of the date hereof, Indemnitee will be deemed to
have such greater right hereunder. The Company will not adopt
any amendment to the Certificate or the By-laws the effect of
which would be to deny, diminish or encumber Indemnitee&#146;s
right to indemnification under the Certificate, the By-laws or
the DGCL or otherwise as applied to any act or failure to act
occurring in whole or in part prior to the date upon which the
amendment was approved by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors
and/or its stockholders, as the case may be.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">6.&nbsp;<I>Liability Insurance and Funding.</I>
To the extent the Company maintains an insurance policy or
policies providing directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability
insurance, Indemnitee will be covered by such policy or
policies, in accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum
extent of the coverage available for any Company director or
officer. The Company may, but will not be required to, create a
trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means
(including without limitation a letter of credit) to ensure the
payment of such amounts as may be necessary to satisfy its
obligations to indemnify and advance expenses pursuant to this
Agreement.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">7.&nbsp;<I>Subrogation.</I> In the event of
payment under this Agreement, the Company will be subrogated to
the extent of such payment to all of the related rights of
recovery of Indemnitee against other persons or entities. The
Indemnitee will execute all papers reasonably required and will
do everything that may be reasonably necessary to secure such
rights and enable the Company effectively to bring suit to
enforce such rights (all of Indemnitee&#146;s reasonably costs
and expenses, including attorneys&#146; fees and disbursements,
to be reimbursed by or, at the option of Indemnitee, advanced by
the Company).
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">8.&nbsp;<I>No Duplication of Payments.</I> The
Company will not be liable under this Agreement to make any
payment in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee to
the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment
(under any insurance policy, the Certificate or the By-laws or
otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">9.&nbsp;<I>Joint Defense.</I> Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein contained, if
(a)&nbsp;Indemnitee elects to retain counsel in connection with
any Claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought by
Indemnitee against the Company pursuant to this Agreement and
(b)&nbsp;any other director or officer of the Company may also
be subject to liability arising out of such Claim and in
connection with such Claim may seek indemnification against the
Company pursuant to an agreement similar to this Agreement,
Indemnitee, together with such other persons, will employ
counsel to represent jointly Indemnitee and such other persons
unless the employment of separate counsel shall have been
authorized in writing by the Board of Directors of the Company
in connection with the defense of such action or the Indemnitee
shall have reasonably concluded and delivered to the Board of
Directors a written request setting forth in reasonable detail
the basis for the determination that such Indemnitee has
available to its defenses which are inconsistent with the
defenses available to any other party seeking indemnification
against the Company. In the event the Board of Directors of the
Company fails to act on such request within 30 calendar days
after receipt thereof by the Company, Indemnitee will be deemed
to be entitled to be represented by separate counsel in
connection with such Claim.
