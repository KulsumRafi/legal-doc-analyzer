           2.5 Adjustments in Right.

           (a) In the event that the outstanding shares of Common Stock subject
to the Right are changed into or exchanged for cash or a different number or
kind of shares or other securities of the Company, by reason of merger,
consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock split-up, stock
dividend, combination of shares, the Committee shall make an appropriate and
equitable adjustment in the number and kind of shares as to which the Right, or
portions thereof then unexercised, shall be exercisable, to the end that after

<PAGE>

proportionate interest shall be maintained as before the occurrence of such
event. Such adjustment in the Right may include any necessary or appropriate
corresponding adjustment in the Right exercise price, but shall be made without
change in the total price applicable to the unexercised portion of the Right
(except for any change in the aggregate price resulting from rounding-off of
share quantities or prices) and with any necessary corresponding adjustment in
the exercise price per share. Any such adjustment made by the Committee shall be
final and binding upon the Holder, the Company and all other interested persons.

           (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of such a
reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
split-up, stock dividend or combination, or any other similar adjustment or
event which results in shares of Common Stock subject to the Right being
exchanged for or converted into cash, securities or other property, the Company
will have the right to terminate the Plan as of the date of the exchange or
conversion, in which case all options, rights and other awards under the Right
shall become the right to receive such cash, securities or other property, net
of any applicable exercise price.

           (c) In the event of a "spin-off" or other substantial distribution of
assets of the Company which has a material diminutive effect upon the Fair
Market Value of the Company's Common Stock, the Committee may in its discretion
make an appropriate and equitable adjustment to the Right to reflect such
diminution.

                            PERIOD OF EXERCISABILITY

           (b) No portion of the Right which is unexercisable at Termination of

that payment shall be subject to set off of claims by the Company for the
commission by the Holder of a felony or the perpetration by the Holder of an act

the Holder which is injurious in any material respect to the financial condition
or business reputation of the Company or a Subsidiary; and further provided that
payment shall be postponed until such set off is resolved by settlement or final
court adjudication; or

outstanding voting stock, or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company,
unless the Committee waives this provision in connection with such transaction.
At least twenty (20) days prior to the effective date of such merger,
consolidation, exchange, acquisition, liquidation or dissolution, the Committee
shall give the Holder notice of such event if the Right has then neither been
fully exercised nor become unexercisable under this Section 3.3; provided,
however, to the extent that the Right is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the tenth anniversary of the date the Right was granted, such Right (or
portion thereof) shall be deemed exercised under Section 2.2 if the Fair Market
Value of a share of Common Stock on such date exceeds the exercise price per
share.
