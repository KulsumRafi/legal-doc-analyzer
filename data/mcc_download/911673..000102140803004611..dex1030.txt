assigns, and subsidiaries (collectively the "Releasees") of, to, and from any
and all claims, defenses, actions, causes of action, suits, controversies,
agreements, provisions, and demands in law or in equity, known or unknown
(collectively, the "Claims") which the Company ever had, now has, or may have
arising from or relating to the Investment Documents, against or related to the
Releasees, through the date of this Fourth Amendment. The Company agrees to
assume the risk of any and all unknown, unanticipated or misunderstood claims
which are released hereby.

          9.   Miscellaneous.

               (a)  Entire Agreement; Integration Clause. This Fourth Amendment
and the other Investment Documents set forth the entire agreements and
understandings of the parties hereto with respect to this transaction, and as
such supersede any prior agreements, whether written or oral, regarding the
matters described herein.

               (b)  No Oral Modification or Waivers. The terms herein may not be
modified or waived orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the
party against which enforcement of the modification or waiver (as the case may
be) is sought.

               (c)  Governing Law. This Fourth Amendment is governed by, and
interpreted and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of
Maryland (without regard to its conflicts of law principles).

               (d)  Headings. The headings of the paragraphs and sub-paragraphs
of this Fourth Amendment are inserted for convenience only and shall not be
deemed to constitute a part of this Fourth Amendment or the other Investment
Documents.

               (e)  Severability. To the extent any provision herein violates
any applicable law, that provision shall be considered void and the balance of
this Fourth Amendment shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

               (f)  Counterparts. This Fourth Amendment may be executed in as
many counterpart copies as may be required. It shall not be necessary that the
signature of, or on behalf of, each party appear on each counterpart, but it
shall be sufficient that the signature of, or on behalf of, each party appear on
one or more of the counterparts. All counterparts shall collectively constitute
a single agreement. It shall not be necessary in any proof of this Fourth
Amendment to produce or account for more than a number of counterparts
containing the respective signatures of, or on behalf of, all of the parties.
