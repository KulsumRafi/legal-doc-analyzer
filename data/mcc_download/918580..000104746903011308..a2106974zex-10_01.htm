Paul-Son Gaming Corporation 1994 Directors' Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is intended to promote the interests of Paul-Son Gaming Corporation (the
"Corporation") and its subsidiaries by offering members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation who are not employed as regular salaried officers or employees of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as "Non-Employee Directors" or "Optionees") the opportunity to participate in a stock option plan in order to encourage Non-Employee
Directors to take a long term view of the affairs of the Corporation; to attract and retain highly qualified Non-Employee Directors; and to aid in rewarding Non-Employee
Directors for their services to the Corporation. </FONT></P>

Plan shall be administered by a Committee (the "Committee") of not less than two Directors of the Corporation who are not eligible to participate under the Plan, selected by and
serving at the pleasure of the Corporation's Board of Directors (the "Board"). The Committee shall not have any discretion to determine or vary any matters which are fixed under the terms of the Plan
including, without limitation, which individuals shall receive option awards, how many shares of the Corporation's stock shall be subject to each such option award, what the exercise price of stock
covered by an option shall be, and what means of payment shall be acceptable. </FONT></P>
