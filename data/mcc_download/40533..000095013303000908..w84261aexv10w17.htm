you agree to assignments in support of GDAIS, you will not serve any business
or organization, or engage in any business on your own behalf that conflicts
with GDAIS&#146; without our express, written permission. You agree to provide us
with a full and complete list of your current clients and the names of your
principal contact with your clients and to notify us in writing whenever you
add new clients, delete clients, or change principal contact with your clients.

federal and state taxes owing on the consulting income received.

<P><FONT size="2">You will not act as our agent or enter into any agreements or incur any
obligations on our behalf, or commit us in any other manner, without our prior
written consent. You shall indemnify and hold us harmless from any liability,
loss or damage whatsoever for injuries (including death) to you or any of your

incurred in certain lobbying and consulting activities. These restrictions
apply to you and are found in the &#147;Byrd Amendment&#148; (31 U.S.C. 1352) and
restrict the allowability of certain costs incurred while lobbying congress or
contacting executive agencies in connection with Federal contracts.

(including death) to you arising out of your performance under this agreement
or otherwise. General Dynamics shall indemnify you for any reasonable amount
that you become legally obligated to pay in connection with any claim made
against you by a third party or on behalf of General Dynamics because of any
act, omission or neglect or breach of duty which you commit or suffer or permit
to occur while acting in any authorized capacity as a consultant pursuant to
this agreement, provided that you are either wholly successful with respect
thereto, or acted in good faith in what you reasonably believed to be the best
interests of General Dynamics, and with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that your conduct was unlawful.
The term &#147;claim&#148; shall include any claim, action, suit or proceeding, civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, whether such claim is alleged action
or inaction in, or is otherwise based upon your capacity as a consultant, and
whether or not you are acting or serving in such capacity at the date hereof,
at the time liability is incurred, or at the time the claim is asserted. The
term &#147;wholly successful&#148; shall mean termination, withdrawal or dismissal of any
claim against you without any finding of liability or guilt against you, or the
expiration of a reasonable period of time after the making of any claim without
the institution of the same, without any payment or promise make to induce a
settlement.
