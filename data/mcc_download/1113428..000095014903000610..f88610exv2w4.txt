                                       OF

         The date of filing of the original Certificate of Incorporation of the

         This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly
adopted in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sections 242 and 245 of
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "GCL").

         The text of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, as
amended and restated, shall read in its entirety as follows:

         FIRST:     The name of the Corporation is Larscom Incorporated.

         SECOND:    The address of the Corporation's registered office in the
State of Delaware is 1209 Orange Street, City of Wilmington, County of New
Castle, Delaware 19801. The name of its registered agent at such address is The
Corporation Trust Company.

         THIRD:     The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful
act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the GCL.

         FOURTH:    The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation
shall have authority to issue is One Hundred Sixteen Million Nine Hundred
Thousand (116,900,000), consisting of Five Million (5,000,000) shares of
preferred stock with a par value of $0.01 per share (the "Preferred Stock") and
One Hundred Eleven Million Nine Hundred Thousand (111,900,000) shares of common
stock with a par value of $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock").

         (A)  Shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation may be issued from
time to time in one or more classes or series, each of which class or series
shall have such distinctive designation or title as shall be fixed by the Board
of Directors prior to the issuance of any shares thereof. Each such class or
series of Preferred Stock shall have such voting powers (full or limited) or no
voting powers, such preferences and relative participating, optional or other
special rights, relative ranking and such qualifications, limitations or
restrictions, as shall be

                                       1

<PAGE>

stated in such resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such class
or series of Preferred Stock as may be adopted from time to time by the Board of
Directors prior to the issuance of any shares thereof pursuant to the authority
hereby expressly vested in it, all in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware.

         (B)  Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder
thereof to one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of
this Corporation for their vote; provided, however, that except as otherwise
required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any
amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of
designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates
solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the
holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a
class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon by law
or pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of
designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock).

         FIFTH:     Upon this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
becoming effective pursuant to the GCL (the "Effective Time") to effectuate both
a reclassification of the outstanding common stock into one class and to
effectuate a one-for-_________ reverse stock split, (i) each share of the
Corporation's Class A Common Stock, par value par value $0.01 per share ("Class
A Common Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, will be automatically reclassified as and converted into ________ of a
share of Common Stock and (ii) each share of the Corporation's Class B Common
Stock, par value par value $0.01 per share ("Class B Common Stock"), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be automatically
reclassified as and converted into _________ of a share of Common Stock; which
shares will be fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Corporation's Common
Stock. No fractional shares shall be issued on such stock split; any stockholder
otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share, shall receive an amount in
cash equal to the value of such fractional share, based on the then current
market price of the Corporation's Common Stock following the reverse stock
split. Any stock certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i)
represented shares of Class A Common Stock will, from and after the Effective
Time, automatically and without the necessity of presenting the same for
exchange, represent the number of shares of Common Stock as equals the product
obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Class A Common Stock represented
by such certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time by _________ and
(ii) represented shares of Class B Common Stock will, from and after the
Effective Time, automatically and without the necessity of presenting the same
for exchange, represent the number of shares of Common Stock as equals the
product obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Class B Common Stock
represented by such certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time by
_________.

         SIXTH:     The incorporator of the Corporation is Susan
Blanchard-Bologna.

         SEVENTH:   The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change
or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all
rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this
reservation. The Board of Directors of the Corporation is authorized to make,
alter, amend or repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation by resolution adopted by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the whole Board. Stockholders may not
make, adopt, alter,

                                       2

amend, change or repeal the By-Laws except, subject to the terms of any
outstanding class or series of Preferred Stock, upon the affirmative vote of the
holders of the shares of Common Stock possessing a majority of the votes
represented by the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common
Stock voting as a single class entitled to vote at such meeting or to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting.

         EIGHTH:    No director of the Corporation shall be liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the GCL or (iv) for any transaction
from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. No amendment to or
repeal of this Article EIGHTH shall apply to or have any effect on the liability
or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to
any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or
repeal. If the GCL is amended hereafter to further limit the liability of a
director, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be further
limited to the fullest extent permitted by the GCL, as so amended.

         NINTH:     The Corporation shall indemnify each person who is or was or
as agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation, and may, at its
option, indemnify any other person who is or was or has agreed to become an
employee or agent of the Corporation or who is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, to the
fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the GCL, as the same may be amended
or supplemented, against all expenses and liabilities (including, but not
limited to, counsel fees) reasonably incurred by or imposed upon such person in
connection with any proceeding to which he or she may be made a party, or in
which he or she may become involved, by reason of his or her being or having
been a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or any
settlement thereof, whether or not he or she is a director, officer, employee or
agent at the time such expenses are incurred or liability incurred, except in
such cases where the director, officer, employee or agent is adjudged guilty of
willful misfeasance or malfeasance in the performance of his or her duties;
provided that in the event of a settlement the indemnification herein shall
apply only when the Board of Directors approves such settlement and
reimbursement as being for the best interests of the Corporation. Without
limiting the generality or the effect of the foregoing, the Corporation may
adopt By-Laws, or enter into one or more agreements with any person, which
provide for indemnification greater or different than that provided in this
Article NINTH or the GCL and the foregoing right of indemnification shall be in
addition to and not exclusive of all other rights to which such director,
officer, employee or agent may be entitled.

                  The Corporation may purchase insurance on behalf of any person
who is a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any liability asserted by him or her and incurred by him or
her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether
or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify him
or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article NINTH.
