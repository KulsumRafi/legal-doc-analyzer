                            ------------------------

     THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is entered into as of the 21st
day of February, 2003, by and among TriMas Company LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, as purchaser ("Buyer"), each of the Persons identified on
Schedule 4.2 (each, a "Seller," and collectively, the "Sellers") and FNL
Management Corp, an Ohio corporation, as Sellers' Representative (as defined
herein) and as attorney-in-fact for the Option Holders (as defined herein).

                                    RECITALS:
                                    ---------

      A. Sellers own, in the aggregate, all of the issued and outstanding shares
of capital stock (as more particularly defined herein, the "Shares") of Highland
Group Corporation, an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), and all of the issued
and outstanding options to purchase shares of capital stock of the Company (as
more particularly defined herein, the "Stock Options");

      B. Buyer desires to purchase from Sellers, and Sellers desire to sell to
Buyer, all of the Shares and Buyer and Sellers further desire that the Stock
Options be terminated, upon and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

     Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, Buyer and Sellers hereby
agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE 1
                                   DEFINITIONS

     1.2 Accounting Terms. Accounting terms used in this Agreement and not

                                   ARTICLE 2
                                PURCHASE AND SALE

     2.1 Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, each Seller shall sell, assign, transfer and deliver
to Buyer, free and clear of all Liens, and Buyer shall purchase from each
Seller, all of such Seller's right, title and interest in and to all of the
Shares owned by such Seller, as more specifically identified on Schedule 4.2 (as
to each Seller, respectively, the "Seller's Respective Securities").

     2.2 Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price for all of the Shares (the
"Purchase Price") shall be an amount equal to:

         (a) Seventy Million Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars
     ($70,500,000) (the "Enterprise Value"), subject to adjustment pursuant to
     Section 2.5.6

<PAGE>

     for any differences between the Closing Working Capital and the Working
     Capital Target;

         (b) plus forty percent (40%) of the amount to be paid immediately prior
     to the Closing by the Company for transaction bonuses listed on Schedule
     2.2(b);

         (c) plus an amount equal to forty percent (40%) of the Option Spread
     (the amounts referred to Sections 2.2(b) and 2.2(c), collectively, the "Tax
     Benefits");

provided, however, that the Tax Benefits may be subject to reimbursement to
Buyer as provided in Section 8.1.9.

     2.3 Certain Definitions.

         2.3.1 Working Capital. "Working Capital" of the Company is defined, and
shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth, on Schedule 2.3.1.

         2.3.2 Closing Working Capital. "Closing Working Capital" means the
Working Capital of the Company as shown on the face of the Final Closing Balance
Sheet.

         2.3.3 Working Capital Target. "Working Capital Target" means
$13,987,200.

     2.4 Payment of Purchase Price. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer shall pay and deliver the Purchase Price to
Sellers by means of a wire transfer of immediately available cash funds to an
account or accounts as directed by Sellers' Representative (the "Sellers'
Account").

     2.5 Post-Closing Adjustment.

         2.5.1 Closing Balance Sheet Preparation. Within forty-five (45) days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and shall deliver to
Sellers' Representative a balance sheet of the Company (the "Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet") and, based on the Closing Working Capital as derived therefrom,
Buyer's written calculation of any difference between the Closing Working
Capital and Working Capital Target (the "Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment").
The Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared as of the close of
business of the Company on the Closing Date; provided, however, that the
preparation of the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet shall entirely disregard
any and all effects on the assets or liabilities of the Company of any financing
or refinancing arrangements entered into by Buyer at any time at or after the
Closing Date or any other transactions entered into by Buyer in effecting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Preliminary
Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with Schedule 2.3.1 hereto
and on a basis consistent with, and using the same accounting methods, policies,
practices and procedures as employed in the preparation of the Company's
internal monthly financial statements, except that the Closing Balance Sheet
need only reflect those assets and liabilities of the Company necessary to
calculate the Closing Working Capital in accordance with the terms of Sections
2.3.1 and 2.3.2. In preparing the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, (i) it
shall be assumed that the Company and each of its lines of business shall be
continued as a going concern, and (ii) there shall not be taken into account any
of the plans, transactions or changes which Buyer intends to initiate or

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

make or cause to be initiated or made at or after the Closing Date with respect
to the Company or its business or assets, or any facts or circumstances that are
unique or particular to Buyer or any assets or liabilities of Buyer, or any
obligation of the Company to pay the Purchase Price hereunder.

         2.5.2 Closing Balance Sheet Review. Sellers' Representative shall
review the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Post-Closing
Adjustment and, if Sellers' Representative reasonably believes that either was
not prepared in accordance with the requirements of Sections 2.3.1 and 2.5.1,
Sellers' Representative shall so notify Buyer no later than the 30th day after
Sellers' Representative's receipt thereof, setting forth in such notice Sellers'
Representative's objection or objections to the Preliminary Closing Balance
Sheet or the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment with particularity and the
specific changes or adjustments which Sellers' Representative claims are
required to be made thereto in order to conform the same to the requirements of
Sections 2.3.1 and 2.5.1. Buyer shall cause the books and records of the Company
to be made available during normal business hours to Sellers' accountants,
attorneys and other representatives (including Sellers' Representative) to
facilitate such review upon reasonable prior request, and shall cause the
necessary personnel of the Company to assist such representatives in their
review of the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet. Any notice of objection
delivered pursuant to this Section 2.5.2 shall specify in reasonable detail the
nature of any disagreement so asserted, which disagreement shall not relate to
the accounting methods, policies, practices or procedures underlying the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet so long as such accounting methods, policies,
practices and procedures are consistent with those used in preparing Schedule
2.3.1.

         2.5.3 Closing Balance Sheet Dispute Resolution. If Sellers'
Representative timely notifies Buyer in accordance with Section 2.5.2 of an
objection by Sellers' Representative to the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet or
the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment, and if Buyer and Sellers'
Representative are unable otherwise to resolve such dispute within fifteen (15)
days after Sellers' Representative's delivery of such notice of objection, then
the parties shall mutually engage and submit such dispute to, and the same shall
be finally resolved in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement by, the
firm of Deloitte & Touche or such other accounting firm of national reputation
as shall be mutually acceptable to Buyer and Sellers' Representative (the
"Independent Accountants"). The Independent Accountants shall determine and
report in writing to Buyer and Sellers' Representative as to the resolution of
all disputed matters submitted to the Independent Accountants and the effect of
such determinations on the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the Preliminary
Post-Closing Adjustment within twenty (20) days after such submission or such
longer period as the Independent Accountants may reasonably require, and such
determinations shall be final, binding and conclusive as to Buyer, Sellers, and
their respective Affiliates. The fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accountants shall be shared equally by Buyer on the one hand, and Sellers,
collectively, on the other hand.

         2.5.4 Pre-Closing Taxes Schedule. Within forty-five (45) days after the
Closing, the Sellers shall cause the Sellers' Representative to prepare and
deliver to Buyer Schedule 2.5.4 which shall set forth the amount of Taxes with
respect to income that are unpaid and payable by the Company or that are
overpaid and refundable to the Company (solely to the extent such overpayment
and refund are not attributable to the Tax Benefits), for Tax periods through
and

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

including the Closing Date including (on a pro rata basis) any such periods
beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (the
"Pre-Closing Taxes"). The Buyer shall review Schedule 2.5.4 and, if Buyer does
not object to the calculations set forth on Schedule 2.5.4 within thirty (30)
days of its receipt thereof, the Pre-Closing Taxes shall be either paid to the
Buyer by the Sellers or paid to the Sellers' Representative for the benefit of
the Sellers, as the case may be, as set forth in Section 2.5.6(b). If the Buyer
files a timely objection to the Sellers' preparation of Schedule 2.5.4 and the
amount of the Pre-Closing Taxes, specifying the changes and adjustments which
Buyer claims are required to Schedule 2.5.4 and to the amount of the Pre-Closing
Taxes, and Buyer and Sellers' Representative are unable otherwise to resolve
such dispute within fifteen (15) days after Buyer's delivery of such notice of
objection, then any such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the provisions of
Section 2.5.3 hereof. Buyer shall cause the books and records of the Company to
be made available during normal business hours to Sellers' Representatives and
its accountants, attorneys and other representatives to facilitate the
calculation of the Pre-Closing Taxes, and, upon reasonable prior request shall
cause the necessary personnel of the Company to assist in the calculation of the
Pre-Closing Taxes.

         2.5.5 Final Balance Sheet and Adjustment The Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment shall become the
"Final Closing Balance Sheet" and the "Final Post-Closing Adjustment,"
respectively, and as such shall become final, binding and conclusive upon Buyer,
Sellers and their respective Affiliates for all purposes of this Agreement, upon
the earliest to occur of the following:

               (i) the mutual acceptance by Buyer and Sellers' Representative of
         the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Post-Closing
         Adjustment, respectively, with such changes or adjustments thereto, if
         any, as may be proposed by Sellers' Representative and consented to by
         Buyer;

               (ii) the expiration of thirty (30) days after Sellers'
         Representative's receipt of the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and
         the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment, respectively, without timely
         objection thereto by Sellers' Representative in accordance with Section
         2.5.2; or

               (iii) the delivery to Buyer and Sellers' Representative by the
         Independent Accountants of the report of their determination of all
         disputed matters submitted to them pursuant to Section 2.5.3.

         2.5.6 Adjustment of Purchase Price.

         (a) If the Closing Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance
     with this Section 2.5, is greater than the Working Capital Target, then the
     Buyer shall pay the amount of such difference to Sellers' Representative
     for the benefit of the Sellers by means of a wire transfer of immediately
     available funds to the Sellers' Account, and if less than the Working
     Capital Target, Sellers, in accordance with the allocations set forth on
     Schedule 2.6, shall pay the amount of such difference to the Buyer by means
     of a wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
     by Buyer. The Final Post-Closing Adjustment, if any, shall be due and
     payable pursuant to this Section 2.5.6 no later than ten (10) days after
     the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

     Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment become the Final Closing Balance Sheet
     and the Final Post-Closing Adjustment, respectively, pursuant to Section
     2.5.5.

         (b) If Schedule 2.5.4 as determined in accordance with the procedures
     set forth in Section 2.5.4 shows that Pre-Closing Taxes are payable to the
     Tax authorities, then the Sellers' Representative, on behalf of the
     Sellers, shall pay such amount of Pre-Closing Taxes to Buyer by means of a
     wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
     Buyer. If Schedule 2.5.4 as determined in accordance with the procedures
     set forth in Section 2.5.4 shows that the Company is entitled to a tax
     refund in the amount of the Pre-Closing Taxes, then Buyer shall pay the
     amount of such Pre-Closing Taxes to Sellers' Representative for the benefit
     of the Seller by means of a wire transfer of immediately available funds to
     the Sellers' Account. Pre-Closing Taxes, if any, shall be due and payable
     pursuant to this Section 2.5.6(b) no later than ten (10) days after
     Schedule 2.5.4 is finalized and agreed to pursuant to Section 2.5.4.

     2.6 Allocation of Purchase Price. Payment by Buyer of the Purchase Price
into the Sellers' Account shall constitute payment by Buyer to each Seller and
satisfaction of Buyer's obligation to pay such amount hereunder, and Sellers'
Representative shall be solely responsible for allocating and distributing to

     4.12 Real and Personal Properties.

         (a) Schedule 4.12(a) identifies (i) all of the real property owned by
     the Company (collectively, the "Owned Real Property"), and (ii) all of the
     real property demised by leases or subleases (collectively, the "Leases")
     to the Company (collectively, the "Leased Real Property," and together with
     the Owned Real Property, the "Real Property"). The Real Property comprises
     all material real property interests used in the conduct of the business
     and operations of the Company as now conducted.

         (b) The Leases are in full force and effect, and the Company holds a
     valid and existing leasehold interest under each of the Leases for the
     terms set forth therein, respectively. The Company is not in default under
     any Lease, and, To Sellers' Knowledge, no events have occurred and no
     circumstances exist which, if unremedied, and whether with or without
     notice or the passage of time or both, would result in such a default,
     except in each case for such defaults as would not have a Material Adverse
     Effect. Sellers have made available to Buyer a complete and accurate copy
     of each of the Leases, including all amendments thereto.

         (c) The Company owns, with good, valid, legal and marketable title,
     each parcel of Owned Real Property, and the Company owns each of the items
     of tangible personal property reflected on the Acquisition Balance Sheet or
     acquired thereafter (except for assets reflected thereon or acquired
     thereafter that have been disposed of since the date of the Acquisition
     Balance Sheet), free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens identified or
     described on Schedule 4.12(c), and except for Permitted Liens.

         (d) The Real Property is suitable for its present use.

         (e) The Personal Property is in good operating condition normal wear
     and tear excepted and, together with the intangible assets of the Company,
     is sufficient for the operation of the Company's business, in all material
     respects, as currently conducted by the Company.

         (f) Except for the leases indicated on Schedule 4.12(f), no Person,
     other than the Company, owns or primarily utilizes any material equipment
     of the Company.

     4.13 Accounts Receivable. The accounts receivable reflected on the
Acquisition Balance Sheet and accounts receivable arising after the date of the
Acquisition Balance Sheet and reflected on the books and records of the Company
represent valid obligations arising from sales actually made or services
actually performed. The accounts receivable reflected on the Acquisition Balance
Sheet are stated thereon in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, and which
include allowances for doubtful accounts. To Sellers' Knowledge, such accounts
receivable are subject to no valid contest, claim or right of setoff other than
returns and discounts in the ordinary course of business and all of such
accounts receivable relate solely to sales of goods and services to customers of
the Company, none of whom are Affiliates of the Company. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, Sellers make no representation or warranty
with regard to the collectibility of any account or accounts receivable.

                                      -14-

     4.14 Inventories. The inventories of raw materials, work-in-process and
finished goods of the Company reflected on the Acquisition Balance Sheet are
stated thereon in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, and which include
reserves for obsolete, slow-moving or below-standard-quality items.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Sellers make no
representation or warranty with regard to the salability of any inventory. The
inventories do not consist of any item held on consignment and the inventories
are owned free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens.

     4.15 Intellectual Properties. Schedule 4.15(a) sets forth a complete list
of all issued patents, registered trademarks, service marks, trade names,
copyrights and any applications for any of the foregoing that are owned by, or
are licensed to, the Company and that are used by the Company in the conduct of
its business (collectively, "Intellectual Properties"). The Company has not
received any written notice alleging that the Intellectual Properties infringe
or violate any intellectual properties of any third party. To Sellers'
Knowledge, the Company's Intellectual Property is not being infringed upon or
violated in any material respect by any third party.

         Section 4.16 with any shareholder, officer or director of the Company,
         or any Affiliate of any such Person.

The Company has made available to Buyer correct and complete copies of each
contract identified on Schedule 4.16, including amendments thereto
(collectively, the "Material Contracts"). The Company has performed all
obligations (including payment) required to be performed by it pursuant to such
contracts except where the failure so to perform does not, or, To Sellers'
Knowledge, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. In addition, no such breach results, or, To Sellers' Knowledge, would be
reasonably be expected to result in payments to cure of $100,000 or more, and,
To Sellers' Knowledge, there is no existing or threatened default under or
violation of any of such contracts by any other party thereto. The Company has
not released any of its material rights under any Material Contracts.

     4.17 Litigation. There are no actions, suits at law or in equity,

Sellers' Knowledge, could not reasonably be expected to result in payment
involving individually or in the aggregate in excess of $100,000 nor To Sellers'
Knowledge, are any such product warranty claims threatened against the Company.
The Company has no material liability with respect to repair of products sold
prior to Closing.

         (b) Except for products destroyed in the field and credits issued for
returned products as set forth in the aggregate on Schedule 4.18(b) and except
for normal replacement of products, each product the Company manufactured, sold,
leased or delivered during the past three (3) years has been in conformity in
all material respects with all applicable contractual commitments, regulatory
requirements and all express and implied warranties. No product of the

                                      -16-

Company manufactured, sold, leased or delivered is subject to any guaranty,
warranty or other indemnity beyond the terms and conditions of sale and lease as
established from time to time by each customer. Schedule 4.18(c) sets forth

products of the Company (containing any guaranty, warranty and indemnity

be paid by Sellers.

to terminate its relationship with the Company.

     4.21 Absence of Unlawful Payments. No customer or supplier has requested
of, or received from, the Sellers or the Company, in exchange for the promise of
conducting, or continuing to conduct, business with the Company, any payment,
favor, or arrangement that violates any Law or policy of the Company or, To
Sellers' Knowledge, of such customer or supplier.

     4.22 Scope of Insurance Coverage, Good Standing of Policies and Absence of
Uninsured Claims. Schedule 4.22 contains an accurate and complete list of all
insurance policies owned, held by or applicable to the Company (or its assets or
business), and Sellers have heretofore delivered to Buyer a true and complete

Company or otherwise in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby and,
if made, such representation or warranty may not be relied upon as having been
authorized by Sellers and shall not be deemed to have been made by Sellers.

contained in this Article 5 are true and correct.

     5.1 Organization; Authorization. Buyer is a limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Buyer has all requisite limited liability company power and authority
to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and each other agreement,
instrument and document to be executed and delivered by or on behalf of Buyer in
connection herewith.

     5.2 Execution and Delivery; Enforceability. This Agreement has been, and
each other document, instrument or agreement to be executed and delivered by
Buyer in connection herewith will upon such delivery be, duly executed and
delivered by Buyer and constitutes, or will upon such delivery constitute, the
legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws of general application
affecting enforcement of creditors' rights or by principles of equity.

     5.3 Governmental Authorities; Consents. Except for the applicable
requirements of the HSR Act, Buyer is not required to submit any notice, report
or other filing with any governmental authority in connection with Buyer's
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any other document,
instrument or agreement to be executed and delivered by Buyer in connection
herewith, and such execution, delivery and performance will not violate any Law
by which Buyer is bound. Except for the applicable provisions of the HSR Act, no
consent, approval or authorization of any governmental authority or any other
Person is required to be obtained by Buyer in connection with Buyer's execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement or any other document, instrument or
agreement to be executed and delivered by Buyer in connection herewith.

     5.4 Brokerage. Except for the fees payable to Heartland Industrial
Partners, L.P., no Person is or will become entitled, by reason of any agreement
or arrangement entered into or made by or on behalf of Buyer, to receive any
commission, brokerage, finder's fee or other similar compensation in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     5.5 Investment Intent; Restricted Securities. Buyer is acquiring the Shares
solely for Buyer's own account, for investment purposes only, and not with a
view to, or with any present intention of, reselling or otherwise distributing
the Shares or dividing its participation herein with others. Buyer understands
and acknowledges that (a) none of the Shares have been registered or qualified
under the 1933 Act, or under any securities Laws of any state of the United
States or other jurisdiction, in reliance upon specific exemptions thereunder
for transactions not involving

                                      -18-
<PAGE>

any public offering; (b) all of the Shares constitute "restricted securities" as
defined in Rule 144 under the 1933 Act; (c) none of the Shares are traded or
tradable on any securities exchange or over-the-counter; and (d) none of the
Shares may be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of unless a registration
statement under the 1933 Act with respect to such Shares and qualification in
accordance with any applicable state securities Laws becomes effective or unless
such registration and qualification is inapplicable, or an exemption therefrom
is available. Buyer will refrain from transferring or otherwise disposing of any
of the Shares acquired hereunder or any interest therein in any manner that may
cause any Seller to be in violation of the 1933 Act or any applicable state
securities Laws.

Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     5.7 No Known Inaccuracies or Breaches. To Buyer's Knowledge, as of the date

an inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation and warranty of Sellers
contained in this Agreement that, based solely on the extent of Buyer's
Knowledge as of the date of this Agreement, is or would have been sufficient or
could reasonably be expected to be sufficient to serve as the basis for a valid
claim for indemnity by Buyer against Sellers pursuant to Section 9.1 of the
Agreement.

                       ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

  8.1 Covenants.

     8.1.1 Publicity. Any disclosures or announcements relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby will be made only as may be
agreed upon by Sellers' Representative and Buyer, or as may be required by Law
or by any governmental authority or regulatory authority.

     8.1.2 Expenses. Buyer shall pay all fees and expenses incident to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement which are incurred by Buyer or its
representatives or are otherwise expressly allocated to Buyer hereunder, and
Sellers shall pay all fees and expenses incident to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement which are incurred by Sellers or the Company or
their representatives or are otherwise expressly allocated to Sellers or the
Company hereunder. No such expenses shall be accrued on the books of the Company
as of the Closing.

     8.1.3 No Assignments. No assignment of any part of this Agreement or any
right or obligation hereunder may be made by any party hereto without the prior
written consent of all other parties hereto, and any attempted assignment
without such consent shall be void and of no force or effect; provided, however,
that nothing shall prevent Buyer from assigning its right to purchase the Shares
to one or more of its wholly owned subsidiaries, but without relieving Buyer
from its obligations hereunder. .

     8.1.4 Access by Sellers. Buyer shall, for a period of five (5) years after
the Closing Date, during normal business hours, provide Sellers' Representative
and its designees with such access to the books and records of the Company and
to the Real Property of the Company as may reasonably be requested by Sellers'
Representative, who shall be entitled, at its expense, to make inspections of
the Real Property and extracts and copies of the books and records of the
Company, to permit Sellers' Representative to take all necessary or desirable
action required (i) in connection with any matters pertaining to Taxes
(including, without limitation, the preparation and filing of any Tax Return)
with respect to Sellers and (ii) to achieve the Act 2 release. Buyer agrees that
it shall not, during such 5-year period, destroy or cause or permit to be
destroyed any material books or records pertaining to Taxes or the Act 2 release
without first obtaining the consent of Sellers' Representative (or providing to
Sellers' Representative notice of such intent and a reasonable opportunity to
copy such books or records at least thirty (30) days prior to such destruction).

     8.1.5 Continuation of Indemnification. Buyer agrees that after the Closing,
Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to continue to, indemnify and hold
harmless each of the

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

Company's present and former directors, officers, employees and agents, in their
capacities as such, from and against all damages, costs and expenses actually
incurred or suffered in connection with any threatened or pending action, suit
or proceeding at law or in equity by any Person or any arbitration or
administrative or other proceeding relating to the business of the Company or
the status of such individual as a director, officer, employee or agent prior to
the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable Law. Buyer shall
retain or include in the Articles or Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws or
Code of Regulations of the Company any indemnification provision or provisions,
including provisions respecting the advancement of expenses, in effect on the
Closing Date for the benefit of the Company's officers, directors, employees and
agents, and shall not thereafter amend the same (except to the extent that such
amendment preserves, increases or broadens the indemnification or other rights
theretofore available to such officers, directors employees and agents) provided
that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time
to time under applicable Law. Buyer shall cause the persons serving as officers
and directors of the Company immediately prior to the Closing to be covered for
a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date by the directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy or extended discovery insurance maintained
by the Company (provided that Buyer or the Company may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts and which contain terms and
conditions that are, when taken as a whole, not less advantageous in any
material respect to such directors and officers of the Company than the terms
and conditions of such existing policy) with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing Date which were committed by such officers and
directors in their capacity as such; provided, however, that the Company shall
not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the
extent such premiums exceed 200% of the annual premiums paid as of the date
hereof by the Company for such insurance (the "Current Premium"). If such
premium for such insurance would at any time exceed 200% of the Current Premium,
then the Company shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in
the Company's good faith determination, provide the maximum dollar loss coverage
available at an annual premium equal to 200% of the Current Premium. If the
Company merges into, consolidates with or transfers all or substantially all of
its assets to another Person, then and in each such case, Buyer shall make and
shall cause the Company to make proper provision so that the surviving or
resulting corporation or the transferee in such transaction shall assume the
obligations of Buyer and the Company under this Section 8.1.5. This Section
8.1.5 shall survive the Closing and continue for a period of six (6) years
(except that the foregoing provision regarding Directors and Officers Liability
Insurance shall apply for the three-year period applicable thereto) and is
intended to benefit each director, officer, agent or employee who held such
capacity immediately prior to the Closing and is either a party to an
indemnification agreement with the Company or now or hereafter is entitled to
indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to any provisions contained
in the Articles or Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or Code of
Regulations as of the date hereof.

     8.1.6 Sellers' Representative. Sellers hereby designate the Sellers'
Representative to execute any and all instruments or other documents on behalf
of Sellers, and to do any and all other acts or things on behalf of Sellers,
which the Sellers' Representative may deem necessary or advisable, or which may
be required pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, in connection with the

<PAGE>

(i) agree with Buyer with respect to any matter or thing required or deemed
necessary by Sellers' Representative in connection with the provisions of this
Agreement calling for the agreement of Sellers, give and receive notices on
behalf of all Sellers, and act on behalf of Sellers in connection with any
matter as to which Sellers are or may be obligated under this Agreement, all in
the absolute discretion of Sellers' Representative, (ii) in general, do all
things and perform all acts, including without limitation executing and
delivering all agreements, certificates, receipts, consents, elections,
instructions, and other instruments or documents contemplated by, or deemed by
Sellers' Representative to be necessary or advisable in connection with, this
Agreement, and (iii) take all actions necessary or desirable in connection with
the defense and/or settlement of any indemnification claims pursuant to Article
9 and performance of obligations under Article 2, including to withhold funds
for satisfaction of post-Closing liabilities. Sellers shall cooperate with
Sellers' Representative and any accountants, attorneys or other agents whom it
may retain to assist in carrying out its duties hereunder. All decisions by
Sellers' Representative shall be binding upon all Sellers, and no Seller shall
have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.
Sellers' Representative may communicate with any Seller or any other Person
concerning his responsibilities hereunder, but it is not required to do so.
Sellers' Representative has a duty to serve in good faith the interests of
Sellers and to perform its designated role under this Agreement, but Sellers'
Representative shall have no financial liability whatsoever to any Person
relating to its service hereunder (including any action taken or omitted to be
taken), except that it shall be liable for harm which it directly causes by an
act of willful misconduct. Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers'
Representative against any loss, expense (including reasonable attorney's fees)
or other liability arising out of its service as Sellers' Representative under
this Agreement, other than for harm directly caused by an act of willful
misconduct. Sellers' Representative may resign at any time by notifying in
writing Buyer and Sellers.

     8.1.7 Section 338 Election. Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the
Company to make an election under Section 338 of the Code (or any corresponding
election under state or local Laws) with respect to the purchase and sale
contemplated hereunder

     8.1.8 Return of Tax Benefits; Section 280G Indemnity. In the event that
payment in respect of the Option Spread or the transaction bonuses referred to
in Section 2.2(b), either alone or together with any other payment or benefit
(including, without limitation, accelerated vesting or payments of any benefits)
results in "excess parachute payments" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code),
then, to the extent thereof, (i) Buyer shall not be obligated to make any
payment in respect of the Tax Benefits, (ii) Sellers shall promptly return to
Buyer any Tax Benefit payment made to Sellers by Buyer, and (iii) Seller shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer from any Loss resulting from or
arising out of the "excess parachute payments," including, without limitation,
any gross-up obligation.

         8.1.9 Tax Matters.

         (a) Except to the extent provided in Sections 2.5.4 and 2.5.6(b) each
     of the Sellers agrees to indemnify the Buyer from and against Losses the
     Buyer may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature
     of or caused by any liability of the Company for (x) Taxes of the Company,
     its predecessors or former subsidiaries with respect to any Tax year or
     portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date and (y)

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

     the unpaid Taxes of any Person (other than the Company its predecessors or
     former subsidiaries) under Treasury Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
     provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
     contract or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
     herein, the Sellers' obligation to indemnify Buyer from and against Losses
     as set forth this Section 8.1.9(a) shall be subject to the limitations set
     forth in Section 9.2 of this Agreement.

         (b) Buyer, the Company and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the
     extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
     filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this section and any audit, litigation or
     other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
     retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
     information (including historical Tax Returns) which are reasonably
     relevant to any such filing of Tax Returns, audit, litigation or other
     proceeding and the Buyer shall cause the Company to make its employees
     reasonably available to provide additional information and explanation of
     any material provided hereunder. The Company and Sellers agree (A) to
     retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
     Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
     until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
     notified by Buyer or Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the respective
     taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered
     into with any taxing authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable
     written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such
     books and records and, if the other party so requests, the Company or
     Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession
     of such books and records. The parties agree that the obligations of
     Sellers pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not apply to each Seller's
     personal Tax records. Buyer and Sellers further agree, upon request, to use
     their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
     governmental authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
     reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not
     limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

         (c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
     other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
     in connection this Agreement shall be paid by Sellers when due, and Sellers
     will, at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
     documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use,
     stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and , if required by
     applicable law, Buyer will, and will cause its affiliates to, join in the
     execution of any such Tax Returns or other documentation.

         8.1.10 Assistance. Upon the reasonable request of Buyer, Sellers'
Representative shall, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the
Company's historical auditors to, during normal business hours, assist Buyer, at
Buyer's sole expense, in the preparation of any historical financial statements
of the Company which the Buyer may be required to file by applicable Law or as
Buyer may otherwise reasonably require.

         8.1.11 Repayment of Cash. If there are any cash or cash equivalents at
the Company (or held on behalf of the Company) as of the Closing Date which have
not otherwise been transferred or credited to the Sellers, including any amounts
remaining in any lockbox

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

accounts of the Company as of the Closing Date, then Buyer shall pay over such
amounts to Sellers' Account within five (5) business days of the Buyer's
discovery thereof (solely to the extent such amounts do not constitute cash
proceeds from accounts included in the current assets in the calculation of
Closing Working Capital.

                                   ARTICLE 9
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     9.1 Indemnification of Buyer. From and after the Closing, and subject to
Sections 9.2 and 9.5, each Seller shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify
Buyer and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents
(collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees"), against and hold the Buyer Indemnitees
harmless from:

         (a) any Losses based upon, arising out of or caused by any inaccuracy
     in, or breach of, any of the representations and warranties made by such
     Seller in Article 3 or by Sellers in Article 4;

         (b) any Losses based upon, arising out of or caused by any breach or
     nonperformance of any covenant or obligation made or incurred by Sellers or
     Sellers' Representative herein; and

         (c) (i) any Losses based upon, arising out of or caused by any
     Indebtedness of the Company incurred prior to Closing and not paid off at
     or prior to Closing, and (ii) prior to the date on which the Commonwealth
     of Pennsylvania issues the Act 2 release (the "Statutory Release Date"),
     any Losses based upon, arising out of or caused by the issues disclosed in
     the Risk Assessment Report dated December 20, 2002 (the "Risk Assessment
     Report") with respect to the Sheffield, PA facility.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Seller is responsible for only those Losses
under the preceding clause (a) based upon, arising out of or caused by any
inaccuracy in, or breach of, representations and warranties made by that Seller
in Article 3 and no Seller shall be obligated to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees for
Losses under the preceding clause (a) based upon, arising out of or caused by
any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation or warranty made by any
other Seller in Article 3. Any several indemnification responsibilities shall be
construed as being several to the extent of the relative economic ownership of
the Shares or Stock Options, as applicable, held by the relevant Seller at the
time of Closing in accordance with Schedule 2.6. Any Loss created by any act or
omission by Sellers' Representative hereunder shall be deemed to be a Loss that
is the several responsibility of the respective Sellers for purposes of this
Section 9.1. Sellers do not make and shall not be deemed to have made, nor is
Buyer relying upon, any representation, warranty or covenant other than those
representations, warranties and covenants that are expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

     9.2 Limitations on Indemnification of Buyer Indemnitees. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement, the indemnification of Buyer Indemnitees
provided for in this Agreement shall be subject to the limitations and
conditions set forth in this Section 9.2.

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

         (a) Except as set forth below, any claim by a Buyer Indemnitee for
     indemnification pursuant to clause (a) of Section 9.1 of this Agreement
     shall be required to be made by delivering notice to Sellers'
     Representative no later than the expiration of eighteen (18) months after
     the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any claim for
     indemnification based upon, resulting from or arising out of any inaccuracy
     in or breach of any representation or warranty made by any Seller in
     Article 3 or Section 4.2 [Capital Stock] or 4.4 [Noncontravention] may be
     made at any time; and (ii) any claim for indemnification based upon,
     resulting from or arising out of any inaccuracy in or breach of any
     representation or warranty contained in Section 4.7 [Taxes] may be made
     until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; and (iii)
     any claim for indemnification based upon, resulting from or arising out of
     any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty contained in
     Section 4.6(H) or 4.9 [Employee Plans and Other Compensation Arrangements]
     may be made for five (5) years after the Closing. In addition, any claim by
     a Buyer Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to clause (b) of Section
     9.1 of this Agreement shall be required to be made by delivering notice to
     Sellers' Representative no later than the expiration of eighteen (18)
     months after Buyer or senior officers of the Company become aware of any
     breach or nonperformance of any covenant or obligation made or incurred by
     Sellers or Sellers' Representative. Notwithstanding anything in this
     Section 9.2 to the contrary, the foregoing time limitations shall not
     preclude a Buyer Indemnitee from providing notice of a potential claim
     within the applicable time limitation before any Loss has been suffered if
     the facts or circumstances giving rise to the potential Loss have been
     identified with reasonable specificity in the notice and the notice shall
     not be deficient by reason of the foregoing.

         (b) Except for (i) claims for indemnification in respect of breaches of
     representations and warranties contained in Article 3 or Section 4.2
     [Capital Stock], 4.4 [Noncontravention] or 4.19 [Brokerage], or the
     covenants and agreements contained in Article 2 or any other covenants or
     agreements providing for the responsibility of the parties to pay any
     specific amounts (except for the Sellers' obligation to indemnify Buyer for
     Losses pursuant Section 8.1.9 which shall be subject to the limitations set
     forth in this Section 9.2(b)); or (ii) claims for indemnification under
     clause (c) of Section 9.1, Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
     indemnification under clause (a) or (b) of Section 9.1 until the aggregate
     amount of all of Buyer Indemnitees' claims for indemnification exceeds an
     amount equal to $250,000 (the "Indemnification Threshold") and thereafter
     Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification only for amounts in
     excess of the Indemnification Threshold.

         (c) Except for (i) claims for indemnification in respect of breaches of
     representations and warranties contained in Article 3 or Section 4.2
     [Capital Stock], 4.4 [Noncontravention] or 4.19 [Brokerage], or breaches of
     the covenants and agreements contained in Article 2 or willful breaches of
     any other covenants or agreements providing for the responsibility of the
     parties to pay specific amounts (except for Sellers' obligation to
     indemnify Buyer for Losses pursuant to Section 8.1.9 which shall be subject
     to the limitations set forth in this Section 9.2(c)); or (ii) for claims
     for indemnification under clause (c) of Section 9.1, the maximum
     indemnification amount to which Buyer Indemnitees may be entitled under
     clause (a) or (b) of Section 9.1 shall be an amount equal to five percent
     (5%) of the Enterprise Value (the "Aggregate Indemnification

                                      -26-
<PAGE>

     Limit"); provided, however, that (i) the maximum amount which Buyer
     Indemnitees may recover from any individual Seller with respect to any
     particular claim shall be limited to an amount equal to such Seller's pro
     rata share of such claim determined in accordance with the allocations set
     forth on Schedule 2.6 hereto, and (ii) the maximum amount which Buyer may
     recover from any individual Seller with respect to all claims asserted
     hereunder (in the aggregate) shall be limited to Seller's pro rata share of
     the Aggregate Indemnification Limit, determined in accordance with the
     allocations set forth on Schedule 2.6.

         (d) For purposes of this Agreement, Buyer shall not be entitled to
     "double recovery" with respect to any claim for indemnification. Buyer
     shall make the Company's books and records relating to such claims
     available to Sellers' Representative and make the Company's employees
     available for interviews and similar matters to assist Sellers'
     Representative with respect to such claims.

         (e) All claims for indemnification shall be limited to actual and
     incidental damages, liabilities, losses and expenses (including reasonable
     attorneys' and accounting fees) incurred without reference to any valuation
     methodology used by Buyer Indemnitees or Sellers. In the event that a Buyer
     Indemnitee makes a claim for indemnification which is determined by a court
     of competent jurisdiction to be without reasonable basis in law or fact,
     Buyer Indemnitee shall bear all reasonable costs and expenses (including
     court costs and reasonable attorneys' and accounting fees), incurred by
     Sellers in investigating and defending against such claim.

         (f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer Indemnitees
     shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Loss relating to a breach
     of Section 4.10 (other than any Loss indemnified pursuant to Section
     9.1(c)(ii) hereof or a willful or intentional misrepresentation or omission
     made To Sellers' Knowledge); it being understood that the Company shall
     look solely to the Pollution and Remediation Legal Liability Policy
     described on Schedule 4.22 for such matters.

     9.3 Indemnification of Sellers. From and after the Closing Date and subject
to Sections 9.4 and 9.5, Buyer shall indemnify Sellers against and hold Sellers
harmless from:

         (a) any Losses based upon, arising out of or caused by any inaccuracy
     in or breach of any of the representations and warranties made by Buyer in
     Article 5; and

         (b) any Losses based upon, arising out of or caused by any breach or
     nonperformance of any covenant or obligation made or incurred by Buyer
     herein.

Buyer does not make and shall not be deemed to have made, nor is any Seller
relying upon, any representation, warranty or covenant other than those
representations, warranties and covenants which are expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

     9.4 Limitations on Indemnification of Sellers. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement, the indemnification of Sellers provided for in
this Agreement shall be subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in
this Section 9.4.

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

         (a) Except as set forth below, any claim by Sellers for indemnification
     pursuant to this Agreement shall be required to be made by delivering
     notice to Buyer no later than the expiration of eighteen (18) months after
     the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim for
     indemnification resulting from or arising out of any inaccuracy in or
     breach of any representation or warranty made by any Buyer in Sections 5.2
     [Execution and Delivery; Enforceability], 5.3 [Governmental Authorities;
     Consents] or 5.5 [Investment Intent; Restricted Securities] may be made at
     any time.

         (b) Except for claims for indemnification in respect of breaches of
     representations and warranties contained in Sections 5.2 [Execution and
     Delivery; Enforceability], 5.3 [Governmental Authorities], 5.4 [Brokerage]
     or 5.5 [Investment Intent; Restricted Securities], or the covenants and
     agreements contained in Article 2 or otherwise to be performed hereunder,
     Sellers shall be entitled to indemnification only to the extent that the
     aggregate amount of all of Sellers' claims for indemnification exceeds an
     amount equal to the Indemnification Threshold.

         (c) Except for claims for indemnification in respect of breaches of
     representations and warranties contained in Sections 5.2 [Execution and
     Delivery; Enforceability], 5.3 [Governmental Authorities], 5.4 [Brokerage]
     or 5.5 [Investment Intent; Restricted Securities], or the covenants and
     agreements contained in Article 2 or otherwise to be performed hereunder,
     the maximum indemnification amount to which Sellers may be entitled shall
     be an amount equal to the Aggregate Indemnification Limit.

         (d) In the event that Sellers make a claim for indemnification which is
     determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be without reasonable
     basis in law or fact, Sellers shall bear all reasonable costs and expenses
     (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' and accounting fees),
     incurred by Buyer in investigating and defending against such claim.

     9.5 Procedures Relating to Indemnification.

         (a) Third-Party Claims. In order for a party (the "indemnitee") to be
entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of,
arising out of, or involving a claim or demand made by any Person against the
indemnitee (a "Third-Party Claim"), such indemnitee must notify the party from
whom indemnification hereunder is sought (the "indemnitor") in writing of the
Third-Party Claim, within thirty (30) days after such claim or demand is first
asserted or the indemnitee receives notice that such claim or demand is
reasonably likely to be asserted. Such notice shall state in reasonable detail
(to the extent known) the stated amount or stated estimated amount of such
claim, and shall identify the specific basis (or bases) for such claim,
including the representations, warranties or covenants alleged to have been
breached. Failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnitor shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the indemnitor shall not be
liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the indemnitee
failed to give such notice on a timely basis). Thereafter, the indemnitee shall
deliver to the indemnitor without undue delay copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers received by the indemnitee) relating to the
Third-Party Claim.

                                      -28-
<PAGE>

         If a Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnitee, the indemnitor
shall be entitled to participate, at its expense, in the defense thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the indemnitor irrevocably and unconditionally
admits to the indemnitee in writing its obligation to indemnify the indemnitee
therefor, the indemnitor may elect to assume and control the defense thereof
with counsel selected by the indemnitor and reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnitee. If the indemnitor assumes such defense, the indemnitee shall have
the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnitor, it being
understood that the indemnitor shall control such defense.

         If the indemnitor so assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, all
of the indemnified parties shall cooperate with the indemnitor in the defense or
prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include, at the expense of the
indemnitor, the retention and (upon the indemnitor's request) the provision to
the indemnitor of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such
Third-Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. If the indemnitor shall have assumed the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the indemnitee shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the indemnitor's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the
indemnitor shall have assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) the
indemnitee shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a
Third-Party Claim which the indemnitor may recommend and which by its terms
obligates the indemnitor to pay the full amount of the liability in connection
with such Third-Party Claim, and releases the indemnitee completely from any
liability in connection with such Third-Party Claim, provided there is no direct
financial impact on the indemnitee or its affiliates therefrom following such
agreement and (ii) the indemnitor shall not, without the written consent of the
indemnitee, enter into any settlement, compromise or discharge or consent to the
entry of any judgment which imposes any obligation or restriction upon the
indemnitee of an injunctive or other equitable nature.

         (b) Other Claims. In the event any indemnitee should have a claim
against any indemnitor under this Article 9 that does not involve a Third-Party
Claim, the indemnitee shall deliver notice of such claim to the indemnitor
reasonably promptly following discovery of any indemnifiable liability, loss,
damage or expense, or of facts or circumstances reasonably likely to result in
any such indemnifiable item, but in any event not later than the last date set
forth in Section 9.2 or 9.4, as the case may be, for making such claim, but
subject to the terms of such Sections. Such notice shall state in reasonable
detail (to the extent known) the amount or an estimated amount of such claim,
and shall specify the material facts and circumstances which form the basis (or
bases) for such claim, and shall further specify the representations, warranties
or covenants alleged to have been breached. The absence of all facts and
additional potential bases for a claim at the time notice is given shall not
preclude pursuit of a claim on such additional bases. Upon receipt of any such
notice, the indemnitor shall notify the indemnitee as to whether the indemnitor
accepts liability for any such liability, loss, damage or expense. If the
indemnitor disputes its liability with respect to such claim, as provided above,
the indemnitor and the indemnitee shall attempt to resolve such dispute in
accordance with the terms and provisions of Section 11.4.

                                      -29-

claims relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other
than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) shall be pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article 9. In furtherance of
the foregoing, Buyer and each Seller hereby waives on behalf of himself and all
other Persons who might claim by, through or under him, from and after the
Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of,
or causes of action arising from, fraud) which he or any such other Person may
have against Sellers, a Seller, or Buyer, as the case may be, arising under or
based upon any federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article 9).
