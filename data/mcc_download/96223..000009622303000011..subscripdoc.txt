         -------------------
the  meaning  of Rule  144(a)(3)  under  the  Securities  Act  (the  "Restricted
Securities"),  and will be transferable  only upon the satisfaction of the terms
and  conditions  set forth in (x) this  Section 8, (y) the  Registration  Rights
Agreement and (z) the  Company's  restated  certificate  of  incorporation  (the
"Charter").  Any transfer or  purported  transfer in violation of this Section 8

         -------------------
Agreement and the Charter,  prior to any transfer of any Restricted  Securities,

         --------------------
the  restrictions  on  transfer  set forth in this  Section 8, the  certificates
representing such securities will bear restrictive  legends in addition to those
required by the Charter in substantially the following form:

               "THE    SECURITIES    REPRESENTED   BY   THIS
               CERTIFICATE  HAVE NOT BEEN  REGISTERED  UNDER
               THE  SECURITIES  ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
               "SECURITIES  ACT"),  OR ANY STATE  SECURITIES
               LAW  AND   MAY  NOT  BE  SOLD  OR   OTHERWISE
               TRANSFERRED   EXCEPT   PURSUANT   TO  (A)  AN

     8.4 Termination of Restrictions. The restrictions imposed by this Section 8
         ---------------------------
upon the  transferability  of  Restricted  Securities  will  terminate as to any

pursuant to an effective  registration  statement  under the Securities  Act, or
pursuant to Rule 144 under the  Securities  Act or any other  exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to which the transferee
receives  securities that are not "restricted  securities" within the meaning of
that  term as  defined  in Rule  144(a)(3).  Whenever  any of such  restrictions
terminates as to any Restricted Securities,  the holder thereof will be entitled
to  receive  from  the  Company,  at the  Company's  expense,  new  certificates
representing  such  Securities,  without  the  restrictive  legend  set forth in
Section 8.3,  but  containing  any other legend  required by the Charter at that
time.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the restrictions on transferability  set
forth in the Charter  shall remain  unaffected  by any sale  referred to in this
Section.
