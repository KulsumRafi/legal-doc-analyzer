Party Investors and the Management Stockholders on a pro rata basis (based on the number
of shares of Registrable Securities owned by each such Stockholder), and second, the
securities, if any, being sold by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Management Stockholders (and any successor managers of the Company and its subsidiaries)

Parties to the extent that the managing underwriter (or, in the case of an offering that
is not underwritten, a nationally recognized investment banking firm) shall determine in
good faith and in writing (with a copy to each affected Person requesting registration of
Registrable Securities), that the participation of management would adversely affect the
marketability or offering price of the securities being sold in such registration, it
being understood that the Company will include in such registration that number of
shares of the Management Stockholders, if any, which can be sold in such offering

to be sold in such registration. In the event of any such determination under this
Section 1.5, the Company shall give the affected holders of Registrable Securities
notice of such determination and in lieu of the notice otherwise required under Sections
1.1 or 1.2, as the case may be. The Kelso Parties shall use their commercially

expressly for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary

otherwise expressly agreed to in writing by such holders, the only information furnished
or to be furnished to the Company by such holders in their capacities as selling
stockholders for use in any registration statement or prospectus relating to the
Registrable Securities or in any amendment, supplement or preliminary materials
associated therewith are statements specifically relating to (<U>a</U>) transactions between

its agreement referred to in the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 8.2.
Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of the Company or any such director, officer or controlling Person

paragraphs of this Section 8, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof

notice. In case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and to assume the defense
thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to the extent
that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and
after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to

state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by
the indemnified party and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information

securities of the Company pursuant to the Recapitalization Agreement and the Exchange
Agreements or pursuant to the exercise of options (which price, in any event, shall be
deemed to be equal to the Redemption Consideration (as defined in the Recapitalization
Agreement)), and (3) in the case of the Third Party Investors, deducting therefrom the
price paid by the Third Party Investors or its affiliates to acquire the equity
securities of the Company and (y) insofar as such net proceeds have been distributed by
any indemnifying party to its partners, stockholders or members, the amount of such
indemnifying party&#146;s contribution hereunder shall be limited to the net proceeds which
it actually recovers from its partners, stockholders or members based upon their
relative fault and that to the extent that such indemnifying party has not distributed
such net proceeds, the amount such indemnifying party&#146;s contribution hereunder shall be
limited by the percentage of such net proceeds which corresponds to the percentage equity
interests in such indemnifying party held by those of its partners, stockholders or
members who have been determined to be at fault. No party shall be liable for
