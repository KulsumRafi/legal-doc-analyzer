<B>NOW, THEREFORE</B>, in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:</FONT></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN=3>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>1.</B>  <U>Consent to Assignment</U>.  In the event that (i) BOC is in default under the Lease Agreement, the Steam Agreement or the BOC Flue Gas Sale Agreement and such default is not cured within the applicable grace period under such agreements, or (ii) BOC's credit rating with respect to its senior unsecured debt (not supported by third party credit enhancements), as published by the Standard &amp; Poor's Rating Group (a division of McGraw-Hill, Inc.) or Moody's Investor Services, Inc., is less than investment grade, BOC will assign the Lease Agreement and the Steam Agreement to Praxair and Praxair shall accept the assignment of BOC's rights and obligations thereunder and toll flue gas for BOC pursuant to the Tolling Agreement; provided that Praxair and BOC shall, promptly after such assignment, execute and deliver to NEA a written assignment and assumption agreement in the form attached hereto as <U>Exhibit A</U> (the "<U>Assignment</U>"), whereby Praxair expressly agrees to assume all rights and obligations under such documents.</FONT></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN=3>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>2.</B>  <U>Agreement of BOC and Praxair</U>.  Praxair and BOC agree that, upon assignment, NEA may treat and regard Praxair as the counterparty under each of the Lease Agreement and Steam Agreement. NEA shall have no liability to BOC for accepting performance from Praxair under the Lease Agreement and the Steam Agreement or for any payments made to Praxair. Any assignment by BOC to Praxair of BOC's rights and obligations under the Lease Agreement and the Steam Agreement shall not be effective until a fully executed copy of the Assignment is delivered to NEA.</FONT></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN=3>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<A NAME="_DV_C39"><B>3.  </B><U>Nullification or Invalidity of Agreements</U>.  In the event a federal or state agency or a court having jurisdiction over the matter nullifies, invalidates or finds the Tolling Agreement, the Steam Agreement, the BOC Flue Gas Sale Agreement, the Praxair Flue Gas Agreement or the Lease Agreement unlawful or unenforceable (each, a "Nullification Event"), then, within 20 days of receipt of written notice of such Nullification Event from Praxair and/or BOC, NEA or its operator-agent (other than BOC or Praxair) will resume operating the Facility and shall supply equal amounts of the Facility's output of finished carbon dioxide to BOC and Praxair for what would have been the remaining term of the Lease Agreement absent the Nullification Event, and BOC and Praxair shall accept any finished carbon dioxide so supplied. NEA agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to produce finished carbon dioxide in quantities and of a quality similar to those then prevailing under the Tolling Agreement at the time of the Nullification Event. Finished carbon dioxide supplied pursuant to this Section 3 shall be sold by NEA to Praxair and BOC at prices for each year equal to the amount that would be payable by BOC under the Lease Agreement, the Steam Agreement and the BOC Flue Gas Agreement and by Praxair under the Praxair Flue Gas Agreement for steam, power and flue gas at the operating efficiencies for power and steam as demonstrated by BOC in the twelve (12) months prior to the date of the Nullification Event, or if less than twelve months, during the time BOC was operating the Facility, plus all reasonable operation and maintenance expenses for the Facility incurred in connection with NEA's operation of the Facility over and above those covered under the Lease Agreement, the Steam Agreement, the BOC Flue Gas Agreement or the Praxair Flue Gas Agreement. The Parties shall negotiate written agreements for the sale of finished carbon dioxide incorporating these terms and agree to conform such agreements to those prevailing quality assurance and quality controls in the Steam Agreement, Lease Agreement, Tolling Agreement, BOC Flue Gas Agreement and Praxair Flue Gas Agreement, as existing at the time of the Nullification Event, as soon as possible after the notice of the Nullification Event is given. Should such a Nullification Event occur, BOC agrees to make available its employees located at the Facility to NEA, at cost, for a period of up to three months, in order to continue uninterrupted operation of the Facility pending assumption of operations by NEA's or NEA's operator-agent's personnel.</A></FONT></TD>
