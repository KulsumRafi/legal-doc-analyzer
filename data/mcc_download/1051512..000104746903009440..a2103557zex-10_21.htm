<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Guaranty, dated as of October&nbsp;22, 2002 is made by Telephone and Data Systems,&nbsp;Inc. (the "Guarantor"), in favor of Societe Generale (the
"Counterparty"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guaranty.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to induce the Counterparty to enter into the variable prepaid forward transactions, the
terms and conditions of which are set forth in the confirmations (the "Confirmations"; the transactions thereby confirmed, the "Transactions") dated as of October&nbsp;22, 2002, October&nbsp;29,
2002, November&nbsp;19, 2002 and December&nbsp;2, 2002 between Counterparty and the Guarantor's wholly-owned subsidiary, TDSI Corporation ("Primary Obligor"), the Guarantor absolutely and
unconditionally guarantees to the Counterparty, its successors and permitted assigns, the prompt payment when due of the Guaranteed Obligations, as defined below. Except as expressly provided herein,
such guarantee shall be without regard to any counterclaim, set-off, deduction or defense of any kind which Primary Obligor or the Guarantor may have or assert against Counterparty, and
without abatement, suspension, deferment or diminution on account of any event or condition whatsoever; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that Guarantor's obligations
under this Guaranty shall be subject to Primary Obligor's rights to set-off as provided in the Agreement, as defined below. "Guaranteed Obligations" shall mean the sum of (i)&nbsp;any
and all floating amount payment obligations of Primary Obligor under the Confirmations and (ii)&nbsp;the difference between (a)&nbsp;all other amounts payable by Primary Obligor under the
Agreement with respect to the Transactions, whether due or to become due, secured or unsecured, joint or several (together with the floating rate payment obligations described in (i)&nbsp;above, the
"Primary Obligations") together with any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Counterparty in enforcing Counterparty's rights under this Guaranty less
(b)&nbsp;the value of the Collateral; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided however </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>that in the event that the Counterparty uses its reasonable best efforts to realize the value
of the Collateral by setoff, sale, acceptance or any other means available to Counterparty under the Agreement and is unable to realize the full value of the Collateral within 30&nbsp;days after the
date on which Counterparty first becomes able to exercise its rights under Paragraph&nbsp;8(a) of the Credit Support Annex, as defined below, "Guaranteed Obligations" shall mean the difference
between (a)&nbsp;the Primary Obligations together with any and all expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Counterparty in enforcing Counterparty's rights under this
Guaranty less (b)&nbsp;the value of the Collateral the Counterparty is able to realize within such 30&nbsp;days, if any. The Primary Obligations shall include interest on overdue payments owed
pursuant to the Agreement, as provided in Section&nbsp;2(e) and Section&nbsp;6(d)(ii)&nbsp;of the Master Agreement at the rates provided for therein. The term "Master Agreement" means the ISDA
Master Agreement dated the date hereof between Counterparty and Primary Obligor; the term "Credit Support Annex" means the Credit Support Annex supplementing and forming part of the Master Agreement;
and the term "Agreement" means the Master Agreement,
the Credit Support Annex and the Confirmations, taken together as composing one and the same contract. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature of Guaranty.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. Any amounts or deliveries
that would be owed or due by Primary Obligor to the Counterparty under the Agreement but are unenforceable or not allowable against Primary Obligor because Primary Obligor is the subject of a
bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar case or proceeding, shall nonetheless be deemed owed or due for the purposes of this Guaranty. Subject to the requirement in paragraph&nbsp;1 of
this Guaranty that Counterparty use its reasonable best efforts to collect against the Collateral, the Counterparty shall not be obligated, as a condition precedent to performance by the Guarantor
hereunder, to file any claim relating to the Primary Obligations in the event that Primary Obligor becomes subject to a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar case or proceeding, and the
failure of the Counterparty to file&nbsp;a claim shall not affect the Guarantor's obligations hereunder. This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any
time any payment to the Counterparty by Primary Obligor on account of any Obligation is returned to Primary Obligor or is rescinded upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of
Primary Obligor or otherwise, all as though such payment has not been made. </FONT></P>
