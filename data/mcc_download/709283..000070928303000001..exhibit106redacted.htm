<p><a name="_DV_M63"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Section 4.</b>&nbsp; <u>Force Majeure</u></p>

<p><a name="_DV_M64"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither party shall be in default under this Agreement for failure or delay in performance of its obligations under this Agreement, if caused by an act of God or public enemy, war,

gives the other party written notice thereof promptly upon discovery thereof and uses reasonable efforts to cure or mitigate the delay or failure to perform.</p>

been assigned or otherwise conveyed to it, which information has commercial value and is not in the public domain. The proprietary information of each party will be and remain the sole property of such party and its assigns. Each party shall use the same degree of
care that it normally uses to protect its own proprietary information to prevent the disclosure to third parties of information that has been identified as proprietary by written notice to such party from the other party. Neither party shall make any use of the
information of the other which has been identified as proprietary except as contemplated or required by the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section shall not apply to any information that a party can demonstrate: (a) was, at the time of
