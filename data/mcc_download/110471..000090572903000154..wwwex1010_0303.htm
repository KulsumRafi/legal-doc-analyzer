<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SUPPLEMENTAL DIRECTOR'S FEE AGREEMENT</B></P>
<BR>

<P>THIS SUPPLEMENTAL DIRECTOR'S FEE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made as of April 27, 1993 by and between PHILLIP D. MATTHEWS, an individual ("Director"), and WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>R E C I T A L S:</B></P>

<P>Director is an independent, non-employee director of the Company. Due to his unique and substantial experience in business, the Company desires that Director serve as Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors for a minimum period of one year. In connection with such service, the Company desires that Director commit a substantial amount of his time, efforts and attention to the affairs of the Company and make himself regularly available for consultation with the executive officers of the Company. In performing such services, the Company recognizes and anticipates that Director may be required to forego other business opportunities and reduce or eliminate his participation in other ventures with which he is currently involved. Director is willing and desires to serve as Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors on the terms set forth in this Agreement.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>ACCORDINGLY, THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:</B></P>

<P>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Service as Chairman. Director agrees to serve as Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors during the term of this Agreement. Director will serve in such position as an officer of the Board of Directors and not as an executive officer or employee of the Company. In connection with such service, Director agrees to assist with and supervise the overall management of the Company as the Chairman of the Board, and to perform such other services as the Board of Directors may reasonably request. Director agrees to devote such amounts of his time, efforts and attention to the affairs of the Company as may be required in his reasonable judgment to perform such services to the satisfaction of the Company's Board of Directors. Director agrees to make himself available on a regular basis for consultation with the Company's executive officers. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall guarantee or require or compel the Company or the Board of Directors to retain Director in the position of Chairman of the Board or otherwise infringe upon the unfettered right of the Board of Directors to elect or appoint any other person to the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors.</P>

<P>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Term; Renewal. The term of this Agreement shall be for a period of one year, commencing on April 27, 1993 and ending on April 26, 1994. Unless the Company delivers written notice to the Director on or prior to April 1, 1994, or April 1 of any succeeding year during the term of this Agreement, of its intention not to renew the term of this Agreement for an additional one-year period, then this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for an additional one-year period on the same terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.</P>
