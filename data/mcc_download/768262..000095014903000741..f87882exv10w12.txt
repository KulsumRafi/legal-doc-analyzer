                                  INTRODUCTION

         1.1      ESTABLISHMENT OF PLAN. Sybase, Inc. established the Sybase,
Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ("Plan") effective as of January 1,

         1.2      PURPOSE OF PLAN. Sybase has established this Plan to provide
select executives and non-employee members of its Board of Directors with the
opportunity to defer the receipt of compensation. Sybase intends to maintain the
Plan primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select
group of management or highly compensated employees, within the meaning of ERISA
Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1). The Plan shall be interpreted in a
manner that comports with these intentions.

Participant to receive any benefit payable upon the death of a Participant.

                  (c)      The consummation of (i) a merger or consolidation of
Sybase with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which
would result in the voting securities of Sybase outstanding immediately prior
thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being
converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) at least fifty percent
(50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of Sybase
or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or

directorship) and attendance fees for Board and committee meetings during a Plan

for out-of-pocket travel expenses, or other amounts included in a Director's

employees who are members of a select group of management or highly compensated
employees (within the meaning of ERISA Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and
401(a)(1)). An employee's eligibility to participate in the Plan for a Plan Year
does not guarantee continued eligibility to participate in any future Plan Year.
In the event that an Eligible Employee transfers employment from one Employer to
another, his or her ability to continue to defer Compensation under Article 3 or
to be eligible for a discretionary employer contribution under Article 4 shall
be governed by such rules and procedures as established by the Committee in its

appreciation rights, severance payments following a formal termination of
employment, moving expenses, car or other special allowances, or other amounts
included in an Eligible Employee's taxable income that are not compensation for
employment services. An Eligible Employee's Compensation shall be determined
before taking into account any reduction in taxable income by salary deferral
contribution under Code Sections 125 or 401(k), or under this Plan.

         2.16     EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT means termination of employment with

Committee may change the Investment Funds at such times as it deems appropriate.

         2.23     PARTICIPANT means either (a) a current or former Eligible
Employee who has been designated by the Committee as eligible to participate in

         2.32     VALUATION DATE means the date on which the Investment Funds

                                   ARTICLE 3

                             ELECTIVE CONTRIBUTIONS

         3.1      PARTICIPATION. Subject to the terms of Section 3.3, an
Eligible Person may elect to defer the receipt of a portion of his or her
Employee Compensation or Director Compensation, as applicable, by completing a
deferred compensation agreement on such form and in such manner as prescribed by
the Committee.

                  (a)      ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. An Eligible Employee may elect to
defer Employee Compensation in accordance with this Section 3.1(a) under one or
both of two tiers, as follows:

                           (i)      TIER A. An Eligible Employee may elect to
defer a percentage of his or her base salary so that, when added to the Eligible
Employee's 401(k) and "catch-up" elections under the Sybase, Inc. 401(k) Plan,
the total percentage of base salary deferred under both plans does not exceed
seventy-five percent (75%). The deferral elections made under this Subsection
3.1(a)(i) must be made in whole percentages. Under a Tier A election, an
Eligible Employee's election to defer base salary under this Plan automatically
begins when an Eligible Employee reaches the Code Section 402(g) limit and, if
applicable, the Code Section 414(v) limit (as periodically indexed for
inflation), or is otherwise limited because of the Code limitations from making
pre-tax salary deferrals under the Sybase, Inc. 401(k) Plan.

                           (ii)     TIER B. In addition to, or in lieu of, a
Tier A election, an Eligible Employee may also elect to defer the receipt of
all, or any whole percentage or dollar amount, of any or all of his/her
incentive, bonus or commission compensation for the Plan Year, including a
percentage above a threshold amount (e.g., 25% of bonus in excess of $10,000).

                           (iii)    An Eligible Employee's election to defer
Employee Compensation under an available Tier is unrelated to, and shall not be
affected by, any election to defer Employee Compensation under another available
Tier. To the extent that an Eligible Employee elected to defer amounts under
Tiers 1, 2 or 3 under the Plan in effect prior to May 1,1998, such elections
shall continue in effect. Tier 1 and Tier 2 amounts shall be credited as Tier A
amounts. Tier 3 amounts shall be credited as Tier B amounts. For administrative
convenience only, the Committee may provide reports to

                                     page 5

<PAGE>

Eligible Employees reflecting balances under such old Tier names for past
contributions.

                           (b)      DIRECTORS. For each Plan Year, a Director
may elect to defer up to one hundred percent (100%) of his or her Director
Compensation under TIER C to an Elective Contribution Account. Deferral
elections must be made in whole percentages.

         3.2      ELECTION PROCEDURES. An Eligible Person who elects to defer
Compensation in accordance with Section 3.1 must do so in accordance with such
procedures as shall be established by the Committee including, where permitted
by applicable law, election by telephonic or other non-written means. Each such
election must specify the form and timing of distribution of such amounts in the
future, and such other matters specified by the Committee.

         3.3      TIMING OF ELECTIONS. In order to be effective, an election to
defer Compensation must be made before the Eligible Person has earned the right
to receive the Compensation to be deferred, as indicated below.

                  (a)      TIER A ELECTIONS. Tier A elections must be made
before the start of the Plan Year in which the Eligible Employee earns the base
salary, which he/she wishes to defer. At the discretion of the Committee, Tier A
elections may be made by newly-hired Eligible Employees for the Plan Year in
which they commence employment, provided (i) such elections are made within
thirty (30) days of their date of hire, and (ii) no Employee Compensation earned
for services performed prior to the making of such election shall be eligible
for contribution to the Plan.

                  (b)      TIER B ELECTIONS. Tier B elections must be made
before the start of the Plan Year in which the incentive, bonus and commission
payment(s) are earned by the Eligible Employee. At the discretion of the
Committee, Tier B elections for a Plan Year may be made during the Plan Year to
which the bonus and/or commissions relate (rather than before the beginning of
the Plan Year), provided that any elections made after the beginning of the Plan
Year shall apply only to bonuses and commissions: (1) which have not yet been
earned by the Eligible Employee and, (2) for which it is not possible to
determine whether any payment will be made or the amount of payment, and (3) for
which the Eligible Employee has not yet had the opportunity to make a deferral
election.

                  (c)      TIER C ELECTIONS. A Director must make his or her
election before the start of the Plan Year in which the Director earns the
Director Compensation that he/she wishes to defer. At the discretion of the
Committee, Tier C elections may be made by newly-elected Directors for the Plan
Year in which they commence service, provided that (i) such elections are made
within thirty (30) days of their date of election, and (ii) no Director
Compensation earned prior to the making of such election shall be eligible for
contribution to the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the 2003 Plan Year,
Directors may make their election to defer a specified percentage or amount of
their unearned 2003 Director Compensation up to thirty (30) days after the Plan
is initially approved to permit the participation of Directors, provided no
Director

                                     page 6

<PAGE>

Compensation earned prior to a Director's effective Plan election date shall be
eligible for contribution to the Plan.

                  (d)      EVERGREEN PROVISION. Unless otherwise required by
applicable law, an Eligible Person's elections under this Section 3.3 shall
remain in effect from year-to-year unless; (i) the Eligible Person elects to
change his or her election during the annual enrollment period, or (ii) the
Eligible Person elects during the annual enrollment period to terminate his or
her participation in the Plan during a future annual enrollment period.

                  (e)      COMMITTEE. The Committee may specify such deadlines
and advance notice requirements as it deems necessary to administer the Plan in
accordance with this Section 3.3.

         3.4      IRREVOCABLE ELECTIONS. Except as otherwise provided herein, an
Eligible Person's election under Section 3.1 is irrevocable and cannot be
amended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may request to revoke an
election under Section 3.1 in the event of a Hardship in accordance with Section
6.1.

                                   ARTICLE 4

                      DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS

         4.1      PARTICIPATION. An Employer may designate, in its sole
discretion, certain Eligible Employees to be eligible for a discretionary
employer contribution if certain target goals are met in such amount as shall be
determined by, and to be payable by, the Employer in accordance with the terms
of this Plan. The identity of the Eligible Employees, the amount of the
discretionary employer contribution and the target goals that must be reached in
order to earn such discretionary employer contribution (subject to any further
vesting period, as set forth in Section 4.2) shall be established by the
Employer in its sole discretion and communicated to each such Eligible Employee
prior to the time period during which the Eligible Employee will perform the
services towards the attainment of the target goals. In the event that an
Eligible Employee commences employment during a Plan Year for which a
discretionary employer contribution has already been announced and for which
target goals have already been set, the Employer may in its sole discretion
permit such Eligible Employee to be eligible for a pro rata portion of such
contribution otherwise payable for that Plan Year.

         4.2      VESTING. Provided that an Eligible Employee's target goals
have been met, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, each
discretionary employer contribution, and any earnings thereon (as described in
Section 5.5(b)), shall be subject to a further vesting schedule as determined by
the Committee, in its sole discretion. In the event that the Eligible Employee
voluntarily terminates employment with Sybase and all other Employers, or is
terminated from Sybase and all other Employers for cause (as defined in Section
6.3 below), he or she shall forfeit his or her right to receive any unvested
portion of such contributions, and any earnings thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event of a Change of Control (as defined in Section 2.4) or an
Eligible Employee's involuntary termination of employment other than for (as
defined in

                                     page 7

<PAGE>

Sybase's then-current Human Resources Policies and Procedures regarding
Termination of Employment), the Eligible Employee shall become immediately
vested as to one hundred percent (100%) of his/her discretionary employer
contributions for which the target goals have been met as of that date, and any
earnings thereon.

         4.3      CHANGE OF CONTROL. If an Eligible Employee's target goal for a
discretionary employer contribution is based solely or in part upon his or her
remaining employed until a future date, then upon a Change of Control occurring
prior to that future date, the Eligible Employee shall be deemed to have met his
or her target goal.

                                   ARTICLE 5

                          PARTICIPANT ACCOUNT BALANCES

         5.1      ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTS. The Committee shall establish and
maintain an Elective Contribution Account on behalf of each Eligible Person who
elects under Article 3 to defer the receipt of a portion of his or her
Compensation, and an Employer Contribution Account for each Eligible Employee
who is entitled to a discretionary employer contribution under Article 4.
Contributions and earnings shall be credited to such accounts in accordance with
the provisions of this article.

         5.2      BOOKKEEPING ACCOUNTS. Elective Contribution Accounts and
Employer Contribution Accounts shall be established primarily for bookkeeping
purposes and shall not restrict the operation of the Plan or require separate
earmarked assets for any account. The establishment of an Elective Contribution
Account or Employer Contribution Account shall not give any Participant the
right to receive any particular asset of Sybase or an Employer.

         5.3      CREDITING ELECTIVE CONTRIBUTIONS. The Committee shall credit
to each Elective Contribution Account the amount of any Compensation elected to
be deferred by the Participant in accordance with Section 3.1 as of the last day
of the quarter in which such Compensation would otherwise have been paid absent
such an election.

         5.4      CREDITING DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS The Committee
shall credit to an Eligible Employee's Employer Contribution Account the amount
of any discretionary employer contribution as of the last day of the quarter in
which the target goals for such contribution have been met by the Eligible
Employee, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.

         5.5      CREDITING INVESTMENT RESULTS.

                  (a)      Each Participant generally may direct the manner in
which his or her Elective Contribution Account shall be deemed invested in and
among the Investment Funds; provided, however, that each investment election
made by a Participant shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
Plan, be strictly subject to the consent of the Committee which, in its sole
discretion, may elect to honor or disregard the Participant's request and/or
have the Elective Contribution Account deemed invested in another manner. Such
deemed investment election shall be made

                                     page 8

<PAGE>

in accordance with such procedures as the Committee shall establish. The
investment authority shall remain at all times with the Committee. The selection
of Investment Funds by a Participant shall be for the sole purpose of
determining the rate of return to be credited to his or her Plan accounts and
shall not be treated or interpreted in any manner whatsoever as a requirement or
direction to actually invest assets in any Investment Fund or any other
investment media. Each Plan account shall be credited on each Valuation Date
with the Participant's allocable share of investment gains or losses of each
Investment Fund in which the account is hypothetically invested. For Eligible
Employees, the Committee shall adopt a protocol for allocating the deemed
investment gains and losses similar to that used in the Sybase, Inc. 401(k)
Plan.

                  (b)      As an Eligible Employee's discretionary employer
contributions vest, the Eligible Employee generally may direct the manner in
which his or her vested discretionary employer contributions shall be deemed
invested in and among the Investment Funds; provided, however, that each
investment election made by an Eligible Employee shall, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in the Plan, be strictly subject to the consent of the Committee
which, in its sole discretion, may elect to honor the Eligible Employee's
request or may elect to disregard the his/her hypothetical investment request
and have the discretionary employer contributions deemed invested in another
manner. Such deemed investment election shall be made in accordance with such
procedures as the Committee shall establish. The investment authority shall
remain at all times with the Committee. The selection of Investment Funds by an
Eligible Employee shall be for the sole purpose of determining the rate of
return to be credited to his or her Employer Contribution Account and shall not
be treated or interpreted in any manner whatsoever as a requirement or direction
to actually invest assets in any Investment Fund or any other investment media.
Each Eligible Employee's Employer Contribution Account shall thereafter be
credited on each Valuation Date with his or her allocable share of investment
gains or losses of each Investment Fund in which the account is hypothetically
invested. The Committee shall adopt a protocol for allocating investment gains
and losses. Such protocol shall initially be similar to that used in the
Eligible Employee's Sybase, Inc. 401(k) Plan.

                  (c)      The credited investment return may reflect the actual
performance of the Investment Funds or may be calculated based on their
respective rates of return, as determined by the Committee in its sole
discretion.

                                   ARTICLE 6

                            DISTRIBUTION OF ACCOUNTS

         6.1      DISTRIBUTION IN THE EVENT OF HARDSHIP. Notwithstanding Section
3.4, the Committee may distribute all or a portion of: (a) the Participant's
Elective Contribution Account, and (b) the vested portion of an Eligible
Employee's Employer Contribution Account, in a lump sum in the event of the
Participant's Hardship. The amount of any Hardship distribution shall not exceed
the amount required to meet the Hardship, including any taxes or penalties due
on the distribution. A Participant or Beneficiary who desires a Hardship
distribution must submit a request for a Hardship to the Committee on such form
and in such manner as the Committee prescribes and must

                                     page 9

<PAGE>

certify as to the existence of a financial need. The Committee shall have sole
discretion to determine whether a Hardship exists and whether to approve the
request for a distribution and may in its sole discretion determine that
Disability and death constitute a Hardship.

         6.2      DISTRIBUTION UPON RETIREMENT. In the event of an Eligible
Person's Retirement, the Participant's Elective Contribution Account (and the
vested portion of his/her Employer Contribution Account, if applicable) shall be
distributed as soon as administratively practicable in the manner elected by the
Eligible Person in accordance with his or her most recent distribution election
filed pursuant to the Plan.

                  (a)      NORMAL FORM. The amount to be distributed upon a
Participant's Retirement shall be paid in a lump sum unless the Participant has
previously elected to receive the distribution in substantially equal annual
installment payments calculated in such method as the Committee prescribes over
a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years.

                  (b)      SMALL ACCOUNT BALANCE. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, in the event that the amount to be distributed to a Participant or
his or her Beneficiary is $10,000 or less, the Committee in its sole discretion
may distribute it in the form of a lump sum. In addition, a Participant may
elect to receive his or her Retirement distribution part in a lump sum and part
in installments.

                  (c)      INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS. An election to receive
installment payments must be made no later than 13 months prior to the month in
which the Participant's Retirement occurs and cannot subsequently be revoked or
amended by the Participant, except in the event of a Hardship.

         6.3      DISTRIBUTION UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. Except as set
forth in Section 6.1, an Eligible Employee's Elective Contribution Account and
the vested portion of the Eligible Employee's Employer Contribution Account
shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable, and any
election previously made by the Eligible Employee to receive installment
payments upon Retirement shall be considered null and void; provided, however,
that a previous election to receive installment payments made by the Eligible
Employee shall be honored in the event the Eligible Employee is involuntary
terminated for reasons other than for cause (as defined in Sybase's then-current
Human Resources Policies and Procedures regarding Termination of Employment).

         6.4      DISTRIBUTION UPON DEATH. In the event of the death of a
Participant prior to the distribution of his or her account balances under the
Plan, the Participant Beneficiary shall receive the Participant's Elective
Contribution Account and, if applicable, the vested portion of his/her Employer
Contribution Account balances in a lump sum as soon as administratively
practicable. Any previous election made by the Participant to receive
installment payments shall be considered null and void.

         If a Participant dies after installment payments have begun, the
Participant's Beneficiary shall continue to receive the Participant's remaining
account balances in

                                    page 10

<PAGE>

accordance with the installment payment scheduled elected by the Participant.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may accelerate payment of such
account balances to pay the Beneficiary in the event of a Hardship.

         6.5      IN-SERVICE DISTRIBUTIONS.

                  (a)      SPECIFIED IN-SERVICE DISTRIBUTION. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, a Participant may elect at the
time he or she commences participation in the Plan to receive on a specified
future date or dates an in-service distribution of a specified percentage (up to
100%) or a specified amount of the Compensation he or she is electing to defer
pursuant to Section 3.1. Such election must be made at the same time the
Participant is electing to defer his or her Compensation under Section 3.1. The
election shall be made on such form and in accordance with such procedures as
the Committee shall specify. In no event may such specified future date be less
than 13 months from the date the Compensation to be distributed would have been
paid to the Participant but for his or her deferral election under Section 3.1.
A Participant shall be limited to a maximum of two (2), outstanding in-service
distribution elections in effect at any given time. In addition, such
distribution elections shall be limited so that in the aggregate they provide
for no more than two (2) distributions (that is, checks written) per calendar
year.

                  (b)      DISTRIBUTION WITH 10% FORFEITURE. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Plan to the contrary, a Participant may elect, at any
time prior to termination of his or her employment, or Retirement as a Director,
as applicable, to receive a lump sum distribution with respect to all or a
portion of (i) the entire amount credited to his or her Elective Contribution
Account; plus (ii) the vested portion of his or her Employer Contribution
Account, if applicable. The election shall be made on such form and in
accordance with such procedures as the Committee shall specify. Ninety percent
(90%) of the amount so elected shall be distributed to the Participant (subject
to applicable withholding as provided in Section 8.5) as soon as
administratively feasible after the date of the Participant's election under
this Section 6.5(b), and the remaining ten percent (10%) of the amount so
elected shall be permanently and irrevocably forfeited. Such Participant shall
not be eligible to make any deferral elections under Section 3.1 of the Plan for
a period of one (1) year after such distribution. A Participant shall be
permitted a maximum of two (2) distributions under this Section 6.5(b) per
calendar year.

         6.6      DISTRIBUTION UPON TERMINATION OF DIRECTORSHIP. Except as set
forth in Section 6.1, the Director's Elective Contribution Account shall be paid
in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable, and any election
previously made by the Director to receive installment payments upon Retirement
shall be considered null and void.

                               PLAN ADMINISTRATION

         7.1      COMMITTEE. This Plan shall be administered by the Committee of
three or more members of the Board appointed by Sybase. The Committee members
shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Board.

         7.2      AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION. The Board may amend all or any
provision of this Plan, and may terminate the Plan in its entirety, at any time
and for any reason. No amendment or termination of the Plan shall adversely
affect any Participant's Elective Contribution Account balance or any Eligible
Employee's Employer Contribution Account balance as of the effective date of
such amendment or termination, without the Participant's or Beneficiary's
consent.

         7.3      ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN. The Committee shall have the sole
authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan, to
have all powers, authority and discretion necessary or appropriate to carry out
the Plan provisions and to interpret and apply the terms of the Plan to
particular cases or circumstances. All decisions, determinations and
interpretations of the Committee shall be final and binding on all interested
parties.

         Committee members who are Participants shall abstain from voting on any
Plan matters that relate primarily to themselves or that would cause them to be
in constructive receipt of amounts credited to their Elective Contribution
Accounts and/or Employer Contribution Accounts. The Committee may delegate in
writing any or all of its responsibilities under the Plan as it sees fit.

         7.4      CLAIMS PROCEDURE. If a request for benefits by a Participant
or Beneficiary is wholly or partially denied, the Committee will provide such
claimant written notice setting forth the denial and the reasons therefore. A
review procedure is available upon written request by the claimant to the
Committee within 90 days after the date of the Committee's written notice of the
denial of the claim, and includes the right to examine pertinent documents and
submit issues and comments in writing to the Committee. The decision on review
will be made within 90 days after receipt of the request for review, unless
circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 90 days,
and shall be in writing. If a decision on review is not made within such period,
the Participant's claim shall be deemed denied.

                                   ARTICLE 8

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         8.1      BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION.

                  (a)      Each Participant shall have the right, at any time,
to designate any person, persons or entity as his or her Beneficiary or
Beneficiaries to whom payment under the Plan shall be paid in the event of his
or her death by designating a Beneficiary

                                    page 12

<PAGE>

in accordance with such procedures as shall be established by the Committee.
Such payment shall be in accordance with Article 6.

                  (b)      If a Participant's Compensation is community
property, any designation other than such Participant's spouse made by a
Participant then married shall not be valid or effective to the extent any
Beneficiary (or combination thereof) is to receive more than fifty percent (50%)
of such Participant's aggregate benefits payable hereunder unless the
Participant's spouse shall, in writing, approve such designation. A Participant
may change any Beneficiary designation by filing such change on a form
prescribed by the Committee. The filing of a new Beneficiary designation will
cancel all Beneficiary designations previously filed for such Plan Year, subject
to any necessary spousal consent.

                  (c)      If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary as
provided above, or if his or her Beneficiary designation is revoked by operation
of law or otherwise, without execution of a new designation, or if all
designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant or die prior to distribution
of the Participant's benefits, then the Participant's Beneficiary shall be
deemed to be his or her estate.

         8.2      NO FUNDING. The obligations of Sybase or an Employer to pay
benefits under the Plan constitute an unfunded, unsecured promise to pay and
Participants and Beneficiaries shall have no rights against Sybase or any
Employer with respect to the payment of any portion of the Participant's
Elective Contribution Account or Employer Contribution Account, except as
general unsecured creditors of Sybase and all Employers.

         8.3      UNSECURED INTEREST. Sybase may establish one or more grantor
trusts, with such trustee(s) as the Committee may approve, for the purpose of
providing for the payment of deferred amounts. Any such trust created by Sybase
will conform to the terms of the model trust approved by the Internal Revenue
Service pursuant to Revenue Procedure 92-64, or any amendment thereof or
successor procedure thereto. Such trust or trusts may be irrevocable, but the
assets thereof shall be subject to the claims of Sybase's general creditors. To
the extent any deferred amounts under the Plan are actually paid from any such
trust, Sybase shall have no further obligation with respect thereto, but to the
extent not so paid, such deferred amounts shall remain the obligation of, and
shall be paid by, Sybase.

         8.4      NONALIENATION. No assignment, pledge or other anticipation of
benefits from the Plan will be permitted or recognized by any Employer or the
Committee. Moreover, benefits from the Plan shall not be subject to attachment,
garnishment or other legal process for debts or liabilities of any Participant
or Beneficiary, to the extent permitted by law. This prohibition on assignment
or alienation shall apply to any judgment, decree or order (including approval
of a property settlement agreement) which relates to the provision of child
support, alimony or property rights to a present or former spouse, child or
other dependent of a Participant pursuant to a state domestic relations or
community property law, unless the judgment, decree or order is determined by
the Committee to be a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of
Section 414(p) of the Code.

                                    page 13

<PAGE>

         8.5      RIGHT TO WITHHOLD. To the extent required by law in effect at
the time a distribution is made from the Plan, Sybase r or its agents shall have
the right to withhold or deduct from any Plan account distributions or payments
any taxes required to be withheld by federal, state or local governments.

         8.6      LIMITATION OF RIGHTS. Nothing in this Plan shall be construed
to give a Participant the right to continue in the employ or service of Sybase
or any Employer at any particular position or to interfere with the right of
Sybase or any Employer to discharge, lay off or discipline an Employee at any
time, or give Sybase or any Employer the right to require any Participant to
remain in its employ or service or to interfere with the Participant's right to
terminate his or her employment or directorship.

         The ability of a Participant to defer Compensation for a given Plan
Year under this Plan shall not in any way ensure eligibility to participate in
the Plan in any subsequent Plan Year.

         8.7      NON-U.S. PARTICIPANTS. With respect to any Subsidiary which
employs Participants who reside outside the United States, and notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Committee may in its sole discretion amend
the terms of the Plan in order to conform such terms with the requirements of
local law or to meet the objectives of the Plan, and may, where appropriate,
establish one or more sub-plans to reflect such amended provisions.

         8.8      GOVERNING LAW. The provisions of this Plan shall be construed,
enforced and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

         8.9      NO DIRECTOR EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP. Neither this Plan, nor
any Director's participation in the Plan shall be construed or interpreted in
any way to create or imply an employment relationship between Sybase and any
such Director.
