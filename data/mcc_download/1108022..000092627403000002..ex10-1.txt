                       Section "U" of Servicer Certificate


The difference between the Reported 8K and Actual Loss column is driven by the
difference in the definition of a Defaulted Contract between the DART 2000-1
Servicing Agreement and the servicer's normal procedures as described in the
Prospectus. Generally the servicer charges-off a contract:
1)   when the servicer deems the contract uncollectible;
2)   if the financed vehicle is not repossessed, during the month when 5% or
     more of an installment due under the contract becomes more than 120 days
     past due;
3)   if the financed vehicle is repossessed, when all sale proceeds, insurance
     claims and refunds of financed insurance policies and extended warranties
     have been received; or
4)   when an obligor files for bankruptcy and the servicer determines that its
     loss is known.

The definition of a Defaulted Contract in the DART 2000-1 Sale And Servicing
Agreement states:
     "Defaulted Contract" means a Contract with respect to which there has
     occurred one or more of the following: (i) all or part of a scheduled
     payment under the Contract is 120 days or more than 120 days past due and
     the Servicer has not repossessed the related Financed Vehicle, (ii) the
     Servicer, has in accordance with its customary servicing procedures,
     determined that eventual payment in full is unlikely and has either
     repossessed and liquidated the related Financed Vehicle or repossessed and
     held the related Financed Vehicle in its repossessed inventory for 90 days,
     whichever occurs first; provided, however, in no event shall the period of
     time referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) extend for a combined period of
     longer than 120 days, or (iii) the relevant Obligor has suffered an
     Insolvency Event.

Two differences between the two standards account for the change in the Net Loss
Ratio reported in the revised Servicer Certificate from the Net Loss Ratio
calculated in accordance with the servicer's customary servicing procedures:
1)   Under the DART 2000-1 Servicing Agreement the servicer must recognize the
     entire amount of a bankrupt account as a loss when the obligor files for
     bankruptcy rather than when the seller determines the actual amount of
     loss. Although prior experience does not necessarily predict future
     performance, in the servicer's experience, a majority of the accounts that
     file bankruptcy are collected.

2)   Under the DART 2000-1 Servicing Agreement repossessions in inventory are
     considered to be a loss if the contract is 120 days delinquent.
     Traditionally the Servicer would not consider repossessions in inventory to
     be a loss until the car has been sold and all liquidation proceeds have
     been recovered and the loss is known.

*Losses as determined according to the Servicer's customary servicing
procedures.
