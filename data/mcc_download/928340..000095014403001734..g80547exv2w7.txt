WHEREAS:

The parties hereto entered into a Share Sale Agreement dated October 4, 2002
(the "Share Sale Agreement").

The Share Sale Agreement provided at Clause 8.8 that the Share Sale Agreement
could be modified by an instrument in writing signed by the duly authorised

The Share Sale Agreement was amended to provide for a later completion date and
the consequences thereof by an Agreement to Amend Share Sale Agreement dated
November 29, 2002 (the "Amending Agreement").

The completion of the Share Sale Agreement as amended by the Amending Agreement
was made conditional on the happening of certain events on or before December
31, 2002, and the parties have agreed that the conditions precedent to the Share
Sale Agreement as amended by the Amending Agreement are unlikely to be satisfied
by that date and accordingly the parties have agreed to enter into this second
amending agreement to provide for a later completion date and the consequences
thereof.

                           31st January, 2003."

2.       Clauses 4.2, 4.3 and 5.1 of the Share Sale Agreement as amended by the
         Amending Agreement are amended by deleting "December 31, 2002" wherever
         it appears, and substituting therefor "January 31, 2003".

3.       Clause 3.7 of the Share Sale Agreement as amended by the Amending
         Agreement is amended by deleting "November 29, 2002" wherever it
         appears and substituting therefor "December 31, 2002".
