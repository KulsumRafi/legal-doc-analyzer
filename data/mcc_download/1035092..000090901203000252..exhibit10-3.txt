relief. The existence of this right shall not preclude any other rights and
remedies at law or in equity which the Company may have.

same shall not be held to affect the validity of any other such covenant
contained in this Agreement. The benefits of this Section 9 shall inure to the
benefit of, and each reference to Company shall be deemed to include any
