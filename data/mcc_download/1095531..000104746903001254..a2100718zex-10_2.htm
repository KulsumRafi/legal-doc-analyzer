the Borrower and the Credit Documents (including the exercise of any rights and remedies provided in the Credit Documents) as may be directed jointly by you and all other Initial C Term Loan
Participants (at the expense of such Initial C Term Loan Participants) to enforce or protect your and their interest in the Initial C Term Loans; provided, however, that absent such joint direction,
we agree that we will take such action as you may separately direct (at your expense) to enforce any rights and remedies provided in the Credit Documents to recover all amounts owing to you with
respect to the Initial C Term Loans in which you have purchased a participation (including, without limitation, any action you direct to forclose on any collateral securing the Initial C Term Loans or
to enforce any guarantee thereof). In addition, upon your request, we will assign our rights in the Initial C Term Loans subject to the Participation to you. </FONT></P>

sub-participation therein, without our prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), provided that after you have made your payment to us of the principal
amount of the Participation pursuant to Paragraph&nbsp;2, you may sell or otherwise dispose of the Participation or any interest therein to any of your affiliates that directly or indirectly owns
