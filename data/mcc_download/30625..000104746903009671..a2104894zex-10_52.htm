of them. If an Eligible Senior Manager, beneficiary or survivor or anyone claiming under any of them shall attempt
to or shall subject in any manner any benefit which shall be payable under this Plan to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, garnishment, encumbrance, or charge, his interest
in any such benefit shall terminate and the Committee shall hold or apply it to or for the benefit of such person, his spouse, children or other dependents, or any of them as the Committee may decide.
In addition, all benefits under this Plan shall be computed without giving effect to any "Qualified Domestic Relations Order", as such term is defined under ERISA. </FONT></P>

be mentally competent and of age until the Committee receives written notice, in a form and manner acceptable to it, that such person is incompetent, and that a guardian, conservator, statutory
committee, or other person legally vested with the care of his estate has been appointed. In the event that the Committee finds that any person to whom a benefit is payable under the Plan is unable to
properly care for his affairs, then any payment due (unless a prior claim therefore shall have been made by a duly appointed legal representative) may be paid to the spouse, a child, a parent, or a
brother or sister, or to any person deemed by the Committee to have incurred expense for such person otherwise entitled to payment. </FONT></P>

the event a guardian or conservator or statutory committee of the estate of any person receiving or claiming benefits under the Plan shall be appointed by a court of competent
jurisdiction, payments shall be made to such guardian or conservator or statutory committee, provided that proper proof of appointment is furnished in a form and manner suitable to the Committee. Any
payment made under the provision of this Section&nbsp;7.2 shall be a complete discharge of liability therefore under the Plan. </FONT></P>

Senior Manager, beneficiary or survivor shall not be reduced. An Eligible Senior Manager who is in active service at the time of Plan amendment or termination shall be entitled to no less than the
benefits he has accrued under the Plan to the date of such amendment or termination. The time and manner of payment of benefits subsequent to such date shall remain subject to the terms and conditions
of the Plan, as they may have been amended, except that any Eligible Senior Manager, beneficiary or survivor covered by or receiving benefits from the Plan as of such date may elect to have the
provisions in effect prior to their amendment apply to him. Subject to the foregoing provision, the Eligible Senior Manager shall have a contractual right to all benefits applicable to him under the
Plan. In the event that an Eligible Senior Manager brings a legal action after a "Change of Control" as defined in Section&nbsp;2.1(b) to enforce any of his rights hereunder, the Company shall
reimburse the Eligible Senior Manager for his legal fees and expenses in bringing such action unless it is judicially determined that such action was frivolous or brought in bad faith. </FONT></P>
