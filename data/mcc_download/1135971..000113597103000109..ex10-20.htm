<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 17, 1983, the Potomac Electric Power Company ("Pepco") established the Supplemental Benefit Plan (the "Pepco plan")to provide for the payment of a retirement supplement to executives eligible to participate in the plan or their beneficiaries in amounts equal to any reduction of total retirement benefits that otherwise would be payable under the Pepco General Retirement Plan to the extent such reduction is attributable to A) the benefit limitation provisions of federal law and regulations; or B) the exclusion of deferred compensation from the compensation base used in determining retirement benefits under the General Retirement Plan, as required under applicable law.  The Pepco plan was amended from time to time thereafter.  On March 28, 2002, further amendments were authorized to the Pepco plan to recognize the intent to consummate a transaction (the "Merger") by which Pepco and Conectiv would become wholly owned subsidiaries of Pepco Holdings, Inc. (the "Company" or "Pepco Holdings") and, for the near term future, to maintain for the benefit of the executives of Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries, the level of benefits provided to such executives by their respective employers prior to the Merger.  Such amendments include  authorization to name Pepco Holdings as the sponsor of the Pepco plan; to change the name of the Pepco plan to reflect the change in plan sponsorship; to amend the section of the plan relating to eligibility to participate;  and to delete all references to Pepco's General Retirement Plan, and to replace all such references to the Pepco General Retirement Plan with "the principal defined benefit pension plan of Pepco Holdings or one of its subsidiaries in which the employee participates".   Therefore, the Pepco plan has been amended and is restated herein and is now known as the Pepco Holdings, Inc. Supplemental Benefit Plan. (the "Plan").<BR>

Such trust  initially received a transfer of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000).  However such trust provides that the full present value of the benefits payable hereunder shall subsequently be contributed to the trust in the event the Company fails to pay any benefits due hereunder in a timely manner. Except to the extent provided under the provisions of this Section, all payments under this Plan shall be made out of the Company's general revenue, a Participant's right to payment shall be solely that of an unsecured general creditor of the Company, and no assets of the Company shall be set aside, earmarked or placed in trust or escrow for the benefit of any Participant to fund the Company's obligations which exist under the Plan.<BR>
