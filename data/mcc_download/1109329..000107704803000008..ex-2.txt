                        AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     This  Agreement  and  Plan  of Merger (this "Agreement"),  dated  as  of
January 20, 2003, is between HESPERIA HOLDING CORP., a California corporation
("Hesperia"), and SAVEYOUTIME.COM, INC., a Nevada corporation ("SCI").

     Whereas, the Boards of Directors of Hesperia and SCI each have, in light
of  and  subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (i) determined
that  the  Merger (as defined below) is fair to their respective stockholders
and  in  the best interests of such stockholders and (ii) approved the Merger
in accordance with this Agreement;

     Whereas, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
qualify  as  a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)  of  the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and

     Whereas,  Hesperia  and  SCI  desire to  make  certain  representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger  and  also
to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

     Now,   therefore,   in   consideration   of   the   promises   and   the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein  contained,  and
intending  to  be  legally bound hereby, Hesperia and  SCI  hereby  agree  as
follows:

                                  ARTICLE I
                                 THE MERGER

     Section 1.1    The Merger.  At the Effective Time (as defined below) and
upon  the  terms  and  subject to the conditions of  this  Agreement  and  in
accordance  with  the  General Corporation Law of the State  of  Nevada  (the
"NGCL")  and  the  General Corporation Law of the State  of  California  (the
"CGCL"),  Hesperia shall be merged with and into SCI (as defined below)  (the
"Merger").   Following  the  Merger, SCI  shall  continue  as  the  surviving
corporation  (the "Surviving Corporation"), shall continue to be governed  by
the  laws  of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization  and  the
separate corporate existence of Hesperia shall cease to exist.  Prior to  the
Effective Time, the parties hereto shall mutually agree as to the name of the
Surviving Corporation; however, initially the Surviving Corporation shall  be
named Hesperia Holding Inc., a Nevada corporation.  The Merger is intended to
qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

     Section 1.2    Effective Time.  Subject to the terms and conditions  set
forth  in  this Agreement, a Certificate of Merger (the "Merger Certificate")
shall  be  duly  executed and acknowledged by each of SCI and  Hesperia,  and
thereafter the Merger Certificate reflecting the Merger shall be delivered to
the  Secretary of State of the State of Nevada and the Secretary of State  of
the  State  of  California for filing pursuant to the NGCL and  CGCL  on  the
Closing  Date (as defined in Section 1.3).  The Merger shall become effective
at  such  time  as  a  properly executed and certified  copy  of  the  Merger
Certificate is duly filed by the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in
accordance  with  the  NGCL  and the Secretary  of  State  of  the  State  of
California in accordance with the CGCL or such later time as the parties  may
agree  upon  and set forth in the Merger Certificate (the time at  which  the
Merger  becomes  effective  shall be referred to  herein  as  the  "Effective
Time").

     Section  1.3     Closing of the Merger.  The closing of the Merger  (the
"Closing")  will  take place at a time and on a date to be specified  by  the
parties,  which  shall  be  no  later than  the  second  business  day  after

<PAGE>

satisfaction of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article  5
(the  "Closing Date"), at the offices of the Stoecklein Law Group,  402  West
Broadway,  Suite 400, San Diego, California 92101, unless another time,  date
or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

     Section 1.4    Effects of the Merger.  The Merger shall have the effects
set  forth  in  the  NGCL and CGCL.  Without limiting the generality  of  the
foregoing,  and  subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the  properties,
rights,  privileges,  and  powers of Hesperia shall  vest  in  the  Surviving
Corporation,  and all debts, liabilities and duties of Hesperia shall  become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     Section 1.5    Board of Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation.
The  directors  and officers of Hesperia immediately prior to  the  Effective
Time  shall  be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation  from
and  after  the Effective Time, until their successors shall have  been  duly
elected or appointed and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation
or  removal  in  accordance with the Surviving Corporation's  Certificate  of
Incorporation and Bylaws.

     Section 1.6    Conversion of Shares.  At the Effective Time, each  share
of  common  stock,  $.001  par value per share of  Hesperia  (individually  a
"Hesperia  Share"  and  collectively,  the  "Hesperia  Shares")  issued   and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue  of  the
Merger  and  without any action on the part of SCI, Hesperia, or  the  holder
thereof, be converted into and shall become fully paid and nonassessable  SCI
Common  Stock  determined by dividing (i) Ten Million  Four  Hundred  Fifteen
Thousand  Eight Hundred Forty-Five (10,415,845), by (ii) the total number  of
shares  of Hesperia, Ten Million Four Hundred Fifteen Thousand Eight  Hundred
Forty-Five  (10,415,845) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time
(such  quotient, the "Exchange Ratio").  The holder of one or more shares  of
Hesperia  Common Stock shall be entitled to receive in exchange  therefore  a
number  of shares of SCI Common Stock equal to the product of (x) (the number
of  shares  of  Hesperia Common Stock (10,415,845)), times (y) (the  Exchange
Ratio).  By way of example, 10,415,845/10,415,845= 1.00 (the Exchange Ratio).
The  number of shares of Hesperia Common Stock held by a stockholder  (1,000)
times  the  Exchange Ratio of 1.00 equals 1,000 shares of SCI  Shares  to  be
issued.

     Section 1.7    Exchange of Certificates.

     (a)   Prior  to  the Effective Time, SCI shall enter into  an  agreement
with, and shall deposit with the Stoecklein Law Group or such other agent  or
agents as may be satisfactory to Hesperia and SCI (the "Exchange Agent"), for
the  benefit  of  the  holders of Hesperia Shares, for exchange  through  the
Exchange   Agent  in  accordance  with  this  Article  I:  (i)   certificates
representing the appropriate number of SCI Shares to be issued to holders  of
Hesperia  Shares issuable pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding
Hesperia Shares.

     (b)   As  soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective  Time,  the
Exchange  Agent  shall  mail to each holder of record  of  a  certificate  or
certificates  which  immediately  prior to  the  Effective  Time  represented
outstanding Hesperia Shares (the "Certificates") whose shares were  converted
into the right to receive SCI Shares pursuant to Section 1.6: (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss  and  title  to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery  of  the
Certificates  to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and  have  such
other  provisions  as  SCI  and  Hesperia may reasonably  specify)  and  (ii)
instructions  for  use  in effecting the surrender  of  the  Certificates  in

<PAGE>

exchange  for  certificates  representing SCI Shares.  Upon  surrender  of  a
Certificate  to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly  executed,  and  any  other  required  documents,  the  holder  of  such
Certificate  shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore a certificate
representing that number of whole SCI Shares, which such holder has the right
to  receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article I, and the Certificate
so  surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  In the event of a  transfer  of
ownership of Hesperia Shares which are not registered in the transfer records
of  Hesperia, a certificate representing the proper number of SCI Shares  may
be  issued  to  a  transferee if the Certificate representing  such  Hesperia
Shares  is  presented  to  the Exchange Agent accompanied  by  all  documents
required  by  the Exchange Agent or SCI to evidence and effect such  transfer
and  by evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other taxes have  been
paid.    Until  surrendered  as  contemplated  by  this  Section  1.7,   each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only  the  right to receive upon such surrender the certificate  representing
SCI Shares as contemplated by this Section 1.7.

     (c)   No  dividends or other distributions declared or  made  after  the
Effective  Time  with  respect to SCI Shares with a  record  date  after  the
Effective  Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered  Certificate
with  respect to the Hesperia Shares represented thereby until the holder  of
record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate.

     (d)  In the event that any Certificate for SCI Shares or Hesperia Shares
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue  in
exchange  therefore,  upon the making of an affidavit of  that  fact  by  the
holder  thereof such Hesperia Shares and cash in lieu of fractional  Hesperia
Shares,  if  any,  as  may be required pursuant to this Agreement;  provided,
however,  that SCI or the Exchange Agent, may, in its respective  discretion,
require the delivery of a suitable bond, opinion or indemnity.

     (e)   All  SCI Shares issued upon the surrender for exchange of Hesperia
Shares  in  accordance with the terms hereof shall be  deemed  to  have  been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Hesperia Shares.
There  shall  be  no further registration of transfers on the stock  transfer
books  of  Hesperia of the Hesperia Shares which were outstanding immediately
prior  to the Effective Time.  If, after the Effective Time, Certificates  of
Hesperia  are  presented to SCI for any reason, they shall  be  canceled  and
exchanged as provided in this Article I.

     (f)  No fractional SCI Shares shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu
thereof each holder of Hesperia Shares otherwise entitled to a fractional SCI
Share  shall,  upon surrender of its, his or her Certificate or Certificates,
be  entitled to receive an additional share to round up to the nearest  round
number of shares.

     Section 1.8    Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action.  If,  at  any
time after the Effective Time, SCI or Hesperia reasonably determines that any
deeds, assignments, or instruments or confirmations of transfer are necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest SCI with
full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of SCI, the officers and directors of Hesperia and  SCI
are  fully  authorized  in  the  name  of their  respective  corporations  or
otherwise  to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary or desirable
action.

                                 ARTICLE II
                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SCI

under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization,  and
has  all  requisite  power  and  authority to  own,  lease  and  operate  its
properties  and  to  carry on its businesses as now being  conducted,  except
where  the  failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing  or  to

<PAGE>

defined  below) on SCI.  When used in connection with SCI, the term "Material
Adverse  Effect"  means any change or effect (i) that  is  or  is  reasonably
likely  to  be  materially adverse to the business,  results  of  operations,
condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of SCI, other than any change
or  effect  arising  out  of  general economic conditions  unrelated  to  any
business in which SCI is engaged, or (ii) that may impair the ability of  SCI
to  perform  its  obligations  hereunder or to  consummate  the  transactions
contemplated hereby.

          (b)  SCI has heretofore delivered to Hesperia accurate and complete
copies  of  the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (or similar governing
documents),  as  currently  in effect, of SCI.   SCI  is  duly  qualified  or
licensed  and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction  in  which
the  property  owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the  business
conducted  by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary,  except  in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed  and
in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on SCI.

     Section 2.2    Capitalization of SCI.

               (a)   The authorized capital stock of SCI consists of:  Twenty
Million  (20,000,000) Authorized Shares of Common Stock,  $0.001  par  value,

securities  of  SCI, (ii) securities of SCI convertible into or  exchangeable
for  shares  of  capital stock or voting securities of  SCI,  (iii)  options,
warrants,   calls,   rights,   commitments,  agreements,   arrangements,   or
undertakings  of  any kind to which SCI is a party or by which  it  is  bound
obligating SCI to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, additional shares of capital stock or other voting securities of SCI or

to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into
or  exchangeable  for capital stock or voting securities  of  SCI,  and  (iv)
equity  equivalents, interests in the ownership or earnings of SCI  or  other
similar  rights  (collectively, "SCI Securities"). As  of  the  date  hereof,
except  there  are no outstanding obligations of SCI or its  subsidiaries  to
repurchase,  redeem  or otherwise acquire any SCI Securities  or  stockholder
agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which  SCI
is  a party or by which it is bound relating to the voting or registration of
any shares of capital stock of SCI.  There are no bonds, debentures, notes or
other  indebtedness  of  SCI having the right to vote  (or  convertible  into
securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders  of
SCI may vote.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Lien" means, with respect  to
any  asset (including, without limitation, any security) any mortgage,  lien,
pledge,  charge, security interest or encumbrance of any kind in  respect  of
such asset.

               (b)   The  SCI  Shares  constitute the only  class  of  equity
securities of SCI registered or required to be registered under the  Exchange
Act.

constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of SCI, enforceable  against
SCI in accordance with its terms.

the  foregoing, collectively, the "SCI SEC Reports").  None of such  SCI  SEC

included  or  incorporated by reference therein, contained, when  filed,  any
untrue  statement  of  a material fact or omitted to state  a  material  fact
required  to  be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary  in
order  to  make  the statements therein, in light of the circumstances  under

circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

give such notice would not have a Material Adverse Effect on SCI.

     Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by SCI
nor  the consummation by SCI of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i)
conflict  with  or  result in any breach of any provision of  the  respective
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws (or similar governing documents) of  SCI,
(ii)  result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without  due
notice  or  lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to  any  right  of

30,  2002 unaudited financial statements, none of SCI or its subsidiaries had

or event occurred after the date of this Agreement.

or  investigation pending or, to the knowledge of SCI, threatened against SCI
or  any  of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or  assets

     any liability which would have a Material Adverse Effect on SCI.

                    (b)   (i) No SCI Employee Plan is or has been subject  to
     Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code; and (ii) each SCI Employee
     Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust
     intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code is the subject of a
     favorable Internal Revenue Service determination letter, and nothing has
     occurred  which  could reasonably be expected to adversely  affect  such
     determination.

surface   water,   ground   water,  land  surface   or   subsurface   strata)
(collectively,  "Environmental Laws"), except for non-compliance  that  would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on SCI, which compliance includes, but  is
not  limited  to,  the possession by SCI of all material  permits  and  other
governmental authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws, and
compliance  with the terms and conditions thereof; (ii) SCI has not  received
written  notice  of,  or, to the knowledge of SCI, is  the  subject  of,  any
action, cause of action, claim, investigation, demand or notice by any person

material compliance in the future.

          (b)   Except  as publicly disclosed by SCI in the SCI SEC  Reports,
there  are  no  Environmental Claims pending or, to  the  knowledge  of  SCI,

retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of law.

all  of  its properties and assets, free and clear of all liens, charges  and
encumbrances except liens for taxes not yet due and payable and such liens or

effective in accordance with their respective terms, and there is not, to the
knowledge of SCI, under any of such leases, any existing material default  or
event of default (or event which with notice of lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default and in respect of which SCI has not taken adequate steps
to  prevent such a default from occurring) except where the lack of such good
standing,  validity and effectiveness, or the existence of  such  default  or
event, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on SCI.

     Section 2.14   Intellectual Property.

     (a)  SCI owns, or possesses adequate licenses or other valid rights to use,
all  existing  United  States and foreign patents, trademarks,  trade  names,

party.

                                 ARTICLE III
                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SCI

     Except as set forth on the Disclosure Schedule delivered by Hesperia  to
SCI  (the  "Hesperia  Disclosure Schedule"), Hesperia hereby  represents  and
warrants to Hesperia as follows:

     Section 3.1    Organization and Qualification.

          (a)   Hesperia  is  duly organized, validly existing  and  in  good
standing  under  the  laws  of  the  jurisdiction  of  its  incorporation  or
organization  and  has all requisite power and authority to  own,  lease  and
operate its properties and to carry on its businesses as now being conducted,
except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or
to have such power and authority would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below) on Hesperia.  When used in connection with Hesperia, the  term
"Material  Adverse  Effect" means any change or effect  (i)  that  is  or  is
reasonably  likely  to  be  materially adverse to the  business,  results  of
operations,  condition  (financial or otherwise) or  prospects  of  Hesperia,
taken  as  a  whole, other than any change or effect arising out  of  general
economic conditions unrelated to any businesses in which Hesperia is engaged,
or   (ii)  that  may  impair  the  ability  of  Hesperia  to  consummate  the
transactions contemplated hereby.

          (b)   Hesperia  has heretofore delivered to Hesperia  accurate  and
complete  copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws  (or  similar
governing documents), as currently in effect, of Hesperia.  Hesperia is  duly
qualified  or  licensed  and  in  good  standing  to  do  business  in   each
jurisdiction  in which the property owned, leased or operated by  it  or  the
nature  of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary  except  in  such jurisdictions where the failure  to  be  so  duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have a Material  Adverse
Effect on Hesperia.

     Section 3.2    Capitalization of Hesperia.

     (a)  As of July 31, 2002, the authorized capital stock of Hesperia consists
of  Fifteen Million (15,000,000) Hesperia common Shares, $0.001 par value, of
which  10,415,845  common  Shares are issued and  outstanding.   All  of  the

<PAGE>

outstanding Hesperia Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued, and
are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

      (b)  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.2(b) of the Hesperia Disclosure
Schedule,  between  January  17,  2003 and the  date  hereof,  no  shares  of
Hesperia's capital stock have been issued and no Hesperia Stock options  have
been  granted.  Except as set forth in Section 3.2(a) above, as of  the  date
hereof, there are no outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or other  voting
securities  of  Hesperia,  (ii) securities of Hesperia  convertible  into  or
exchangeable  for shares of capital stock or voting securities  of  Hesperia,
(iii)  options  or other rights to acquire from Hesperia, or  obligations  of
Hesperia  to  issue,  any  capital  stock, voting  securities  or  securities
convertible  into or exchangeable for capital stock or voting  securities  of
Hesperia, or (iv) equity equivalents, interests in the ownership or  earnings
of  Hesperia  or other similar rights (collectively, "Hesperia  Securities").
Except  as  set forth in Schedule 3.2(b) of the Hesperia Disclosure Schedule,
as  of  the date hereof, there are no outstanding obligations of Hesperia  to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Hesperia Securities.   Except  as
set  forth  in  Section 3.2(b), there are no stockholder  agreements,  voting
trusts or other agreements or understandings to which Hesperia is a party  or
by  which it is bound relating to the voting or registration of any shares of
capital stock of Hesperia.

      (c)  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.2(c) of the Hesperia Disclosure
Schedule,   there  are  no  securities  of  Hesperia  convertible   into   or
exchangeable for, no options or other rights to acquire from Hesperia, and no
other  contract,  understanding, arrangement or obligation  (whether  or  not
contingent)  providing for the issuance or sale, directly or  indirectly,  of
any capital stock or other ownership interests in Hesperia.

      (d)  The Hesperia Shares constitute the only class of equity securities of
Hesperia.

      (e)  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.2(e) of the Hesperia Disclosure
Schedule,  Hesperia  does  not own directly or  indirectly  more  than  fifty
percent  (50%)  of the outstanding voting securities or interests  (including
membership interests) of any entity.

     Section  3.3     Authority  Relative to this Agreement;  Recommendation.
Hesperia  has  all  necessary corporate power and authority  to  execute  and
deliver  this  Agreement  and  to  consummate the  transactions  contemplated
hereby.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by
the  Board  of  Directors of Hesperia (the "Hesperia Board"),  and  no  other
corporate proceedings on the part of Hesperia are necessary to authorize this
Agreement  or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, except,  as
referred  to in Section 3.16, the approval and adoption of this Agreement  by
the  holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding Hesperia  Shares.
Subject  to obtaining the requisite shareholder approval, this Agreement  has
been  duly  and validly executed and delivered by Hesperia and constitutes  a
valid,  legal and binding agreement of Hesperia, enforceable against Hesperia
in accordance with its terms.

     Section  3.4    Information Supplied.  None of the information  supplied
or  to be supplied by Hesperia for inclusion or incorporation by reference to
the  8-K  will, at the time the 8-K is filed with the SEC and at the time  it
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material  fact  or  omit  to state any material fact required  to  be  stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

     Section  3.5     Consents and Approvals; No Violations.  Except  as  set
forth  in  Schedule 3.5 of the Hesperia Disclosure Schedule, and for filings,
permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required under, and
other applicable requirements of, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state
securities  or  blue sky laws, the HSR Act, the rules of the  NASD,  and  the

<PAGE>

filing and recordation of the Merger Certificate as required by the DGCL,  no
filing  with or notice to, and no permit, authorization, consent or  approval
of,  any  Governmental Entity is necessary for the execution and delivery  by
Hesperia  of  this  Agreement  or  the  consummation  by  Hesperia   of   the
transactions  contemplated hereby, except where the failure  to  obtain  such
permits, authorizations consents or approvals or to make such filings or give
such notice would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Hesperia.

     Subject  to  obtaining  requisite  shareholder  approval,  neither   the
execution,  delivery and performance of this Agreement by  Hesperia  nor  the
consummation  by  Hesperia of the transactions contemplated hereby  will  (i)
conflict  with  or  result in any breach of any provision of  the  respective
Certificate  of Incorporation or Bylaws (or similar governing  documents)  of
Hesperia,  (ii)  result in a violation or breach of, or constitute  (with  or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise  to  any
right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration or Lien) under,
any  of  the  terms,  conditions or provisions of any note,  bond,  mortgage,
indenture,  lease,  license,  contract,  agreement  or  other  instrument  or
obligation  to which Hesperia is a party or by which Hesperia or any  of  its
respective  properties  or assets may be bound or (iii)  violate  any  order,
writ,  injunction,  decree, law, statute, rule or  regulation  applicable  to
Hesperia  or any of its properties or assets, except in the case of  (ii)  or
(iii)  for  violations, breaches or defaults which would not have a  Material
Adverse Effect on Hesperia.

     Section 3.6    No Default.  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.6  of  the
Hesperia Disclosure Schedule, Hesperia is not in breach, default or violation
(and  no  event has occurred which with notice or the lapse of time  or  both
would  constitute a breach, default or violation) of any term,  condition  or
provision  of (i) its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (ii) any  note,
bond,  mortgage,  indenture,  lease, license, contract,  agreement  or  other
instrument or obligation to which Hesperia is now a party or by which any  of
its  properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) any order, writ, injunction,
decree, law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Hesperia or any of its
properties  or  assets, except in the case of (ii) or (iii)  for  violations,
breaches  or  defaults  that  would not have a  Material  Adverse  Effect  on
Hesperia.   Each  note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license,  contract,
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Hesperia is now a  party
or  by which any of its properties or assets may be bound that is material to
Hesperia  taken  as  a whole and that has not expired is in  full  force  and
effect  and  is  not  subject  to any material default  thereunder  of  which
Hesperia is aware by any party obligated to Hesperia.

     Section  3.7    No Undisclosed Liabilities; Absence of Changes.   Except
as  set forth in Schedule 3.7 of the Hesperia Disclosure Schedule, as of July
31,  2002,  Hesperia  does not have any liabilities  or  obligations  of  any
nature,  whether  or  not  accrued, contingent or otherwise,  that  would  be
required  by  generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected  on  a
balance sheet of Hesperia (including the notes thereto) or which would have a
Material Adverse Effect on Hesperia.  Except as disclosed by Hesperia,  since
July  31,  2002,  Hesperia has not incurred any liabilities  of  any  nature,
whether  or  not accrued, contingent or otherwise, which could reasonably  be
expected  to  have, and there have been no events, changes  or  effects  with
respect  to Hesperia having or which reasonably could be expected to have,  a
Material  Adverse Effect on Hesperia.  Except as and to the extent  disclosed
by  Hesperia on Schedule 3.7 of the Hesperia Disclosure Schedule, since  July
31,  2002,  there  has not been (i) any material change by  Hesperia  in  its
accounting methods, principles or practices (other than as required after the
date   hereof   by  concurrent  changes  in  generally  accepted   accounting
principles), (ii) any revaluation by Hesperia of any of its assets  having  a
Material Adverse Effect on Hesperia, including, without limitation, any write-
down of the value of any assets other than in the ordinary course of business
or  (iii)  any other action or event that would have required the consent  of
any  other  party hereto pursuant to Section 4.2 of this Agreement  had  such
action or event occurred after the date of this Agreement.

     Section  3.8    Litigation.  Except as disclosed by Hesperia on Schedule
3.8  of  the  Hesperia Disclosure Schedule, there is no suit, claim,  action,
proceeding  or  investigation  pending or,  to  the  knowledge  of  Hesperia,
threatened  against Hesperia or any of its properties or  assets  before  any

<PAGE>

Governmental Entity which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Hesperia or could reasonably
be  expected  to  prevent  or  delay  the consummation  of  the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  Except as disclosed by Hesperia, Hesperia is
not  subject  to  any outstanding order, writ, injunction  or  decree  which,
insofar  as  can  be reasonably foreseen in the future, could  reasonably  be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Hesperia or could reasonably be
expected   to   prevent  or  delay  the  consummation  of  the   transactions
contemplated hereby.

     Section  3.9    Compliance with Applicable Law.  Except as disclosed  by
Hesperia on Schedule 3.9 of the Hesperia Disclosure Schedule, Hesperia  holds
all  permits,  licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals  of  all
Governmental  Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of its business  (the
"Hesperia  Permits"), except for such failures to hold Hesperia Permits  that
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Hesperia.  Except as disclosed on
Schedule  3.9,  Hesperia  is in compliance with the  terms  of  the  Hesperia
Permits,  except  where the failure so to comply would not  have  a  Material
Adverse  Effect  on  Hesperia.   Except as disclosed  in  Schedule  3.9,  the
business  of  Hesperia  is  not being conducted  in  violation  of  any  law,
ordinance  or regulation of any Governmental Entity and except for violations
or  possible violations which do have a Material Adverse Effect on  Hesperia.
Except  as  disclosed  by  Hesperia,  no  investigation  or  review  by   any
Governmental Entity with respect to Hesperia is pending or, to the  knowledge
of  Hesperia,  threatened,  nor,  to  the  knowledge  of  Hesperia,  has  any
Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same.

     Section 3.10   Employee Benefit Plans; Labor Matters.

   (a)  With respect to each employee benefit plan, program, policy, arrangement
and contract (including, without limitation, any "employee benefit plan,"  as
defined  in Section 3(3) of ERISA), maintained or contributed to at any  time
by Hesperia or any entity required to be aggregated with Hesperia pursuant to
Section  414  of the Code (each, a "Hesperia Employee Plan"),  no  event  has
occurred  and,  to  the  knowledge  of  Hesperia,  no  condition  or  set  of
circumstances  exists  in  connection with  which  Hesperia  or  any  of  its
subsidiaries  could  reasonably be expected to be subject  to  any  liability
which would have a Material Adverse Effect on Hesperia.

   (b)  (i) No Hesperia Employee Plan is or has been subject to Title IV of
ERISA  or  Section  412  of the Code; and (ii) each  Hesperia  Employee  Plan
intended  to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust intended
to  qualify  under Section 501(a) of the Code is the subject of  a  favorable
Internal Revenue Service determination letter, and nothing has occurred which
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect such determination.

  (c)  Schedule 3.10(c) of the Hesperia Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of each person who holds
any Hesperia Stock Options, together with the number of Hesperia Shares which

which  such  option  is vested (or will become vested  as  a  result  of  the
Merger), the option price of such option (to the extent determined as of  the
date  hereof),  whether  such option is a nonqualified  stock  option  or  is

advisable  under  applicable  laws and regulations  to  consummate  and  make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
limitation,  (i) cooperating in the preparation and filing of  the  8-K,  any
filings  that  may be required under the HSR Act, and any amendments  to  any

party hereto shall take all such necessary action.

     Section 4.9    Indemnification; Releases

          (a)   Subject to obtaining a Release in form reasonably  acceptable
by  the parties from each officer and director of Hesperia, and provided that
all  such Releases are obtained, Hesperia agrees, to the extent, if any,  not
provided  by  an  existing  right under one of  the  parties'  directors  and
officers liability insurance policies, from and after the Effective Time,  to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and Hesperia's Certificate  of
Incorporation and Bylaws, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each  person
who  is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes
prior  to  the  Effective  Time,  a director  or  officer  of  SCI  (each  an
"Indemnified  Party" and, collectively, the ``Indemnified  Parties")  against
all  losses,  expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees  and  expenses),
claims,  damages  or  liabilities or, subject to  the  proviso  of  the  next
succeeding  sentence, amounts paid in settlement arising out  of  actions  or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or
claimed  prior to, at or after the Effective Time) that are in  whole  or  in
part  based  on  the Merger or arising out of the business of  the  Surviving
Corporation after the Merger, provided, however, in no event shall  SCI  have
the  obligation  to  indemnify and hold harmless  any  Indemnified  Party  or
Indemnified  Parties for any breach of their duty of loyalty to  SCI  or  its
stockholders,  for  acts  or omissions not in good  faith  or  which  involve
intentional  misconduct  or a knowing violation of  law  (including,  without
limitation,  any federal or state securities laws), for unlawful payments  of
dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in   NGCL,
or  for any transaction from which the Indemnified Person derived an improper
personal  benefit.  In the event of any such loss, expense, claim, damage  or
liability  (whether or not arising before the Effective Time), (i) SCI  shall
advance  to  such Indemnified Party upon request reimbursement of  documented
expenses reasonably incurred, to the extent not prohibited by the NGCL or its
Certificate  of  Incorporation or Bylaws, (ii)  SCI  will  cooperate  in  the
defense  of any such matter and (iii) any determination required to  be  made
with  respect  to  whether an Indemnified Party's conduct complies  with  the
standards set forth under the NGCL and SCI's Certificate of Incorporation  or
Bylaws  shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to  SCI  and
the  Indemnified Party; provided, however, that SCI shall not be  liable  for
any  settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only
one law firm with respect to each related matter.

          (b)   In  the  event SCI or any of its successors  or  assigns  (i)
consolidates  with  or  merges into any other person and  shall  not  be  the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity or such consolidation or merger
or  (ii)  transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets  to
any  person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be made  so
that the successors and assigns of SCI shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 4.9.

          (c)   The provisions of this Section 4.9 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his  or  her
heirs and his or her representatives.

     Section 4.10   Information Statement.  As soon as practicable after  the
execution  of this Agreement, Hesperia will prepare an Information  Statement
or  other  applicable filing for mailing to its stockholders,  in  accordance
with  the  requirements of all federal and state securities  laws  and  other
applicable  laws.   Hesperia  will file the Information  Statement  with  the

<PAGE>

Application  for  Qualification of Securities filed with  the  Department  of

     Each  party  will  provide the other on a timely  basis  with  all  such
information  as may be required to be included in the Information  Statement.
The parties will cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation
of  documentation  for submission to regulatory authorities  and  holders  of
their respective securities and will keep each other informed of any requests
or   comments  made  by  regulatory  authorities  in  connection  with   such
documentation.  Hesperia will, through its Board of Directors,  recommend  to
its stockholders, approval of such matters.

     Section  4.11    Press  Releases.   No press  release  or  other  public
announcement  concerning  the  proposed  transactions  contemplated  by  this
Agreement will be made by any party hereto without the prior consent  of  the
other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld; provided, however,
that any party may without such consent make such disclosure about itself  as
may  be required by any stock exchange on which its securities are listed  or
by  federal  and  state  securities laws or any regulatory  authority  having
jurisdiction over such party and, if such disclosure is required,  the  party
making  the  disclosure will use reasonable efforts to  give  prior  oral  or
written notice to the other party and an opportunity to allow the other party
to comment on the proposed disclosure provided the party required to make the
disclosure  has  reasonable time to do so before such regulatory  authorities
require such disclosure to be made.

     Section  4.12    Other Filings.  At all times from and  after  the  date
hereto until the Effective Time, SCI covenants and agrees to make all filings
it is required to make pursuant to the Exchange Act on a timely basis.
