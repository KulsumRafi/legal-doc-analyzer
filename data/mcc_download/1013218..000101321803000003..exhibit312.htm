<br>
<dir>
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;  on the date fixed pursuant to Section 7.5 of these Bylaws as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting; or<br>
<br>

(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;  if no such record date is so fixed, then (a) at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice of the meeting is given or (b) if notice of the meeting is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.<br>
<br>
</dir>

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise provided in a shareholders agreement, persons holding stock of the Corporation in a fiduciary capacity shall be entitled to vote such stock.  Persons whose stock is pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares, unless in the pledgor's transfer on the books of the Corporation he expressly empowered the pledgee to vote such shares, in which case only the pledgee or the pledgee's proxy may represent and vote such stock.  Stock having voting power standing of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants in common, tenants by entirety or otherwise, or with respect to which two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship, shall be voted in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.<br><br>


(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;  Unless otherwise provided in a shareholders agreement, voting rights may be exercised by the stockholder entitled thereto in person or by the stockholder's proxy appointed by an instrument in writing, subscribed by such stockholder or by his attorney thereunto authorized and delivered to the secretary of the meeting; <U>provided, however</U>, that no proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless that proxy shall provide for a longer period.  A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it so states and if, and only for so long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.  A stockholder who may have given a proxy prior to any meeting shall not, solely by attending such meeting, revoke the same unless he notifies the secretary of the meeting of his intent to revoke the proxy, in writing, prior to the voting of the proxy.  At any meeting of the stockholders at which a quorum is present, all matters (except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, in these Bylaws or by law) shall be decided by the vote of a majority in voting interest of the stockholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereat and thereon.  Voting at any meeting of the stockholders on any question need not be by ballot, unless so directed by the chairman of the meeting.  On a vote by ballot each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or by his proxy, if there be such proxy, and it shall state the number of shares voted.<br>

The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.  The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contenders or its equivalent, shall not of itself create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that he had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Section 5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;  <U>Actions, Etc., by or in the Right of the Corporation</U>.  The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys, fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; <U>provided, however</U>, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Section 5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;  <U>Determination of Right of Indemnification</U>.  Any indemnification under Section 5.1 or 5.2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 5.1 or 5.2. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iii) by the stockholders.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Section 5.10&nbsp;&nbsp;  <U>Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit or Proceeding</U>.  The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article 5 shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators.  Any repeal or modification of the provisions of this Article 5 shall be prospective only and shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.  If a claim under this Article 5 is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses by a director, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring a suit or other proceeding against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim.

Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit or proceeding that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper under the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit or proceeding brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit or proceeding.  In any such suit or proceeding brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover the advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article 5 or otherwise, shall be on the Corporation.<br>
