                                  ARTICLE III

                 The Issuer hereby represents and warrants to Loral as follows:

                 Section 3.1.     Disclosure.  (a)  None of the representations
or warranties of the Issuer contained in this Agreement, or in the exhibits
hereto, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact necessary in order to make any of such representations or
warranties in light of the circumstances under which they were made not
misleading.  The Issuer confirms that it has delivered certain projections to
Loral which Loral has relied upon, in part, in connection with its
determination to consummate the Exchange.  The Issuer makes no representation
or warranty concerning any such projections, except that the Issuer has no
reason to believe that such projections are based on other than the good faith
estimates and assumptions of the management of the Issuer which such management
believes to be reasonable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood
that events included in such projections and assumptions may or may not occur.

                          (b)     There is no fact known to the Issuer which
the Issuer has not disclosed to Loral or which has not otherwise been publicly
disclosed by the Issuer in any document or report previously filed by the
Issuer pursuant to the Exchange Act (other than facts related to general
economic conditions) which materially adversely affects or, insofar as the
Issuer can reasonably foresee, will materially adversely affect, the
properties, business, prospects, operations, earnings, assets, liabilities or
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or the ability of the Issuer to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement.

                 Section 3.2.     Organization and Status.  The Issuer is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and is duly qualified to transact
business in each jurisdiction in which the character of its business makes such
qualification necessary, except where such failure to





                                      -4-
<PAGE>
qualify would not have a material adverse effect on the business, operations,
prospects, properties or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Issuer and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and the Issuer has adequate corporate power
and authority to own its property and assets and to transact the business in
which it is engaged.

                 Section 3.3.     Authorization. (a) The Issuer has the
requisite corporate power to execute, deliver and perform the terms and

                 Section 7.1.     Restrictions on Transfer.  From and after the
Closing Date, neither the Common Stock nor any interest therein shall be
transferable except upon the conditions specified in Sections 7.2 through 7.4,

will cause any proposed transferee of the Common Stock (or any interest
therein) held by it to agree to take and hold such Common Stock (or any
interest therein) subject to the provisions and upon the conditions specified
in Sections 7.2 through 7.4.

                 Section 7.2.     Restrictive Legends.  Each certificate for
Common Stock issued to Loral  or to a subsequent transferee shall (unless
otherwise permitted by the provisions of Section 7.3) include a legend in
substantially the form set forth in the Amended and Restated Stockholders
Agreement.

                 Section 7.3.     Notice of Proposed Transfers.  At least five
Business Days prior to any proposed Transfer of any Common Stock, the holder
thereof shall give written notice to the Issuer of such holder's intention to
effect such Transfer, setting forth the manner and circumstances of the
proposed Transfer in reasonable detail.  Such proposed Transfer may be effected
only if the Issuer shall have received such notice of Transfer accompanied by
(i) an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer addressed to
the Issuer, to the effect that the proposed Transfer of the Common Stock may be
effected without registration under the Securities Act, (ii) representation
letters





                                      -12-

compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act, and (iii) letters in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer from each such transferee
stating such transferee's agreement to be bound by the terms of this Article
VII.  In addition to the requirements set forth herein, Transfers of the Common
Stock may only be made in compliance with the provisions of the Amended and
Restated Stockholders Agreement.  Each certificate evidencing the Common Stock
transferred as above provided shall bear the legend referred to in Section 7.2,
except that such certificate shall not bear the Securities Act legend if the
opinion of counsel referred to above is to the further effect that neither such
legend nor the restrictions on Transfer in Sections 7.2 and 7.3 are required in
order to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act.

                 Section 7.4.     Registration Rights.  Loral  shall be
entitled to the registration rights set forth in the Amended and Restated
Stockholders Agreement with respect to the Common Stock.

and warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall
survive and remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of Loral, or by or on behalf of the Issuer, and shall

                 Section 8.7.     Replacement Securities.  The Issuer agrees to
issue from time to time replacement Common Stock certificates to facilitate

past, present or future stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the
Issuer or of any successor, either directly or through the Issuer or any
success under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or
otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the
acceptance of the Common Stock by the holders thereof and as part of the
consideration for the issue of the Common Stock.
