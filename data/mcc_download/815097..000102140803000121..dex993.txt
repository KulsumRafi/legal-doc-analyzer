2.   Boards of P&O Princess and Carnival

2.1  Board Principles

     P&O Princess and Carnival agree that the following principles are essential
     to the implementation, management and operation of the DLC Structure:

     (A)  P&O Princess and Carnival must operate as if they were a single
          unified economic entity, through boards of directors which comprise
          exactly the same individuals and a unified senior executive
          management, and the Combined

                                                                               9

<PAGE>

          Shareholders shall be treated as if they were shareholders of a
          combined enterprise; and

     (B)  the directors of P&O Princess and Carnival shall, in addition to their
          duties to the company concerned, have regard to the interests of the
          other company and both the holders of P&O Princess Ordinary Shares and
          the holders of Carnival Common Stock as if the two companies were a
          single unified legal entity.

2.2  Board Composition

     Each of Carnival and P&O Princess will therefore do (and will, to the
     extent it is able, procure that each member of its Group will do) all acts
     and things necessary and within their respective powers to ensure that at
     all times the Board of P&O Princess and the Board of Carnival comprise
     exactly the same individuals.

2.3  Indemnification of Directors

     Each of Carnival and P&O Princess will take all actions necessary or
     desirable to ensure that the directors of each company shall be indemnified
     by such company and the other company for any acts or omissions by such
     directors in their capacity as a director of such company, to the maximum
     permitted by Applicable Regulations PROVIDED THAT nothing in this paragraph
     shall affect the obligations provided for in Section 4.8.1 (Director and
     Officer Liability) of the Implementation Agreement.

3.   Equalization of Distributions

3.1  Equalization Principle

     3.1.1 Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, neither Carnival
           nor P&O Princess shall pay or make any Distribution in cash unless
           the other company also pays or makes a Distribution in cash at or
           about the same time and the ratio of the Equalization Distribution
           Amount so paid or made by Carnival to the Equalization Distribution
           Amount so paid or made by P&O Princess (converted, if applicable, at
           the Applicable Exchange Rate for such Distributions and rounded to
           five decimal places) equals the Equalization Ratio in effect on the
           Distribution Determination Date for such Distributions (each, an
           "Equivalent Distribution")

     3.1.2 Subject to Clause 3.1.3, neither Carnival nor P&O Princess shall
           declare or otherwise become obligated to pay or make a Distribution
           in cash unless (i) on the date on which such declaration is made or
           such obligation is created, the other company has sufficient
           Distributable Reserves to make an Equivalent Distribution with
           respect to such Distribution; or (ii) such company agrees to pay, and
           does pay, to the other company (before such other company pays or
           makes such Distribution) the minimum amount required by the other
           company so that it will have sufficient Distributable Reserves to pay
           or make such an Equivalent Distribution. Notwithstanding compliance
           with the preceding sentence, if either of Carnival or P&O Princess
           shall have declared or otherwise become obligated to pay or make an
           Equivalent Distribution and does not have sufficient Distributable
           Reserves to pay or make such Equivalent Distribution when due, then
           the other company shall pay to such company the minimum amount
           required by such company so that it will have sufficient
           Distributable Reserves to pay or make such Equivalent Distribution;
           PROVIDED HOWEVER that if the other company does not have sufficient
           Distributable Reserves to pay or make in full

                                                                              10

<PAGE>

           both the Equivalent Distribution that it declared or became obligated
           to make and the payment required by this sentence, then (1) such
           other company shall only pay or make the portion of that Equivalent
           Distribution (and any related payment that would have been required
           by this sentence in respect of such portion if it were the entire
           Equivalent Distribution that it had declared or became obligated to
           make) that it can make out of its Distributable Reserves; and (2) the
           first company shall only pay or make the portion of its Equivalent
           Distribution that it can make out of its Distributable Reserves
           following receipt of such payment.

     3.1.3 For the purposes of Clause 3.1.2, the amount a company is required to
           pay the other company shall be determined after taking into account
           all Taxes payable by, and all Tax Benefits of, the parties with
           respect to the payment or receipt of such payment and any such
           payment may be made on the Equalization Share issued by the paying
           party if both Boards deem it appropriate.

3.2  Timing of Equalized Distributions

     The parties agree that, insofar as is practical, the Boards of P&O Princess
     and Carnival shall:

     (A)   in relation to any proposed cash Distribution, agree the amount of
           the Equivalent Distribution to be made by each company;

     (B)   determine to pay or recommend to pay Equivalent Distributions at
           Board meetings convened as close in time to each other as is
           practicable;

     (C)   announce and pay their Equivalent Distributions simultaneously or as
           close in time as is practicable;

     (D)   ensure that the record dates for receipt of the Equivalent
           Distributions are on the same date; and

     (E)   generally co-ordinate the timing of all other aspects of the payment
           or making of Equivalent Distributions.

4.   Capital Actions

4.1  Equalization Principle

     The capital of the DLC Structure is to be deployed and managed in the most
     effective way for the benefit of the Combined Shareholders. Solely for
     purposes of construing the provisions of this Clause 4 and the Schedule,
     and without providing an independent basis for requiring any adjustment to
     the Carnival Equivalent Number or the Equalization Ratio or other action
     hereunder, Carnival and P&O Princess further intend to undertake Actions in
     such a way as will not give rise to a materially different financial effect
     as between the interests of the holders of Carnival Common Stock and the
     interests of the holders of P&O Princess Ordinary Shares, unless approved
     as a Class Rights Action.

4.2  Automatic Adjustment

     If any Action by Carnival or P&O Princess is covered by the Schedule, then
     an automatic adjustment to the Carnival Equivalent Number (and therefore
     the Equalization Ratio) will occur pursuant to such Schedule unless the
     Board of the other company, in its sole discretion, undertakes:

                                                                              11

<PAGE>

     (A)  a Matching Action; or

     (B)  an alternative to such automatic adjustment, that has been approved as
          such by a Class Rights Action,

     it being understood that the Board of the other company is under no
     obligation to undertake any such Matching Action or to seek approval as a
     Class Rights Action of any such alternative.

4.3  Other Actions

     If any Action by Carnival or P&O Princess is not covered by the Schedule,
     then no automatic adjustment to the Carnival Equivalent Number or the
     Equalization Ratio will occur but the Board of the other company shall have
     the right (in its sole discretion), but not the obligation (i) to undertake
     a Matching Action; or (ii) to seek approval of an adjustment to the
     Carnival Equivalent Number (and therefore the Equalization Ratio) as a
     Class Rights Action in order to ensure that the proposed Action does not
     give rise to materially different financial effects as between the
     interests of the holders of Carnival Common Stock and the interests of
     holders of P&O Princess Ordinary Shares. In all cases, the Boards of P&O
     Princess and Carnival will co-operate in deciding what (if any) Actions or
     Matching Actions to undertake.

4.4  No Adjustment Required

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Clause 4 or the Schedule, no
     adjustment to the Carnival Equivalent Number or the Equalization Ratio will
     be required on the following Actions:

     (A)  grants or issuances by Carnival or P&O Princess of their equity
          securities, or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or
          exercisable for, their equity securities ("equity equivalents"), under
          scrip dividend or dividend reinvestment schemes where the market value
          of the equity securities or equity equivalents granted or issued
          (determined in the manner customary for such schemes or plans in the
          jurisdictions in which they operate) is equal to, or less than, the
          cash amount of the dividend waived or reinvested;

     (B)  issuances of equity securities or equity equivalents by either P&O
          Princess or Carnival pursuant to a share or stock option or purchase
          or other benefit plan to or on behalf of any one or more of the
          directors, officers, employees or consultants (in their capacity as
          such) of such company or any of its Subsidiaries, which plans are
          either:

          (i)  in existence prior to the date of this Agreement; or

          (ii) approved by the relevant Board and as otherwise required by
               Applicable Regulations;

     (C)  any issuance of Carnival Common Stock under the Carnival Convertible
          Instruments;

     (D)  other issuances by Carnival or P&O Princess of its equity securities
          or equity equivalents to any person, including for acquisitions, other
          than by way of rights to the holders of its Shares as a class;

                                                                              12

<PAGE>

     (E)  repurchases or buy-backs by Carnival or P&O Princess of its Shares as
          follows:

          (i)    in the market in an offer (1) not made by way of rights to the
                 holders of its Shares; or (2) in compliance with Rule 10b-18
                 (under the US Securities Exchange Act);

          (ii)   (other than under the preceding sub-clause (i)) at or below
                 market price of such Shares (1) in the case of a repurchase or
                 buy-back at a fixed price, on the Dealing Day immediately
                 preceding the date on which such repurchase or buy-back is
                 announced; or (2) otherwise, on the Dealing Day immediately
                 preceding the date on which such repurchase or buy-back is
                 made;

          (iii)  any purchase by Carnival of Excess Shares (as defined in the
                 Carnival Articles and By-laws) under Article XIII of the
                 Carnival Articles (or any equivalent amended articles of
                 Carnival's Articles);

          (iv)   any purchase pursuant to the provisions of the Carnival
                 Articles and By-laws or the P&O Princess Memorandum and
                 Articles referred to in Clause 8; and

          (v)    pro rata by way of rights to the Combined Shareholders at the
                 same amount of premium to the market value of the relevant
                 Shares (as adjusted by the Equalization Ratio);

     (F)  Matching Actions;

     (G)  the issue of an Equalization Share in accordance with Clause 14 by
          either party;

     (H)  any purchase, cancellation or reduction of Disenfranchised P&O
          Ordinary Shares;

     (I)  any purchase, cancellation or reduction of Disenfranchised Carnival
          Common Stock; and

     (J)  any distribution of shares of beneficial interest in the P&O Princess
          SVT by Carnival in accordance with the Pairing Agreement among P&O
          Princess Trustee, Carnival and the transfer agent thereunder, of even
          date herewith.

4.5  Matching Action

     For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Matching Action" means, in relation
     to an Action in respect of the holders of Shares of Carnival or P&O
     Princess (the "Primary Action"), an Action in respect of the holders of
     Shares in the other company which the Board of such other company
     determines (i) has a financial effect on the holders of the Shares of such
     other company equivalent (but not necessarily identical) to the financial
     effect of the Primary Action on the holders of Shares of the company
     undertaking the Primary Action; and (ii) does not materially disadvantage
     the holders of the Shares of either company. In making the determination
     referred to in the preceding sentence:

     (A)  the Board of such other company shall consider the then existing
          Equalization Ratio, the timing of the Primary Action and any proposed
          Matching Action, and any other relevant circumstances;

                                                                              13

<PAGE>

     (B)  in relation to any Action, when calculating any economic return to the
          holders of P&O Princess Ordinary Shares or Carnival Common Stock, any
          Tax or Tax Benefit shall be disregarded; and

     (C)  the Boards of Carnival and P&O Princess shall have no obligation to
          take into account any fluctuations in exchange rates or in the market
          value of any securities or any other changes in circumstances arising
          after the date on which the Boards of Carnival and P&O Princess, as
          the case may be, decide to undertake a particular Matching Action.

4.6  Boards' Decisions Final

     The decision as to whether an Action is a Matching Action shall be a
     decision solely for the Boards of P&O Princess and Carnival, which may
     obtain appropriate professional advice in connection with such
     determination if they, in their sole discretion, consider it to be
     appropriate. Any such decision made by the Boards of P&O Princess and
     Carnival in accordance with this Clause 4 shall be final and binding.

            (B)  there shall be no restriction on the issue of P&O Princess
                 Ordinary Shares to a member of the Carnival Group.

            in accordance with Applicable Regulations.

6.   Separate Approvals of Class Rights Actions

6.1  Class Rights Action

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
     either P&O Princess or Carnival proposes to take any of the following
     actions:

     (A)  the voluntary Liquidation of such company for which the approval of
          shareholders is required by Applicable Regulations or otherwise sought
          other than a voluntary Liquidation of both companies at or about the
          same time with the purpose or effect of no longer continuing the
          operation of the businesses of the companies as a combined going
          concern and not as part of a scheme, plan, transaction, or series of
          related transactions the primary purpose or effect of which is to
          reconstitute all or a substantial part of such businesses in one or
          more successor entities;

     (B)  the sale, lease exchange or other disposition of all or substantially
          all of the assets of such company, other than in a bona fide
          commercial transaction undertaken for a valid business purpose in
          which such company receives consideration with a fair market value
          reasonably equivalent to the assets disposed of and not as a part of a
          scheme, plan, transaction or series of related transactions the
          primary purpose or effect of which is to collapse or unify the DLC
          Structure;

     (C)  any adjustment to the Carnival Equivalent Number or the Equalization
          Ratio otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this
          Agreement;

     (D)  except where specifically provided for in the relevant agreements, any
          amendment to the terms of, or termination of, this Agreement, the SVE
          Special Voting Deed, the P&O Princess Guarantee or the Carnival
          Guarantee (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the voluntary
          termination of either Guarantee);

     (E)  any amendment to, removal or alteration of the effect of (which shall
          include the ratification of any breach of) any P&O Princess Entrenched
          Provision or any Carnival Entrenched Provision;

                                                                              17

<PAGE>

     (F)  any amendment to, removal or alteration of the effect of (which shall
          include the ratification of any breach of) Article XII or XIII of the
          Carnival Articles that would cause, or at the time of implementation
          would be reasonably likely to cause, an Exchange Event described in
          clause (a) of the definition of such term in the P&O Princess Articles
          to occur; and

     (G)  the doing of anything which the Boards of Carnival and P&O Princess
          agree (either in a particular case or generally), in their absolute
          discretion, should be approved as a Class Rights Action,

     each of them agrees with the other that it shall only take such action
     after it has been approved as a Class Rights Action in accordance with this
     Clause 6.

6.2  Approvals of Class Rights Action

     A Class Rights Action shall require approval by a Majority Resolution of
     each company, unless Applicable Regulations and/or the Carnival Articles
     and By-laws and the P&O Princess Memorandum and Articles (as relevant)
     require such Class Rights Action to be approved as a Supermajority
     Resolution by either or both companies, in which case it shall be approved
     as a Supermajority Resolution by the relevant company or companies to which
     such requirement applies (the "Required Majority").

6.3  Class Rights Procedure

     A Class Rights Action must be approved separately by the Required Majority
     of (i) the holders of the Carnival Common Stock and the holders of any
     other class of shares of Carnival that are entitled to vote pursuant to
     Applicable Regulations and/or the Carnival Articles and By-laws; and (ii)
     the holders of the P&O Princess Ordinary Shares and the holders of any
     other class of shares of P&O Princess that are entitled to vote pursuant to
     Applicable Regulations and/or the P&O Princess Memorandum and Articles.
     Each of Carnival and P&O Princess will convene a shareholders meeting at
     which the holders of its Shares and the holder of its Special Voting Share
     (and the holders of any other relevant class of shares) may vote upon the
     Class Rights Action together as a single class on a poll; PROVIDED THAT the
     holder of the relevant Special Voting Share shall not vote on such
     resolution unless the Class Rights Action is not approved by the Required
     Majority of the holders of Shares (and any other relevant class of shares)
     of the other company, in which case the holder of the Special Voting Share
     shall cast all votes to which the Special Voting Share is entitled against
     such resolution in accordance with the Carnival Articles and By-laws (in
     the case of the Carnival Special Voting Share) or in accordance with the
     P&O Princess Articles of Association (in the case of the P&O Princess
     Special Voting Share).

7.   Meetings and Voting

7.1  Obligations to convene meetings

     In relation to both Joint Electorate Actions and Class Rights Actions:

     (A)  each party shall, as soon as practicable, convene a meeting of its
          shareholders for the purpose of considering a resolution to approve
          the Joint Electorate Action or Class Rights Action;

                                                                              18

<PAGE>

     (B)   each party shall endeavour to ensure such meetings are held on dates
           as close together as is practicable; and

     (C)   the parties shall co-operate fully with each other in preparing
           resolutions, explanatory memoranda or any other information or
           material required in connection with the proposed Joint Electorate
           Action or Class Rights Action.

7.2  Poll

     Each of P&O Princess and Carnival agrees with the other that any resolution
     proposed at a meeting of its shareholders in relation to which the holder
     of the P&O Princess Special Voting Share, or the holder of the Carnival
     Special Voting Share, is or may be entitled to vote shall be decided on by
     a poll (i.e. by tabulation of individual votes) and not, for the avoidance
     of doubt, on a show of hands.

7.3  Timing of Poll

     7.3.1 P&O Princess agrees with Carnival that any poll in which the holder
           of the P&O Princess Special Voting Share is or may be entitled to
           vote shall (as regards the P&O Princess Special Voting Share) be kept
           open for such time as to allow the corresponding general meeting of
           Carnival to be held and for the votes attaching to the P&O Princess
           Special Voting Share to be calculated and cast on such poll, although
           such poll may be closed earlier in respect of shares of other
           classes.

     7.3.2 Carnival agrees with P&O Princess that any poll on which the holder
           of the Carnival Special Voting Share is or may be entitled to vote
           shall (as regards the Carnival Special Voting Share) be kept open for
           such time as to allow the corresponding general meeting of P&O
           Princess to be held and for the votes attaching to the Carnival
           Special Voting Share to be calculated and cast on such poll, although
           such poll may be closed earlier in respect of shares of other
           classes.

7.4  Discretionary Matters

     The Boards of P&O Princess and Carnival may by agreement (subject to
     Applicable Regulations):

     (A)   decide to seek the approval of the shareholders (or any class of
           shareholders) of either or both of P&O Princess and Carnival for any
           matter that would not otherwise require such approval;

     (B)   require any Joint Electorate Action to be approved instead as a Class
           Rights Action; or

     (C)   specify a higher majority vote than the majority that would otherwise
           be required for any shareholder vote provided for in this Clause 7.

7.5  Procedural Resolutions

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
     resolutions of Carnival or P&O Princess of a procedural or technical nature
     (and which do not adversely affect the other company or its shareholders in
     any material respect) shall not constitute Joint Electorate Actions or
     Class Rights Actions and will be voted on by the relevant company's
     shareholders voting separately, and neither Special Voting Share will

                                                                              19

<PAGE>

     have any vote on those resolutions. Resolutions which will constitute
     resolutions of a procedural or technical nature may include any resolution:

     (A)    that certain people be allowed to attend or excluded from attending
            the meeting;

     (B)    that discussion be closed and the question put to the vote (provided
            no amendments have been raised);

     (C)    that the question under discussion not be put to the vote;

     (D)    to proceed with matters in an order other than that set out in the
            notice of the meeting;

     (E)    to adjourn the debate (for example, to a subsequent meeting); and

     (F)    to adjourn the meeting.

8.   Change of Control of Either P&O Princess or Carnival

     Carnival and P&O Princess shall co-operate with each other in the prompt
     enforcement of the provisions of Articles XIV and XV of the Carnival
     Articles and Articles 277 to 286 of the P&O Princess Articles of
     Association to the full extent possible under law.

9.   Stock Exchanges

     Each of P&O Princess and Carnival will, and so far as it is able will
     ensure that each of its Subsidiaries will, ensure that it is in a position
     to comply with obligations imposed on it by all stock exchanges on which
     either or both of the parties' shares (or other securities or depository
     receipts representing such shares or securities) are from time to time
     listed, quoted or traded.

10.  Liquidation

10.1 Liquidation Principle

     If either or both of Carnival and/or P&O Princess goes into any voluntary
     or involuntary Liquidation, Carnival and P&O Princess will, subject to
     Clause 10.2 below, make and receive such payments or take such other
     actions required to ensure that the holders of Shares (which, for the
     avoidance of doubt in this Clause 10 do not include the holders of
     Disenfranchised Shares) of each entity would, had each entity gone into
     Liquidation on the same date, be entitled to receive a Liquidation
     Distribution which is equivalent on a per Share basis in accordance with
     the then existing Equalization Ratio, having regard to the Liquidation
     Exchange Rate but ignoring any shareholder Tax or Tax Benefit.

10.2 Liquidation Procedure

     10.2.1 To establish the amount payable under Clause 10.1, each of Carnival
            and P&O Princess will determine the amount of assets (if any) it
            will have available for distribution in a Liquidation on the date of
            Liquidation (or notional date of Liquidation) to holders of its
            Shares after payment of all its debts and other financial
            obligations, including any tax costs associated with the realisation
            of any assets on a Liquidation and any payments due on any
            preference shares (its "Net Assets"). To the extent that the Net
            Assets of one company would enable it to make a Liquidation
            Distribution to the holders of its Shares that is greater than

                                                                              20

<PAGE>

            the Liquidation Distribution that the other company could pay from
            its Net Assets to the holders of its Shares, adjusting such
            comparative Liquidation Distribution in accordance with the then
            existing Equalization Ratio and having regard to the Liquidation
            Exchange Rate, but ignoring any shareholder Tax (including any
            withholding Tax required to be deducted by the company concerned) or
            Tax Benefit, then, subject to Clause 10.2.2, such company will make
            a balancing payment (or take any other balancing action described in
            Clause 10.3 below) in such amount as will ensure that both companies
            may make equivalent Liquidation Distributions to the holders of
            their Shares in accordance with the then existing Equalization Ratio
            and having regard to the Liquidation Exchange Rate, but ignoring any
            shareholder Tax (including any withholding Tax required to be
            deducted by the company concerned) or Tax Benefit, PROVIDED ALWAYS
            THAT no company need make a balancing payment (or take any other
            action) as described in this Clause 10.2 if it would result in
            neither the holders of Carnival Common Stock nor the holders of P&O
            Princess Ordinary Shares being entitled to receive any Liquidation
            Distribution at all.

     10.2.2 For purposes of Clause 10.2.1, the amount a company is required to
            pay the other company shall be determined after taking into account
            all Taxes payable by, and all Tax credits, losses or deductions of,
            the parties with respect to the payment or receipt of such payment
            and any such payment may be made on the Equalization Share issued by
            the paying party if both Boards deem it appropriate.

10.3 Liquidation Actions

     In giving effect to the principle regarding a Liquidation of Carnival
     and/or P&O Princess described above, Carnival and P&O Princess shall take
     such action as may be required to give effect to that principle, which may
     include:

     (A)    making a payment (of cash or in specie) to the other company;

     (B)    issuing shares (which may include the Equalization Share) to the
            other party or to holders of Shares of the other party and making a
            distribution or return on such Shares; or

     (C)    taking any other action that the Boards of Carnival and P&O Princess
            shall both consider appropriate to give effect to that principle.

     Any action other than a payment of cash by one company to the other shall
     require the prior approval of the Boards of both companies.

11.  Termination

     Either Carnival or P&O Princess may terminate this Agreement:

     (A)    on the mutual agreement of both parties (upon approval as a Class
            Rights Action);

     (B)    if either party becomes a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the other; or

     (C)    after all Liquidation obligations under Clause 10 have been
            satisfied.

                                                                              21

<PAGE>

12.  Consequences of Termination

12.1 Non Dual-Listed Group

     In any combination of Carnival and P&O Princess into a single non
     dual-listed group, the consideration to be received by the holders of
     Shares in the two companies will be calculated by reference to the
     applicable Equalization Ratio.

12.2 Other Circumstances

     12.2.1 In any other circumstances of termination of the DLC Structure, the
            Boards of Carnival and P&O Princess will use their reasonable
            endeavours to agree a termination proposal to be put to their
            shareholders which the Boards consider to be equitable to both the
            holders of Carnival Common Stock and the holders of P&O Princess
            Ordinary Shares, at the applicable Equalization Ratio and using an
            exchange rate agreed by the parties (failing which, such exchange
            rate to be determined by an independent accounting firm). If the
            Boards cannot agree on the proposal to be put to their respective
            holders of Shares, each Board will appoint an independent accounting
            firm to establish the value of its company as at the proposed date
            of termination. The two accounting firms will use the same
            principles of valuation. If the accounting firms fail to agree on
            each other's valuation of any company, then a third independent
            accounting firm shall be appointed to finally determine the value of
            such company or companies. If, subject to Clause 12.2.2, the
            agreed/determined respective values of each company on a per Share
            basis (using the agreed or determined exchange rate) are not
            equivalent in accordance with the Equalization Ratio at the proposed
            date of termination then a balancing payment, or other balancing
            action agreed by the companies, will be made by one company to the
            other as appropriate in such amount as will ensure that such values
            are equivalent in accordance with such Equalization Ratio.

     12.2.2 For purposes of Clause 12.2.1, the amount a company is required to
            pay the other company shall be determined after taking into account
            all Taxes payable by, and all Tax credits, losses or deductions of,
            the parties with respect to the payment or receipt of such payment
            and any such payment may be made on the Equalization Share issued by
            the paying party if both Boards deem it appropriate.

13.  Personal rights only

13.1 Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 2001

     The parties to this Agreement do not intend that any term of this Agreement
     should be enforceable, by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties)
     Act 2001, by any person who is not a party to this Agreement.

13.2 Personal rights

     For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Agreement are personal
     rights only. They do not, and are not intended to, create any proprietary
     right (including any proprietary right in any member, shareholder or
     creditor of P&O Princess or Carnival). These undertakings are not
     assignable, and cannot be subject to a mortgage, charge, pledge,
     encumbrance or other security interest. These undertakings do not survive
     any termination of this Agreement. It is fundamental to the agreement of
     each of P&O

                                                                              22

<PAGE>

     Princess and Carnival to give these undertakings that they should be relied
     on solely by the other, and it is fundamental to the agreement of each of
     P&O Princess and Carnival to accept these undertakings that they should be
     performed solely by the other.

14.  Issue of Equalization Shares

     The parties agree that the Board of P&O Princess and the Board of Carnival
     may agree to the issue of the P&O Princess Equalization Share to a member
     of the Carnival Group (against the nominal value of that share) and of the
     Carnival Equalization Share to a member of the P&O Princess Group (against
     the nominal value of that share), but that neither Carnival or P&O Princess
     shall issue its Equalization Share unless the Board of Carnival and the
     Board of P&O Princess shall have agreed to such issue.

15.  Relationship with other documents

     In the event of any conflict between this Agreement on the one hand and on
     the other hand either of the P&O Princess Memorandum and Articles or the
     Carnival Articles and By-laws, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail
     and the parties shall use their best endeavours to ensure that any required
     amendment to the P&O Princess Memorandum and Articles or the Carnival

20.  Arbitration

     (A)  Any and all disputes, controversies or claims arising out of or in
          connection with this Agreement, any provision hereof, or any alleged
          breach hereof, and any and all disputes, controversies or claims
          relating to the validity of this Agreement (all of which are referred
          to herein as "Disputes"), even though some or all of such Disputes are
          alleged to be extra-contractual in nature, whether such Disputes sound
          in contract, tort or otherwise, at law or in equity, whether for
          damages, specific performance or other relief, shall be finally and
          exclusively determined by final and binding arbitration in accordance
          with this Clause 20.

     (B)  The arbitral tribunal (the "Tribunal") shall be composed of three
          arbitrators, which shall be appointed as follows: each party shall
          have the right to appoint one arbitrator; the two arbitrators so
          appointed shall then appoint a third arbitrator who shall serve as the
          Chairman of the Tribunal. A person or persons, entitled to appoint an
          arbitrator, shall appoint such arbitrator within ten (10) days of
          receiving notice from a party of the commencement of an arbitration,
          failing which such arbitrator shall, at the written request of either
          party, be appointed by the International Chamber of Commerce. At the
          initiation of a proceeding and upon the convening of the Tribunal, the
          arbitrators shall take an oath of neutrality and shall decide the
          matters presented to them based upon the evidence submitted in the
          proceeding and without regard to the origin or circumstances of their
          appointment or selection for service on the Tribunal.

     (C)  The construction and interpretation of this Clause 20, and all rules
          of conduct of any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Clause 20
          (including procedural and evidentiary matters), shall be determined by
          the Tribunal. Unless otherwise unanimously agreed by the arbitrators,
          the venue of the arbitration shall be Miami, Florida, USA.

     (D)  The Tribunal shall conduct a hearing as soon as reasonably practicable
          after a matter has been submitted for arbitration by a party and the
          members of the Tribunal have been selected. As the Tribunal may direct
          and without the necessity of subpoenas or other court orders, the
          parties shall make their agents, employees and witnesses available
          upon reasonable notice at reasonable times for deposition or for
          testimony at the hearing and shall respond to requests for documents.
          An award completely disposing of all Disputes (a "Final Award") shall
          be rendered by the Tribunal as soon as reasonably practicable after
          the hearing. The Tribunal shall not be required to submit a detailed
          statement of its reasons, but shall set forth concisely in the Final
          Award the amounts, actions, contractual responsibilities or other
          remedial conclusions that the Tribunal determines to be appropriate.

     (E)  Each party acknowledges and agrees that in the event either party
          breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement, the other party
          would be irreparably harmed and could not be made whole by monetary
          damages alone. Both parties accordingly agree that the Tribunal shall
          have the authority to grant any party all appropriate non-monetary
          relief, including ordering a breaching party to comply fully with its
          obligations under the Agreement, ordering specific performance or
          granting temporary or permanent injunctive relief; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
          that nothing in this Clause 20 shall be construed to limit the
          Tribunal in awarding

                                                                              25

<PAGE>

          monetary damages, whether as a sole remedy or together with remedies
          for specific performance and/or injunctive relief.

     (F)  Any award made by the Tribunal shall be final and binding upon each
          party, each of which expressly waives all right to appeal or recourse
          to any court. The Final Award may be confirmed, and a judgement
          entered or enforced, in any court of competent jurisdiction in the
          United States or the United Kingdom.

     (G)  The fees and expenses of the arbitrators shall be borne equally by the
          parties, but the Final Award may include such allocations and awards
          of the arbitrators' fees and expenses as the Tribunal determines is
          appropriate.

IN WITNESS whereof this Agreement has been executed on the date first written
above.

                                                                              26

                                    Schedule

             Automatic Adjustments to the Carnival Equivalent Number

1.   Automatic Adjustments

1.1  Rights issue of Shares

     If either Carnival or P&O Princess (the "Relevant Company") shall offer its
     Shares to the holders of its Shares as a class by way of rights at less
     than the Current Market Price of such Shares, the Carnival Equivalent
     Number shall be adjusted by:

          (i)   dividing the Carnival Equivalent Number by the following
                fraction where Carnival is the Relevant Company; and

          (ii)  multiplying the Carnival Equivalent Number by the following
                fraction where P&O Princess is the Relevant Company:

                              K + L           Q
                              ----- where L = - M
                              K + M           P

     where:

     K is the number of Shares of the Relevant Company which rank for the
     relevant offer;

     M is the aggregate number of Shares being offered to the holders of Shares
     of the Relevant Company;

     P is the Current Market Price of one Share of the Relevant Company; and

     Q is the price per Share being offered to the holders of Shares of the
     Relevant Company.

     The adjustment to the Carnival Equivalent Number shall become effective
     from the later of the time at which the Shares of the Relevant Company are
     first traded ex-rights and the time at which the issue of the Shares
     becomes wholly unconditional.

1.2  Rights issue of other securities

     If the Relevant Company shall offer any securities (other than a rights
     issue of Shares described in paragraph 1.1 of this Schedule) to holders of
     its Shares as a class by way of rights, or grant to such shareholders as a
     class by way of rights, any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe
     for, purchase or sell any securities, Carnival Equivalent Number shall be
     adjusted by:

          (i)   dividing the Carnival Equivalent Number by the following
                fraction where Carnival is the Relevant Company; and

          (ii)  multiplying the Carnival Equivalent Number by the following
                fraction where P&O Princess is the Relevant Company:

                R - S
                -----
                  R

                                                                              27

<PAGE>

     where:

     R is the Current Market Price of one Share; and

     S is the estimated Fair Market Value (calculated in the same currency as
     the Shares described in R above) of the portion of the rights attributable
     to one Share of the Relevant Company over any five consecutive Dealing Days
     determined by the Board of the Relevant Company during the twenty Dealing
     Days preceding the date on which the Shares are first traded ex-rights.

     The adjustment to the Carnival Equivalent Number shall become effective
     from the later of the time at which the Shares of the Relevant Company are
     first traded ex-rights and the time at which the issue of the Shares
     becomes wholly unconditional.

1.3  Non cash distributions and share repurchases

     If the Relevant Company shall implement (i) any distribution of any
     non-cash assets; or (ii) any repurchase of its Shares involving an offer
     made to all or substantially all of its holders of Shares to repurchase
     their Shares at a premium to the Current Market Price of such shares, the
     Carnival Equivalent Number shall be adjusted by:

          (i)   dividing the Carnival Equivalent Number by the following
                fraction where Carnival is the Relevant Company; and

          (ii)  multiplying the Carnival Equivalent Number by the following
                fraction where P&O Princess is the Relevant Company:

                    V
                T - -
                    U
                -----
                  T

     where:

     T is the Current Market Price of one Share of the Relevant Company;

     U is equal to the number of Shares of the Relevant Company prior to the non
     cash distribution or repurchase; and

     V is (i) in the case of a non cash distribution, the aggregate Fair Market
     Value of the assets distributed to shareholders of the Relevant Company;
     and (ii) in the case of a repurchase, the aggregate premium paid to holders
     of Shares; in either case denominated in the same currency as the Current
     Market Price referred to in T and disregarding the effect of any
     shareholder Taxes or Tax Benefits and/or any fees incurred in connection
     with the non-cash Distribution or repurchase.

     The adjustment to the Carnival Equivalent Number shall become effective
     immediately following implementation of the non-cash Distribution or
     repurchase.

1.4  Consolidation or subdivision of shares

     If there shall be a change to the number of Shares of the Relevant Company
     as a result of a consolidation or subdivision of shares, the Carnival
     Equivalent Number shall be adjusted by:

                                                                              28

<PAGE>

          (i)   dividing the Carnival Equivalent Number by the following
                fraction where Carnival is the Relevant Company; and

          (ii)  multiplying the Carnival Equivalent Number by the following
                fraction where P&O Princess is the Relevant Company:

           X
           -
           Y

     where:

     X is the number of Shares of the Relevant Company outstanding or in issue
     immediately before such alteration; and

     Y is the number of Shares of the Relevant Company outstanding or in issue
     immediately after such alteration.

     The adjustment to the Carnival Equivalent Number shall become effective
     immediately after the alteration takes effect.

1.5  Bonus issue or stock dividend

     If the Relevant Company issues any Shares to holders of Shares for no
     consideration or solely by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves,
     the Carnival Equivalent Number shall be adjusted by:

          (i)   dividing the Carnival Equivalent Number following fraction where
                Carnival is the Relevant Company; and

          (ii)  multiplying the Carnival Equivalent Number by the following
                fraction where P&O Princess is the Relevant Company:

           X
           -
           Y

     where:

     X is the number of Shares of the Relevant Company outstanding immediately
     before the issue; and

     Y is the number of Shares of the Relevant Company outstanding immediately
     after such issue.

     The adjustment to the Carnival Equivalent Number shall become effective
     from the time the issue of such Shares becomes wholly unconditional.

2.   Certification

     certify the arithmetical adjustment to be made to the Carnival Equivalent
     Number in the circumstances set out in this Schedule where an adjustment is
     made to such Carnival Equivalent Number and any adjustments so certified
     shall, in the absence of manifest error, be final and binding on the
     parties and on all others affected thereby. P&O Princess and Carnival agree
     with each other to make and co-ordinate such public announcements

                                                                              29
