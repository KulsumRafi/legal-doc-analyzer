purchase price of $15,000,000 (such aggregate purchase price of $15,000,000, as
adjusted pursuant to Section 1.1(a)(ii), the "Committed Amount"). The Preferred
Shares to be purchased and sold at Closing shall be issued pursuant to a
certificate of designation substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the

Warrants for no additional consideration, provided, however, that if the
Committed Amount and the number of Preferred Shares to be purchased and sold at

Warrants issuable at the Closing to the Purchaser shall be proportionately
reduced. The Warrants shall be issued pursuant to a warrant agreement,
substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto, which shall be in effect as of
the Closing (the "Warrant Agreement").

          (c)  At the Closing, the Company shall issue to the Purchaser, in

available funds to an account designated in writing by the Company (such

the Closing Date), and such other instruments and documents as are specified in
Section 5.3.

          1.4. Capitalized Terms. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in

                                  ARTICLE III
                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASER

          The Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company with respect to
the Securities it is acquiring hereunder as of the date hereof and as of the
Effective Date, as set forth in this Article III.

          3.1. Acquisition for Investment. The Purchaser is acquiring the
Securities for its own account, for investment and not with a view to, or for
sale in connection with, the distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act (it being understood that except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, the Purchaser
does not agree to hold the Securities for any minimum or other specific term and
reserves the right to dispose of the Securities at any time in accordance with
the Securities Act and state securities laws applicable to such disposition).

          3.2. Accredited Investor Status. The Purchaser is an "accredited
investor," as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. The Purchaser has sufficient knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of its investment in the Securities and is capable of bearing the economic
risks of such investment. The Purchaser understands that its investment in the
Securities involves a significant degree of risk.

          3.3. Information. The Purchaser and its advisers have been furnished
with all materials relating to the business, finances and operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and materials relating to the offer and sale of the
Securities which have been requested by the Purchaser or its advisers. The
Purchaser and its advisers have been afforded the opportunity to ask questions
of the Company's management concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries and the
Securities. The Purchaser has been provided with copies of, and has carefully
reviewed, the SEC Reports and the Bankruptcy Documents.

          3.4. Government Review. The Purchaser understands that no Governmental
Entity has passed upon or made any recommendation or endorsement of the
Securities.

          3.5. Sale or Transfer. The Purchaser understands that (i) except as
provided in this Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement, the sale or
re-sale of the Securities has not been and is not being registered under the
Securities Act or any applicable

                                       7

<PAGE>

state securities laws, and the Securities may not be sold or otherwise
transferred unless (a) the Securities are sold or transferred pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws, (b) the Purchaser shall have delivered to the Company an
opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope
customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that
the Securities to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to
an exemption from such registration, or (c) the Securities are sold pursuant to
Rule 144 under the Securities Act; (ii) any sale of such Securities made in
reliance on Rule 144 may be made only in accordance with the terms of such Rule
and further, if such Rule is not applicable, any sale of such Securities under
circumstances in which the seller (or the person through whom the sale is made)
may be deemed to be an underwriter (as that term is defined in the Securities
Act) may require compliance with another exemption under the Securities Act or
the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder; and (iii) neither the Company
nor any other Person is under any obligation to register such Securities under
the Securities Act or any state securities laws or to comply with the terms and
conditions of any exemption thereunder (in each case, other than pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement). The Purchaser shall not transfer any of the
Securities held by the Purchaser to any Affiliate of the Purchaser whose
acquisition or ownership of such Securities would reasonably be likely to result
in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries becoming subject to regulation
pursuant to PUHCA or the PUHCA Regulations other than such regulation which is
applicable to an ETC that is an affiliate of a public utility holding company
registered under PUHCA.

          3.6. Residency. The principal offices of the Purchaser and the offices
of the Purchaser in which it made its decision to purchase the Securities are
located at the address set forth in the preamble to this Agreement.

          3.7. No Brokers or Finders. No agent, broker, investment banker or
other Person is or shall be entitled to any broker's or finder's fee or any
other commission or similar fee from the Purchaser in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur on the Closing Date.

          3.8. Organization. (a) The Purchaser is an entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
formation and has the requisite power and authority to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted.

          (b) SCANA represents and warrants that it is registered with the SEC
as a public utility holding company under PUHCA. Neither the execution, delivery
or performance by SCANA of this Agreement nor the performance by SCANA of any
other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, including the acquisition
and ownership of the Securities by SCANA, shall result in the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries becoming subject to regulation pursuant to PUHCA or the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "PUHCA Regulations") other than such
regulation which is applicable to an ETC that is an affiliate of a public
utility holding company registered under PUHCA. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required prior to, in connection with, or as a result
of the acquisition and ownership of Securities by SCANA to make or obtain any
Consents, Approvals and Filings with

                                       8

pursuant to PUHCA or the PUHCA Regulations.

          3.9.  Due Authorization. The Purchaser has the requisite power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and each of the other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery by the Purchaser of this
Agreement and each of the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and
the compliance by the Purchaser with each of the provisions of this Agreement
and each of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party (including the
consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby) (i) are within the power and authority of the Purchaser and (ii) have
been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Purchaser. This
Agreement has been, and each of the other Transaction Documents to which it is a
party when executed and delivered by the Purchaser shall be, duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Purchaser. Assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party,
this Agreement constitutes, and each of such other Transaction Documents when
executed and delivered by the Purchaser shall constitute, a valid and binding
agreement of the Purchaser enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforcement is limited by bankruptcy, insolvency and
other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
for limitations imposed by general principles of equity.

          3.10. Consents; No Violations. Neither the execution, delivery or
performance by the Purchaser of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall (i) conflict with, or result in a breach or
a violation of, any provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
other organizational documents of the Purchaser; (ii) constitute, with or
without notice or the passage of time or both, a breach, violation or default,
create an Encumbrance, or give rise to any right of termination, modification,
cancellation, prepayment, suspension, limitation, revocation or acceleration,
under any Law, or any provision of any agreement or other instrument to which
the Purchaser is a party or pursuant to which the Purchaser or any of its assets
or properties is subject, except for breaches, violations, defaults,
Encumbrances, or rights of termination, modification, cancellation, prepayment,
suspension, limitation, revocation or acceleration, which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not materially adversely affect the ability of the
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Transaction Document to which it is a party; or (iii) require any Consents,
Approvals and Filings on the part of the Purchaser, except for (a) the Consents,
Approvals and Filings required under the Exchange Act and applicable state
securities laws, (b) the Consents, Approvals and Filings set forth on Schedule
3.10 and (c) such other Consents, Approvals and Filings which the failure of the
Purchaser to make or obtain would not materially adversely affect the ability of
the Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any Transaction Document.

          3.11. Litigation. There is no Litigation pending or, to the knowledge
of the Purchaser, threatened against the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or
involving any of its properties or assets by or before any court, arbitrator or
other Governmental Entity which in any

manner challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the

consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such

Nasdaq Stock Market, by any other automated quotation system on which the
Company's securities or, if applicable, the Purchaser's securities are quoted or
to be quoted or by any national securities exchange on which the Company's

                                       10

<PAGE>

contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
other covenants of the parties contained in this Agreement, if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a
private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each party shall cooperate in all
respects with the other party and use its reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          4.4. Listing. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to have the New

partners and other authorized representatives) obtains from the Company or the
Subsidiaries any Confidential Information, the Purchaser (i) shall treat all
such Confidential Information as confidential, (ii) shall use such Confidential
Information only for the purposes contemplated in this Agreement and (iii) shall
not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party except to such
officers, employees, counsel, accountants, partners and other authorized
representatives of the Purchaser who need to know such Confidential Information
for the purpose of effectuating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and who have been informed of and have agreed to protect the confidential nature
of such Confidential Information (and the Purchaser shall be responsible for
compliance with this Section 4.8 by such officers, employees, counsel,
accountants, partners and other authorized representatives). Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, if the Purchaser or any of its authorized representatives
becomes legally required pursuant to applicable law or regulation (including
securities laws or regulations or the regulations of the NMS or any applicable
stock exchange) or regulatory, legal or judicial process

                                       11

<PAGE>

(including by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena or
similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the Purchaser
shall provide the Company with prompt prior written notice of such requirement
so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or
waive in writing compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained and such a written waiver has
not been received from the Company that would permit such required disclosure,
the Purchaser and its authorized representatives shall disclose only that
portion of the Confidential Information which the Purchaser is advised in the
opinion of its counsel is legally required to be disclosed and shall take all
reasonable steps to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information
by cooperating with the Company to obtain an appropriate protective order or
other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the
Confidential Information.

return to the Company or destroy all documents (including any copies thereof)

Company shall comply with the terms thereof.

          4.10. Obligation of the Purchaser to Vote in Favor of the Plan. The
Purchaser hereby acknowledges to the Company that it supports the terms of the
Plan. The Purchaser agrees that, for so long as it is the beneficial owner of
Notes, common stock of the Company or Series B-1 or Series B-2 Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (collectively, the "SCANA
Securities"), it (i) shall vote, or shall cause its Subsidiaries that own SCANA
Securities of record to vote, its claims in respect of the SCANA Securities in
favor of the Plan and (ii) shall not object to, delay, impede or take any other
action to interfere, directly or indirectly, with the acceptance or
implementation of the Plan, including commencing any action to oppose or object
to the Plan. The provisions of this Section 4.10 shall not in any way limit or
condition the right of the Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries to sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of (a "Transfer") any or all of the SCANA
Securities at any time or to any person (a "Transferee") in the sole and
absolute discretion of the Purchaser or any such Subsidiary; provided, however,
that, if and to the extent that the Purchaser or any such Subsidiary Transfers
any of the SCANA Securities before the date of confirmation of the Plan, the
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or to cause such
Subsidiary to obtain, the agreement of the Transferee prior to the effectiveness
of such Transfer to be bound by the terms of this Section 4.10 with respect to
the SCANA Securities being Transferred to the Transferee. Such agreement of the
Transferee shall be confirmed in a writing, which may include a trade
confirmation issued by a broker or dealer, acting as principal or as agent for
the Transferee, stating that such agreement is a term of such Transfer.

date of this Agreement, the Company and the Purchaser agree to cooperate with
each other, and at the request of the other party, to execute and deliver any
further instruments or documents and to take all such further action as the
other party may reasonably request in order to evidence or effectuate the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the other
Transaction Documents and otherwise to carry out the intent of the parties
hereunder or thereunder.

          4.12. Waiver of Right to Participate in Rights Offering.. The
Purchaser hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any and all rights that
it has as of the date hereof or may have after the date hereof to subscribe for

     Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to
     perform its obligations under this Agreement, provided that any failure by
     the Company to obtain any necessary or required consents from any party to
     lawsuits or other proceedings which challenge the Company's rights to use
     its network easements, rights-of-way, franchises or licenses shall not be
     deemed a failure to satisfy this condition, or (ii) the failure of the

     (ii) if any condition to the Purchaser's obligations to close set forth in
     Article V has not been satisfied as of the Closing Date or satisfaction of
     such a condition is or becomes impossible (other than because of the

context, any pronoun used in this

                                       23

<PAGE>

Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms,
and the singular forms of nouns, pronouns, and verbs shall include the plural
and vice versa. Reference to any agreement, document, or instrument means such
agreement, document, or instrument as amended or otherwise modified from time to
time in accordance with the terms thereof and, if applicable, hereof. The use of
the words "include" or "including" in this Agreement shall be by way of example
rather than by limitation. The use of the words "or," "either" or "any" shall
not be exclusive. The parties to this Agreement have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement. The parties agree that prior drafts of this
Agreement shall be deemed not to provide any evidence as to the meaning of any
provision hereof or the intention of the parties hereto with respect to this
Agreement.

           7.14.  References. When a reference is made in this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document to a Section, Exhibit, Schedule or Appendix, such
reference shall be to a Section of or an Exhibit or a Schedule or Appendix to
this Agreement or such other Transaction Document, unless otherwise indicated.

           7.15.  Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all
respects, including validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the
State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed and to be performed wholly
within such state.

           7.16.  Exclusive Jurisdiction; Venue. Any process against the Company
or the Purchaser in, or in connection with, any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, may be served personally or by certified mail pursuant to the notice
provision set forth in Section 7.9 with the same effect as though served on it
personally. Each of the Company and the Purchaser hereby irrevocably submits in
any suit, action or proceeding by the parties hereto arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal and state courts of the State of
Delaware and irrevocably waives any and all objections to exclusive jurisdiction
and review of venue that any such party may have under the laws of the State of
Delaware or the United States. Without limiting the other remedies, this
Agreement shall be enforceable by specific performance. Each of the foregoing
parties hereby irrevocably designates RL&F Service Corp. (the "Process Agent"),
with offices at the date hereof at One Rodney Square, 920 King Street,
Wilmington, Delaware, 19899, as its designee, appointee and agent to receive,
for and on its behalf, service of process in the State of Delaware in any legal
action or proceedings with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and such service shall be deemed complete upon delivery
thereof to the Process Agent, provided that in the case of any such service upon
the Process Agent, the party effecting such service shall also deliver a copy
thereof to the other party in accordance with the notice provision set forth in
Section 7.9. Each party shall take all such action as may be necessary to
continue such appointment in full force and effect or to appoint another agent,
who will thereafter be referred to herein as the "Process Agent," so that each
such party shall at all times have an agent for service for the foregoing
purposes in the State of Delaware.

                                       24

           7.17. Waiver of Jury Trial. The Company and the Purchaser hereby
waive any right they may have to a trial by jury in respect of any action,
proceeding or litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in
connection with this Agreement or the Transaction Documents.

           7.18. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not
render invalid or unenforceable any other provision of this Agreement.

           7.19. Delivery by Facsimile. This Agreement, the agreements referred
to herein, and each other agreement or instrument entered into in connection
herewith or therewith or contemplated hereby or thereby, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile
machine, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or
instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request
of any party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party
hereto or thereto shall reexecute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall
raise the use of a facsimile machine to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the
use of a facsimile machine as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a
contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense.
