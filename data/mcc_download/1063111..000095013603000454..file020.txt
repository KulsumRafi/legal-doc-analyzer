PROMISE TO PAY. MIDWEST CABLE COMMUNICATIONS OF ARKANSAS INC. ("BORROWER")
PROMISES TO PAY TO REGIONS BANK ("LENDER"), OR ORDER, IN LAWFUL MONEY OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE & 00/100 DOLLARS ($116.235.00), TOGETHER WITH INTEREST
AT THE RATE OF 9.125% PER ANNUM ON THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE FROM MARCH 13,
2001, UNTIL PAID IN FULL.

PAYMENT. BORROWER WILL PAY THIS LOAN ON DEMAND, OR IF NO DEMAND IS MADE, IN 35
PAYMENTS OF $3.703.97 EACH PAYMENT AND AN IRREGULAR LAST PAYMENT ESTIMATED AT
$3.703.98. BORROWER'S FIRST PAYMENT IS DUE APRIL 13, 2001, AND ALL SUBSEQUENT
PAYMENTS ARE DUE ON THE SAME DAY OF EACH MONTH AFTER THAT. BORROWER'S FINAL
PAYMENT WILL BE DUE ON MARCH 13. 2004, AND WILL BE FOR ALL PRINCIPAL AND ALL
ACCRUED INTEREST NOT YET PAID. PAYMENTS INCLUDE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. Interest
on this Note is computed on a 365/365 simple interest basis; that is, by
applying the ratio of the annual interest rate over the number of days in a year
(366 during leap years), multiplied by the outstanding principal balance,
multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding.
Borrower will pay Lender at Lender's address shown above or at such other place
as Lender may designate in writing. Unless otherwise agreed or required by
applicable law, payments will be applied first to accrued unpaid interest, then
to principal, and any remaining amount to any unpaid collection costs and late
charges.

PREPAYMENT. Borrower may pay all or a portion of the amount owed earlier than it
is due. Early payments will not, unless agreed to by lender in writing, relieve
Borrower of Borrower's obligation to continue to make payments under the payment
schedule. Rather, they will reduce the principal balance due and may result in
Borrower making fewer payments.

LATE CHARGE. If a payment is 10 days or more late, Borrower will be charged
$25.00.

DEFAULT. Borrower will be in default if any of the following happens: (a)
Borrower fails to make any payment when due. (b) Borrower breaks any promise
Borrower has made to Lender, or Borrower fails to comply with or to perform when
due any other term, obligation, covenant, or condition contained in this Note or
any agreement related to this Note, or in any other agreement or loan Borrower
has with Lender. (c) Borrower defaults under any loan, extension of credit,
security agreement, purchase or sales agreement, or any other agreement, in
favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of
Borrower's property or Borrower's ability to repay this Note or perform
Borrower's obligations under this Note or any of the Related Documents. (d) Any
representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Borrower or on
Borrower's behalf is false or misleading in any material respect either now or
at the time made or furnished. (e) Borrower becomes insolvent, a receiver is
appointed for any part of Borrower's property, Borrower makes an assignment for
the benefit of creditors, or any proceeding is commenced either by Borrower or
against Borrower under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws. (f) Any creditor tries
to take any of Borrower's property on or in which Lender has a lien or security
interest. This includes a garnishment of any of Borrower's accounts with Lender.
(g) Any guarantor dies or any of the other events described in this default
section occurs with respect to any guarantor of this Note. (h) A material
adverse change occurs in Borrower's financial condition, or Lender believes the
prospect of payment or performance of the Indebtedness is impaired. (i) Lender
in good faith deems itself insecure.
