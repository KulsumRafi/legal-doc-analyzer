GE 1990 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated as of August 1, 1997
(the &quot;1990 Plan&quot;) is hereby amended as follows.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Section 4(a)(i)
  is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;SHARES
    AVAILABLE. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4(b):</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;CALCULATION
      OF NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE. The number of Shares available for granting
      Awards under the Plan in each calendar year or, in the case of the years
      1990 and 2007, part thereof shall be ninety-five one-hundredths of one
      percent (0.95%) of the issued Shares (including, without limitation,
      treasury Shares) as of the first day of such year. If, after the effective
      date of the Plan, any Shares covered by an Award granted under the Plan or
      by an award granted under the 1983 Plan, or to which such an Award or
      award relates, are forfeited, or if an Award or award otherwise terminates
      without the delivery of Shares or of other consideration, then the Shares
      covered by such Award or award, or to which such Award or award relates,
      or the number of Shares otherwise counted against the aggregate number of
      Shares available under the Plan with respect to such Award or award, to
      the extent of any such forfeiture or termination, shall again be, or shall
      become, available for granting Awards under the Plan. Notwithstanding the
      foregoing, but subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4(b), no more
      than one hundred million (100,000,000) Shares shall be cumulatively
      available for delivery pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;The
  cumulative number of Shares that were carried forward in prior years and made
  available for Awards pursuant to Section 4(a)(i) of the Plan as it was in
  effect prior to this amendment shall be eliminated from the pool of Shares
  available for granting Awards as of December 31, 2002.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;
  Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Amendment No. 1, the
  provisions of the 1990 Plan shall continue to be in full force and effect.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;This
  Amendment No. 1 will remain in full force and effect so long as the 1990 Plan
  remains in effect. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the
  meaning given in the Plan.</P>

December 31, 2002</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note:
The numbers of shares of stock set forth herein have been adjusted to give
effect to stock splits effective before the restatement of the Pan effective
August 1, 1997, but have not been adjusted to give effect to the 3-for-1 stock
split effective April 27, 2000.</P>
