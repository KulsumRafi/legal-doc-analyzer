<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Primary Employer previously established a 401(k) savings plan on October 1, 1996.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Primary Employer is of the opinion that the plan should be changed.  It believes that the best means to accomplish these changes is to completely restate the plan's terms, provisions and conditions.  The restatement, effective January&nbsp;1, 1997, is set forth in this document and is substituted in lieu of the prior document.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;This restatement is made retroactively to reflect the law changes made through the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998.  The provisions of this Plan apply as of the effective date of the restatement except as provided in the attached addendums which reflect the operation of the Plan between the effective date of the restatement and the date this restatement is adopted and identify those provisions which are not amended retroactively.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The restated plan continues to be for the exclusive benefit of employees of the Employer.  All persons covered under the plan on December&nbsp;31, 1996, shall continue to be covered under the restated plan with no loss of benefits.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;It is intended that the plan, as restated, shall qualify as a profit sharing plan under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including any later amendments to the Code.</P>

The amount reported in the "Wages, Tips and Other Compensation" box on Form W-2 satisfies this definition.</P>

The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any determination period beginning in such calendar year.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual limit multiplied by a fraction.  The numerator of the fraction is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of the fraction is 12.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;To determine an Eligibility Computation Period after an Eligibility Break in Service, the Plan shall use the consecutive 12-month period beginning on an Employee's Reemployment Commencement Date as if his Reemployment Commencement Date were his Employment Commencement Date.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<B>Eligibility Service</B> means one year of service for each Eligibility Computation Period that has ended and in which an Employee is credited with at least 1,000 Hours-of-Service. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b)&#9;for the preceding year had compensation from the Employer in excess of $80,000 and, if the Employer so elects, was in the top-paid group for the preceding year.  The $80,000 amount is adjusted at the same time and in the same manner as under Code Section 415(d), except that the base period is the calendar quarter ending September&nbsp;30, 1996.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;For this purpose the applicable year of the plan for which a determination is being made is called a determination year and the preceding 12-month period is called a look-back year.  If the Employer makes a calendar year data election, the look-back year shall be the calendar year beginning with or within the look-back year.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The determination of who is a highly compensated former Employee is based on the rules applicable to determining Highly Compensated Employee status as in effect for that determination year, in accordance with section 1.414(q)-1T, A-4 of the temporary Income Tax Regulations and Internal Revenue Service Notice 97-45.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The determination of who is a Highly Compensated Employee, including the determinations of the number and identity of Employees in the top-paid group, the compensation that is considered, and the identity of the 5-percent owners, shall be made in accordance with Code Section 414(q) and the regulations thereunder.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The crediting of Hours-of-Service above shall be applied under the rules of paragraphs (b) and (c) of the Department of Labor Regulation 2530.200b-2 (including any interpretations or opinions implementing such rules); which rules, by this reference, are specifically incorporated in full within this Plan.

The reference to paragraph (c) applies to the crediting of hours of service to computation periods.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a)&#9;The Contribution is of amounts distributed from a plan that satisfies the requirements of Code Section 401(a) or from a "conduit" individual retirement account described in Code Section&nbsp;408(d)(3)(A).  In the case of an Inactive Participant, the Contribution must be of an amount distributed from another plan of the Employer, or a plan of a Controlled Group member, that satisfies the requirements of Code Section 401(a).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b)&#9;The Contribution is of amounts that the Code permits to be transferred to a plan that meets the requirements of Code Section 401(a).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;A Rollover Contribution shall be allowed in cash only and must be made according to procedures set up by the Plan Administrator.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If the Eligible Employee is not an Active Participant when the Rollover Contribution is made, he shall be deemed to be an Active Participant only for the purpose of investment and distribution of the Rollover Contribution.  Employer Contributions shall not be made for or allocated to the Eligible Employee until the time he meets all of the requirements to become an Active Participant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Rollover Contributions made by an Eligible Employee or an Inactive Participant shall be credited to his Account.  The part of the Participant's Account resulting from Rollover Contributions is fully (100%) vested and nonforfeitable at all times.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Univers,Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Nonvested Account of a Participant shall be forfeited as of the earlier of the following:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a)&#9;the date the Participant dies (if prior to such date he had ceased to be an Employee), or</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b)&#9;the Participant's Forfeiture Date.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All or a portion of a Participant's Nonvested Account shall be forfeited before such earlier date if, after he ceases to be an Employee, he receives, or is deemed to receive, a distribution of his entire Vested Account or a distribution of his Vested Account derived from Employer Contributions which were not 100% vested when made, under the RETIREMENT BENEFITS SECTION of Article&nbsp;V, the VESTED BENEFITS SECTION of Article&nbsp;V, or the SMALL AMOUNTS SECTION of Article&nbsp;X.  The forfeiture shall occur as of the date the Participant receives, or is deemed to receive, the distribution.  If a Participant receives, or is deemed to receive, his entire Vested Account, his entire Nonvested Account shall be forfeited.  If a Participant receives a distribution of his Vested Account from Employer Contributions which were not 100% vested when made, but less than his entire Vested Account from such Contributions, the amount to be forfeited shall be determined by multiplying his Nonvested Account from such Contributions by a fraction.  The numerator of the fraction is the amount of the distribution derived from Employer Contributions which were not 100% vested when made and the denominator of the fraction is his entire Vested Account derived from such Contributions on the date of distribution.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;A Forfeiture shall also occur as provided in the EXCESS AMOUNTS SECTION of this article.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Forfeitures shall be determined at least once during each Plan Year.  Forfeitures may first be used to pay administrative expenses.  Forfeitures of Matching Contributions which relate to excess amounts as provided in the EXCESS AMOUNTS SECTION of this article, which have not been used to pay administrative expenses, shall be applied to reduce the earliest Employer Contributions made after the Forfeitures are determined.  Any other Forfeitures which have not been used to pay administrative expenses shall be applied to reduce the earliest Employer Contributions made after the Forfeitures are determined.  Upon their application to reduce Employer Contributions, Forfeitures shall be deemed to be Employer Contributions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If a Participant again becomes an Eligible Employee after receiving a distribution which caused all or a portion of his Nonvested Account to be forfeited, he shall have the right to repay to the Plan the entire amount of the distribution he received (excluding any amount of such distribution resulting from Contributions which were 100% vested when made).  The repayment must be made in a single sum (repayment in installments is not permitted) before the earlier of the date five years after the date he again becomes an Eligible Employee or the end of the first period of five consecutive Vesting Breaks in Service which begin after the date of the distribution.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If the Participant makes the repayment above, the Plan Administrator shall restore to his Account an amount equal to his Nonvested Account which was forfeited on the date of distribution, unadjusted for any investment gains or losses.  If no amount is to be repaid because the Participant was deemed to have received a distribution, or only received a distribution of Contributions which were 100% vested when made, and he again performs an Hour-of-Service as an Eligible Employee within the repayment period, the Plan Administrator shall restore the Participant's Account as if he had made a required repayment on the date he performed such Hour-of-Service.  Restoration of the Participant's Account shall include restoration of all Code Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits with respect to that restored Account, according to applicable Treasury regulations.  Provided, however, the Plan Administrator shall not restore the Nonvested Account if (i) a Forfeiture Date has occurred after the date of the distribution and on or before the date of repayment and (ii) that Forfeiture Date would result in a complete forfeiture of the amount the Plan Administrator would otherwise restore.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Plan Administrator shall restore the Participant's Account by the close of the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which repayment is made.  Permissible sources for the restoration of the Participant's Account are Forfeitures or special Employer Contributions.  Such special Employer Contributions shall be made without regard to profits.  The repaid and restored amounts are not included in the Participant's Annual Additions, as defined in the CONTRIBUTION LIMITATION SECTION of this article.</P>

Compensation must be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2)).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;No loans will be made to any shareholder-employee or Owner-employee.  For purposes of this requirement, a shareholder-employee means an employee or officer of an electing small business (Subchapter S) corporation who owns (or is considered as owning within the meaning of Code Section 318(a)(1)), on any day during the taxable year of such corporation, more than 5 percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;A loan to a Participant shall be a Participant-directed investment of his Account.  The loan is a Trust Fund investment but no Account other than the borrowing Participant's Account shall share in the interest paid on the loan or bear any expense or loss incurred because of the loan.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P><DIR>

<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a)&#9;$50,000, reduced by the highest outstanding loan balance of loans during the one-year period ending on the day before the new loan is made.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For purposes of this maximum, a Participant's Vested Account does not include any accumulated deductible employee contributions, as defined in Code Section 72(o)(5)(B), and all qualified employer plans, as defined in Code Section 72(p)(4), of the Employer and any Controlled Group member shall be treated as one plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The foregoing notwithstanding, the amount of such loan shall not exceed 50 percent of the amount of the Participant's Vested Account, reduced by any outstanding loan balance on the date the new loan is made.  For purposes of this maximum, a Participant's Vested Account does not include any accumulated deductible employee contributions, as defined in Code Section 72(o)(5)(B).  No collateral other than a portion of the Participant's Vested Account (as limited above) shall be accepted.  The Loan Administrator shall determine if the collateral is adequate for the amount of the loan requested.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Each loan shall bear a reasonable fixed rate of interest to be determined by the Loan Administrator.  In determining the interest rate, the Loan Administrator shall take into consideration fixed interest rates currently being charged by commercial lenders for loans of comparable risk on similar terms and for similar durations, so that the interest will provide for a return commensurate with rates currently charged by commercial lenders for loans made under similar circumstances.  The Loan Administrator shall not discriminate among Participants in the matter of interest rates; but loans granted at different times may bear different interest rates in accordance with the current appropriate standards.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The loan shall by its terms require that repayment (principal and interest) be amortized in level payments, not less frequently than quarterly, over a period not extending beyond five years from the date of the loan.  If the loan is used to acquire a dwelling unit, which within a reasonable time (determined at the time the loan is made) will be used as the principal residence of the Participant, the repayment period may extend beyond five years from the date of the loan.  The period of repayment for any loan shall be arrived at by mutual agreement between the Loan Administrator and the Participant and if the loan is for a principal residence, shall not be made for a period longer than the repayment period consistent with commercial practices.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Participant shall make an application for a loan in such manner and in accordance with such rules as the Employer shall prescribe for this purpose (including by means of voice response or other electronic means under circumstances the Employer permits).  The application must specify the amount and duration requested.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Information contained in the application for the loan concerning the income, liabilities, and assets of the Participant will be evaluated to determine whether there is a reasonable expectation that the Participant will be able to satisfy payments on the loan as due.  Additionally, the Loan Administrator will pursue any appropriate further investigations concerning the creditworthiness and credit history of the Participant to determine whether a loan should be approved.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Each loan shall be fully documented in the form of a promissory note signed by the Participant for the face amount of the loan, together with interest determined as specified above.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;There will be an assignment of collateral to the Plan executed at the time the loan is made.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In those cases where repayment through payroll deduction is available, installments are so payable, and a payroll deduction agreement shall be executed by the Participant at the time the loan is made.  Loan repayments that are accumulated through payroll deduction shall be paid to the Trustee by the earlier of (i) the date the loan repayments can reasonably be segregated from the Employer's assets, or (ii) the 15th business day of the month following the month in which such amounts would otherwise have been paid in cash to the Participant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Where payroll deduction is not available, payments in cash are to be timely made.  Any payment that is not by payroll deduction shall be made payable to the Employer or the Trustee, as specified in the promissory note, and delivered to the Loan Administrator, including prepayments, service fees and penalties, if any, and other amounts due under the note.  The Loan Administrator shall deposit such amounts into the Plan as soon as administratively practicable after they are received, but in no event later than the 15th business day of the month after they are received.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The promissory note may provide for reasonable late payment penalties and service fees.  Any penalties or service fees shall be applied to all Participants in a nondiscriminatory manner.  If the promissory note so provides, such amounts may be assessed and collected from the Account of the Participant as part of the loan balance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Each loan may be paid prior to maturity, in part or in full, without penalty or service fee, except as may be set out in the promissory note.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Plan shall suspend loan payments for a period not exceeding one year during which an approved unpaid leave of absence occurs other than a military leave of absence.  The Loan Administrator shall provide the Participant a written explanation of the effect of the suspension of payments upon his loan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If a Participant separates from service (or takes a leave of absence) from the Employer because of service in the military and does not receive a distribution of his Vested Account, the Plan shall suspend loan payments until the Participant's completion of military service or until the Participant's fifth anniversary of commencement of military service, if earlier, as permitted under Code Section 414(u).  The Loan Administrator shall provide the Participant a written explanation of the effect of his military service upon his loan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If any payment of principal and interest, or any portion thereof, remains unpaid for more than 90 days after due, the loan shall be in default.  For purposes of Code Section 72(p), the Participant shall then be treated as having received a deemed distribution regardless of whether or not a distributable event has occurred.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Upon default, the Plan has the right to pursue any remedy available by law to satisfy the amount due, along with accrued interest, including the right to enforce its claim against the security pledged and execute upon the collateral as allowed by law.  The entire principal balance whether or not otherwise then due, along with accrued interest, shall become immediately due and payable without demand or notice, and subject to collection or satisfaction by any lawful means, including specifically, but not limited to, the right to enforce the claim against the security pledged and to execute upon the collateral as allowed by law.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In the event of default, foreclosure on the note and attachment of security or use of amounts pledged to satisfy the amount then due shall not occur until a distributable event occurs in accordance with the Plan, and shall not occur to an extent greater than the amount then available upon any distributable event which has occurred under the Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;All reasonable costs and expenses, including but not limited to attorney's fees, incurred by the Plan in connection with any default or in any proceeding to enforce any provision of a promissory note or instrument by which a promissory note for a Participant loan is secured, shall be assessed and collected from the Account of the Participant as part of the loan balance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If payroll deduction is being utilized, in the event that a Participant's available payroll deduction amounts in any given month are insufficient to satisfy the total amount due, there will be an increase in the amount taken subsequently, sufficient to make up the amount that is then due.  If any amount remains past due more than 90 days, the entire principal amount, whether or not otherwise then due, along with interest then accrued, shall become due and payable, as above.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If no distributable event has occurred under the Plan at the time that the Participant's Vested Account would otherwise be used under this provision to pay any amount due under the outstanding loan, this will not occur until the time, or in excess of the extent to which, a distributable event occurs under the Plan.  An outstanding loan will become due and payable in full 60 days after a Participant ceases to be an Employee and a party-in-interest as defined in ERISA or after complete termination of the Plan.</P>

A distribution to an Alternate Payee before the Participant has attained his earliest retirement age is available only if the order specifies that distribution shall be made prior to the earliest retirement age or allows the Alternate Payee to elect a distribution prior to the earliest retirement age.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Nothing in this section shall permit a Participant to receive a distribution at a time otherwise not permitted under the Plan nor shall it permit the Alternate Payee to receive a form of payment not permitted under the Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The benefit payable to an Alternate Payee shall be subject to the provisions of the SMALL AMOUNTS SECTION of Article&nbsp;X if the value of the benefit does not exceed $5,000 ($3,500 for Plan Years beginning before August 6, 1997).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Plan Administrator shall establish reasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of a domestic relations order.  Upon receiving a domestic relations order, the Plan Administrator shall promptly notify the Participant and the Alternate Payee named in the order, in writing, of the receipt of the order and the Plan's procedures for determining the qualified status of the order.  Within a reasonable period of time after receiving the domestic relations order, the Plan Administrator shall determine the qualified status of the order and shall notify the Participant and each Alternate Payee, in writing, of its determination.  The Plan Administrator shall provide notice under this paragraph by mailing to the individual's address specified in the domestic relations order, or in a manner consistent with Department of Labor regulations.  The Plan Administrator may treat as qualified any domestic relations order entered into before January&nbsp;1, 1985, irrespective of whether it satisfies all the requirements described in Code Section 414(p).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If any portion of the Participant's Vested Account is payable during the period the Plan Administrator is making its determination of the qualified status of the domestic relations order, a separate accounting shall be made of the amount payable.  If the Plan Administrator determines the order is a qualified domestic relations order within 18 months of the date amounts are first payable following receipt of the order, the payable amounts shall be distributed in accordance with the order.  If the Plan Administrator does not make its determination of the qualified status of the order within the 18-month determination period, the payable amounts shall be distributed in the manner the Plan would distribute if the order did not exist and the order shall apply prospectively if the Plan Administrator later determines the order is a qualified domestic relations order.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<B>5-percent Owner</B> means a 5-percent owner as defined in Code Section 416.  A Participant is treated as a 5-percent Owner for purposes of this article if such Participant is a 5-percent Owner at any time during the Plan Year ending with or within the calendar year in which such owner attains age 70&nbsp;1/2.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In addition, a Participant is treated as a 5-percent Owner for purposes of this article if such Participant becomes a 5-percent Owner in a later Plan Year.  Such Participant's Required Beginning Date shall not be later than the April&nbsp;1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which such later Plan Year ends.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Once distributions have begun to a 5-percent Owner under this article, they must continue to be distributed, even if the Participant ceases to be a 5-percent Owner in a subsequent year.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<B>Required Beginning Date</B> means, for a Participant who is a 5-percent Owner, the April&nbsp;1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which he attains age 70&nbsp;1/2.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Required Beginning Date means, for any Participant who is not a 5-percent Owner, the April&nbsp;1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which he attains age 70&nbsp;1/2 or the calendar year in which he retires.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The preretirement age 70&nbsp;1/2 distribution option is only eliminated with respect to Participants who reach age 70&nbsp;1/2 in or after a calendar year that begins after the later of December&nbsp;31, 1998, or the adoption date of the amendment which eliminated such option.  The preretirement age 70&nbsp;1/2 distribution is an optional form of benefit under which benefits payable in a particular distribution form (including any modifications that may be elected after benefits begin) begin at a time during the period that begins on or after January&nbsp;1 of the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70&nbsp;1/2 and ends April&nbsp;1 of the immediately following calendar year.</P>

Any such Participant attaining age 70&nbsp;1/2 in years after 1995 may elect by April&nbsp;1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which he attained age 70&nbsp;1/2 (or by December&nbsp;31, 1997 in the case of a Participant attaining age 70&nbsp;1/2 in 1996) to defer distributions until the calendar year following the calendar year in which he retires. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;If a claim for benefits under the Plan is denied, the Plan Administrator shall provide adequate written notice to the Claimant whose claim for benefits under the Plan has been denied.

The Plan Administrator shall advise the Claimant of its decision within 60 days of his written request for review, unless special circumstances (such as a hearing) would make rendering a decision within the 60-day limit unfeasible.  The Claimant must be notified within the 60-day limit if an extension is necessary.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Employer may amend this Plan at any time, including any remedial retroactive changes (within the time specified by Internal Revenue Service regulations), to comply with any law or regulation issued by any governmental agency to which the Plan is subject.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;An amendment may not diminish or adversely affect any accrued interest or benefit of Participants or their Beneficiaries nor allow reversion or diversion of Plan assets to the Employer at any time, except as may be required to comply with any law or regulation issued by any governmental agency to which the Plan is subject.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;No amendment to this Plan shall be effective to the extent that it has the effect of decreasing a Participant's accrued benefit.  However, a Participant's Account may be reduced to the extent permitted under Code Section 412(c)(8).  For purposes of this paragraph, a Plan amendment which has the effect of decreasing a Participant's Account with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing an accrued benefit.  Furthermore, if the vesting schedule of the Plan is amended, in the case of an Employee who is a Participant as of the later of the date such amendment is adopted or the date it becomes effective, the nonforfeitable percentage (determined as of such date) of such Employee's right to his employer-derived accrued benefit shall not be less than his percentage computed under the Plan without regard to such amendment.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;No amendment to the Plan shall be effective to eliminate or restrict an optional form of benefit with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment except as provided in the MERGERS AND DIRECT TRANSFERS SECTION of this article and below:</P>

<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(a)&#9;The Plan is amended to eliminate or restrict the ability of a Participant to receive payment of his Account balance under a particular optional form of benefit and the amendment satisfies the condition in (1) and (2) below:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(1)&#9;The amendment provides a single sum distribution form that is otherwise identical to the optional form of benefit eliminated or restricted.  For purposes of this condition (1), a single sum distribution form is otherwise identical only if it is identical in all respects to the eliminated or restricted optional form of benefit (or would be identical except that it provides greater rights to the Participant) except with respect to the timing of payments after commencement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(2)&#9;The amendment provides that the amendment shall not apply to any distribution with an Annuity Starting Date earlier than the earlier of:</P>

The Employer may enter into merger agreements or direct transfer of assets agreements with the employers under other retirement plans which are qualifiable under Code Section 401(a), including an elective transfer, and may accept the direct transfer of plan assets, or may transfer plan assets, as a party to any such agreement.  The Employer shall not consent to, or be a party to a merger, consolidation, or transfer of assets with a plan which is subject to the survivor annuity requirements of Code Section 401(a)(11) if such action would result in survivor annuity feature being maintained under this Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, to the extent any optional form of benefit under the Plan permits a distribution prior to the Employee's retirement, death, disability, or severance from employment, and prior to plan termination, the optional form of benefit is not available with respect to benefits attributable to assets (including the post-transfer earnings thereon) and liabilities that are transferred, within the meaning of Code Section 414(l), to this Plan from a money purchase pension plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) (other than any portion of those assets and liabilities attributable to voluntary employee contributions).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Plan may accept a direct transfer of plan assets on behalf of an Eligible Employee.  If the Eligible Employee is not an Active Participant when the transfer is made, the Eligible Employee shall be deemed to be an Active Participant only for the purpose of investment and distribution of the transferred assets.  Employer Contributions shall not be made for or allocated to the Eligible Employee, until the time he meets all of the requirements to become an Active Participant.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Unless a transfer of assets to the Plan is an elective transfer as described below, the Plan shall apply the optional forms of benefit protections described in the AMENDMENTS SECTION of this article to all transferred assets.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;A Participant's protected benefits may be eliminated upon transfer between qualified defined contribution plans if the conditions in Q&amp;A 3(b)(1) in section 1.411(d)-4 of the regulations are met.  The transfer must meet all of the other applicable qualification requirements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;A Participant's protected benefits may be eliminated upon transfer between qualified plans (both defined benefit and defined contribution) if the conditions in Q&amp;A 3(c)(1) in section 1.411(d)-4 of the regulations are met.  Beginning January&nbsp;1, 2002, if the Participant is eligible to receive an immediate distribution of his entire nonforfeitable accrued benefit in a single sum distribution that would consist entirely of an eligible rollover distribution under Code Section 401(a)(31), such transfer will be accomplished as a direct rollover under Code Section 401(a)(31).  The rules applicable to distributions under the plan would apply to the transfer, but the transfer would not be treated as a distribution for purposes of the minimum distribution requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;<B>Top-heavy Plan</B> means a plan which is top-heavy for any plan year beginning after December&nbsp;31, 1983.  This Plan shall be top-heavy if any of the following conditions exist:</P>

Both the numerator and denominator of the Top-heavy Ratio are increased to reflect any contribution not actually made as of the Determination Date, but which is required to be taken into account on that date under Code Section 416 and the regulations thereunder.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(b)&#9;If the Employer maintains one or more defined contribution plans (including any simplified employee pension plan) and the Employer maintains or has maintained one or more defined benefit plans which during the five-year period ending on the Determination Date(s) has or has had accrued benefits, the Top-heavy Ratio for any required or permissive Aggregation Group, as appropriate, is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the account balances under the aggregated defined contribution plan or plans of all Key Employees determined in accordance with (a) above, and the Present Value of accrued benefits under the aggregated defined benefit plan or plans for all Key Employees as of the Determination Date(s), and the denominator of which is the sum of the account balances under the aggregated defined contribution plan or plans for all participants, determined in accordance with (a) above, and the Present Value of accrued benefits under the defined benefit plan or plans for all participants as of the Determination Date(s), all determined in accordance with Code Section 416 and the regulations thereunder.  The accrued benefits under a defined benefit plan in both the numerator and denominator of the Top-heavy Ratio are increased for any distribution of an accrued benefit made in the five-year period ending on the Determination Date.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(c)&#9;For purposes of (a) and (b) above, the value of account balances and the Present Value of accrued benefits will be determined as of the most recent Valuation Date that falls within or ends with the 12-month period ending on the Determination Date, except as provided in Code Section 416 and the regulations thereunder for the first and second plan years of a defined benefit plan.  The account balances and accrued benefits of a participant (i) who is not a Key Employee but who was a Key Employee in a prior year or (ii) who has not been credited with at least an hour of service with any employer maintaining the plan at any time during the five-year period ending on the Determination Date will be disregarded.  The calculation of the Top-heavy Ratio and the extent to which distributions, rollovers, and transfers are taken into account will be made in accordance with Code Section 416 and the regulations thereunder.  Deductible employee contributions will not be taken into account for purposes of computing the Top-heavy Ratio.  When aggregating plans, the value of account balances and accrued benefits will be calculated with reference to the Determination Dates that fall within the same calendar year.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The accrued benefit of a participant other than a Key Employee shall be determined under (i) the method, if any, that uniformly applies for accrual purposes under all defined benefit plans maintained by the Employer, or (ii) if there is no such method, as if such benefit accrued not more rapidly than the slowest accrual rate permitted under the fractional rule of Code Section&nbsp;411(b)(1)(C).</P>
