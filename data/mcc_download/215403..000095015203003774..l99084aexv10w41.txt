          NINTH AMENDMENT, WAIVER AND CONSENT (this "Amendment"), dated as of
March __, 2003, among CERES GROUP, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Borrower"), the lending institutions party to the Credit Agreement referred to
below (each a "Bank" and, collectively, the "Banks"), and JPMORGAN CHASE BANK,
as Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Agent"). All capitalized terms used
herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings
provided such terms in the Credit Agreement referred to below.

                              W I T N E S S E T H :
                               - - - - - - - - - -


          WHEREAS, the Borrower, the Banks and the Administrative Agent are
party to a Credit Agreement, dated as of February 17, 1999 (as amended, modified
and supplemented prior to the date hereof, the "Credit Agreement");

          WHEREAS, the Borrower and its indirect Wholly-Owned Subsidiary,
Continental General Insurance Company, a Nebraska insurance company
("Continental"), have decided to sell 100% of the capital stock of the Pyramid
Life Insurance Company, a Kansas stock insurance company ("Pyramid") and a
direct Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of Continental (the "Pyramid Sale");

          WHEREAS, to effectuate the Pyramid Sale, Continental, the Borrower,
Pennsylvania Life Insurance Company, a Pennsylvania insurance company and a
Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of American Exchange Life Insurance Company, a Texas
corporation ("American Exchange"), and Universal American Financial Corp. have
heretofore entered into a Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 20, 2002 (the
"Pyramid Purchase Agreement");

          WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested that the Banks consent to the
Pyramid Sale as provided herein;

          WHEREAS, the Borrower has also requested certain other amendments and
waivers to the Credit Agreement as provided herein; and

          WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions of this Amendment, the
Banks hereby agree to grant the consents, amendments and waivers under the
Credit Agreement as herein provided;

          NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed:

          1. The Banks hereby waive any Default or Event of Default that may
have arisen solely as a result of the Borrower's failure to comply with (a)
Section 7.12 of the Credit Agreement solely to the extent such Default or Event
of Default was caused by the failure of Continental to comply with the minimum
Risk-Based Capital Ratio set forth in such Section 7.12 of the Credit Agreement
during the period commencing on December 31, 2002 and ending on the Ninth
Amendment Effective Date and (b) Section 7.17 of the Credit Agreement for the
Test
<PAGE>

Period ended on December 31, 2002, solely to the extent such Default or Event of
Default would not have occurred had the Borrower been permitted to exclude the
amount of intercompany tax sharing payments made during such Test Period in
calculating Borrower Cash Flow for such Test Period.

          2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Credit
Agreement, the Banks hereby consent to the Pyramid Sale on the terms and
conditions substantially the same as those set forth in the Pyramid Purchase
Agreement, so long as (i) no Default or Event of Default exists at the time of
consummation of such sale or would result therefrom, (ii) such sale shall be for
an amount at least equal to the fair market value thereof (as determined in good
faith by senior management of the Borrower), (iii) the total consideration
received therefrom by Continental is 100% cash and is paid at the time of
closing of such sale, (iv) the aggregate sale proceeds therefrom shall be at
least $56,000,000, subject to an adjustment equal to the change (if any) in the
aggregate statutory capital and surplus of Pyramid as of the closing of such
sale as compared to the aggregate statutory capital and surplus of Pyramid at
June 30, 2002, each as determined in accordance with the accounting practices
prescribed or permitted by the State of Kansas (the "Pyramid Sale Price"), (v)
upon receipt by Continental of such sale proceeds, Dividends in an amount equal
to at least $10,000,000 are paid in cash by Continental to Continental General
Corporation ("Continental Corporation"), (vi) upon receipt by Continental
Corporation of such Dividends, further Dividends in an amount equal to at least
$10,000,000 are paid in cash by Continental Corporation to the Borrower and are
applied upon receipt thereof as a mandatory repayment of principal of
outstanding (x) A-1 Term Loans in an amount equal to no less than $6,300,000 and
(y) A-2 Term Loans in an amount equal to no less than $3,600,000, and (vii) any
material amendments and/or modifications to the Pyramid Purchase Agreement after
the Ninth Amendment Effective Date are reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent.
