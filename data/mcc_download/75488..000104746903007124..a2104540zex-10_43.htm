<P><FONT SIZE=2>This
is the controlling and definitive statement of the Officer Severance Policy of PG&amp;E Corporation ("Policy"). Since Officers are employed at the will of PG&amp;E Corporation and its subsidiaries
("Corporation"), their employment with the Corporation may be terminated at any time, with or without cause. The Policy, which was first adopted effective November&nbsp;1, 1998, provides Officers of
the Corporation in Officer Compensation Bands I through V ("Officers") with severance benefits if their employment is terminated.(1) Severance benefits for officers not covered by this Policy will be
provided under policies or programs developed by the appropriate lines of business in consultation with and the approval by the Senior Human Resources Officer of the Corporation. </FONT></P>

benefits for Officers who are currently covered by an employment agreement will continue to be provided solely under such agreements until their expiration at which time
this Policy will become effective for such Officers. </FONT></DD></DL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
purpose of the Policy is to attract and retain senior management by defining terms and conditions for severance benefits, to provide severance benefits that are part of a competitive total
compensation package, to provide consistent treatment for all terminated officers, and to minimize potential litigation costs associated with Officer termination of employment. </FONT></P>

interpreted in a manner consistent with the intent of the Tax Restoration Payment paragraph above, which is to make the Executive Officer whole, on an after-tax basis, from the application
of Excise Tax, it being understood that the correction of an Overpayment may result in the Executive Officer's repaying to the Corporation an amount that is less than the Overpayment. </FONT></P>
