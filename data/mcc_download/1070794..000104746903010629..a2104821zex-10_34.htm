<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>FINAL SEPARATION AGREEMENT AND GENERAL RELEASE<BR>  OF KIMMARIE SINATRA    <BR>  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with your resignation of employment with Park Place Entertainment Corporation ("PPE" or the "Company") effective as of January&nbsp;31, 2003, as
provided below, PPE and you have agreed to the following Separation Agreement and Release ("Agreement"): </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your
last day of active employee status, your authority to act as our representative, and your resignation as secretary of PPE will be January&nbsp;28, 2003. However, your last day
of employment will be effective as of January&nbsp;31, 2003 ("Termination Date"). Upon execution and delivery of this Agreement, in addition to your salary check for salary earned since the end of
the last pay period until the Termination Date, you will receive a payment for all unused earned vacation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your
Employment Agreement ("the Employment Agreement") dated as of February&nbsp;1, 2002 with PPE shall terminate as of the Termination Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
you agreed in your original Employment Agreement, you are bound by certain provisions of the Employment Agreement, which are incorporated by reference herein, following the
Termination Date. Subject to the modifications set forth herein, you are bound by the provisions of Paragraph&nbsp;6, subsections A(1) through (3), inclusive, of the Employment Agreement, for a
period of twelve (12)&nbsp;months from the Termination Date. Additionally, you shall be bound by the provisions of Paragraph&nbsp;6, subsection A(4) of the Employment Agreement for a period of
five (5)&nbsp;years from the Termination Date, provided that at any time following the Termination Date any Confidential Information (as such is defined in the Employment Agreement) shall become
part of the public domain through no fault of yours, then the restrictions and limitations of subparagraph A(4) shall not apply to such particular information. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
the foregoing, you are specifically permitted to obtain employment (without offset against your Severance Amount, as hereinafter defined) in the gaming industry or with a
company or firm dealing with the gaming industry, except you shall not be permitted to be employed by Harrah's
Entertainment Corporation, MGM-MIRAGE, Mandalay Bay, or any of their respective affiliates, subsidiaries or properties ("the Competing Gaming Companies") for a period of twelve
(12)&nbsp;months from the Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are specifically permitted to obtain employment in the private practice of law (including employment with law firms
that represent the Competing Gaming Companies) and can perform work on behalf of the Competing Gaming Companies provided that work is not adverse to or in conflict with the interests of PPE. If such
work is adverse to or in conflict with the interests of PPE, you will recuse yourself and create an ethical wall from the affected matter(s). The remaining subsections of Paragraph&nbsp;6 of the
Employment Agreement shall remain in force between you and PPE as set forth therein, except as expressly modified hereby. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you execute this Agreement and do not revoke within the time period described below, upon the expiration of the seven (7)&nbsp;day revocation period, you shall be paid a lump sum
of $994,750, less usual payroll deductions (the "Severance Amount"). Additionally, unless otherwise provided in the benefit plans, by COBRA or by other law, your right to participate in any of PPE's
benefit plans shall cease as of your Termination Date. There shall not be further vesting of stock options or SRU's, but those vested as of the date of this Agreement shall be governed exclusively by
the terms of the applicable plans. The Company shall vest as of the date of this Agreement any unvested Company matching contributions in your EDCP account. The Company shall also provide (at its
expense) COBRA coverage for you and your authorized dependents through January&nbsp;30, 2004. You agree that this Agreement provides you with valuable consideration in excess of that to which you
are otherwise entitled, and that you will not seek any further payments from PPE other than benefits to which you were entitled prior to the Termination Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the provisions of paragraph&nbsp;3, above, in the event you are offered employment with or other compensation by a third party at any time prior to January&nbsp;29,
2004, you must notify PPE at least </FONT></P>
