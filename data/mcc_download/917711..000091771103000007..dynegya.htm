&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of Beneficiary entering into the CSA, and for other consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknow1edged and received, the Guarantor hereby agrees as follows: <BR>
<BR>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>General</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guarantor does hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee, undertake and assure to and for the benefit of Beneficiary, its successors and permitted assigns, the full, prompt and complete payment of Cost of Cover True Up Amounts due to Beneficiary under Section 10.6 of the CSA accruing on or after October 1, 2002 and on or prior to the last Day of the Contract Year containing October 1, 2002 (the "Obligations") up to the aggregate amount of Five Million Dollars (US$5,000,000), which undertaking and assurance are unconditional and absolute. The Guarantor agrees that the undertaking and assurance as set forth herein are and shall be primary obligations of, and fully and completely enforceable against, the Guarantor and shall constitute a continuing guaranty of payment and not a guaranty of collection only and shall remain in full force and effect for the term of this Guarantee. The Guarantor acknowledges the receipt and adequacy of the consideration hereinabove recited and agrees that such consideration fully supports this Guarantee.<BR>
<BR>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Payments</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any payments made by the Guarantor to Beneficiary under this Guarantee shall be made in the lawful money of the United States in the amount(s) required to be paid hereunder, not later than five (5) Business Days following Beneficiary's written demand to the Guarantor, which demand shall state and identify the nature of the Obligations due. <BR>
<BR>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Termination</U>.  Upon the earliest of (a) August 16, 2003, (b) the date that Obligor provides Beneficiary replacement Cost of Cover Credit Support, ( c) the date on which the aggregate amount paid by Guarantor hereunder shall equal $5,000,000 and (d) termination by Obligor and Beneficiary of the CSA (provided all of the Obligations and liabilities of Obligor pursuant to Section 10.6 of the CSA shall have been fully discharged), this Guarantee shall terminate and Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder. On termination of this Guarantee, Beneficiary shall, at Guarantor's request, promptly release this Guarantee in a written document reasonably satisfactory to Beneficiary and Guarantor. This Guarantee will continue in full force and effect until such date; provided however, that termination of this Guarantee shall not affect the validity or enforceability of this Guarantee with respect to: (a) any Obligation incurred or arising prior to the termination of this Guarantee, (b) any Obligation(s) which survives the termination of the CSA, and (c) any extensions or renewals of, interest accruing on, or fees, costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred with respect to any of the Obligations.<BR>

<BR>
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Attorney's Fees</U>.  The Guarantor will be responsible for the payment of all of Beneficiary's costs and expenses (i) incurred in enforcing its rights under this Guarantee, by legal process or otherwise, including, but not limited to, Beneficiary's reasonable expert and attorney's fees or (ii) incurred as a result of the failure by the Guarantor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof, except to the extent any of the foregoing are the result of an action brought by Beneficiary which is finally adjudged to be without merit, in which case, Beneficiary shall bear all such costs and expenses. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Guarantee, the obligations of the Guarantor under this Section 8 are in addition to its obligation to Guarantee the Obligations.<BR>
<BR>
9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Assignment</U>.  This Guarantee may be assigned by Beneficiary without the consent of Guarantor and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Beneficiary's successors and assigns and legal representations. Except as herein provided, neither party hereto may assign this Guarantee or any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party.<BR>
<BR>
10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Representations</U>.  The Guarantor hereby makes the following representations and warranties: <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guarantor is a corporation duly organized and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction specified for the Guarantor in the first paragraph of this Guarantee.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guarantor has the corporate authority to execute, deliver and fully perform its obligations under this Guarantee and all resolutions, if any, of directors and shareholders required to authorize execution and delivery of this Guarantee have been obtained.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Guarantee constitutes a valid, legal and binding obligation of the Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy or similar laws respecting creditor's rights generally.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Guarantor's knowledge, there are no legal or arbitral proceedings, or any proceedings by or before any governmental or regulatory authority or agency, now pending or, to the best knowledge of the Guarantor, threatened against the Guarantor or its property which (i) could have a material adverse effect on Guarantor's ability to perform its obligations under this Guarantee, or (ii) could affect the validity or enforceability of this Guarantee or the Guarantor's obligations hereunder.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All approvals, consent, authorizations, filings, permits or other actions required to be obtained from or made with respect to any applicable governmental authority ("Government Approval"), if any, as of the date hereof in connection with due execution and delivery of, and performance by the Guarantor of its obligations and the exercise of its rights under, this Guarantee have been duly obtained or made, were validly issued, are in full force and effect, are final and not subject to appeal or renewal, are held in the name of the Guarantor and are free from<I> </I>conditions or requirements. There is no proceeding pending or, to the best knowledge of the Guarantor, threatened against the Guarantor which seeks to rescind, terminate or suspend any such Government Approval. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarantor has not received notice of, and is not otherwise aware of any material default under or with respect to any other material agreement, lease or instrument to which the Guarantor is a party or by which it or its properties may be bound. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarantor is not, and shall not as a result of the execution and delivery of this Guarantee, be rendered insolvent. By executing this Guarantee, Guarantor does not intend to incur, or believe it is incurring, obligations beyond its ability to pay. Guarantor's property remaining after the delivery and performance of this Guarantee shall not constitute unreasonably small capital in comparison to its potential liability under this Guarantee. <BR>
<BR>
11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Governing Law</U>. The legal rights and obligations hereunder shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. <BR>
<BR>
12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Severability</U>.  Every provision of this Guarantee is intended to be severable. If any term or provision of this Guarantee is declared to be illegal or invalid for any reason whatsoever by a court of competent jurisdiction, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the balance of the terms and provisions hereof, which terms and provisions shall remain binding and enforceable.<BR>
<BR>
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Notices</U>. All notices, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted to be made or given under this Guarantee shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (i) on the date of personal delivery, (ii) on the date of deposit in the U.S. Mail, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, or (iii) on the date of delivery to a reputable overnight courier service, in each case addressed to the other party as follows:<BR>
