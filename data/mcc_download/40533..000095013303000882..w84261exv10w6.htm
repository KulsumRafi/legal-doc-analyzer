the Eligible Director may elect. There shall be 250,000 shares of Common

any award under the Plan shall expire, terminate, or be canceled for any
reason without having been vested or exercised in full, the corresponding
number of shares which were reserved for issuance in connection therewith
shall again be available for the purposes of the Plan. Shares available
under the Plan may be authorized and unissued shares or may be treasury

defined in Section&nbsp;9 hereof) thereon shall be credited to an account

award of Restricted Stock shall have a nonforfeitable interest in
amounts credited to such account in proportion to the lapse of
restrictions on the Restricted Stock to which such amounts relate.

Stock granted in an award, the holder of such Restricted Stock shall
have a nonforfeitable interest in 50&nbsp;percent of the amount credited to
his account which is attributable to such Restricted Stock. The

Board shall make an initial grant of shares of Restricted Stock (the
&#147;Initial Grant&#148;). At the end of a specified performance period
(determined by the Board), the number of shares in the Initial Grant
shall be increased or decreased, based on the increase or decrease in
the fair market value of a share of Common Stock during the
performance period, by a number of shares equal to (a)&nbsp;the excess of
the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the last day of
the performance period over the fair market value of a share of Common
Stock on the grant date multiplied by (b)&nbsp;the number of shares of
Restricted Stock subject to the Initial Grant and divided by (c)&nbsp;the
fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the last day of the
performance period. The number of shares of Common Stock so
determined is added to (in the case of a higher fair market value) or
subtracted from (in the case of a lower fair market value) the number
of shares of Restricted Stock to be earned at that time. Once the
number of shares of Restricted Stock has been adjusted, restrictions
will continue to be imposed for a period of time determined by the
Board.</FONT></TD>
