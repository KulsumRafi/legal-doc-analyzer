Cablecom GmbH, Neumuhlestr. 42, 8406 Winterthur

                           (hereinafter referred to as the "Employer company")


                                      and



John Gregg, 411 Silvermoss Drive, Vero Beach, Florida  32963 USA

                                    (hereinafter referred to as the "Employee")

Definition

The terms "Group" or "Group Company" refers to the Employer company, all
subsidiary companies of the Employer company, all companies directly or
indirectly controlled by the Employer company and all companies controlled by
the Employer company, its parent company or a subsidiary company of the parent
company.

1.       Area of employment, function

1.1      The Employee will be "Chief Financial Officer" of the Group. In this
         function he is reporting to the board of directors of the Employer
         company (the "Board").

1.2      The Employee will be known as a Chief Financial Officer (CFO).

1.3      Place of business: London.

2.       Working hours / overtime

         If the Employee has to work overtime in order to fulfill his
         function, this overtime must be worked. Overtime is not remunerated
         and time off is not given in lieu; compensation for any overtime
         worked is included in the salary.

3.       Payment

3.1      The Employee is entitled to a salary at a rate of USD 200,000 for
         each period of six months that the Employee is employed under this
         Agreement, payable in equal installments at the end of each month
         (the "Base Salary").
<PAGE>

3.2      Reasonable business expenses incurred by the Employee in connection
         with carrying out his function will be reimbursed on production of
         the appropriate supporting documents (as the company may reasonably
         require).

4.       Commencement, duration and termination of employment relationship

4.1      The employment relationship will start on the effective date (the
         "Effective Date") as outlined in the Employment Agreement, dated as
         of October 15, 2002, to which the Employee and NTL Incorporated (to
         be known as NTL Europe, Inc. ("NTL Europe")) are parties (the "NTL
         Europe Agreement").

4.2      The employment relationship is for an indefinite period, provided,
         that the employment relationship may be terminated by the Employee or
         the Employer company on not less than one months' written notice
         (such period being the "Term").

4.3      Upon (x) termination of the Employee's employment by the Employer
         company for any reason other than for Cause (as defined below) or (y)
         termination of the Employee's employment by the Employee in a
         Constructive Termination Without Cause, the Employee shall be
         entitled to a lump sum equal to USD 200,000 minus any portion of the
         Base Salary that has already been paid to the Employee (but not less
         than zero), such amount to be paid within 15 days following such
         termination. The Employer company's obligation to make the payment
         set forth in this Section 4.3 is conditioned upon the Employee's
         execution and delivery to the Employer company of a valid and
         enforceable release, in a form substantially similar to the release
         set forth in Section 19 of the NTL Europe Agreement (with such
         changes as the Employer company determines are necessary and
         appropriate to give the release its full force and effect under
         applicable law), of any litigation, arbitration, claim or demand
         arising out of, in connection with, or relating to, the Employee's
         employment or termination of employment with all members of the
         Employer group; provided, however, that such release shall not
         release (i) any right of the Employee to indemnification applicable
         to periods prior to the Effective Date, (ii) any rights the Employee
         may have under the Iesy Agreements (as defined in the NTL Europe
         Agreement) and (iii) any rights the Employee may have under the NTL
         Europe Agreement.

         For purposes of this Agreement, a "Constructive Termination Without
         Cause" means a termination of the Employee's employment during the
         Term by the Employee within 15 days following the occurrence of any
         of the following events without the Employee's prior consent: (A)
         failure to continue the Employee in the position set forth in Section
         1 hereof (excluding a promotion); (B) assignment to the Employee of
         duties that are materially inconsistent with the scope of duties and
         responsibilities generally associated with the positions set forth in
         Section 1 hereof; (C) any materially adverse change in the reporting
         structure applicable to the Employee (but not including a change in
         the person filling the position to which the Employee reports; (D)
         relocation of the Employee's principal office to a location more than
         40 miles from London, England, except for required travel for
         Employer company business to an extent substantially consistent with
         the Employee's prior business travel obligations; (E) any material
         breach by the Employer company of any material obligation to the
         Employee under this Agreement; or (F) failure to maintain directors'
         and officers' liability insurance on the substantially similar terms
         described in Section 5.2 of this Agreement or Section
<PAGE>

         18(b) of the NTL Europe Agreement, despite the Employer company's or
         NTL Europe's reasonable efforts to maintain such coverage or that
         such coverage cannot be obtained at a commercially reasonable cost.
         The Employee shall give the Employer company 10 days' notice of the
         Employee's intention to terminate the Employee's employment and claim
         that a Constructive Termination Without Cause has occurred, and such
         notice shall describe the facts and circumstances in support of such
         claim. The Employer company shall have 10 days thereafter to cure
         such facts and circumstances if possible.

4.4      Upon termination of the Employee's employment by the Employer company
         for "Cause," then the Employee shall be entitled to Base Salary
         through the date of termination and the Employee shall not be
         entitled to any other payments or benefits. For purposes of this
         Agreement, Cause shall mean: (i) the Employee (x) is indicted for,
         convicted of, or pleads guilty or nolo contendere to, any felony or
         (y) commits any other crime involving fraud, embezzlement or breach
         of trust or fiduciary duty; (ii) in carrying out the Employee's
         duties, the Employee engages in conduct that constitutes gross
         neglect or willful misconduct; or (iii) the Employee's material
         breach of any obligation or representation set forth in this
         Agreement; provided, however, that Cause shall not be deemed to have
         occurred by reason of the Employee's lack of physical or mental
         capacity.

         The Employer company shall give the Employee 10 days' notice of the
         Employer company's intention to terminate the Employee's employment
         and claim that facts and circumstances constituting Cause exist, and
         such notice shall describe the facts and circumstances in support of
         such claim. The Employee shall have 10 days thereafter to cure such
         facts and circumstances if possible; provided, however, that this
         sentence shall not apply to clause (i) of the definition of Cause,
         for which there shall be deemed no possible cure. If the Board
         reasonably concludes that the Employee has not cured such facts or
         circumstances within such time, Cause shall not be deemed to have
         been established unless and until the Employee has received a hearing
         before the Board (if promptly requested by the Employee) and a
         majority of the Board in attendance at a meeting of the Board that
         occurs within 10 days of the date of such hearing (if so requested)
         reasonably confirms the existence of Cause and the termination of the
         Employee therefor.

4.5      Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if
         the Employee's employment terminates under the NTL Europe Agreement
         and such termination is as set forth in the left column of the
         following table, then the Employee's employment shall automatically
         terminate hereunder and such termination shall be as set forth in the
         right column of the following table:

5.       Indemnification

5.1      To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Employer
         company shall indemnify the Employee against, and save and hold the
         Employee harmless from, any damages, liabilities, losses, judgments,
         penalties, fines, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, costs and
         reasonable expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees
         and expenses), resulting from, arising out of or in connection with
         any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, proceeding or
         investigation (whether civil or criminal) against or affecting the
         Employee as a result of the Employee's service from and after the
         Effective Date as an officer, director or employee of, or consultant
         to, any member of the Employer company or any of its affiliates, or
         in any capacity at the request of the Employer company or any of its
         affiliates, or an officer, director or employee thereof, in or with
         regard to any other entity, employee benefit plan or enterprise
         (other than arising out of the Employee's acts of willful misconduct,
         misappropriation of funds or fraud). In the event the Employer
         company does not compromise or assume the defense of any
         indemnifiable claim or action against the Employee, the Employer
         company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, promptly
         pay to the Employee all costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred
         by the Employee in defending or responding to any claim or
         investigation in advance of the final disposition thereof; provided,
         however, that if it is ultimately determined by a final judgment of a
         court of competent jurisdiction (from whose decision no appeals may
         be taken, or the time for appeal having lapsed) that the Employee was
         not entitled to indemnity hereunder, then the Employee shall repay
         forthwith all amounts so advanced. The Employer company may not agree
         to any settlement or compromise of any claim against the Employee,
         other than a settlement or compromise solely for monetary damages for
         which the Employer company shall be solely responsible, without the
         prior written consent of the Employee, which consent shall not be
         unreasonably withheld. This right to indemnification shall be in
         addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right to indemnification
         to which the Employee shall be entitled pursuant to the Employer
         company's Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or otherwise.

5.2      During the Term, the Employer company shall use its reasonable
         efforts to maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance on
         substantially similar terms as in effect prior to the Effective Date,
         so long as such insurance may be obtained at a commercially
         reasonable cost.

6.       Final provisions

6.1      Amendments and additions to this contract are only valid if made in
         writing. Employee may assign his right to receive any payment
         hereunder to a company wholly owned by him, and, following any such
         assignment, the Employer company shall make such payments to such
         company; provided that any assignment by which the Employer company
         would lose a tax deduction available to it in the absence of such
         assignment shall not be permitted. Any such assignment shall be made
         pursuant to a written instrument in form satisfactory to the Employee
         and Employer company.

6.2      This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Switzerland.

6.3      The place of jurisdiction for disputes arising from the employment
         relationship shall be either the domicile of the defendant or the
         place of business for which the Employee performs work.
