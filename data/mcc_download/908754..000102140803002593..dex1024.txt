RE: Conversion of Service Fees to Equity

Dear Dave:

This letter memorializes your oral agreement to convert any unpaid compensation
for your services to the Company into Company common stock at the effective time
of the proposed merger with Polar Molecular Corporation.

For all services rendered on or prior to July 31, 2002, all unpaid amounts shall
be converted into the number of shares of Company common stock as determined by
dividing the amount due for such services by $3.03, rounding up any fractional
shares to the nearest whole share. The amount which would be converted through
July 31, 2002, is $17,000.00 which will convert to 5,611 shares of Company
common stock.

For all services rendered after July 31, 2002, all unpaid amounts shall be
converted into the number of shares of Company common stock as determined by
dividing the amount due for such services by $1.00, rounding up any fractional
shares to the nearest whole share. For purposes of illustration only, should the
merger become effective on March 31, 2003, you would be due approximately $8,000
for post-July 31, 2002, services. This would result in a conversion of the
amount due you into 8,000 shares of Company common stock.

Please acknowledge below, that you are in complete agreement with the terms of
this letter, and return an executed copy to me.

Sincerely,


Nancy Davis
Staff Accountant
