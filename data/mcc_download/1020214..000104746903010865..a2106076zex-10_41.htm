of November __, 2002 (&#147;Loan Agreement&#148;).&#160;
The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount hereunder
until such time as the amounts hereunder are paid in full, such interest
payable at the rate(s) and at the times set forth in the Loan Agreement with
all outstanding amounts due and payable no later than the Maturity Date.&#160; All interest shall be calculated on the
basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed.&#160; The Borrower may prepay in whole or in part
any time without any premium or penalty, notwithstanding any refinancing,
renewal, extension or modification of this note.</font></p>

specified in the Loan Agreement.&#160; All

to the Borrower, and the respective maturities thereof, and all payments made
on account of principal thereof, shall be recorded in the books and records of

error.&#160; Failure by the Lender to record
such loans or payments shall not relieve the Borrower of any obligation with
respect to such loan or payment.</font></p>

the terms and conditions therein specified.&#160;

defined, this Term Note and all amounts owed hereunder shall accrue interest at
two hundred basis points (2.0%) above the interest rate applicable immediately
before such event occurred.</font></p>
