Cash Bonus Plan For Key Employees  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the action of the Board of Directors of Equity Oil Company a Cash Bonus Plan for Key Employees of the Company (Plan) has been adopted. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
participant in the Plan will have an Individual Award Opportunity (Award Opportunity) set at the beginning of the Plan year. This will be defined as a percentage of base
W-2 salary. To determine the bonus to be paid under the Plan, the percentage award calculated for each factor will be multiplied by the participants Award Opportunity to arrive at a
percentage of base salary. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants
of the Plan are divided into two groups: (1)&nbsp;non-officers and (2)&nbsp;officers. The qualifications for each group are outlined below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Non-Officer Bonus Plan  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Non-Officer Bonus Plan will be based on three factors: (1)&nbsp;change in net asset value per share; (2)&nbsp;production growth; and
(3)&nbsp;personal achievement. A description of each of the factors and the methodology for computation are: </FONT></P>

in Net Asset Value per Share&#151;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>50% Weighting</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&#151;Net asset value is defined as net
present value of year end proved oil and gas reserves plus working capital less long-term debt. </FONT></DD></DL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
net present value will be calculated at a discount rate of 10% using constant oil and gas prices from year to year and will be based on audited year end proved reserves. The use of constant
pricing will remove commodity volatility from the calculation and focus on operational and financial management success or failure. Index prices of $24 per barrel and $3 per MCF as the constant prices
will be used for each year beginning with the base year of 2001. Net asset value incorporates reserve quantity change, the cost of finding and producing the reserves, the cost of administration and
the full cost of financing the acquisition of the reserves. The Board will review the base case pricing criteria annually but will not change the base pricing criteria from year to year unless there
is a major shift in forecast energy pricing either up or down. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Each
1% change in net asset value per share will qualify for 5% of this award category. For example a 20% change in net asset value will result in a full qualification for this factor. (20% change in
net asset value * 5% for each 1% change * 50% weighting factor for this category&nbsp;= 50%) </FONT></P>
