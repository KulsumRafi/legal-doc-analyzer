<P>(b)&#9;If the Indemnifying Parties admit that the Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification with respect to such claim, then the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right, on written notice given to Indemnified Parties within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice from the Indemnified Parties of any Third Party Claim, to assume the defense or handling of such Third Party Claim, at the Indemnifying Parties sole expense, with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Parties in connection with conducting the defense or handling of such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Parties shall defend or handle the same in consultation with the Indemnified Parties, shall keep Indemnified Parties timely apprised of the status of such Third Party Claim<B> </B>and shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Parties, directly or indirectly assume any position or take any action that would impose any obligation of any kind on or restrict the actions of the Indemnified Parties in any material respect.
