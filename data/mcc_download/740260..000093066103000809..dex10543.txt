the Directing Mezzanine Lender and provided further that the Directing Mezzanine
Lender may direct Senior Lender to send copies of all notices sent to the

or subsequent Transfer, the Senior Loan and the Senior Loan Documents shall be
and remain a senior obligation in the respects set forth in this Agreement to
the Mezzanine Loan and the Mezzanine Loan Documents in accordance with the terms
and provisions of this Agreement and the terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding on any such transferee. Unless the Senior Loan is included in a

Persons (the "Directing Senior Lender") to act on behalf of all such Persons
holding an interest in the Senior Loan. The Directing Senior Lender shall have

shall be deemed to be the Directing Senior Lender and provided further that the
Directing Senior Lender may direct Mezzanine Lender to send copies of all
notices sent to the Directing Senior Lender to up to two (2) additional Persons.
Once the Directing Senior Lender has been designated hereunder, Mezzanine Lender
shall be entitled to rely on such designation until it has received written
notice from the holder(s) of more than 50% of the principal amount of the Senior
Loan of the designation of a different Person to act as the Directing Senior
Lender.

Equity Collateral. The Mezzanine Lender (or, if applicable, Loan Pledgee) shall
provide notice of any transfer of the Equity Collateral and an officer's
certificate from an officer of Mezzanine Lender (or, if applicable, Loan
Pledgee) certifying to such officers knowledge that all conditions set forth in
this Section 5(a) have been satisfied to Senior Lender and the Rating Agencies
upon consummation of such transfer of the Equity Collateral pursuant to this
Section 5(a). Senior Lender may request reasonable evidence that the foregoing
requirements have been satisfied. As a condition of being permitted to obtain
title to the Equity Collateral, the transferee of the Equity Collateral shall
assume in writing the obligations of Mezzanine Lender that accrue under this
Agreement from and after the transfer of title to the Equity Collateral and
shall agree otherwise to be bound by this Agreement.

          (b)  If no Certificates are outstanding or if Certificates are issued
but the Senior Loan is subsequently removed from the vehicle that issued the
Certificates, Mezzanine Lender (or, if applicable, Loan Pledgee) shall not

conditioned or delayed, or (ii) the transfer of title to the Equity Collateral
is to a Qualified Transferee and the Properties will be managed by a Qualified
Manager promptly after the transfer of title to the Equity Collateral. As a

obligations of Mezzanine Lender that accrue under this Agreement from and after
the transfer of title to the Equity Collateral and shall agree otherwise to be
bound by this Agreement.

          (c)  Nothing contained herein shall limit or restrict the right of
Mezzanine Lender to exercise its rights and remedies, in law or in equity, or
otherwise, in order to realize on any Separate Collateral that is not Equity
Collateral.

          (d)  In the event Mezzanine Lender or any purchaser at a UCC sale or a
foreclosure obtains title to the Separate Collateral, Senior Lender hereby
acknowledges and agrees that any transfer or assumption fee in the Senior Loan
Agreement shall be waived as a condition to such transfer and any such transfer
shall not constitute a breach or default under the Senior Loan Documents,
provided the conditions in Section 5(a) or 5(b), as applicable, are met. Senior
Lender also acknowledges and agrees that it will not impose any unreasonable
fees or delays in connection with such transfer. Mezzanine Lender shall provide

except that (A) no such Senior Loan Modification shall, without the prior
written consent of Mezzanine Lender: (1) increase the principal amount of the
Senior Loan (provided however that the Senior Lender may capitalize interest),
(2) modify or amend the terms and provisions of the Senior Loan Cash Management
Agreement or Senior Loan Collection Account Agreement in a manner that would
prevent or defer distributions to the account formed pursuant to the Mezzanine
Cash Management Agreement, (3) modify any of the provisions of Article VI of the
Senior Loan Agreement relating to cash management and reserves, including,
without limitation, order of priority of payment to the Mezzanine Lender in a
manner that would prevent or defer distributions to the account formed pursuant
to the Mezzanine Cash Management Agreement or (4) extend the period during which
voluntary prepayments are prohibited or during which prepayments require the
payment of a prepayment fee or premium or yield maintenance charge or increase
the amount of any such prepayment fee, premium or yield maintenance charge and
(B) if Mezzanine Lender has cured or is the process of curing (within the time
period permitted for cure in Section 11) all Senior Loan Events of Default and,
with respect to any then existing non-monetary Senior Loan Event of Default that
is caused by the Borrower's failure to deliver financial statements, Senior
Lender will not take any of the actions set forth in clauses (a)(i)(l) through
(a)(i)(14) above without the written consent of Mezzanine Lender. None of the
foregoing restrictions shall limit the right of Senior Lender to waive
compliance, or forbear from exercising any remedies for any failure to comply,
with any of the terms and provisions of the Senior Loan Documents or to take
Protective Actions or make Protective Advances.

of this Section 7(a), any amounts funded by the Senior Lender under the Senior
Loan Documents as a result of (A) the making of any Protective Advances or other
advances by the Senior Lender expressly permitted by the terms of the Senior
Loan Documents, or (B) interest accruals or accretions and any compounding
thereof (including default interest), shall not constitute Senior Loan

          (b)  Mezzanine Lender shall have the right to enter into any
amendment, deferral, extension, modification, increase, renewal, replacement,
consolidation, supplement or waiver (collectively, a "Mezzanine Loan
Modification") of the Mezzanine Loan or the Mezzanine Loan Documents subject to
the following conditions:

               (i)     Mezzanine Lender shall have the right to effect a
Mezzanine Loan Modification except that, unless otherwise provided in Section

written consent of Senior Lender: (1) increase the principal amount of the
Mezzanine Loan, except that the capitalization of unpaid interest shall not be
subject to this limitation, (2) increase the interest rate payable under the
Mezzanine Loan by more than two hundred (200) basis points, except that any fees

shall not be characterized as interest for purposes of this clause (2) or clause

Documents, Mezzanine Lender may effect a Mezzanine Loan Modification in
connection with a work-out or other surrender, compromise, release, renewal or

Modification shall, without the prior written consent of Senior Lender: (1)

          (c)  Senior Lender shall deliver to Mezzanine Lender copies of any and
all modifications, amendments, extensions, consolidations, spreaders,
restatements, alterations, changes or revisions to any one or more of the Senior
Loan Documents (including, without limitation, any side letters, waivers or
consents entered into, executed or delivered by Senior Lender) within five (5)
Business Days after any of such applicable instruments have been executed by
Senior Lender.

          (d)  Mezzanine Lender shall deliver to Senior Lender copies of any and
all modifications, amendments, extensions, consolidations, spreaders,
restatements, alterations, changes or revisions to any one or more of the
Mezzanine Loan Documents (including, without limitation, any side letters,
waivers or consents entered into, executed or delivered by Mezzanine Lender)
within five (5) Business Days after any of such applicable instruments have been
executed by Mezzanine Lender.

  Section 8.   Intentionally Omitted.

  Section 9.   Payment Subordination.

          (a)  Except (i) as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement and
(ii) in connection with the exercise by Mezzanine Lender of its rights and
remedies with respect to the Separate Collateral in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, all of Mezzanine Lender's rights to payment of the Mezzanine
Loan and the obligations evidenced by the Mezzanine Loan Documents are hereby
subordinated to all of Senior Lender's rights to payment by Borrowers of the
Senior Loan and the obligations secured by the Senior Loan Documents, and
Mezzanine Lender shall not accept or receive payments (including, without
limitation, whether in cash or other property and whether received directly,
indirectly or by set-off, counterclaim or otherwise) from any Borrower and/or
from any Property prior to the date that all obligations of Borrowers to Senior
Lender under the Senior Loan Documents are paid. If a Proceeding shall have
occurred or a Continuing Senior Loan Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, Senior Lender shall be entitled to receive payment and performance
in full of all amounts due or to become due to Senior Lender before Mezzanine
Lender is entitled to receive any payment on account of the Mezzanine Loan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Senior Lender acknowledges and agrees that
Mezzanine Lender shall be entitled to receive and collect any amounts in respect
of the Separate Collateral that is not the Equity Collateral (including, without
limitation, any amounts due to Mezzanine Lender under the Mezzanine Mortgages or
the Master Guaranty). All payments or distributions upon or with respect to the
Mezzanine Loan which are received by Mezzanine Lender contrary to the provisions
of this Agreement shall be received and held in trust by the Mezzanine Lender
for the benefit of Senior Lender and shall be paid over to Senior Lender in the
same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement) to be applied (in the
case of cash) to, or held as collateral (in the case of non-cash property or
securities) for, the payment or performance of the Senior Loan in accordance
with the terms of the Senior Loan Documents. Nothing contained herein shall
prohibit the Mezzanine Lender from (i) making Protective Advances (and adding
the amount thereof to the principal balance of the Mezzanine Loan)
notwithstanding the existence of a default under the Senior Loan at such time or
(ii) exercising any of its rights or remedies under the Mezzanine Mortgages or
the Master Guaranty.

          (b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 9(a) hereof, provided that no
Event of Default shall then exist under the Senior Loan Documents, Mezzanine
Lender may accept the following payments (i) any amounts (both current or
delinquent) due and payable from time to time which Mezzanine Borrowers are
obligated to pay Mezzanine Lender in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Mezzanine Loan Documents and (ii) any funds which are distributed to
Mezzanine Lender in accordance with the Senior Loan Cash Management Agreement
and the Mezzanine Loan Cash Management Agreement, and in each of the foregoing
instances, Mezzanine Lender shall have no obligation to pay over to Senior
Lender any such amounts.

          (c)  Mezzanine Lender may take any Equity Collateral Enforcement
Action which is permitted under Section 5 hereof; provided, however, that (i)
Mezzanine Lender shall, prior to commencing any Equity Collateral Enforcement
Action, give the Senior Lender written notice of the default which would permit
Mezzanine Lender to commence such Equity Collateral Enforcement Action and (ii)
Mezzanine Lender shall provide Senior Lender with copies of any and all material
notices, pleadings, agreements, motions and briefs served upon, delivered to or
with any party to any Equity Collateral Enforcement Action and otherwise keep
Senior Lender reasonably apprised as to the status of any Equity Collateral
Enforcement Action.

          (d)  In the event of a casualty to the buildings or improvements
constructed on any portion of any Property or a condemnation or taking under a
power of eminent domain of all or any portion of any Property, Senior Lender
shall have a first and prior interest in and to any payments, awards, proceeds,
distributions, or consideration arising from any such event (the "Award"). If
the amount of the Award is in excess of all amounts owed to Senior Lender under
the Senior Loan Documents, however, and either the Senior Loan has been paid in
full or the Borrowers are entitled to a remittance of same under the Senior Loan
Documents other than to restore the applicable Property, such excess Award or
portion to be so remitted to the applicable Borrower shall, to the extent
permitted in the Senior Loan Documents, be paid to or at the direction of
Mezzanine Lender, unless other Persons (other than Borrowers or Mezzanine
Borrowers) have claimed the right to such awards or proceeds, in which case
Senior Lender shall only be required to provide notice to Mezzanine Lender of
such excess Award and of any other claims thereto. In the event of any competing
claims for any such excess Award, Senior Lender shall continue to hold such
excess Award until either (i) Senior Lender deposits the same into court in
connection with the filing of an interpleader action joining all such competing
parties of which Senior Lender is aware or (ii) Senior Lender receives an
agreement signed by all Persons making a claim to the excess Award or a final
order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing Senior Lender as to how and
to which Person(s) the excess Award is to be distributed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event of a casualty or condemnation, Senior Lender shall
release the Award from any such event to the applicable Borrower if and to the
extent required by the terms and conditions of the Senior Loan Documents in
order to repair and restore the applicable Property in accordance with the terms
and provisions of the Senior Loan Documents. Any portion of the Award made
available to the applicable Borrower for the repair or restoration of the
applicable Property shall not be subject to attachment by Mezzanine Lender.

          (e)  This Agreement shall not be construed as subordinating and shall
not subordinate or impair Mezzanine Lender's first lien priority right, estate
and interest in and to the Separate Collateral and Senior Lender hereby
acknowledges and agrees that Senior Lender does

                                     - 22 -

<PAGE>

not have and shall not hereafter acquire, any lien on, or any other interest
whatsoever in, the Separate Collateral, or any part thereof, and that the
exercise of remedies and realization upon the Separate Collateral by Mezzanine
Lender or a Loan Pledgee in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not in and of itself constitute a default or an Event of Default
under the Senior Loan Documents.

  Section 10.  Rights of Subrogation; Bankruptcy.

          (a)  Each of Mezzanine Lender and Senior Lender hereby waives any
requirement for marshaling of assets thereby in connection with any foreclosure
of any security interest or any other realization upon collateral in respect of
the Senior Loan Documents or the Mezzanine Loan Documents, as applicable, or any
exercise of any rights of set-off or otherwise. Each of Mezzanine Lender and
Senior Lender assumes all responsibility for keeping itself informed as to the
condition (financial or otherwise) of each Borrower, each Mezzanine Borrower,
the condition of each Property and all other collateral and other circumstances
and, except for notices expressly required by this Agreement, neither Senior
Lender nor Mezzanine Lender shall have any duty whatsoever to obtain, advise or
deliver information or documents to the other relative to such condition,
business, assets and/or operations. Mezzanine Lender agrees that Senior Lender
owes no fiduciary duty to Mezzanine Lender in connection with the administration
of the Senior Loan and the Senior Loan Documents and Mezzanine Lender agrees not
to assert any such claim. Senior Lender agrees that Mezzanine Lender owes no
fiduciary duty to Senior Lender in connection with the administration of the
Mezzanine Loan and the Mezzanine Loan Documents and Senior Lender agrees not to
assert any such claim.

          (b)  No payment or distribution to Senior Lender pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement and no Protective Advance by Mezzanine Lender shall
entitle Mezzanine Lender to exercise any right of subrogation in respect thereof
prior to the payment in full of the Senior Loan Liabilities, and Mezzanine
Lender agrees that, except with respect to the enforcement of its remedies under
the Mezzanine Loan Documents permitted hereunder, prior to the satisfaction of
all Senior Loan Liabilities it shall not acquire, by subrogation or otherwise,
any lien, estate, right or other interest in any portion of the Properties or
any other collateral now securing the Senior Loan or the proceeds therefrom that
is or may be prior to, or of equal priority to, any of the Senior Loan Documents
or the liens, rights, estates and interests created thereby.

          (c)  Subject to Section 30 of this Agreement, the provisions of this
Agreement shall be applicable both before and after the commencement, whether
voluntary or involuntary, of any case, proceeding or other action against any
Borrower under any existing or future law of any jurisdiction relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or relief of debtors (a "Proceeding").
For as long as the Senior Loan shall remain outstanding, Mezzanine Lender shall
not, and shall not solicit any person or entity to, and shall not direct or
cause any Mezzanine Borrower to direct or cause any Borrower (the "Borrower
Group") to: (i) commence any Proceeding; (ii) institute proceedings to have any
Borrower adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent; (iii) consent to, or acquiesce in,
the institution of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against any Borrower;
(iv) file a petition or consent to the filing of a petition seeking
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, winding-up, dissolution, composition,
liquidation or other relief by or on behalf of any Borrower; (v) seek or consent
to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator,
custodian or any similar official for any Borrower, the Properties

                                     - 23 -

<PAGE>

(or any portion thereof) or any other collateral securing the Senior Loan (or
any portion thereof); (vi) make an assignment for the benefit of any creditor of
any Borrower; (vii) seek to consolidate any of the Properties or any other
assets of any Borrower with the assets of any Mezzanine Borrower or any member
of the Borrower Group in any proceeding relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or relief of debtors; or (viii) take any action in furtherance of
any of the foregoing.

          (d)  If Mezzanine Lender is deemed to be a creditor of any Borrower in
any Proceeding (i) Mezzanine Lender hereby agrees that it shall not make any
election, give any consent, commence any action or file any motion, claim,
obligation, notice or application or take any other action in any Proceeding by
or against such Borrower without the prior consent of Senior Lender, except to
the extent necessary to preserve or realize upon Mezzanine Lender's interest in
the Equity Collateral; provided, however, that any such filing shall not be as a
creditor of such Borrower, (ii) Senior Lender may vote in any such Proceeding
any and all claims of Mezzanine Lender, and Mezzanine Lender hereby appoints the
Senior Lender as its agent, and its proxy, for the purpose of exercising any and
all rights and taking any and all actions available to the Mezzanine Lender in
connection with any case by or against any Borrower in any Proceeding, including
without limitation, the right to file and/or prosecute any claims, to vote to
accept or reject a plan, to make any election under Section 111l(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code; provided, however, that with respect to any proposed plan of
reorganization in respect of which creditors are voting, Senior Lender may vote
on behalf of Mezzanine Lender only if the proposed plan would result in Senior
Lender being "impaired" (as such term is defined in the United States Bankruptcy
Code) and (iii) Mezzanine Lender shall not challenge the validity or amount of
any claim submitted in such Proceeding by Senior Lender in good faith or any
valuations of the Properties or other Senior Loan collateral submitted by Senior
Lender in good faith, in such Proceeding or take any other action in such
Proceeding, which is adverse to Senior Lender's enforcement of its claim or
receipt of adequate protection (as that term is defined in the Bankruptcy Code).

  Section 11.  Rights of Cure.

          (a)  Prior to Senior Lender commencing any Enforcement Action under
the Senior Loan Documents, Senior Lender shall provide written notice of the
default which would permit the Senior Lender to commence such Enforcement Action
to Mezzanine Lender and any Loan Pledgee entitled to notice thereof pursuant to
Section 15 of this Agreement, whether or not Senior Lender is obligated to give
notice thereof to any Borrower (each, a "Senior Loan Default Notice") and shall
permit Mezzanine Lender an opportunity to cure such default in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 11(a). If the default is a monetary default
relating to a liquidated sum of money, Mezzanine Lender shall have until five
(5) Business Days after the later of (i) the giving by Senior Lender of the
Senior Loan Default Notice and (ii) the expiration of Borrower's cure provision,
if any, (a "Monetary Cure Period") to cure such monetary default. If the default
is of a non-monetary nature, Mezzanine Lender shall have a period of time not to
exceed thirty (30) days from the expiration of the last day upon which Borrowers
can cure a non-monetary default under the Loan Documents to commence a cure of
such non-monetary default; provided, however, if such non-monetary default is
susceptible of cure but cannot reasonably be cured within such period and if
curative action was promptly commenced and is being continuously and diligently
pursued by Mezzanine Lender, Mezzanine Lender shall be given an

                                     - 24 -

<PAGE>

additional period of time, not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days, as is
reasonably necessary for Mezzanine Lender in the exercise of due diligence to
cure such non-monetary default for so long as (i) Mezzanine Lender makes or
causes to be made timely payment of the regularly scheduled monthly principal
and/or interest payments of Borrowers under the Senior Loan and any other
amounts due under the Senior Loan Documents, (ii) such additional period of time
does not exceed thirty (30) days, unless such non-monetary default is of a
nature that can not be cured within such thirty (30) days, in which case,
Mezzanine Lender shall have such additional time, not to exceed one hundred
eighty (180) days, as is reasonably necessary to cure such non-monetary default
(it being understood that Mezzanine Lender's cure period shall not, in any
event, exceed two hundred ten (210) days in total), (iii) such default is not a
bankruptcy, insolvency or assignment for the benefit of creditors of Borrowers
and (iv) during such non-monetary cure period, there is no material impairment
to the value, use or operation of the Properties. Any additional cure period
granted to the Mezzanine Lender hereunder shall automatically terminate upon the
filing of bankruptcy (or similar insolvency) proceedings by or against any of
the Borrowers.

          (b)  To the extent that any Qualified Transferee acquires the Equity
Collateral in accordance with the provisions and conditions of this Agreement,
such Qualified Transferee shall acquire the same subject to the Senior Loan and
the terms, conditions and provisions of the Senior Loan Documents for the
balance of the term thereof, which shall not be accelerated by Senior Lender
solely due to such acquisition and shall remain in full force and effect;
provided, however, that (i) such Qualified Transferee shall have caused
Borrowers to reaffirm in writing, subject to such exculpatory provisions set
forth in the Senior Loan Documents, all of the terms, conditions and provisions
of the Senior Loan Documents on the part of the Borrowers to be performed, (ii)
all defaults under the Senior Loan which remain uncured as of the date of such
acquisition have been cured by such Qualified Transferee or waived in writing by
Senior Lender except for defaults that are not susceptible of being cured by
such Qualified Transferee and do not have a material impairment on the value of
the Properties and (iii) such Qualified Transferee or an Affiliate thereof shall
execute and deliver to Senior Lender a guaranty of recourse obligations which
provides for the obligations of such obligor in a form substantially similar to
the Guaranty of Recourse Obligations, pursuant to which such Qualified
Transferee or an Affiliate thereof shall undertake the obligations set forth
therein; provided that such Qualified Transferee or Affiliate thereof shall only
be liable thereunder from and after the date of the Transfer. Notwithstanding
any contrary or inconsistent provision of this transfer Agreement, the Senior
Loan Documents or the Mezzanine Loan Documents, no acquisition or other fee or
similar charge shall be due in connection with such Qualified Transferee's
acquisition of any interest in any Borrower or any Property as the result of an
Equity Collateral Enforcement Action or assignment in lieu of foreclosure or
other negotiated settlement in lieu of any of the foregoing.

          (c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in
the Senior Loan Documents, the parties agree and acknowledge that during the
period of time commencing on the expiration of Borrower's cure rights, if any,
for any Event of Default, that the Senior Lender shall direct the Cash
Management Bank (as defined in the Senior Loan Agreement) to hold in the Cash
Management Account (as defined in the Senior Loan Agreement) and not disburse
all funds that would have been remitted to the Mezzanine Cash Management Account
(as defined in the Senior Loan Agreement) in the absence of the Event of Default
that gave rise

                                     - 25 -

<PAGE>

to the cure periods under Section 1l(a). If such Event of Default is cured (by
any party) or waived by Senior Lender prior to the expiration of the Mezzanine
Lender's cure rights under Section 1l(a) then all such funds held in the Cash
Management Account pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be
remitted to the Mezzanine Cash Management Account (as defined in the Senior Loan
Agreement); or if such Event of Default is not cured or waived by Senior Lender
prior to the expiration of the Mezzanine Lender's cure rights under Section
1l(a) then all such funds held in the Cash Management Account pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence shall be distributed pursuant to the terms of the
Senior Loan Agreement. So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing under the Senior Loan Documents, all funds held and applied pursuant
to the Senior Loan Cash Management Agreement, shall continue to be applied
pursuant thereto and shall not be applied by Senior Lender to prepay outstanding
principal balance of the Senior Loan.

  Section 12.  No Actions; Restrictive Provisions. Senior Lender consents to
Mezzanine Lender's right, pursuant to the Mezzanine Loan Documents, under the
circumstances set forth therein, to cause the termination of the Property
Manager; provided that the Property Manager is promptly replaced with a
Qualified Manager. In the event both Mezzanine Lender and Senior Lender shall
have such rights at any time, and Senior Lender shall fail to exercise such
rights, Mezzanine Lender may exercise such rights, provided such exercise may be
superseded by any subsequent exercise of such rights by Senior Lender pursuant
to the Senior Loan Documents. Upon the occurrence of any event which would
entitle Mezzanine Lender to cause the termination of the Property Manager
pursuant to the Mezzanine Loan Documents, Mezzanine Lender shall have the right
to select, or cause the selection, of a replacement property manager (including
any asset manager) or leasing agent for the Properties, which replacement
manager, asset manager and/or leasing agent shall (a) if any Certificates are
then outstanding, be subject to a Rating Agency Confirmation and (b) be a
Qualified Manager. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12 to the contrary,
if a Continuing Senior Loan Event of Default then exists or any other event
shall have occurred pursuant to which Senior Lender has the right to select any
replacement manager, asset manager and/or leasing agent pursuant to the Senior
Loan Documents, Senior Lender shall have the sole right to select any
replacement manager, asset manager and/or leasing agent, whether or not a new
manager or agent was retained by Mezzanine Lender, provided that, if any such
replacement is not a Qualified Manager, the prior written consent of Mezzanine
Lender shall be required.

  Section 13.  Right to Purchase Senior Loan.

          (a)  If the Senior Loan has been accelerated, any Enforcement Action
has been commenced and is continuing under the Senior Loan Documents, the Senior
Loan is a "specially serviced mortgage loan" under the applicable pooling and
servicing agreement, trust and servicing agreement or similar agreement or at
any time following the date Senior Lender determines is the first day of a
continuing Senior Loan Event of Default (each of the foregoing, a "Purchase
Option Event"), upon ten (10) Business Days prior written notice to Senior
Lender (the "Purchase Option Notice"), Mezzanine Lender shall have the right to
purchase, or the right to cause its designee to purchase, in whole but not in
part, the Senior Loan for a price equal to the outstanding principal balance
thereof, together with all accrued interest, any Protective Advances made by
Senior Lender and any interest charged by Senior Lender on any advances for
monthly payments of principal and/or interest on the Senior Loan and/or on any
Protective

                                     - 26 -

<PAGE>

Advances, including all costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses)
actually incurred by Senior Lender in enforcing the terms of the Senior Loan
Documents and other amounts due thereon [including any late charges, default
interest, breakage costs, spread maintenance premium and prepayment fees (the
specific inclusions referred to in this bracketed clause being the "Add-Ons")]
(the "Loan Purchase Price"). Concurrently with payment to the Senior Lender of
the Loan Purchase Price, Senior Lender shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
Mezzanine Lender all Senior Loan Documents held by or on behalf of Senior Lender
and will execute in favor of Mezzanine Lender or its designee assignment
documentation, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Mezzanine Lender,
at the sole cost and expense of Mezzanine Lender, to assign the Senior Loan and
its rights under the Senior Loan Documents (without recourse, representations or
warranties, except for representations as to the outstanding balance of the
Senior Loan and as to Senior Lender's not having assigned or encumbered its
rights in the Loan). The right of Mezzanine Lender to purchase the Senior Loan
shall automatically terminate (i) upon a transfer of any of the Properties by
foreclosure sale, sale by power of sale or delivery of a deed in lieu of
foreclosure or (ii) if a Purchase Option Event ceases to exist. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if (i) at the time the Purchase Option Notice is given the then
current Debt Service Coverage Ratio is less than 1:1 and (ii) the Purchase
Option Notice is given no later than 10 Business Days following the giving by
Senior Lender of an Enforcement Notice, the Loan Purchase Price shall not
include the Add-Ons. Without limitation of the foregoing purchase option, Senior
Lender agrees that it shall not take any Enforcement Action in respect of a
Continuing Senior Loan Event of Default until the expiration of 10 days
following Senior Lender's written notice ("Enforcement Notice") to Mezzanine
Lender of Senior Lender's intent to commence one or more Enforcement Actions.

          (b)  Mezzanine Lender covenants not to enter any agreement with the
Borrowers or any Affiliate thereof to purchase the Senior Loan pursuant to
subsection (a) above or in connection with any refinancing of the Senior Loan in
any manner designed to avoid or circumvent the provisions of the Senior Loan
Documents which require the payment of a prepayment fee or yield maintenance
charge in connection with a prepayment of the Senior Loan by the Borrowers.

  Section 14.  Additional Understandings. For as long as the Mezzanine Loan
remains outstanding:

          (a)  Notices of Transfer; Consent. Senior Lender promptly shall notify
Mezzanine Lender if any Borrower seeks or requests a release of the lien of the
Senior Loan or seeks or requests Senior Lender's consent to, or take any action
in connection with or in furtherance of, a sale or transfer of all or any
material portion of any Property, the granting of a further mortgage, deed of
trust or similar encumbrance against any Property or a prepayment or refinancing
of the Senior Loan. In the event of a request by any Borrower for Senior
Lender's consent to either (i) the sale or transfer of all or any material
portion of any Property or (ii) the granting of a further mortgage, deed of
trust or similar encumbrance against any Property, Senior Lender shall, if
Senior Lender has the right to consent, obtain the prior written consent of
Mezzanine Lender prior to Senior Lender's granting of its consent or agreement
thereto.

          (b)  Annual Budget. The Mezzanine Lender shall have the right to
approve any annual operating budget of the Borrowers in accordance with the
terms of the Mezzanine

                                     - 27 -

<PAGE>

Loan Documents. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, in the Senior Loan
Documents or in the Mezzanine Loan Documents, the Mezzanine Lender may require
Borrowers to submit the annual budget to the Mezzanine Lender for approval prior
to any submission to the Senior Lender. Upon Mezzanine Lender's approval, the
Mezzanine Lender shall submit the approved budget to the Senior Lender for its
approval. The Mezzanine Lender shall consent to any changes in the budget
reasonably requested by the Senior Lender. In the event that the approval of the
Mezzanine Lender is not obtained on a timely basis, then the current existing
operating budget shall remain in effect with an increase in any
non-discretionary expense item to either (i) the prior budgeted expense amount
with a 5% increase or (ii) the actual expense incurred as evidenced by the
applicable bill or invoice.

          (c)  Insurance. Senior Lender acknowledges that it has reviewed the
insurance coverage and the insurance carriers for the Properties which were
accepted and approved by Original Senior Lender as of the Closing Date. Senior
Lender acknowledges that, notwithstanding that such insurance coverage and
insurance carriers do not satisfy the standards set forth in the Senior Loan
Agreement, such coverage and carriers are acceptable to Senior Lender and Senior
Lender shall not declare any default nor exercise any remedies available to
Senior Lender for failure of the existing coverage and carriers to meet said
standards. Senior Lender shall notify Mezzanine Lender at any time that (i)
Senior Lender desires to require Borrowers to obtain insurance coverage in types
and amounts which are different than the types and amounts approved by Original
Senior Lender as of the Closing Date or (ii) Senior Lender desires to require
Borrowers to replace the insurance carriers approved by Original Senior Lender
as of the Closing Date (each of (i) and (ii), a "Insurance Change"). Senior
Lender shall not require any Insurance Change without the prior written consent
of Mezzanine Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Senior Lender may require
the substitution of any insurance carrier whose claims paying ability is
downgraded below that of its claims paying ability as of the date hereof.

          (d)  Servicer. Senior Lender may elect to appoint a Servicer or
replace the existing Servicer, provided that Senior Lender shall give Mezzanine
Lender not less than ten (10) Business Days' prior written notice of any such
appointment or change.

          (e)  Leases and Alterations. If the Mezzanine Loan Documents contain
any provision or requirement that Mezzanine Lender's consent or approval be
obtained for any act or determination by any Borrower in connection with the
leasing of any Property or alterations to any Property, and if Mezzanine Lender
objects to the requested consent or approval, upon Senior Lender's request,
Mezzanine Lender will consult with Senior Lender with respect to any such
consent or approval.

  Section 15.  Financing of Mezzanine Loan. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, Senior Lender consents to Mezzanine Lender's pledge (a "Pledge") of all
or any portion of the Mezzanine Loan and of the Separate Collateral to any
entity which has extended a credit facility to Mezzanine Lender that is a
Qualified Transferee or a financial institution whose long-term unsecured debt
is rated at least "A" (or the equivalent) or better by each Rating Agency (a
"Loan Pledgee"), on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 15;
provided that a Loan Pledgee which is not a Qualified Transferee may not take
title to the Equity Collateral without a Rating Agency Confirmation if
Certificates are outstanding. Upon written notice by Mezzanine

                                     - 28 -

<PAGE>

Lender to Senior Lender that the Pledge has been effected, Senior Lender agrees
to acknowledge receipt of such notice and thereafter agrees: (a) to give Loan
Pledgee written notice of any default by Mezzanine Lender under this Agreement
of which default Senior Lender has actual knowledge; (b) to allow Loan Pledgee a
period of at least ten (10) days (in respect of a monetary default) and a
reasonable period of not less than thirty (30) days (in respect of a
non-monetary default) to cure a default by Mezzanine Lender in respect of its
obligations to Senior Lender hereunder, but Loan Pledgee shall not be obligated
to cure any such default; (c) that no amendment, modification, waiver or
termination of this Agreement shall be effective against Loan Pledgee without
the written consent of Loan Pledgee, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld; (d) to deliver to Loan Pledgee any estoppel certificate that Loan
Pledgee may reasonably request; (e) that Senior Lender shall give to Loan
Pledgee copies of any Senior Loan Default Notice simultaneously with the giving
of same to the Mezzanine Lender and accept any cure thereof by Loan Pledgee made
in accordance with the provisions of Section 11 of this Agreement as if such
cure were made by the Mezzanine Lender; and (f) that, upon written notice (a
"Redirection Notice") to Senior Lender by Loan Pledgee that Mezzanine Lender is
in default, beyond applicable cure periods, under Mezzanine Lender's obligations
to Loan Pledgee pursuant to the applicable credit agreement between Mezzanine
Lender and Loan Pledgee (which notice need not be joined in or confirmed by
Mezzanine Lender), and until such Redirection Notice is withdrawn or rescinded
by Loan Pledgee, Senior Lender shall remit to Loan Pledgee and not to Mezzanine
Lender, any payments that Senior Lender would otherwise be obligated to pay to
Mezzanine Lender from time to time pursuant to this Agreement, any Mezzanine
Loan Document or any other agreement between Senior Lender and Mezzanine Lender
that relates to the Senior Loan. Mezzanine Lender hereby unconditionally and
absolutely releases Senior Lender from any liability (other than any liability
resulting from Senior Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct) to
Mezzanine Lender on account of Senior Lender's compliance with any Redirection
Notice believed by Senior Lender to have been delivered by Loan Pledgee. Loan
Pledgee shall be permitted to fully exercise its rights and remedies against
Mezzanine Lender, and realize on any and all collateral granted by Mezzanine
Lender to Loan Pledgee (and accept an assignment in lieu of foreclosure as to
such collateral), in accordance with applicable law. In such event, the Senior
Lender shall recognize Loan Pledgee (and any transferee which is also a
Qualified Transferee at any foreclosure or similar sale held by Loan Pledgee or
any transfer in lieu of such foreclosure), and its successors and assigns, as
the successor to Mezzanine Lender's rights, remedies and obligations under this
Agreement and the Mezzanine Loan Documents and any such Loan Pledgee or
Qualified Transferee shall assume in the writing the obligations of the
Mezzanine Lender hereunder accruing from and after such Transfer and agrees to
be bound by the terms and provisions hereof. The rights of Loan Pledgee under
this Section 15 shall remain effective unless and until Loan Pledgee shall have
notified the Senior Lender in writing that its interest in the Mezzanine Loan
has terminated.

  Section 16.  Master Guaranty. Senior Lender acknowledges and agrees that the
Master Guaranty has been amended to terminate those portions of the Master
Guaranty which relate to the Senior Loan. Senior Lender acknowledges that it
shall have no rights or remedies with respect to the Master Guaranty or the
collateral securing the Master Guaranty.

  Section 17.  Obligations Hereunder Not Affected.

          (a)  All rights, interests, agreements and obligations of Senior
Lender and Mezzanine Lender under this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect irrespective of:

               (i)     any lack of validity or enforceability of the Senior Loan
     Documents or the Mezzanine Loan Documents or any other agreement or
     instrument relating thereto;

               (ii)    any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any

     consent to or departure from any guaranty, for all or any portion of the
     Senior Loan or the Mezzanine Loan;

               (iii)   any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds
     thereof, to all or any portion of the Senior Loan or the Mezzanine Loan, or
     any manner of sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any
     portion of the Senior Loan or the Mezzanine Loan or any other assets of any
     Borrower or any Mezzanine Borrower or any other Affiliates of Borrowers;

               (iv)    any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate
     structure or existence of any Borrower or any Mezzanine Borrower or any
     other Affiliates of Borrowers; or

               (v)     any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
     defense available to, or a discharge of, any Borrower, any Mezzanine
     Borrower or a subordinated creditor or a Senior Lender subject to the terms
     hereof.

          (b)  This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated,
as the case may be, if at any time any payment of all or any portion of the
Senior Loan is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by Senior Lender or
Mezzanine Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any
Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

  Section 18.  Notices. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals or
other communications required, permitted, or desired to be given hereunder shall
be in writing sent by facsimile (with answer back acknowledged) or by registered

hand or reputable overnight courier addressed to the party to be so notified at

and all reasonable expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees
and expenses of its counsel and of any experts or agents, which Senior Lender
may incur in connection with the (i) exercise or enforcement of any of the

breach of this Agreement by the other, the remedies of injunction, declaratory
judgment and specific performance shall be available to such non-breaching
party.

          (a)  Each of Senior Lender and Mezzanine Lender are sophisticated

independent expert evaluation of the terms, covenants, conditions and provisions
of, respectively, the Senior Loan Documents and the Mezzanine Loan Documents and
such other matters, materials and market conditions and criteria which each of
Senior Lender and Mezzanine Lender deem relevant. Each of Senior Lender and
Mezzanine Lender has not relied in entering into this Agreement, and
respectively, the Senior Loan, the Senior Loan Documents, the Mezzanine Loan or
the Mezzanine Loan Documents, upon any oral or written information,
representation, warranty or covenant from the other, or any of the other's
representatives, employees, Affiliates or agents other than the representations
and warranties of the other contained herein. Each of Senior Lender and
Mezzanine Lender further acknowledges that no employee, agent or representative
of the other has been authorized to make, and that each of Senior Lender and
Mezzanine Lender have not relied upon, any statements, representations,
warranties or covenants other than those specifically contained in this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Senior Lender and Mezzanine
Lender acknowledges that the other has made no representations or warranties as
to the Senior Loan or the Mezzanine Loan or any of the Properties (including,
without limitation, the cash flow of any

                                     - 34 -

Property, the value, marketability, condition or future performance thereof, the
existence, status, adequacy or sufficiency of the leases, the tenancies or
occupancies of any Property, or the sufficiency of the cash flow of any of the
Properties, to pay all amounts which may become due from time to time pursuant
to the Senior Loan or the Mezzanine Loan).

          (b)  Each of Senior Lender and Mezzanine Lender acknowledges that the
Senior Loan and the Mezzanine Loan Documents are distinct, separate transactions
and loans, separate and apart from each other.
