mapping, physical and environmental inspection, conducting an appraisal and other
reasonable purposes related to the sale of the Property. PURCHASER hereby indemnifies and
holds harmless SELLER from and against any and all claims, liens, damages, losses, and
causes of action which may be asserted by PURCHASER or PURCHASER&#146;S employees, agents,
or any third party who enters upon the Property or conducts tests related to the Property

<U>Election At The End Of The Inspection Period.</U> During the Inspection Period and
prior to Closing, PURCHASER may make the above-described physical and environmental
inspections, applications, reviews, studies, appraisals, evaluations or surveys required
to satisfy itself as to the acceptability and suitability of the Property for purchase.
Should, for any or no reason and in its sole discretion, PURCHASER not be satisfied that
the Property is acceptable or suitable, PURCHASER shall notify SELLER in writing on or
before the expiration of the Inspection Period of its dissatisfaction, at which time this
Agreement shall be considered null and void and of no further force and effect and the
Deposit shall be promptly returned to PURCHASER, however, if the objections of PURCHASER
are to title or other defects which SELLER can reasonably cure prior to Closing, then
SELLER shall have the right to cure such defects to the reasonable satisfaction of
PURCHASER prior to Closing. PURCHASER shall, at any time, have the right to waive the
conditions precedent to its performance under this Agreement before the end of the
Inspection Period and if PURCHASER elects to waive the conditions precedent to its
performance, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and the Deposit shall
become non-refundable except as otherwise provided herein. Failure of PURCHASER to notify
SELLER of its dissatisfaction prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period shall be
deemed a waiver of this condition precedent and acceptance of the Property as suitable for
purchase, as required above. If PURCHASER gives notice to SELLER of an unacceptable
environmental condition and requests that SELLER correct or remediate the condition,
SELLER may elect to (a) correct or remediate the condition at SELLER&#146;S expense and on
terms acceptable to both Parties; or (b) terminate the Agreement, in which event the
Deposit promptly shall be returned to PURCHASER.</FONT></TD>

          <U>Easements.</U> At the time of Closing, PURCHASER shall grant to SELLER
          easements (&#147;Easements&#148;), without cost to SELLER, over, upon, across
          and under the Property for the operation of SELLER&#146;S existing and future

          grants of easements (collectively, &#147;Grant of Easements&#148;) satisfactory
          to both SELLER and PURCHASER. Agreement of SELLER and PURCHASER as to the
          Easements and the form and substance of the Grant of Easements shall be
          conditions precedent to the obligations of both SELLER and PURCHASER to effect
          Closing, which conditions are for the benefit of both SELLER and PURCHASER. If
          SELLER and PURCHASER fail to agree on the nature and extent of the Easements
          and/or the form and substance of the Grant of Easements on or before the Closing
          Date, then either Party may terminate this Agreement upon notice to the other,
          in which event the Deposit shall be immediately refunded and paid to PURCHASER. </FONT></P>

          <U>Condemnation.</U> In the event any condemnation proceedings are instituted
          with respect to the Property, then SELLER shall promptly notify PURCHASER
          thereof. If such condemnation applies to a substantial portion (hereinafter
          defined) of the Property, then SELLER and PURCHASER shall each have the option
          to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other given within five
          (5) business days after delivery of SELLER&#146;S notice to PURCHASER, in which
          event the Deposit shall be returned to PURCHASER. For purposes of condemnation,
          a substantial portion of the Property shall be deemed to mean ten percent (10%)
          or more of the Property or of the improvements located on the Property,
          including electrical facilities. If this Agreement is not terminated, then
          PURCHASER shall consummate the purchase of the Property without reduction in the
          Purchase Price. In the event PURCHASER consummates the purchase of the Property,
          then the right to collect any condemnation award shall be assigned by SELLER to
          PURCHASER. SELLER shall not agree to or accept any compromise or condemnation
          award without obtaining PURCHASER&#146;S written approval thereof, which shall
          not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. </FONT></P>

          <U>Force Majeure.</U> Neither party shall be in default under the terms of this
          Agreement if the failure to comply with the terms and conditions of this
          Agreement is caused by an Uncontrollable Force. An &#147;Uncontrollable
          Force&#148; is defined as any cause beyond the control of the party affected,
          including, but not limited to, storm, fire, lightning, riot, civil disturbance,
          labor disturbance, and restraint by court order or governmental action, which
          the party could not have reasonably foreseen and avoided. A party cannot claim
          Uncontrollable Force based the actions of a subcontractor of that party. A party
          cannot claim Uncontrollable Force if that party&#146;s negligence contributed to
          the existence of the Uncontrollable Force. A party claiming Uncontrollable Force
          shall take all reasonable actions to remove the Uncontrollable Force as soon as
          is reasonably possible. The party claiming Uncontrollable Force shall notify the
          other party as soon as is reasonably possible of the occurrence and shall keep
          the other party informed of the actions being taken to remove the Uncontrollable
          Force. </FONT></P>

          <U>Undergrounding.</U> The Purchase Price of $20,700,000 is based upon the value
          of the Property if the Undergrounding occurs. If the Undergrounding does not
          occur, then the Parties agree that the value of the Property is eighteen
          million, one hundred and ten thousand dollars ($18,110,000). Therefore, the
          PURCHASER shall pay to SELLER, eighteen million, one hundred and ten thousand
          dollars ($18,110,000) at Closing. If (i) the Undergrounding has commenced within
          five (5) years of the Closing Date, (ii) within seven (7) years of the Closing
          Date the Facilities have been removed from the Property and relocated and
          replaced with underground power lines and facilities in Flamingo Road
          right-of-way and (iii) within seven (7) years of the Closing Date SELLER has
          vacated, terminated and relinquished its Easement for the Facilities in the
          northerly 48 feet of the Property (except for any such portion of that Easement
          area as may be necessary for SELLER to continue to provide service to its
          customers), then PURCHASER agrees that the value of the Property will have
          increased by two million, five hundred and ninety thousand dollars ($2,590,000),
          in which event PURCHASER agrees to then pay to SELLER the $2,590,000
          (&#147;Additional Amount&#148;). The Additional Amount shall be paid to SELLER
          within 30 days of the timely fulfillment of all three (3) of the conditions set
          forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence,
          including the recording in the Official Records of Clark County, Nevada of the
          vacation, termination and relinquishment of SELLER&#146;S Easement for the
          Facilities, time being of the essence. If any one of those 3 conditions is not
          timely fulfilled, PURCHASER shall have no further obligation to pay the
          Additional Amount. Each Party shall be responsible for any taxes, assessments,
          costs and brokerage fees incurred because of the payment of the Additional
          Amount as a part of the Purchase Price and shall hold the other Party harmless
          therefrom. For purposes of this Agreement, the Undergrounding shall be deemed to
          have commenced when (i) all building, construction and encroachment permits
          necessary for the construction and installation of the replacement facilities
          have been issued by all State of Nevada and Clark County authorities and (ii)
          physical trenching and/or pavement removal for the replacement facilities has
          physically commenced at some location. If a portion of the Property is used for
          the Undergrounding, or if PURCHASER is required to pay certain costs or expenses
          for the Undergrounding, SELLER shall not be responsible for any such property
          loss, costs or expenses, and neither the value of the Property nor the costs or
          expenses shall be applied to or set-off against the Additional Amount. In the
          event of any dispute between the Parties relative to a matter set forth in this
          Section 33 (hereafter referred to as a &#147;Dispute&#148;), the Dispute shall
          be resolved by final and binding arbitration in accordance with Section 35. If
          not timely paid when due, the Additional Amount shall accrue simple interest at
          the rate of 12% per annum, beginning on the date it is due until paid. </FONT></P>

          <U>Arbitration Process.</U> A Dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in
          accordance with Chapter 38 of Nevada Revised Statutes, unless the Parties agree
          otherwise. Notice of demand for arbitration shall be given in writing by one
          Party to the other. Any arbitration shall be conducted before a single
          arbitrator selected by the Parties. If the Parties are unable to agree upon an
          arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be appointed by the court and, if reasonably
          possible, shall be a former, retired or senior justice of the peace or district
          court judge who has served in that capacity in Clark County, Nevada. The
          arbitration shall be undertaken without the conduct of any discovery, save and
          except an exchange of all documents which each Party intends to introduce in the
          arbitration, copies of which shall be furnished to the other Party not less than
          five (5) business days prior to the date of the arbitration hearing. The
          arbitration hearing shall consist of a single hearing to be held in Clark
          County, Nevada. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon
          the Parties and may be enforced in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 38
          of Nevada Revised Statutes. Fees of the arbitrator, other costs of arbitration
          and reasonable attorneys&#146; fees of the prevailing Party shall be borne by
          the non-prevailing Party, with the amount of attorneys&#146; fees and costs to
          be determined by the arbitrator in the arbitration. </FONT></P>
