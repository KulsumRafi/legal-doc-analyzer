<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dear Mr. Henderson:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This shall confirm the agreement between Roger Henderson ("Henderson") and Chyron Corporation (the "Company") pursuant to which you have agreed voluntarily to terminate your employment with the Company, earlier than provided for in the Employment Agreement dated July 12, 1999, as amended on January 10, 2002, April 5, 2001 and May 14, 2002 (collectively, the "Employment Agreement"), and in accordance with the terms hereof.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.&#9;<U>Separation Date</U>.  Henderson shall resign his positions with the Company as: President and Chief Executive Officer, all officer and director positions of all subsidiaries of the Company, and all fiduciary positions with regard to pension plans and 401(k) plans effective February 21, 2003 (the "Separation Date").  Henderson has agreed to remain on the Board of Directors of the Company following the Separation Date and he shall be compensated as any other outside director for such service following such date.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&#9;<U>Options</U>.  Henderson has been previously granted options to purchase a total of 650,000 shares of common stock of the Company.  The Company agrees that the time period to exercise options to purchase 150,000 shares of common stock, which are fully vested and with an exercise price of $0.55 per share, shall be extended until February 28, 2005.

The Company shall pay Henderson a consulting fee of $15,000 on March 22, 2003 and April 22, 2003 for providing consulting services to the Company as requested by the Office of the Chief Executive Officer during the period of February 22, 2003 through and including April 22, 2003, (the "Consulting Period").  If during the Consulting Period, Henderson should become employed full-time with another company, then the consulting fee shall be reduced pro-rata based upon when such employment begins and the amount of time remaining in the consulting period.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.&#9;<U>Benefits and Other Items</U>.  Pro-Bel shall continue to pay for the health and life insurance policies, which currently cover Henderson and his family through April 21, 2003.  Henderson may keep, at no charge, the Company's laptop that he currently has in his possession and the Company's desktop personal computer that he uses in his United Kingdom home.  Henderson's mobile telephone number, 44-789-984-7117, shall be retained by him and he shall assume responsibility for payment of the service following the Separation Date.  Henderson shall pay the tax preparation fees of PriceWaterhouseCoopers for the year 2003.  In accordance with Company policy, Henderson shall be paid for any accrued and unused vacation pay as of the Separation Date and any unreimbursed business expenses, including without limitation the cost of the preparation of Henderson's 2002 USA tax returns.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&#9;<U>Extension of Transaction Bonus</U>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.&#9;<U>Continuing Obligations of Henderson</U>.  In exchange for the extension of the exercise period for the options as set forth herein and the extension of the Transaction Bonus, Henderson hereby reaffirms his obligations under Section 6 (Non-Competition), Section 7 (Patents; Copyrights) and Section 8 (Confidential Information) of the Employment Agreement and agrees to act in accordance with these restrictions.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.&#9;<U>Reduced Amounts</U>.  Henderson agrees that his Base Salary shall remain at the reduced rate of $280,000 per annum through the Separation Date and he acknowledges that he is not owed any other sums of money with respect to taking a reduced salary since April 2001.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.&#9;<U>No Other Payments</U>.  Except as specifically provided herein or as otherwise may be required by law, Henderson shall not be entitled to receive any other payments, benefits or severance amounts from the Company following the Separation Date, whether pursuant to the Employment Agreement, the Company's severance and retention plans or otherwise.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.&#9;<U>Continuing Indemnity</U>.  The Company hereby acknowledges its obligation to continue to indemnify Henderson for any claims made against him arising from his service as an officer and director of the Company, including its subsidiaries, and as a fiduciary for the Company's pension plans.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">17.&#9;<U>Severability</U>.  If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then the invalidity or unenforceability of that provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect and such invalid or unenforceable provision shall be reformulated by such court to preserve the intent of the parties hereto.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">18.&#9;<U>Counterparts</U>.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same Agreement.</P>
