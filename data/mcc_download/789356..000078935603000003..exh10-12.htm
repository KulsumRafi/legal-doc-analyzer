desires to enter into any Sale Transaction (either in the Company's sole
determination or as a result of the Company being approached by any Person that
desires to enter into a Sale Transaction with the Company which the Company
wishes to entertain), the Company shall, prior to entering into any substantive
negotiations with respect to any Sale Transaction with any Person, give CPK
written notice of its desire to enter into a Sale Transaction and, if within
fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, CPK states in writing that CPK
is interested therein, the Company shall attempt in good faith to negotiate the
terms of such Sale Transaction with CPK on mutually satisfactory terms.  If the
Company determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it will not be able to
reach or is unlikely to be able to reach a satisfactory agreement with CPK with
respect to the terms of such Sale Transaction, the Company shall so notify CPK
in writing, and the Company shall then be free to locate, negotiate with, and

the Company may only enter into a Sale Transaction with a Person other than CPK
in which the Cash Equivalent (as determined in the manner described in Section
2.1(e)) of the consideration that the Company would receive from such Person as
consideration for the closing of such Sale Transaction does not exceed 110% of
the CPK Cash Equivalent if (i) the Company delivers to CPK a written notice
stating that the Company has received an offer from another Person to enter into
a Sale Transaction (the &quot;<B>Third Party Written Notice</B>&quot;), which
Third Party Written Notice sets forth (A) the form and amount of consideration
to be paid as consideration for the closing of such Sale Transaction, and (B)
the Cash Equivalent (as determined in the manner described in Section 2.1(e)) as
of the date of such Third Party Written Notice, and (ii) CPK does not, within
fifteen (15) days after such Third Party Written Notice is deemed delivered to
CPK by the Company, deliver a written notice (the &quot;<B>Second CPK Written
Offer</B>&quot;) to the Company stating that CPK wishes to enter into a Sale
Transaction with the Company in which the consideration received by the Company
as consideration for the closing of such Sale Transaction (Y) is in the form of

(unless the consideration offered by such other Person is solely in the form of
cash, in which case such consideration must be in the form of cash or Freely

Third Party Written Notice that equals or exceeds the Cash Equivalent of the
consideration set forth in such Third Party Written Notice.  If CPK timely
delivers such Second CPK Written Offer to the Company, the Company and CPK shall
enter into good faith negotiations to close such Sale Transaction.  In the event
that the consideration that the Company would receive from such other Person as
consideration for the closing of such Sale Transaction is or includes Other Non-
Cash Consideration, the Third Party Written Notice shall not be deemed to have
been delivered until the Cash Equivalent value of such Other Non-Cash
Consideration has been determined as provided in Section 2.1(e).</LI></P>

Offer (as applicable) is greater than 110% of the Cash Equivalent of such
consideration as of the date of the CPK Written Offer or Second CPK Written
Offer (as applicable) (the &quot;<B>Initial Sale Value</B>&quot;), CPK, in its
sole discretion, shall have the right to terminate the Sale Transaction unless
the Company agrees to accept consideration of the same type offered by CPK in
the CPK Written Offer or Second CPK Written Offer (as applicable) which, on the
closing date of the Sale Transaction, has a Cash Equivalent equal to 110% of the
Initial Sale Value.  If, as of the day immediately preceding the closing date of
a Sale Transaction between CPK and the Company pursuant to a CPK Written Offer
or a Second CPK Written Offer, the value of the Cash Equivalent of the
consideration offered by CPK in the CPK Written Offer or Second CPK Written
Offer (as applicable) is less than 90% of the Initial Sale Value, the Company,
in its sole discretion, shall have the right to terminate the Sale Transaction
unless CPK agrees to pay consideration of the same type offered by CPK in the
CPK Written Offer or Second CPK Written Offer (as applicable) which, on the
closing date of the Sale Transaction, has a Cash Equivalent equal to 90% of the
Initial Sale Value.  Following any termination pursuant to this Section 2.1(d),
the Company shall have the right to consummate a Sale Transaction with any other
Person so long as the consideration received by the Company in such transaction
has a Cash Equivalent which is equal to or greater than the Initial Sale
Value.</LI></P>

CPK offers to enter into a Sale Transaction with the Company and any portion of
the consideration that the Company would receive from such other Person as
consideration for the closing of such Sale Transaction is in the form of Other
Non-Cash Consideration, the Cash Equivalent of such Other Non-Cash Consideration
shall be determined by the appraisal mechanism set forth in the second paragraph
of Section 3.4(d) as if CPK was the Selling Shareholder).  </LI></P>
