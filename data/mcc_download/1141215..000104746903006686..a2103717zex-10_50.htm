<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributors Sales Targets are defined for calendar&nbsp;years 2002 and 2003 below. For subsequent calendar&nbsp;years during the Term, the parties agree to
use best efforts to negotiate and mutually agree upon new Sales Targets for the coming calendar year between November&nbsp;1 and November&nbsp;30 of the year prior. The mutually agreed upon Sales
Targets shall then apply for the approaching calendar year. For example, the parties shall negotiate and agree upon Sales Targets for year 2004 during the time period November&nbsp;1 through 30,
2003. This cycle shall then apply for each subsequent calendar year during the Term. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
all Product minimum Sales Targets are met or exceeded for both calendar year 2002 and 2003, then Distributor's Exclusivity for the Markets and the Territories shall automatically
extend through the following calendar year, year 2004. Likewise, if subsequent calendar year Sales Targets established via the annual cycle defined above are met or exceeded in any calendar year,
Distributor's Exclusivity for the Markets and the Territories shall automatically extend through the following calendar year. Subject to Sections&nbsp;2.3 and 6.1, failure by Distributor to meet or
exceed the Sales Targets established in year 2004 shall result in loss of Exclusivity in the subsequent calendar year, and Distributors rights shall convert to non-exclusive upon
January&nbsp;1, 2005. </FONT></P>
