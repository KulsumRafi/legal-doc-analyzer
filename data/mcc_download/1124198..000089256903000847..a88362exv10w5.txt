Mark A. Stevens
President

Fluor Daniel

Dear Mark,

It is my pleasure to inform you that at the September 6, 2000 Organization and
Compensation Committee meeting of the Fluor Board of Directors, Phil Carroll
recommended and they approved your participation in a special
Incentive/Retention Program. The amount of the award is $1,000,000. The award
has been structured as follows:

AWARD AMOUNT:                       $1,000,000

INCENTIVE/RETENTION PERIOD:         September 6, 2000 through December 31, 2004

INCENTIVE/RETENTION AGREEMENT:      The Award Amount is divided between the
                                    following two components:

INCENTIVE AWARD

The Organization and Compensation Committee has made a $500,000 grant of 10,000
shares of restricted stock and 6,700 tandem-restricted units. The earning of
these shares and units will be based on exceeding pre-established annual
performance objectives to be determined annually by the President and CEO Fluor
Daniel. The award will be earned in equal 25% increments if the established
objectives for each of the next four fiscal years (ending December 31, 2001,
2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively) are achieved. Your performance objective for
fiscal year 2001 performance will be established by me within the next 90 days.
These objectives will be communicated to you in a separate memorandum. If the
annual objective is not achieved, 100% of each annual portion of the award is
forfeited. The earned restricted stock and units will then vest on January 1,
2005. The entire Incentive Award, earned and unearned portion, will be forfeited
in the event that prior to December 31, 2004 you voluntarily terminate your
employment with the Company, or your employment with the Company is terminated
for cause. The specific terms and conditions of this award will be set forth in
the agreement to be forwarded to you shortly.

ACCRUAL TO EXECUTIVE DEFERRAL COMPENSATION PROGRAM ("EDCP")

You may earn $500,000, said amount to be adjusted as provided below, if you
remain continuously employed by the Company until on or after December 31, 2004
(the "EDCP Accrual"). During the period from September 6, 2000 to the date upon
which the EDCP Accrual vests (if at all), you will also be entitled to invest
the EDCP Accrual by selecting one or more of the crediting options contained in
the Fluor Executive Deferred Compensation Program. Thereafter, the amount of
your EDCP Accrual, if vested, shall be adjusted based upon the investment return
that you would have otherwise received had the EDCP Accrual been actually earned
as of January 1, 2005 and credited in your Fluor Executive Deferred Compensation
Program account based upon your chosen crediting option through the date of
vesting. If no crediting option is indicated, the EDCP Accrual will be
automatically credited as if you chose the Money Market crediting option under
the Fluor Executive Deferred Compensation Program.

The EDCP Accrual, as adjusted, will vest and be credited to your existing
Company Fluor Executive Deferred Compensation Program account (a) if you remain
continuously employed by the Company until December 31, 2004 or (b) if your
employment terminates prior to that date due to (i) death, (ii) permanent and
total disability, (iii) a Company-initiated termination other than on a
for-cause basis or (iv) a Company initiated termination following a Change of
Control. If in the event your employment terminates prior to any such vesting
date for any other reason (including, without limitation, your voluntary
termination or a termination for cause), then the EDCP Accrual, as adjusted,
will be forfeited.

For purposes hereof, the term "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have
occurred if, (a) a third person, including a "group" as defined in Section
13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, acquires shares of the Company
having 25% or more of the votes that may be cast for the election of directors
of the Company or (b) as a result of any cash tender or exchange offer, merger
or other business combination, or any combination of the preceding (a
"transaction"), the persons who are the directors of the Company before the
transaction shall cease to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of
the Company or any successor thereto.
