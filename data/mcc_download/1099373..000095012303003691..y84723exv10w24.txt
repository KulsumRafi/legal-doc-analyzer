3.2      AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLE II:  THE CREDITS

         A. Section 2.01 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by (i)
deleting the "and" at the end of clause (b) thereof and substituting therefor
"," and (ii) adding at the end of clause (c) thereof the following:

         "and (d) to fund an amount for the making of, or for the conversion
         from Tranche A Term Loans to (as the case may be in accordance with the
         immediately following sentence), Tranche C Term Loans on the Fifth
         Amendment Effective Date equal to its Tranche C Commitment.
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, immediately upon the
         funding of such amounts as described in Section 5.11 on the Fifth
         Amendment Effective Date, (x) all Tranche A Term Loans outstanding
         immediately prior to such funding shall be continued as and converted
         to, and shall thereafter be deemed to be, Tranche C Term Loans (in an
         aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of
         all outstanding Tranche A Term Loans) hereunder, and shall be subject
         to the terms and provisions of the Tranche C Term Loans (and not the
         Tranche A Term Loans) set forth in this Agreement, and (y) each Tranche
         C Lender shall be deemed to have made additional Tranche C Term Loans
         in the aggregate amount of all amounts funded by such Tranche C Lender
         on such date less the aggregate principal amount of all Tranche A Term
         Loans converted pursuant to clause (x), so that the aggregate principal
         amount of Tranche C Term Loans on the Fifth Amendment Effective Date
         after giving effect to clauses (x) and (y) shall be $35,000,000.
         Interest shall begin to accrue on the Tranche C Term Loans as of the



                                        5

<PAGE>

         Fifth Amendment Effective Date. It is the intent of the parties hereto
         that this conversion of the Tranche A Term Loans and continuation of
         the Tranche A Term Loans as Tranche C Term Loans not constitute a
         novation of the obligations and liabilities of the parties under the
         Credit Agreement or be deemed to be evidence or constitute repayment of
         all or any portion of such obligations and liabilities. On the Fifth
         Amendment Effective Date, concurrently with the conversion referred to
         in this Section 2.01, the Tranche C Lender, without executing an
         Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, shall be deemed to have
         automatically purchased assignments from each Tranche A Lender of all
         such Tranche A Lenders' rights and obligations under this Agreement
         (including all outstanding Tranche A Term Loans of such Tranche A
         Lenders) and the other Loan Documents with respect to the Tranche A
         Loans (collectively, except as set forth below, the "ASSIGNED RIGHTS
         AND OBLIGATIONS"), and each Tranche A Lender shall be deemed to have
         automatically assigned and sold such Tranche A Loans to the Tranche C
         Lender. Each such purchase hereunder shall be at par for a purchase
         price equal to the principal amount of the purchased Tranche A Term
         Loans plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and shall be without
         recourse, representation or warranty, except that each Tranche A Lender
         shall be deemed to represent and warrant to the Tranche C Lender that
         the Assigned Rights and Obligations of such Tranche A Lender are not
         subject to any Liens created by that Lender. Upon such deemed
         assignment, the Tranche A Lenders, in such capacity as Tranche A
         Lenders, shall no longer be deemed to be parties to this Agreement. On
         the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, Administrative Agent shall
         distribute the amounts funded in accordance with Section 2.01(d) to the
         Tranche A Lenders entitled to receive payments, pro rata in proportion
         to the amount each such Lender is entitled to receive."

         B. Section 2.02(b) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by adding
at the end thereof the following new sentence:

         "Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Tranche C Term Loan shall be a
         Fixed Rate Loan."

         C. Section 2.03(b) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by
deleting the words "in the case of an ABR Borrowing" therefrom and substituting
therefor the following:

         "in the case of an ABR Borrowing or a Tranche C Term Loan Borrowing".

         D. Section 2.03 of the Credit Agreement is hereby further amended by
deleting clauses (i) and (iv) from the third sentence thereof and substituting
therefor the following:

         "(i)     whether the requested Borrowing is to be a Domestic Revolving
         Borrowing, Tranche A Term Loan Borrowing, Tranche B Term Loan Borrowing
         or Tranche C Term Loan Borrowing;"

         "(iv)    in the case of any Borrowing other than a Tranche C Term Loan
         Borrowing, whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
         Eurodollar Borrowing".



                                        6

<PAGE>

         E. Section 2.07(a) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended inserting
the following immediately after the first sentence thereof:

         "All Additional Tranche B Principal (as defined in Section 2.12(e))
         shall constitute ABR Loans."

         F. Section 2.07(a) of the Credit Agreement is hereby further amended by
deleting the concluding sentence therefrom and substituting therefor the
following:

         "This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings or to Tranche C
         Term Loan Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued."

         G. Section 2.08(a) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by
deleting it in its entirety and substituting therefor the following:

         "(a) Unless previously terminated, (i) the Tranche A Commitments and
         Tranche B Commitments shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time,
         on the Effective Date, (ii) the Tranche C Commitments shall terminate
         at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Fifth Amendment Effective Date
         and (iii) the Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving
         Maturity Date."

         H. Section 2.10(b) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by
deleting it in its entirety and substituting therefor the following:

         "(b) Subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section,
the Parent Borrower shall repay Tranche B Term Borrowings on each date in the
table set forth below (or if such date is not a Business Day, the next preceding
Business Day) in the aggregate principal amount set forth opposite such date.
For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate principal amount of Tranche B Term
Loans outstanding on March 20, 2003 is $144,998,148.15.

SECTION 5.        PARENT BORROWER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         In order to induce Lenders to enter into this Amendment and to amend
the Credit Agreement in the manner provided herein, Parent Borrower represents
and warrants to each Lender that the following statements are true, correct and
complete as of the Fifth Amendment Effective Date:

         A. CORPORATE POWER AND AUTHORITY. Parent Borrower and each other Loan
Party has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business
as now conducted, to enter into this Amendment and to carry out the transactions
contemplated by, and perform its obligations under, the Credit Agreement as
amended by this Amendment (the "AMENDED AGREEMENT").

         B. AUTHORIZATION OF AGREEMENTS. The execution and delivery of this
Amendment, and the performance of the Amended Agreement have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required, stockholder action on
the part of Parent Borrower and each other Loan Party signatory hereto.

         C. NO CONFLICT. The execution and delivery by Parent Borrower and each
other Loan Party signatory hereto of this Amendment, the performance by Parent
Borrower and each other Loan Party signatory hereto of the Amended Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not
(i) violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other
organizational documents of the Parent Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or
any order of any Governmental Authority, (ii) conflict with, result in a default
under any material indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon the
Parent Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or any of their assets, or give right
to a right thereunder to require any material payment to be made by the Parent
Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, (iii) result in or require the creation or
imposition of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Liens created under any of the Loan
Documents), or (iv) require any approval or consent of any Person under any
contractual obligation of Parent Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, except for
such approvals or consents which have been obtained on or before the Fifth
Amendment Effective Date and disclosed in writing to Lenders.

         D. GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS. The execution and delivery by Parent Borrower
and each other Loan Party of this Amendment and the performance by Parent
Borrower and each other Loan Party of the Amended Agreement do not require any
consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by or
before, any Governmental Authority,


                                       18

<PAGE>

except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect prior
to the Fifth Amendment Effective Date and disclosed in writing to the Lenders.

         E. BINDING OBLIGATION. This Amendment and the Amended Agreement have
been duly executed and delivered by Parent Borrower and each other Loan Party
signatory hereto and are the legally valid and binding obligations of Parent
Borrower and each other Loan Party signatory hereto, enforceable against Parent
Borrower and each other Loan Party signatory hereto in accordance with their
respective terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or limiting creditors'
rights generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability,
regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

         F. SOLVENCY. Immediately after the consummation of the transactions to
occur on the Fifth Amendment Effective Date and immediately following the making
of each Tranche C Term Loan made on the Fifth Amendment Effective Date and after
giving effect to the application of the proceeds of such Loans, (a) the fair
value of the assets of each Loan Party, at a fair valuation, will exceed its
debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise; (b) the present
fair saleable value of the property of each Loan Party will be greater than the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of its debts and
other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and
other liabilities become absolute and matured; (c) each Loan Party will be able
to pay its debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such
debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (d) no Loan Party will
have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the business in which it

following the Fifth Amendment Effective Date.

         G. INCORPORATION OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES FROM CREDIT
AGREEMENT. The representations and warranties contained in Article III of the
Credit Agreement (considered as if already amended by this Amendment) are and
will be true, correct and complete in all material respects on and as of the
Fifth Amendment Effective Date to the same extent as though made on and as of
that date, except to the extent such representations and warranties specifically
relate to an earlier date, in which case they were true, correct and complete in
all material respects on and as of such earlier date.

         H. ANNUAL REPORT. The Parent Borrower has heretofore furnished to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders its unaudited consolidated balance sheet
and statement of income and cash flows as of and for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2002. Such unaudited financial statements were prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis, and on that basis, present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of
operations and cash flows of the Parent Borrower and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of such date and for such period. The Parent Borrower has
heretofore furnished to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders a draft of its
Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002. Such draft Annual
Report does not contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.


                                       19

<PAGE>

         I. NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. Except for a default of the type
described in Section 4.H of this Amendment, since December 31, 2002, nothing has
occurred which would have a Material Adverse Effect.

         J. ABSENCE OF DEFAULT. Except for a default of the type described in
Section 4.H of this Amendment, no event has occurred and is continuing or will
result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Amendment
that would constitute a Default or an Event of Default.

         K. RELEASE AND AFFIRMATION. Parent Borrower on and as of the Fifth
Amendment Effective Date (1) has no (and it permanently and irrevocably waives
and releases Administrative Agent and Lenders from any, to the extent arising on
or prior to the Fifth Amendment Effective Date) defense, set off, claim or
counterclaim against Administrative Agent or any Lender in regard to its
obligations in respect of the Tranche A Term Loans being converted to Tranche C
Term Loans on such date, the Tranche B Loans and the Revolving Loans and (2)

Term Loans into which such Loans are being converted), the Tranche B Loans and
the Revolving Loans and any amounts owed with respect thereto (whether or not
presently due and payable) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

                  INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT dated as of March, 2003, among
         KNOWLES ELECTRONICS HOLDINGS, INC. (formerly known as Knowles
         Electronics, Inc.), a Delaware corporation (the "Parent Borrower"),
         each Subsidiary of the Parent Borrower listed on the signature pages
         hereto (each such Subsidiary, individually, a "Subsidiary Guarantor"
         and, collectively, the "Subsidiary Guarantors"; the Borrower and the
         Subsidiary Guarantors are referred to collectively herein as the
         "Grantors"), JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, a New York banking corporation
         (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank) ("JPMCB"), as
         Administrative Agent for the Lenders under the Existing Credit
         Agreement (as defined below) and the other Loan Documents, and SILVER
         OAK CAPITAL LLC (the "Tranche C Lender").

         Reference is made to (a) the Credit Agreement dated as of June 28,
1999, as amended and restated as of July 21, 1999, and as further amended as of
December 23, 1999, April 10, 2000, December 12, 2001 and May 10, 2002 (as
further amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, including
pursuant to the Fifth Amendment referred to herein, the "Existing Credit
Agreement"), among the Parent Borrower, the several lenders from time to time
parties thereto (the "Lenders") and JPMCB, as administrative agent and (b) the
Security Documents (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement). Capitalized
terms used herein have the meanings specified in Section 10 hereof.

         Pursuant to the Security Documents, the Grantors have granted to the
Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties security
interests in the Collateral to secure the payment and performance of the
Obligations. To induce the Tranche B Lenders and Revolving Lenders to approve
the Fifth Amendment (and as a condition to the effectiveness thereof), each of
the Grantors and the Tranche C Lender have agreed to enter into this Agreement
to provide for certain rights and obligations with respect to the Collateral. In
approving the Fifth Amendment, each of the Tranche B Lenders and Revolving
Lenders that is a party thereto is relying on the undertakings of each of the
Grantors and the Tranche C Lender as set forth herein.

         Accordingly, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained
and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency and receipt of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Grantors, JPMCB, in its capacity as Administrative
Agent, on behalf of itself and the First Priority Secured Parties, and the
Tranche C Lender, on behalf of itself and the other Second Priority Secured
Parties, hereby agree as follows:

         SECTION 1. Priority of Liens. (a) Notwithstanding that the Security
Documents provide for the grant by the Grantors of Liens on the Collateral to
the Administrative Agent to secure all the Obligations for the ratable benefit
of the Secured Parties, each of the parties hereto and, by acceptance of the
benefits of this Agreement and the Security Documents, each Secured Party agrees
that (i) the parties intend that the Security Documents shall be construed to
create, and shall be deemed to create as between the Lenders, first-priority
Liens securing the First Priority Secured Obligations and second-priority Liens
securing the Second Priority Secured Obligations, and, accordingly, (ii) all
Liens on the Collateral (A) securing the First Priority Secured Obligations
shall be and remain first-priority Liens, senior in all respects and prior to
all Liens on the Collateral securing the Second Priority Secured Obligations and
(B) securing the Second Priority Secured Obligations shall be and remain
second-priority Liens, junior in all respects to all Liens on the Collateral
securing the First Priority Secured Obligations, in each case whether or not any
such Liens are subordinated to any other Lien securing any obligation of the
Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor. In that connection, and

<PAGE>

                                                                               2

notwithstanding the date, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of
any financing statement or any Liens granted to the Administrative Agent or the
Secured Parties under, or any other provision of, the Security Documents or the
Existing Credit Agreement (or any actual or alleged defect or deficiency in any
of the foregoing) and notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Commercial
Code as enacted by any state or any applicable law or any other circumstance
whatsoever, each Second Priority Secured Party hereby agrees that (x) any Lien
on the Collateral securing any First Priority Secured Obligations now or
hereafter held by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent or any First Priority
Secured Party shall be senior in all respects and shall be a first-priority
Lien, prior to any Lien on the Collateral securing any of the Second Priority
Secured Obligations, and (y) any Lien on the Collateral securing any Second
Priority Secured Obligations now or hereafter held by or on behalf of the
Administrative Agent or any Second Priority Secured Party shall be junior in all
respects to the Liens on the Collateral securing the First Priority Secured
Obligations and shall be a second-priority Lien.

         (b)      The Second Priority Secured Parties acknowledge that a portion
of the First Priority Secured Obligations represent Indebtedness that is
revolving in nature and that the amount thereof that may be outstanding at any
time or from time to time may be increased or reduced and subsequently
reborrowed, and that the terms of the First Priority Secured Obligations may be
modified, extended or amended from time to time, and the aggregate amount of the
First Priority Secured Obligations may be increased, replaced or refinanced, all
without notice to or consent by the Second Priority Secured Parties (other than
as expressly provided in the Existing Credit Agreement) and without affecting
the provisions hereof. The priorities provided in Section 1(a) shall not be
altered or otherwise affected by any amendment, modification, supplement,
extension, increase, replacement, renewal, restatement or refinancing of either
the First Priority Secured Obligations or the Second Priority Secured
Obligations, or any portion thereof, nor by any action that the First Priority
Secured Parties or the Second Priority Secured Parties may take or fail to take
in respect of the Collateral.

         SECTION 2. Exercise of Remedies; Determinations Relative to Collateral.
(a) The Administrative Agent shall have the exclusive right to enforce rights,
exercise remedies and make determinations regarding the release, disposition or
restrictions, in each case, with respect to the Collateral, pursuant to the
Security Documents, as instructed by the Required Lenders; provided that the
foregoing shall not be construed to prohibit the exercise by the Administrative
Agent of rights and remedies under the Security Documents that it is entitled to
and elects to exercise. In exercising rights and remedies with respect to the
Collateral, the Administrative Agent may enforce the provisions of the Security
Documents and exercise remedies thereunder, all in such order and in such manner
as it may determine or as instructed by the Required Lenders. Such exercise and
enforcement shall include the rights of an agent appointed by the Administrative
Agent to sell or otherwise dispose of the Collateral upon foreclosure, to incur
expenses in connection with such sale or disposition, and to exercise all the
rights and remedies of a secured lender under the Uniform Commercial Code of any
applicable jurisdiction and of a secured creditor under Bankruptcy Laws of any
applicable jurisdiction. The Administrative Agent shall not have any liability
for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of
the Required Lenders (or, if the consent of all Lenders is required under the
Loan Documents, all Lenders). The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to
take any action under this Agreement or any Security Document except for the
performance of such duties as are specifically set forth herein or therein.
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall take
any action under or with respect to the Security Documents that is requested by
the Required Lenders and that is not inconsistent with or contrary to the
provisions of this Agreement or the Security Documents. The Administrative Agent
may take, but shall have no obligation to take, any and all such actions under
the Security Documents or any

<PAGE>

                                                                               3

of them, or otherwise as it shall deem to be in the best interests of the
Secured Parties in order to maintain the Collateral and protect and preserve the
Collateral and the rights of the Secured Parties.

         (b)      (i) Each Second Priority Secured Party agrees that in the
event a proceeding under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code (the
"Bankruptcy Code") or any other Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership or similar law (collectively, "Bankruptcy Laws") shall
be commenced by or against any Grantor, and a Second Priority Secured Party
shall, upon seeking adequate protection as provided in Section 363 of the
Bankruptcy Code, realize any payment in respect of the Collateral as a result of
such adequate protection, such Second Priority Secured Party agrees, prior to
the payment and satisfaction in full of the First Priority Secured Obligations,
to (i) hold such payment in trust and in escrow and (ii) transfer such payment
(other than additional Liens with respect to the Collateral) to the
Administrative Agent upon the earlier to occur of (A) the conclusion of such
proceeding and (B) the sale or liquidation of all or substantially all the
assets of the Parent Borrower and the distribution of the proceeds therefrom, to
be applied by the Administrative Agent in accordance with this Agreement. All
payments received as a result of such adequate protection, including additional
assets subject to additional or replacement Liens, shall be deemed to be
Collateral or proceeds of Collateral for purposes of this Agreement and the
Security Documents to be held in trust in accordance with this Section 2(b).

         (ii)     The Secured Parties hereby further agree that upon the
conversion of any such proceeding under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to a
proceeding under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Second Priority Secured
Parties will transfer any payments held in escrow pursuant to Section 2(b)(i) to
the Administrative Agent, for distribution to the First Priority Secured
Parties, and the Administrative Agent will hold such payments in trust until
distribution in accordance with this Section 2(b)(ii). Upon receipt of an
Assignment and Acceptance described in the next sentence, the Administrative
Agent shall distribute such payments ratably among the First Priority Secured
Parties, and each First Priority Secured Party receiving any portion of such
payment shall apply the payment as the purchase price payable by the Second
Priority Secured Parties for the purchase of an assignment of a corresponding
amount of First Priority Secured Obligations then due and owing to that First
Priority Secured Party under the Loan Documents. The First Priority Secured
Parties and the Second Priority Secured Parties to each assignment shall execute
and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, with such
changes as are necessary, and upon the delivery of such Assignment and
Acceptance (which shall have an effective date as of the date of receipt by a
First Priority Secured Party of its portion of such transferred payment), the
Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and promptly
record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be
effective unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this
Section 2(b)(ii). Upon the assignment of such First Priority Secured Obligations
to the Second Priority Secured Parties, such First Priority Secured Obligations
shall be continued as and converted to, and shall thereafter be deemed for all
purposes of this Agreement (but not for any purpose under the Existing Credit
Agreement) to be, Second Priority Secured Obligations. The Parent Borrower
expressly consents to the foregoing arrangement and agrees that any purchaser of
an assignment so purchased may, subject to the terms of this Agreement, exercise
any and all rights of a Lender as to such assignment as fully as if that Lender
had complied with the provisions of Section 9.04 of the Existing Credit
Agreement with respect to such assignment.

         SECTION 3. Application of Proceeds; Payments Over. (a) Prior to the
payment and satisfaction in full of the First Priority Secured Obligations, if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent
shall apply the Collateral or proceeds

<PAGE>

                                                                               4

thereof received in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or
collection on, such Collateral in the following order of priority:

         FIRST, to the payment in full of all amounts owed to the Administrative
Agent pursuant to this Agreement or the Security Documents, to the extent not
previously paid;

         SECOND, to the payment in full of the First Priority Secured
Obligations (the amounts to be distributed among the First Priority Secured
Parties pro rata in accordance with the amount of the First Priority Secured
Obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution), until the First
Priority Secured Obligations have been paid and satisfied in full;

         THIRD, to the payment in full of the Second Priority Secured
Obligations (the amounts to be distributed among the Second Priority Secured
Parties pro rata in accordance with the amount of the Second Priority Secured
Obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution), until the Second
Priority Secured Obligations have been paid and satisfied in full; and

         FOURTH, the balance, if any, to the Grantors, their successors or
assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.

         (b)      Each Second Priority Secured Party hereby agrees that if at
any time that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing it shall obtain
possession of any of the Collateral, or shall realize any payment in respect of
the Collateral or the proceeds thereof, in either case prior to the time when
the First Priority Secured Obligations have been paid and satisfied in full,
then it shall hold such Collateral or payment in trust for the First Priority
Secured Parties and transfer such Collateral or payment, as the case may be, to
the Administrative Agent, at its request; provided that the Second Priority
Secured Parties shall not be required to transfer interest payments in respect
of the Tranche C Term Loans prior to acceleration of the Loans or the occurrence
of an Event of Default pursuant to 7.01(h) or (i) of the Existing Credit
Agreement. If, at any time, all or part of any payment with respect to the First
Priority Secured Obligations previously made is rescinded for any reason
whatsoever, the Second Priority Secured Parties shall promptly pay over to the
Administrative Agent any payment received by any of them in respect of the
Collateral and shall promptly turn any Collateral then held by any of them over
to the Administrative Agent, and the provisions set forth in this Agreement
shall be reinstated as if such payment had not been made, until the payment and
satisfaction in full of the First Priority Secured Obligations.

         SECTION 4. Information Concerning Financial Condition of Parent
Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The First Priority Secured Parties, on
the one hand, and the Second Priority Secured Parties, on the other hand, shall
each be responsible for keeping themselves informed of (a) the financial
condition of the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors and all endorsers
and/or guarantors of the Obligations and (b) all other circumstances bearing
upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations. The Administrative Agent and the
First Priority Secured Parties shall have no duty to advise the Second Priority
Secured Parties of information known to it or them regarding such condition or
any such circumstances or otherwise. In the event the Administrative Agent or
any of the First Priority Secured Parties, in its or their sole discretion,
undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any such information to
the Second Priority Secured Parties, it or they shall be under no obligation (w)

Collateral, obtain payment in respect any principal of or interest on any of its
Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline
Loans and accrued interest thereon greater than the proportion received by any
other Lender, then such First Priority Secured Party shall only be required to
purchase participations in the Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in
LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans of the other First Priority Secured Parties
