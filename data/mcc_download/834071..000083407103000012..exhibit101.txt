                  DESCRIPTION OF MEDIUM TERM NOTES
              PURCHASED BY TMCC OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

Certain officers and directors of TMCC have purchased medium-term notes from
TMCC. The terms of the notes are summarized below. The form of the note is
attached after this description.

Each of the notes has a term of ten years. The interest rate is a fixed rate
and was set at a rate equal to .80% above the rate for ten year Treasury
notes. The notes were required to be in a minimum principal amount of $100,000.
Each holder of the notes has a one time option to convert his note at par to a
floating rate note bearing interest at LIBOR plus 0.15%. Each holder also has
the right to require TMCC to repurchase his note, in whole but not in part, at
its then market value, as determined by TMCC.

TOYOTA MOTOR CREDIT CORPORATION, a California corporation ("Issuer" or
the "Company," which terms include any successor corporation under the
Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to
pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of ________________
THOUSAND DOLLARS ($____________), or if this is a Principal Indexed Note,
the principal amount as determined in accordance with the terms set forth under
"Other Provisions" above and/or in the Addendum attached hereto, on the Stated
Maturity Date specified above (except to the extent redeemed or repaid prior
to the Stated Maturity Date), and to pay interest on the principal or face
amount as set forth above at the Interest Rate per annum specified above, until
the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment.  Reference
herein to "this Note", "hereof", "herein" and comparable terms shall include an
Addendum hereto if an Addendum is specified above.

            The Company will pay interest on each Interest Payment Date
specified above, commencing on the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding
the Original Issue Date specified above, and on the Stated Maturity Date or
any Redemption Date or Optional Repayment Date (if specified as repayable at
the option of the Holder in an attached Addendum) (the date of each such Stated
Maturity Date, Redemption Date and Optional Repayment Date and the date on
which principal or an installment of principal is due and payable by
declaration of acceleration pursuant to the Indenture being referred to
hereinafter as a "Maturity" with respect to principal payable on such date);
provided, however, that if the Original Issue Date is between a Regular Record
Date (as defined below) and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest
payments will commence on the second Interest Payment Date succeeding the
Original Issue Date.  Except as provided above, interest payments will be
made on the Interest Payment Dates shown above.  Unless otherwise specified
above, the "Regular Record Date" shall be the date 15 calendar days (whether
or not a Business Day) prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date.
Interest on this Note will accrue from and including the most recent Interest
Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no
interest has been paid, from the Original Issue Date specified above, to, but
excluding such Interest Payment Date.  Unless otherwise specified in an
Addendum attached hereto, if the Maturity or an Interest Payment Date falls
on a day which is not a Business Day as defined below, the payment due on
such Maturity or Interest Payment Date will be paid on the next succeeding
Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Maturity
or Interest Payment Date, as the case may be, and no interest shall accrue
with respect to such payment for the period from and after such Maturity or
Interest Payment Date.  The interest so payable and punctually paid or duly
provided for on any Interest Payment Date will as provided in the Indenture
be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor
Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date
for such Interest Payment Date.  Any such interest which is payable, but not
punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein
called "Defaulted Interest"), shall forthwith cease to be payable to the
registered Holder on such Regular Record Date, and may be paid to the Person
in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered
at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such
Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given



                                       4

<PAGE>

to the Holder of this Note not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record
Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully
provided in the Indenture.

            Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made
at the Office or Agency of the Company maintained by the Company for such
purpose, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the
time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts;
provided, however, that at the option of the Company, payment of interest may
be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such
address shall appear in the Security Register; and provided, further, that AT
THE OPTION OF THE COMPANY, the Holder of this Note may be entitled to receive
payments of principal of and interest on this Note by wire transfer of
immediately available funds if appropriate wire transfer instructions have
been received by the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the applicable
payment date.

            Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed
by or on behalf of Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, the Trustee for this
Note under the Indenture, or its successor thereunder, by the manual signature
of one of its authorized officers, this Note shall not be entitled to any
benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the
respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee (as defined below)

                than a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required
                by law, regulation or executive order to close in the Principal
                Financial Center (as defined below) of the country issuing the

            If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be
continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in
the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

            The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be
affected thereby at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of
the Holders of 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of each series affected thereby.  The Indenture also contains
provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on
behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance
by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past
defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or
waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon
the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof
whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

            No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note
or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which
is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this
Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein
prescribed.

            As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security
Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of
transfer at the office or agency of the Company duly endorsed by, or
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or by
its attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes
of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will
be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

            The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in
denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof.  As provided in the
Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Notes are
exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

            No service charge shall be made for any such registration of
transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

            Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer,
the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat
the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all



                                       8

purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the
Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Company shall provide a written quote to the person or entity requesting the
quote within one Business Day of the Company's receipt of the request. The
Holder shall have three Business Days after delivery of the quote to exercise
its right to require the Company to repay the Note in whole at the Market
Price contained in the quote by delivering written notice of such exercise
to the Trustee. The Trustee shall provide written notice of such exercise to
the Company within one Business Day after receiving same from the Holder.
The repayment shall occur on a Business Day specified by the Company which
shall be not more than three Business Days after delivery of the notice to the
Company. The Holder shall have no obligation to exercise the repayment option
after receipt of the quote. However, exercise of the repayment option will be
irrevocable.

            The Note will be a Book-Entry Note represented by one Global
Security. So long as the Depositary or its nominee is the registered owner of
the Global Security, the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, will be
the sole Holder of the Book-Entry Note represented by the Global Security and
only the Depositary may exercise the repayment option in respect of the Global
Security representing the Book-Entry Note. However, the Beneficial Owner and
the participant through which it owns its interest shall have the right to
request a Market Price quote. To exercise the repayment option, the Depositary
must notify the Trustee in writing as outlined above. Accordingly, the
Beneficial Owner of the Global Security that desires to have the Book-Entry
Note represented by such Global Security repaid must instruct the
participant through which it owns its interest to direct the Depositary to
exercise the repayment option on its behalf. To ensure that the Depositary
receives notice from a participant in time to deliver notice to the Trustee
on a particular day, the Beneficial Owner must so instruct the participant
through which it owns its interest before such participant's deadline for
accepting instructions for that day. Different firms may have different
deadlines for accepting instructions from their customers. Accordingly,
the Beneficial Owner should consult the participant through which it owns
its interest for the deadline for such participant. All instructions given
to a participant from the Beneficial Owner of the Global Security relating to



                                       14

the option to elect repayment shall be irrevocable. In addition, at the
time such instructions are given, the Beneficial Owner shall cause the
participant through which it owns its interest to transfer the Beneficial
Owner's interest in the Global Security representing the related Book-Entry
Note on the Depositary's records to the Trustee. The requirement for
physical delivery of a Book-Entry Note in connection with a demand for
repayment will be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights in the Global
Security representing such Book-Entry Note are transferred by the direct
participant on the Depositary's records.

            The Beneficial Owner of the Global Security shall not be entitled
to receive physical delivery of a Certificated Note, except in the limited
circumstances described under "Description of Notes -- Book-Entry Notes" in
the Prospectus Supplement. In such circumstances, the Holder of a Certificated
Note shall exercise the repayment option by delivering the Note, together with
the form thereon entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed, to the
Trustee at its office maintained for such purpose, currently the corporate
trust office of the Trustee located at 100 Plaza One, Jersey City, New Jersey
07311, within the time specified above. Exercise of such repayment option by
the Holder of a Note will be irrevocable.

            All notices from or to the Holder, the Trustee or the Company in
connection with the repayment of the Note may be delivered in electronic form
or by facsimile.  Oral or written requests for Market Price quotes should be
directed to the Company's Treasury Department.

Note from a Fixed Rate of _______% to a floating rate of LIBOR plus 0.15%. The
principal amount of the Note shall remain the same. The Index Currency shall
be U.S. dollars and the Index Maturity shall be three months. If the Note is

            The exercise of the option to convert the Note into a Floating Rate
Note will be irrevocable. The Holder shall have no further option to convert
the Note into a Fixed Rate Note.

            The Holder shall exercise the option to convert the Note into a
Floating Rate Note by delivering written notice of exercise to the Trustee.
The Trustee shall provide a copy of the notice to the Company. If the Trustee
receives notice on or between the ____ and ____ day of a calendar month, the
"Conversion Date" shall be the _____ day of the calendar month in which notice
is received.  If the Trustee receives notice on or after the ____ day of a
calendar month, the "Conversion Date" shall be the ______ day of the calendar
month immediately following the month in which the notice is received.
Interest shall accrue on the Note at the Fixed Rate to but excluding the
Conversion Date. Interest shall begin to accrue at the Floating Rate on the
Conversion Date to but excluding Maturity.

            At the request of the Holder, the Calculation Agent shall provide
to the Holder the Interest Rate then in effect and, if determined, the Interest
Rate which shall become effective as of the next Interest Reset Date.

            LIBOR shall be calculated as follows:

            LIBOR will initially be determined two London Banking Days
preceding the Conversion Date and thereafter for each Interest Payment Date,
LIBOR will be determined two London Banking Days preceding each Interest
Reset Date (each, a "LIBOR Interest Determination Date") and will be the rate
for deposits in the Index Currency having the Index Maturity designated above
commencing on the second London Banking Day immediately following the LIBOR
Interest Determination Date, that appears on the Designated LIBOR Page
specified above as of 11:00 A.M. London time, on that LIBOR Interest
Determination Date.  If, as described in the immediately preceding sentence
no rate appears, LIBOR in respect of the related LIBOR Interest
Determination Date will be determined as if the parties had specified the
rate described in the immediately succeeding paragraph.

            With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date on which no
rate appears, on the applicable Designated LIBOR Page, as specified in the
immediately preceding paragraph, the Calculation Agent shall request the
principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London
interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide the
Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in the Index
Currency for the period of the Index Maturity shown above, commencing on
the second London Banking Day immediately following such LIBOR Interest
Determination Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at
approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination
Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single
transaction in such Index Currency in such market at such time.  If at least
two such quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on such LIBOR Interest
Determination Date shall be the arithmetic mean (rounded to the nearest
one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one millionths of
a percentage point rounded upwards) of such quotations as determined by the


                                       16

<PAGE>

Calculation Agent.  If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR determined
on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the
Calculation Agent as the arithmetic mean (rounded to the nearest one
hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one millionths of a
percentage point rounded upwards) of the rates quoted at approximately
11:00 A.M. in the Principal Financial Center, on such LIBOR Interest
Determination Date by three major banks in the Principal Financial Center
selected by the Calculation Agent for loans in such Index Currency to leading
European banks having the Index Maturity specified above and in a principal
amount that is representative for a single transaction in such Index Currency
in such market at such time; provided, however, that if the banks selected as
aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this
sentence, LIBOR determined on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date shall be
LIBOR in effect on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date.

                        If an Interest Payment Date (other than an Interest
Payment Date at Maturity) would fall on a day that is not a Business Day, such
Interest Payment Date shall be the following day that is a Business Day;
provided however, that if such next Business Day falls in the next calendar
month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the next preceding day that is a
Business Day.

                        If the Maturity falls on a day which is not a Business
Day, the payment due on such Maturity will be paid on the next succeeding
Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Maturity and
no interest shall accrue with respect to such payment for the period from and
after such Maturity.

                        Commencing on the Initial Interest Reset Date, the rate
at which interest on this Note is payable shall be reset as of each Interest
Reset Date specified above.

                        Except as provided above, upon conversion, the interest
rate in effect on each day shall be (a) if such day is an Interest Reset Date,
the interest rate determined on the LIBOR Interest Determination Date
immediately preceding such Interest Reset Date or (b) if such day is not an
Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined on the LIBOR Interest
Determination Date immediately preceding the next preceding Interest Reset
Date.   If any Interest Reset Date (which term includes the term Initial
Interest Reset Date unless the context otherwise requires) would otherwise be
a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed
to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day; provided however, that if
such next Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, such
Interest Reset Date shall be the next preceding Business Day.

                        All percentages resulting from any calculation on this
Note will be rounded to the nearest one-hundred-thousandth of a percentage
point, with five one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (e.g.,
9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all
dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation will be rounded to
the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).

                        Only the Depositary may exercise the option to convert
the Note into a Floating Rate Note as long as the Note is held as a Global
Security representing the Book-Entry Note. To exercise the conversion option,
the Depositary must notify the Trustee in writing as outlined above.
Accordingly, the Beneficial Owner of the Global Security that desires to have
the Book-Entry Note represented by such Global Security converted into a
Floating Rate Note must instruct the participant through which it owns its
interest to direct the Depositary to exercise the conversion option on its
behalf. To ensure that the Depositary receives notice from a participant in
time to deliver notice to the Trustee on a particular day, the Beneficial Owner
must so instruct the participant through which it owns its interest before such
participant's deadline for accepting instructions for that day. Different firms
may have different deadlines for accepting instructions from their customers.
Accordingly, the Beneficial Owner should consult the participant through which
it owns its interest for the deadline for such participant. All instructions
given to a participant from the Beneficial Owner of the Global Security
relating to the option to elect conversion shall be irrevocable.

                        The Beneficial Owner of the Global Security shall not
be entitled to receive physical delivery of a Certificated Note, except in the
limited circumstances described under "Description of Note -- Book-Entry Note"
in the Prospectus Supplement. In such circumstances, the Holder of a
Certificated Note shall exercise the conversion option by delivering written
notice to the Trustee at its office maintained for such purpose, currently the
corporate trust office of the Trustee located at 100 Plaza One, Jersey City,
New Jersey  07311 within the times specified above. Exercise of such conversion
option by the Holder of a Note will be irrevocable.

Company in connection with the conversion of the Note may be delivered in
electronic form or by facsimile.
