collaborative research under the research proposal beyond the initial three

accounts of record in connection with the manufacture, use and/or sale by or

determination of all figures necessary for verification of royalty obligations
set forth in this Article&nbsp;VI. Such records shall be maintained for a period of
3&nbsp;years from the end of each year in which sales occurred. The payee, at its
expense, through a certified public accountant, shall have the right to access
such books and records for the sole purpose of verifying the royalty
statements; such access shall be conducted after reasonable prior notice by the
payee to the payor during the payor&#146;s ordinary business hours and shall not be
more frequent than once during each calendar year. Said accountant shall not
disclose to the payee or any other party any information except that which
should properly be contained in a royalty report required under this Agreement.
If such accounting determines that a party&#146;s error resulted in the other party
receiving at least 5% less than properly due in respect of any quarter, then
the party in error will reimburse such amount and reimburse the other party for
the costs of such accounting (including the fees and expenses of the certified
public accountant).

should be sought prior to disclosure. If notification is not received during

the disclosure. If due to a valid business reason or a belief by the
nondisclosing party that the disclosure contains subject matter for which a

proposing disclosure shall thereafter be free to publish or disclose the
information. The determination of authorship for any paper shall be in
accordance with accepted scientific practice. In no event may any publication
