  terminated: (i) by the Company, with six months notice, upon Employee&#146;s
  disability which renders him unable to perform his usual and customary duties
  for a period of 180 consecutive days; (ii) by the Company with &#147;cause&#148;
  upon at least 30 days written notice or by the Company without &#147;cause&#148;
  upon six months written notice (&#147;cause&#148; is hereinafter defined); (iii)
  by Employee upon three months written notice; (iv) by Employee upon one month
  written notice, if he suffers a demotion or a lower status with the Company
  other than for cause; or (v) by Employee upon one month written notice, in the
  event of a &#147;change in control&#148; (as hereinafter defined), whether or
  not Employee suffers a demotion or a lower status with the Company. For purposes

  due to physical or mental illness or impairment, (ii)&nbsp;a willful act by
  Employee that constitutes gross misconduct and that is injurious to the Company,
  (iii)&nbsp;a willful breach by Employee of a material provision of this Agreement,
  or (iv)&nbsp;a material and willful violation of a federal or state law or regulation

  shall be considered &#147;willful&#148; unless committed without good faith
  and without a reasonable belief that the act or omission was in the Company&#146;s
  best interest. For purposes of this Agreement, a &#147;change of control&#148;
  shall be deemed to have occurred if (1)&nbsp;any &#147;person&#148; (as such
  term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
  Act (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;)) is or becomes the &#147;beneficial owner&#148;

  securities of the Company representing thirty-five percent (35%) or more of
  the combined voting power (with respect to the election of directors) of the
  Company&#146;s then outstanding securities; (2)&nbsp;at any time after the execution
  of this Agreement, a majority of the Board shall be replaced, over a two-year

  period, and such replacement shall not have been approved by two-thirds (<font size=2>2</font><font size=2>/</font><font size=2>3</font>)

If the Company elects to maintain such life insurance and the policy amount equals or exceeds the value of the Severance Benefits (as determined by the Board), Employee&#146;s estate shall only be entitled to receive the proceeds of the insurance policy. If the policy amount is less than the value of the Severance Benefits, the Company shall pay to

The date of termination by Employee under this Paragraph 12 shall be one month after receipt by the Company of written notice of termination, except in the case of termination by Employee as set forth in clause (iii) of Section 12(a) pursuant to which Employee is required to give the
Company three months notice. All benefits to which Employee is entitled under subparagraph (b) hereof shall be provided within thirty (30) days of the end of Employee&#146;s employment.
