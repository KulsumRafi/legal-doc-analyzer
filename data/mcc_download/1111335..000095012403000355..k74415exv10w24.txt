         2.1 THE COMMITMENT; TERMINATION DATE; INCREASE IN COMMITMENTS

         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each Bank agrees to make Domestic Loans and Eurocurrency Loans to the Company or
any Affiliate, each from time to time during the period from the date hereof to
and including the day prior to the Termination Date in amounts which (i) when
added to such Bank's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations then
outstanding, do not exceed the Bank's Commitment, (ii) do not cause the
aggregate Equivalent principal amount of all Foreign Currency Loans then
outstanding to exceed $400,000,000, and (iii) do not cause the sum of (A) the
aggregate Equivalent principal amount of Loans and CAF Advances then outstanding
plus (B) the aggregate amount of L/C Obligations then outstanding, to exceed the
Aggregate Commitments. Within the conditions specified in this Agreement, the
Company or any Affiliate may borrow under this Section 2.1, repay under Sections
2.17 and 2.18 and reborrow under this Section 2.1.

         (b) The "Termination Date" shall be June 20, 2007.

         (c) The Company may from time to time elect to increase the Aggregate
Commitments so long as, after giving effect thereto, the total amount of the
Aggregate Commitments does not exceed $1,025,000,000. The Company may arrange
for any such increase to be provided by one or more Banks (each Bank so
agreeing, in its sole discretion, to an increase in its Commitment, an
"Increasing Bank"), or by one or more banks, financial institutions or other
entities (each such bank, financial institution or other entity, an "Augmenting
Bank"), to increase their existing Commitments, or extend Commitments, provided
that (i) each Augmenting Bank, shall be subject to the approval of the Company
and the Administrative Agent and (ii) the Company and each applicable Increasing
Bank or Augmenting Bank shall execute all such documentation as the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify. Increases and new Commitments
created pursuant to this clause (c) shall become effective on the date agreed by
the Company, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Banks, and the
Administrative Agent shall notify each affected Bank thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no increase in the Aggregate Commitments (or in the Commitment of
any Bank), shall become effective under this Section 2.1(c) unless, (i) on the
proposed date of the effectiveness of such increase, the conditions set forth in
paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of Section 5.1(a) and paragraphs (i) and (ii) of
Section 5.1(b) shall be satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall have
received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a
responsible officer of the Company and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have
received (with sufficient copies for each of the Banks) documents consistent
with those delivered on the Effective Date under Section 6.1 as to the corporate
power and authority of the Company and related matters to borrow hereunder after
giving effect to such increase. On the effective date of any increase in the
Aggregate Commitments, (i) each relevant Increasing Bank and Augmenting Bank
shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in immediately
available funds and in the relevant currency or currencies as the Administrative
Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other relevant Banks, as being
required in order to cause, after giving effect to such increase and the use of
such amounts to


<PAGE>
                                                                              15


make payments to such other relevant Banks, each Bank's portion of the
outstanding Loans in each currency to equal its Revolving Percentage of such
outstanding Loans in each such currency and (ii) the Company shall be deemed to
have repaid and reborrowed all outstanding Loans as of the date of any increase
in the relevant Commitments (with such reborrowing to consist of the Loans, with
related Interest Periods if applicable, specified in a notice delivered by the
Company in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.6). The deemed payments
made pursuant to clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence in respect of
each Eurocurrency Loan shall be subject to indemnification by the Company
pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.18 if the deemed payment occurs other
than on the last day of the related Interest Periods.

         2.2 PROCEEDS OF LOANS

         The principal amount of each Loan shall be disbursed to the Company or
an Affiliate, as applicable, on the date of Borrowing of such Loan in the
currency in which the Loan is denominated in immediately available funds to the
account of the Company or the Affiliate, as applicable, specified by the Company
or the Affiliate (or the Company on behalf of the Affiliate) to the
Administrative Agent from time to time.

         2.3 FACILITY FEE; UTILIZATION FEE

         (a) The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account
of the Banks a facility fee (the "Facility Fee") for the period from the
Effective Date to and including the Termination Date at a rate determined in
accordance with the Pricing Grid multiplied by the Bank's Commitment (regardless
of whether any Loans are outstanding). The Facility Fee with respect to each
Commitment Quarter shall be payable in arrears on each Fee Payment Date and
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 (or 366) days for the actual
number of days for which due. The Facility Fee shall be payable to the
Administrative Agent and shall be transmitted via the National Automated
Clearing House Association electronic payments network in the United States to
an account in the continental United States specified by the Administrative
Agent from time to time by notice to the Company.

         (b) For any quarter during which

                  (i) the sum of the average principal amount of (A) Aggregate
         Extensions of Credit outstanding hereunder and (B) Aggregate Extensions
         of Credit (as defined in the 364-Day Credit Agreement), exceeds

                  (ii) 33 1/3% of the sum of (A) the Aggregate Commitments
         hereunder and (B) the Aggregate Commitments (as defined in the 364-Day
         Credit Agreement) or, if the Commitments (as defined in the 364-Day
         Credit Agreement) have been terminated pursuant to Section 2.1(b) of
         the 364-Day Credit Agreement, the sum of the Aggregate Extensions of
         Credit (as defined in the 364-Day Credit Agreement),

then the Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Banks a quarterly utilization fee (the "Utilization Fee") in the amount of
0.125% per annum multiplied by the daily average balance of the Aggregate
Extensions of Credit outstanding hereunder during such quarter; provided, that
if the Utilization Fee is applicable at the time the Commitments are


<PAGE>
                                                                             16


terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 or Section 8.3, it shall remain applicable
with respect to the Aggregate Extensions of Credit after the date the
Commitments are so terminated. For any quarter in which the Utilization Fee is
due, the Utilization Fee shall be calculated on a 360-day basis and payable
quarterly in arrears on the date the Facility Fee is paid.

         2.4 MARK-TO-MARKET

         Five Domestic Business Days prior to the end of any Interest Period
applicable to any Loan (or, if there are no Interest Periods for any such Loan,
five Domestic Business Days prior to the next succeeding interest payment date
for such Loan as specified in Section 2.15) (the "Mark-to-Market Day"), the
Administrative Agent shall determine the aggregate amount of all outstanding
Extensions of Credit and CAF Advances in United States dollars, and the
Equivalent in United States dollars of all outstanding Extensions of Credit and
CAF Advances in Foreign Currencies (calculated on the Mark-to-Market Day), and
if such aggregate amount exceeds the Aggregate Commitments (as a result of a
decrease in the value of the United States dollar as measured against the value
of Foreign Currencies in which outstanding Extensions of Credit or CAF Advances
are denominated), the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company
and, in the case of an Affiliate's Loan, the Affiliate, and, at the end of the
applicable Interest Period or on the applicable interest payment date for such
Loan, as the case may be, the Company, or the Affiliate (in the case of an
Affiliate's Loan), shall prepay, in whole or in part, as necessary, the
principal of such Loan in an amount such that after such prepayment such excess
is eliminated; it being understood, however, that if prepayment of the entire
principal amount of such Loan for which the current Interest Period is ending or
for which interest thereon is coming due will not reduce the aggregate amount of
outstanding Extensions of Credit and CAF Advances to the level required above,
then only prepayment of the entire principal amount of such Loan shall be
required. Notwithstanding that only the Loan for which the current Interest
Period is ending or for which interest thereon is coming due will be required to
be prepaid, in whole or in part, as required above, the Company or the
Affiliate, as applicable, shall have the option in its discretion to reduce
Extensions of Credit and CAF Advances to the required level by prepaying other
Loans or causing other Affiliates to prepay other Loans.

         2.5 OPTIONAL TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS

         The Company may at any time or from time to time, upon three Domestic
Business Days' written notice to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office,
(a) terminate the Commitments if no Loans, CAF Advances or Letters of Credit are
then outstanding hereunder or (b) reduce the unused portion of the Commitments;
provided that no such termination or reduction of Commitments shall be permitted
if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the Loans made on the
effective date thereof, the sum of the Aggregate Extensions of Credit and
outstanding CAF Advances would exceed the Aggregate Commitments. From the
effective date of any such termination or reduction, the Facility Fee specified
in Section 2.3 shall cease to accrue or shall be correspondingly reduced,
provided that no such termination or reduction shall affect the Company's
obligation to pay the Facility Fee to the extent theretofore accrued. If the
Company terminates the Commitments in their entirety, such accrued Facility Fee
shall be payable within 30 days after the effective date of such termination in
the manner provided in Section 2.3. Any termination or reduction of the unused
portion of the Commitments by the Company pursuant to


<PAGE>
                                                                              17


this Section 2.5 shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000, or a whole multiple
thereof, and shall be irrevocable.

         2.6 NOTICE OF BORROWING; PROCEDURE

         With respect to each Domestic Borrowing, the Company (on behalf of
itself or an Affiliate) shall give notice of the Borrowing to the Administrative
Agent at the Notice Office no later than the date of such Borrowing, but not
later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on such date. With respect to each
Eurocurrency Borrowing which is denominated in United States dollars, the
Company (on behalf of itself or an Affiliate) shall give notice of the Borrowing
to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office no later than three Eurodollar
Business Days prior to the date of such Borrowing, but not later than 11:00 a.m.
(New York City time) on such date. With respect to each Foreign Currency
Borrowing, the Company (on behalf of its Affiliate) shall give notice of the
Borrowing to the Administrative Agent at the Foreign Currency Notice Office no
later than three Foreign Currency Business Days prior to the date of such
Borrowing, but not later than 3:00 p.m. (London, England time) on such date. In
each case, the notice shall be given by telephone (and shall be promptly
confirmed in a writing substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto) and shall
specify:

                  (a) the borrower;

                  (b) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Domestic
         Business Day in the case of a Domestic Borrowing, a Eurodollar Business
         Day in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing which is denominated in
         United States dollars, or a Foreign Currency Business Day in the case
         of a Foreign Currency Borrowing;

                  (c) the amount of such Borrowing, which shall be not less than
         $1,000,000 or the Equivalent thereof on the date of notice and, if such
         Loan is to be a Eurocurrency Loan, the currency in which such Loan
         shall be denominated;

                  (d) whether the Loan comprising such Borrowing is to be a Base
         Rate Loan or a Eurocurrency Loan;

                  (e) if such Loan is to be a Eurocurrency Loan, the duration of
         the initial Interest Period; and

                  (f) whether any Bank has requested a Gross-up pursuant to the
         next succeeding sentence.

At the time that the Company (on behalf of itself or an Affiliate) gives a
notice of Borrowing, each Bank shall telephonically notify the Company and the
Administrative Agent whether such Bank will require a Gross-up for withholding
taxes in connection with such Loan (as provided in Section 10.4). A notice of
Borrowing, once given to the Administrative Agent, shall not be revocable by the
Company or an Affiliate, except in the event that any Bank notifies the Company
at the time the Company gives notice of the Borrowing that a Gross-up will be
required, in which case, the Company (on behalf of itself or the Affiliate) may
promptly withdraw the notice of Borrowing.


<PAGE>
                                                                              18


Upon receipt of any such notice of Borrowing from the Company, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. Each Bank will
make the amount of its pro rata share of each Borrowing available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Company (or Affiliate) at the
Domestic Funding Office in the case of Domestic Loans, the Eurodollar Funding
Office in the case of Eurocurrency Loans which are denominated in United States
dollars and the Foreign Currency Funding Office in the case of Foreign Currency
Loans, in each case prior to 12:00 Noon, local time, on the date of Borrowing
requested by the Company in funds immediately available to the Administrative
Agent. Such Borrowing will then be made available to the Company (or an
Affiliate) by the Administrative Agent crediting the account of the Company (or
such Affiliate) on the books of such office with the aggregate of the amounts
made available to the Administrative Agent by the Banks and in like funds as
received by the Administrative Agent.

         2.7 CAF ADVANCES

         During the CAF Availability Period and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Company may borrow (a) Fixed Rate CAF Advances
from time to time on any Domestic Business Day or, in the case of CAF Advances
denominated in Foreign Currencies, any Foreign Currency Business Day and (b)
LIBO Rate CAF Advances (to the extent, in the case of currencies other than
United States dollars, the LIBO Rate can be determined pursuant to the first
sentence of the definition thereof) from time to time on any Eurodollar Business
Day or, in the case of CAF Advances denominated in Foreign Currencies, any
Foreign Currency Business Day. CAF Advances may be borrowed in amounts such that
the aggregate amount of Extensions of Credit and CAF Advances outstanding at any
time shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments at such time. Within the limits
and on the conditions hereinafter set forth with respect to CAF Advances, the
Company from time to time may borrow, repay and reborrow CAF Advances.

         2.8 PROCEDURE FOR CAF ADVANCE BORROWING

         (a) The Company shall request CAF Advances by delivering a CAF Advance

Date (in the case of a Fixed Rate CAF Advance Request). Each CAF Advance Request
in respect of any CAF Borrowing Date may solicit bids for CAF Advances on such
CAF Borrowing Date in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and having not more than three
alternative CAF Advance Maturity Dates. The CAF Advance Maturity Date for each
CAF Advance shall be the date set forth therefor in the relevant CAF Advance

(ii) one, two, three or six months after the CAF Borrowing Date therefor, in the
case of a LIBO CAF Advance and (iii) not later than the Termination Date, in the
case of any CAF Advance. The Administrative Agent shall notify each Bank
promptly by facsimile transmission of the contents of each CAF Advance Request
received by the Administrative Agent.

         (b) In the case of a LIBO Rate CAF Advance Request, upon receipt of
notice from the Administrative Agent of the contents of such CAF Advance
Request, each Bank may elect, in its sole discretion, to offer irrevocably to
make one or more CAF Advances at the applicable LIBO Rate plus (or minus) a
margin determined by such Bank in its sole discretion for each such CAF Advance.
Any such irrevocable offer shall be made by delivering a CAF Advance Offer to
the Administrative Agent, before 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the day that
is three Eurodollar Business Days before the proposed CAF Borrowing Date,
setting forth:

                  (i) the maximum amount of CAF Advances for each CAF Advance
         Maturity Date and the aggregate maximum amount of CAF Advances for all
         CAF Advance Maturity Dates which such Bank would be willing to make
         (which amounts may, subject to Section 2.7, exceed such Bank's
         Commitment); and

                  (ii) the margin above or below the applicable LIBO Rate at
         which such Bank is willing to make each such CAF Advance.

The Administrative Agent shall advise the Company before 11:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on the date which is three Eurodollar Business Days before the
proposed CAF Borrowing Date of the contents of each such CAF Advance Offer
received by it. If the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as a Bank, shall
elect, in its sole discretion, to make any such CAF Advance Offer, it shall
advise the Company of the contents of its CAF Advance Offer before 10:15 A.M.
(New York City time) on the date which is three Eurodollar Business Days before
the proposed CAF Borrowing Date.

         (c) In the case of a Fixed Rate CAF Advance Request, upon receipt of
notice from the Administrative Agent of the contents of such CAF Advance
Request, each Bank may elect, in its sole discretion, to offer irrevocably to
make one or more CAF Advances at a rate of interest determined by such Bank in
its sole discretion for each such CAF Advance. Any such irrevocable offer shall
be made by delivering a CAF Advance Offer to the Administrative Agent before
9:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the proposed CAF Borrowing Date, setting
forth:

                  (i) the maximum amount of CAF Advances for each CAF Advance
         Maturity Date, and the aggregate maximum amount for all CAF Advance
         Maturity Dates, which such Bank would be willing to make (which amounts
         may, subject to Section 2.7, exceed such Bank's Commitment); and

                  (ii) the rate of interest at which such Bank is willing to
         make each such CAF Advance.

The Administrative Agent shall advise the Company before 10:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on the proposed CAF Borrowing Date of the contents of each such CAF
Advance Offer received by it. If the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as a
Bank, shall elect, in its sole discretion, to make any such CAF Advance Offer,
it shall advise the Company of the contents of its CAF Advance Offer before 9:15
A.M. (New York City time) on the proposed CAF Borrowing Date.

                                                                              20


         (d) Before 11:30 A.M. (New York City time) three Eurodollar Business
Days before the proposed CAF Borrowing Date (in the case of CAF Advances
requested by a LIBO Rate CAF Advance Request) and before 10:30 A.M. (New York
City time) on the proposed CAF Borrowing Date (in the case of CAF Advances
requested by a Fixed Rate CAF Advance Request), the Company, in its absolute
discretion, shall:

                  (i) cancel such CAF Advance Request by giving the
         Administrative Agent telephone notice to that effect, or

                  (ii) by giving telephone notice to the Administrative Agent
         (immediately confirmed by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a CAF
         Advance Confirmation by facsimile transmission) (A) subject to the
         provisions of Section 2.8(e), accept one or more of the offers made by
         any Bank or Banks pursuant to Section 2.8(b) or Section 2.8(c), as the
         case may be, and (B) reject any remaining offers made by Banks pursuant
         to Section 2.8(b) or Section 2.8(c), as the case may be.

         (e) The Company's acceptance of CAF Advances in response to any CAF
Advance Offers shall be subject to the following limitations:

                  (i) the amount of CAF Advances accepted for each CAF Advance
         Maturity Date specified by any Bank in its CAF Advance Offer shall not
         exceed the maximum amount for such CAF Advance Maturity Date specified
         in such CAF Advance Offer;

                  (ii) the aggregate amount of CAF Advances accepted for all CAF
         Advance Maturity Dates specified by any Bank in its CAF Advance Offer
         shall not exceed the aggregate maximum amount specified in such CAF
         Advance Offer for all such CAF Advance Maturity Dates;

                  (iii) the Company may not accept offers for CAF Advances for
         any CAF Advance Maturity Date in an aggregate principal amount in
         excess of the maximum principal amount requested in the related CAF
         Advance Request; and

                  (iv) if the Company accepts any of such offers, it must accept
         offers based solely upon pricing for each relevant CAF Advance Maturity
         Date and upon no other criteria whatsoever, and if two or more Banks
         submit offers for any CAF Advance Maturity Date at identical pricing
         and the Company accepts any of such offers but does not wish to (or, by
         reason of the limitations set forth in Section 2.7, cannot) borrow the
         total amount offered by such Banks with such identical pricing, the
         Company shall accept offers from all of such Banks in amounts allocated
         among them pro rata according to the amounts offered by such __________
         Banks (with appropriate rounding, in the sole discretion of the
         Company, to assure that each accepted CAF Advance is an integral
         multiple of $1,000,000); provided that if the number of Banks that
         submit __________ offers for any CAF Advance Maturity Date at identical
         pricing is such that, after the Company accepts such offers pro rata in
         accordance with the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the CAF
         Advance to __________ be made by any such Bank would be less than
         $5,000,000 principal amount, the number of such Banks shall be reduced
         by the Administrative Agent by lot until the CAF Advances to be


<PAGE>
                                                                              21


         made by each such remaining Bank would be in a principal amount of
         $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

         (f) If the Company notifies the Administrative Agent that a CAF Advance
Request is cancelled pursuant to Section 2.8(d)(i), the Administrative Agent
shall give prompt telephone notice thereof to the Banks.

         (g) If the Company accepts pursuant to Section 2.8(d)(ii) one or more
of the offers made by any Bank or Banks, the Administrative Agent promptly shall
notify each Bank which has made such an offer of (i) the aggregate amount of
such CAF Advances to be made on such CAF Borrowing Date for each CAF Advance
Maturity Date and (ii) the acceptance or rejection of any offers to make such
CAF Advances made by such Bank. Before 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the
CAF Borrowing Date specified in the applicable CAF Advance Request, each Bank
whose CAF Advance Offer has been accepted shall make available to the
Administrative Agent at its Domestic Funding Office in the case of Fixed Rate
CAF Advances and its Eurodollar Funding Office in the case of LIBO Rate CAF
Advances the amount of CAF Advances to be made by such Bank, in immediately
available funds. The Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the
Company as soon as practicable on such date at such office of the Administrative
Agent. It shall be a condition to each CAF Advance, and each CAF Advance
accepted by the Company shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by
the Company, that:

                  (i) the principal amount of such CAF Advance, when added to
         the aggregate principal amount of all Extensions of Credit and other
         CAF Advances then outstanding hereunder, shall not exceed the amount of
         the Aggregate Commitments, each such amount, if applicable, being
         expressed in the United States dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of
         the notice of Borrowing;

                  (ii) after giving effect to the making of such CAF Advance no
         Event of Default nor Event of Default - Bankruptcy and no event which,
         with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would become an
         Event of Default or an Event of Default - Bankruptcy shall have
         occurred and be continuing; and

                  (iii) the representations and warranties of the Company
         contained in this Agreement, except those contained in Sections 6.2(b)
         and 6.3, shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as
         of the date of such CAF Advance, except to the extent such
         representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date.

As soon as practicable after each CAF Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent
shall notify each Bank of the aggregate amount of CAF Advances advanced on such
CAF Borrowing Date and the respective CAF Advance Maturity Dates thereof.

         (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.8, in
the case of CAF Advances to be denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Company
and the Administrative Agent shall agree upon such modification to the notice
times, bid times, funding times, minimum amounts and other procedures set forth
above in this Section 2.8 that are appropriate for the


<PAGE>
                                                                              22


relevant Foreign Currency; and the Administrative Agent shall advise the Banks
and the Company of such modifications prior to the delivery of any CAF Advance
Request soliciting bids for CAF Advances in such Foreign Currency.

         2.9 CAF ADVANCE PAYMENTS

         (a) The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account
of each Bank which has made a CAF Advance, on the applicable CAF Advance
Maturity Date the then unpaid principal amount of such CAF Advance. The Company
shall not have the right to prepay any principal amount of any CAF Advance
without the consent of the Bank to which such CAF Advance is owed.

         (b) The Company shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of
each CAF Advance from the CAF Borrowing Date to applicable CAF Advance Maturity
Date at the rate of interest specified in the CAF Advance Offer accepted by the
Company in connection with such CAF Advance (calculated on the basis of a
360-day year for actual days elapsed), payable on each applicable CAF Advance
Interest Payment Date.

         (c) If any principal of, or interest on, any CAF Advance shall not be
paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise),
such CAF Advance shall, without limiting any rights of any Bank under this
Agreement, bear interest from the date on which such payment was due at a rate
per annum which is 1% above the rate which would otherwise be applicable to such
CAF Advance until the stated CAF Advance Maturity Date of such CAF Advance, and
for each day thereafter at a rate per annum which is 1% above the ABR, in each
case until paid in full (as well after as before judgment). Interest accruing
pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall be payable from time to time on demand.

         2.10 CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS

         A CAF Advance Request may request offers for CAF Advances to be made on
not more than one CAF Borrowing Date and to mature on not more than three CAF
Advance Maturity Dates. No CAF Advance Request may be submitted earlier than
five Domestic Business Days after submission of any other CAF Advance Request.

         2.11 PROMISE TO PAY CAF ADVANCES; EVIDENCE OF CAF ADVANCES

         The Company unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of each Bank that makes a CAF Advance, on the CAF Advance
Maturity Date with respect thereto, the principal amount of such CAF Advance.
The Company further unconditionally promises to pay interest on each CAF Advance
and each Loan for the period from and including the CAF Borrowing Date of such
CAF Advance on the unpaid principal amount thereof from time to time outstanding
at the applicable rate per annum determined as provided in, and payable as
specified in, Section 2.9(b). Each Bank shall maintain in accordance with its
usual practice appropriate records evidencing indebtedness of the Company to
such Bank resulting from each CAF Advance of such Bank from time to time,
including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank
from time to time in respect of each such CAF Advance.

having an Interest Period, at times other than the last day of an Interest
Period, as provided in Section 2.12(f).

         (c) The notice by the Company to the Administrative Agent of an
election pursuant to Section 2.12(a) to extend any outstanding Loan, to convert
any outstanding Loan on the last day of the then-existing Interest Period (if

which does not have an Interest Period shall be given by telephone (and shall be
promptly confirmed in a writing substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto)
as follows:

                  (i) if such outstanding Loan is to be extended and is a
         Eurocurrency Loan denominated in United States dollars, by giving

<PAGE>
                                                                              24


                  (iii) if such outstanding Loan is a Eurocurrency Loan
         denominated in United States dollars and is to be converted into a
         Domestic Loan, by giving notice no later than the last day of the
         then-existing Interest Period with respect to such outstanding Loan not

                  (iv) if such outstanding Loan is a Domestic Loan which is to

         dollars, by giving notice no later than three Eurodollar Business Days,
         but not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on such date, prior

         desires the conversion of such outstanding Loan to be made effective;
         and

         (d) Each notice given by the Company pursuant to this Section 2.12
shall specify:

                  (i) whether such outstanding Loan is to be extended or
         converted;

                  (ii) if such outstanding Loan is to be converted, the date
         such conversion should be effective;

                  (iii) if such outstanding Loan is to be extended and is a
         Eurocurrency Loan, the Interest Period for the Loan as so extended;

                  (iv) if such outstanding Loan is to be converted, whether such
         Loan is to be converted into a Base Rate Loan or Eurocurrency Loan
         denominated in United States dollars;

                  (v) if such outstanding Loan is to be converted into a

                  (vi) whether the Administrative Agent or any Bank has
         requested a Gross-up pursuant to subsection (g) below.

         (e) With respect to each outstanding Loan which shall be extended or
converted pursuant to this Section 2.12:

                  (i) the Company or the Affiliate, whichever shall be the
         borrower, shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
         Bank all accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such outstanding
         Loan,

                           (A) if such Loan is a Eurocurrency Loan, on the last
                  day of the then-existing Interest Period with respect to such
                  outstanding Loan; or

                           (B) if such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, or if pursuant
                  to Section 2.12(f) the Loan is being converted on a day other
                  than the last day of the then-existing Interest Period, on the
                  day such outstanding Loan is converted;

                  (ii) no repayment of the principal amount of such outstanding
         Loan shall be required; and


<PAGE>
                                                                              25


                  (iii) the Loan to be outstanding upon the extension or
         conversion of an outstanding Loan shall not be deemed to be a new Loan
         under Section 5.1 of this Agreement.

         (f) Subject to the requirements of Sections 2.12(a) and 2.12(b), any
outstanding Eurocurrency Loan denominated in United States dollars may be
converted into a Base Rate Loan pursuant to this Section 2.12 at times other
than the last day of an Interest Period; provided, however, that

                  (i) the Company's notice (on behalf of itself or an Affiliate)
         with respect to any such conversion shall be given no later than the
         date of such conversion, but not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City
         time) on such date; and

                  (ii) the Company or the Affiliate, whichever is the borrower,
         shall reimburse each Bank on demand for any loss incurred by it as a
         result of the timing of any such conversion in an amount determined as
         provided in Section 2.18 with respect to prepayments.

         (g) At the time that the Company (on behalf of itself or an Affiliate)
gives a notice to extend or convert any Loan pursuant to the requirements of
this Section 2.12, each Bank shall telephonically notify the Company and the
Administrative Agent whether such Bank will require a Gross-up for withholding
taxes in connection with such Loan as so extended or converted (as provided in
Section 10.4). A notice to extend or convert any Loan, once given to the
Administrative Agent, shall not be revocable by the Company or an Affiliate,
except in the event that any Bank notifies the Company at the time the Company
gives notice to extend or convert a Loan that a Gross-up will be required, in
which case, the Company (on behalf of itself or the Affiliate) may promptly
withdraw the notice to extend or convert the Loan.

         (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, if after
the date an outstanding Loan is borrowed the country in whose currency the Loan
is denominated becomes a Participating Member State, for so long as it remains a
Participating Member State, the Loan shall remain outstanding in accordance with
its terms but the outstanding amount of the Loan shall automatically be
converted into the equivalent amount of the euro calculated using the fixed
conversion rate established between the euro and the National Currency Unit for
such country's former currency. In addition, for so long as it exists, the
amount of such Loan denominated in the euro shall also be denominated in the
equivalent amount of the National Currency Unit for such country's former
currency, calculated in accordance with the same fixed conversion rate.

         2.13 REGISTER

         The Administrative Agent shall, on behalf of the Company and each
Affiliate, maintain at one of its offices a register for the recordation of the
names and addresses of the Banks and the Commitment of, and the principal amount
of the Loans, CAF Advances and L/C Obligations owing to, each Bank from time to
time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the
absence of manifest error, and the Company, each Affiliate, the Administrative

of the Loans (and any Notes evidencing the Loans), the CAF Advances and the L/C
Obligations recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. Any assignment
of any Loan pursuant to Section 9.1, whether or not evidenced by a Note, shall
be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in
the Register (and any Note evidencing such Loan shall expressly so provide). Any
assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan shall be registered on the
Register only upon presentation of a duly executed Assignment and Acceptance
and, if such Loan is evidenced by a Note, surrender of such Note for
registration of assignment or transfer.

         2.14 INTEREST RATES

         (b) Interest on Base Rate Loans shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 365 (or 366) days and paid for the actual number of days for which due.

including the first day thereof to but excluding the last day thereof.

         2.16 OVERDUE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST

         Any overdue principal of the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations and, to
the extent permitted by law, overdue interest thereon, shall bear interest
payable on demand for each day from the date payment thereof was due to the date
of actual payment, as follows:

                  (a) with respect to each Base Rate Loan, at a rate per annum

         such overdue interest are offered to the Administrative Agent by other
         leading banks, as determined by the Administrative Agent, in the
         interbank market in which the Eurocurrency is obtained for a period of
         one day, or if no such rate is available, one month (or, if such amount
         remains unpaid more than three Eurocurrency Business Days, then for
         such other period of time not longer than six months as the
         Administrative Agent may elect);

                  (c) with respect to Reimbursement Obligations, at a rate per
         annum applicable to Base Rate Loans pursuant to paragraph (a) above.

         2.17 DATES FOR PAYMENT OR OPTIONAL PREPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL

         The Company and each Affiliate unconditionally promises to repay the
unpaid principal amount of each Loan made to it on or before the Maturity Date.
The Company or an Affiliate may, at its option, prepay the principal amount of
any Loan, in whole or in part, without penalty or premium, as follows:

         Business Day, provided that the Company deliver an irrevocable notice
         of prepayment to the Administrative Agent no later than 11:00 a.m., New
         York City time, on such date, which notice shall specify the date and
         amount of prepayment; and

                  (b) with respect to any Eurocurrency Loan on the last day of
         any Interest Period therefore, provided that the Company deliver an

         prepayment;

<PAGE>
                                                                              28


         2.18 OPTIONAL PREPAYMENT ON OTHER DATES; REIMBURSEMENT FOR CERTAIN
COSTS

         The Company or an Affiliate, as applicable, may, at its option, prepay
the principal amount of any Eurocurrency Loan, in whole or in part, at times
other than those provided for in Section 2.17(b), in each case together with
accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the date of prepayment; provided,
however, that with respect to any such Loan, the Company or the Affiliate,
whichever is the borrower, shall reimburse each Bank on demand for any loss
incurred by such Bank as a result of the timing of such payment, including
without limitation, any loss incurred in liquidating or re-employing deposits
from third parties but excluding loss of the Eurocurrency Margin or any other
profit for the period after such payment, provided that the amount of such loss
shall in no event exceed the amount of interest that would have accrued from the
date of prepayment to the last day of the then-current Interest Period in the
absence of prepayment, and the relevant Bank shall have delivered to the Company
and, if the borrower is an Affiliate, to such Affiliate, a written statement
setting forth the basis for determining such loss, which written statement shall
be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Each Bank shall use its
reasonable efforts to mitigate any loss resulting from any prepayment by the
Company or an Affiliate.

         2.19 METHOD OF PAYMENT

         All payments required to be made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
made in immediately available funds (i) with respect to the Facility Fee and the
Utilization Fee, in United States dollars to the account in the continental
United States designated by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.3,
(ii) with respect to payments relating to Loans (including, without limitation,
principal, interest, any Gross-up or any payments pursuant to Section 2.18 or
10.3) or CAF Advances, in the lawful currency of the country in which the Loan
or CAF Advance is denominated, to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the Banks at (A) the Domestic Funding Office, with respect to each Domestic Loan
and each CAF Advance denominated in United States dollars, (B) the Eurodollar
Funding Office, with respect to each Eurocurrency Loan which is denominated in
United States dollars, (C) the Foreign Currency Funding Office, with respect to
each Foreign Currency Loan or CAF Advance denominated in a Foreign Currency or
(D) in each case, at such other location as may be agreed upon by the
Administrative Agent and the Company and (iii) with respect to any other payment
due hereunder, in such currency and in such place or office as may be required
hereunder or as may otherwise be agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the
Company. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Banks
promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. Whenever any payment of
principal of, or interest on, any Domestic Loan or of the Facility Fee shall be
due on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day, the date for payment thereof
shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day and, in the case
of a payment of principal, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended
time. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, any Eurocurrency
Loan which is denominated in United States dollars shall be due on a day which
is not a Eurodollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended
to the next succeeding Eurodollar Business Day, unless as a result thereof such
date would fall in the next calendar month, in which case, such date shall be
advanced to the next preceding Eurodollar Business Day, and, in the case of a
payment of principal, interest thereon shall be payable to the date of payment
as extended or advanced as the case may be. Whenever any payment of principal
of, or interest on, any Foreign Currency Loan shall be due on a day which is not

<PAGE>
                                                                              29


shall be extended to the next succeeding Foreign Currency Business Day, unless
as a result thereof such date would fall in the next calendar month, in which
case, such date shall be advanced to the next preceding Foreign Currency
Business Day, and, in the case of a payment of principal, interest thereon shall
be payable to the date of payment as extended or advanced as the case may be.

         2.20 PRO RATA TREATMENT AND PAYMENTS

         (a) Each Borrowing by the Company or any Affiliate from the Banks
hereunder, each payment by the Company or any Affiliate on account of the
Facility Fee or Utilization Fee and any reduction of the Commitments of the
Banks shall be made pro rata according to the respective Revolving Percentages
of the Banks.

         (b) Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Company or any
Affiliate on account of principal of and interest on the Loans shall be made pro
rata according to the respective outstanding amounts of principal and interest
then due and owing to the Banks.

         (c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing
by any Bank prior to a Borrowing that such Bank will not make the amount that
would constitute its share of such Borrowing available to the Administrative
Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank is making such amount
available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company (or an Affiliate) a
corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative
Agent by the required time on the Borrowing date such Bank shall pay to the
Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate
equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules
on interbank compensation, for the period until such Bank makes such amount
immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the
Administrative Agent submitted to any Bank with respect to any amounts owing
under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If
such Bank's share of such Borrowing is not made available to the Administrative
Agent by such Bank within three Domestic Business Days after such Borrowing
Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover (i) in the case
of amounts denominated in United States dollars, such amount with interest
thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans, on demand, from the
Company or (ii) in the case of amounts denominated in Foreign Currencies, such
amount with interest thereon at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent to
be the cost to it of funding such amount, on demand, from the Company or the
relevant Affiliate.

         (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing
by the Company or any Affiliate prior to the date of any payment due to be made
by the Company or any Affiliate hereunder that the Company or such Affiliate
will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent
may assume that the Company or such Affiliate is making such payment, and the
Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Banks their respective pro rata shares of a
corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by
the Company or such Affiliate within three Domestic Business Days after such due
date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from
each Bank to which any amount which was made


<PAGE>
                                                                              30


available pursuant to the preceding sentence (i) in the case of amounts
denominated in United States dollars, such amount with interest thereon at the
rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii)
in the case of amounts denominated in Foreign Currencies, such amount with
interest thereon at a rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent to
be the cost to it of funding such amount. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Bank against the Company or
any Affiliate.

         2.21 LIMITATION ON EUROCURRENCY TRANCHES

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
borrowings, conversions and continuations of Eurocurrency Loans and all
selections of Interest Periods shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to
such elections so that, no more than fifteen Eurocurrency Tranches in any
currency shall be outstanding at any one time.

         2.22 REPAYMENT OF BILATERAL OBLIGATIONS; TERMINATION OF BILATERAL
COMMITMENTS

         The Commitment of each Bank hereunder and the other agreements
contained herein are conditioned upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of
evidence of repayment by the Company of all amounts of principal and interest
outstanding under the Bilateral Revolving Credit Agreements. Subject to the
foregoing, the Company, the Affiliates and the Banks agree that any commitment
of any Bank to make loans to the Company and any Affiliate pursuant to the terms
of any Bilateral Revolving Credit Agreement shall terminate as of the Effective
Date, and each Bank party to one or more Bilateral Revolving Credit Agreements
agrees to waive any notice required by such Bilateral Revolving Credit Agreement
with regards to the Company's termination of such Bank's commitment. The
termination of each Bank's commitment under its respective Bilateral Revolving
Credit Agreement shall not affect or terminate any outstanding payment
obligations of the Company or any Affiliate owing or arising under such
Bilateral Revolving Credit Agreement, which obligations shall continue until
satisfied in their entirety.

SECTION 3. LETTERS OF CREDIT

         3.1  L/C COMMITMENT

         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Issuing Bank, in
reliance on the agreements of the other Banks set forth in Section 3.4(a),
agrees to issue letters of credit ("Letters of Credit") for the account of the
Company or Affiliate on any Domestic Business Day prior to the fifth Domestic
Business Day preceding the Termination Date in such form as may be approved from
time to time by such Issuing Bank; provided that an Issuing Bank (i) shall have
no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such
issuance, the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment and (ii) may not
issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, the
aggregate amount of Extensions of Credit and CAF Advances would exceed the
Aggregate Commitments. Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be denominated in United
States dollars or a Foreign Currency and (ii) expire no later than the earlier
of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance and (y) the date that is
five Domestic Business Days prior to the Termination Date, provided that any
Letter of Credit with a one-year


<PAGE>
                                                                              31


term may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which
shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above).

         (b) No Issuing Bank shall be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit if
such issuance would conflict with, or cause the Issuing Bank or any L/C
Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law.

         3.2 PROCEDURE FOR ISSUANCE OF LETTER OF CREDIT

         The Company or any Affiliate may from time to time request that a
particular Issuing Bank issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to such Issuing
Bank at its Domestic Lending Office (with a copy to the Administrative Agent at
its Domestic Lending Office) an Application therefor, completed to the
satisfaction of such Issuing Bank, and such other certificates, documents and
other papers and information as such Issuing Bank may request. Upon receipt of
any Application, the Issuing Bank will process such Application and the
certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in
connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall
promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall the
Issuing Bank be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three
Domestic Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all
such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating
thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary
thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by the Issuing Bank and the Company or
Affiliate. The Issuing Bank shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the
Company or any Affiliate promptly following the issuance thereof. The Issuing
Bank shall promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn
promptly furnish to the Banks, notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit
(including the amount thereof).

         3.3 FEES AND OTHER CHARGES

         (a) The Company or applicable Affiliate will pay a fee on all
outstanding Letters of Credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin
then in effect with respect to Eurocurrency Loans, shared ratably among the
Banks and payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the
issuance date (such fee to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the
actual number of days elapsed). In addition, the Company or applicable Affiliate
shall pay to the Issuing Bank for its own account a fronting fee in the amount
per annum agreed upon between the Company and the Issuing Bank on the undrawn
and unexpired amount of each Letter of Credit, payable quarterly in arrears on
each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date.

         (b) In addition to the foregoing fees, the Company or applicable
Affiliate shall pay or reimburse the Issuing Bank for such normal and customary
costs and expenses as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Bank in issuing,
negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any
Letter of Credit.

         3.4 L/C PARTICIPATIONS

         (a) Each Issuing Bank irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to
each L/C Participant, and, to induce each Issuing Bank to issue Letters of
Credit, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and
hereby accepts and purchases from each Issuing


<PAGE>
                                                                              32


Bank, on the terms and conditions set forth below, for such L/C Participant's
own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant's
Revolving Percentage in each Issuing Bank's obligations and rights under and in
respect of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank and the amount of
each draft paid by such Issuing Bank thereunder. Each L/C Participant
unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with each Issuing Bank that, if a draft
is paid under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank for which such
Issuing Bank is not reimbursed in full by the Company or any Affiliate in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (i) if such draft is paid in a
Foreign Currency, such amount shall be converted into United States dollars at
the Exchange Rate then in effect as determined by the Administrative Agent (and
such amount shall thereafter be denominated in United States dollars for all
purposes of this Agreement) and (ii) such L/C Participant shall pay to such
Issuing Bank upon demand at such Issuing Bank's address for notices specified
herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving Percentage of the
amount of such draft, or any part thereof, as so converted, that is not so
reimbursed.

         (b) If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to any
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion
of any payment made by such Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit is paid to
such Issuing Bank within three Domestic Business Days after the date such
payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Bank on demand an
amount equal to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily average
Federal Funds Effective Rate during the period from and including the date such
payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available
to such Issuing Bank, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is
360. If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to
Section 3.4(a) is not made available to the Issuing Bank by such L/C Participant
within three Domestic Business Days after the date such payment is due, the
Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand,
such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per
annum applicable to Base Rate Loans. A certificate of the Issuing Bank submitted
to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

         (c) Whenever, at any time after an Issuing Bank has made payment under
any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its pro rata
share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), such Issuing Bank
receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the
Company or any Affiliate or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied
thereto by such Issuing Bank), or any payment of interest on account thereof,
such Issuing Bank will distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share
thereof; provided, however, that in the event that any such payment received by
such Issuing Bank shall be required to be returned by such Issuing Bank, such
L/C Participant shall return to such Issuing Bank the portion thereof previously
distributed by the Issuing Bank to it.

         3.5 REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY OR AFFILIATE

         If any draft is paid under any Letter of Credit, the Company or any
Affiliate shall reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for the amount of (a) the
draft so paid and (b) any taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses
incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with such


<PAGE>
                                                                              33


payment, not later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on (i) the Domestic
Business Day that the Company or any Affiliate receives notice of such draft, if
such notice is received on such day prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time, or
(ii) if clause (i) above does not apply, the Domestic Business Day immediately
following the day that the Company or Affiliate receives such notice. Each such
payment shall be made to the applicable Issuing Bank at its address for notices
referred to herein in the relevant currency and in immediately available funds.
Interest shall be payable on any such amounts from the date on which the
relevant draft is paid until payment in full at the rate set forth in (x) until
the Domestic Business Day next succeeding the date of the relevant notice,
Section 2.14(a)(i) in the case of amounts denominated in United States dollars,
and at the rate determined by the Issuing Bank to be the cost to it of funding
such amount plus the Eurocurrency Margin in the case of amounts denominated in
Foreign Currencies, and (y) thereafter, Section 2.16(a).

         3.6 OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE

         The Company and Affiliate's obligations under this Section 3 shall be
absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of
any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Company or Affiliate may
have or have had against such Issuing Bank, any beneficiary of a Letter of
Credit or any other Person. The Company and its Affiliates also agree with each
Issuing Bank that such Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for, and neither
the Company's Reimbursement Obligations nor the Affiliate's Reimbursement
Obligations under Section 3.5 shall be affected by, among other things, the
validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though
such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any
dispute between or among the Company and its Affiliates and any beneficiary of
any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be
transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Company or Affiliate against any
beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. No Issuing Bank
shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission,
dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in
connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions found by a
final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Bank.
The Company and its Affiliates agree that any action taken or omitted by an
Issuing Bank under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related
drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct and in accordance with the standards of care specified in the Uniform
Commercial Code of the State of New York, shall be binding on the Company and
its Affiliates and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Bank to the
Company or its Affiliates.

         3.7 LETTER OF CREDIT PAYMENTS

         If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit,
the applicable Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Company or Affiliate of
the date and amount thereof. The responsibility of such Issuing Bank to the
Company or Affiliate in connection with any draft presented for payment under
any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly
provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the
documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in
connection with such presentment are substantially in conformity with such
Letter of Credit.


<PAGE>
                                                                              34


         3.8 APPLICATIONS

         To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any
Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, the
provisions of this Agreement shall apply.

SECTION 4. GUARANTEE OF LOANS TO AFFILIATES

         (a) The Company hereby guarantees to the Administrative Agent, for the
ratable benefit of the Banks and their affiliates, the due and punctual payment
of the principal of and interest on any Loans made to any Affiliate under this
Agreement and any other Obligations of any Affiliate to the Administrative Agent
or any Bank under this Agreement (including, in respect of any Letter of Credit
issued for the account of such Affiliate, the related Reimbursement Obligations
and any other obligations of such Affiliate related to such Letter of Credit) or
its Accession Memorandum (the "Guaranteed Obligations") when and as the same
shall become due and payable, whether at maturity, upon declaration or
otherwise, according to the terms thereof. Upon the occurrence of an Affiliate
Event of Default with respect to an Affiliate under this Agreement, the Company
shall on behalf of such Affiliate upon demand by the Administrative Agent
punctually make any payment due and payable by such Affiliate under this
Agreement or its Accession Memorandum, whether at maturity, upon declaration or
otherwise; and any such payment shall be treated for the purposes of such
Accession Memorandum and this Agreement (other than Section 10.4) as if such
payment were made by the Affiliate.

         (b) The Company hereby agrees that its obligations under this Section 4
shall be irrevocable and unconditional and that the Company shall not have the
right to assert any defenses based upon the validity, regularity or
enforceability of any Accession Memorandum or this Agreement or any Note, the
absence of any attempt to collect from the defaulting Affiliate or other action
to enforce the same, the waiver or consent by the Administrative Agent or any
Bank with respect to any provisions thereof or hereof (other than with respect
to this Section 4), or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense of the Company or of a guarantor.

         (c) With respect to its obligations under this Section 4, the Company
waives filing of claims with a court, trustee or receiver in the event of
receivership or bankruptcy of the defaulting Affiliate, diligence, presentment,
demand of payment, protest or notice with respect to Guaranteed Obligations and
all demands whatsoever (other than that provided for in subsection (a) above),
and covenants that this Guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will not be
discharged except by complete performance of the Guaranteed Obligations of the
defaulting Affiliate and the obligations of the Company under this Guarantee.

         (d) To the extent of any payment by the Company to the Administrative
Agent or any Bank under this Section 4, the Company shall succeed to all
corresponding claims that the Administrative Agent or such Bank may have and
otherwise be subrogated to the rights of the Administrative Agent or such Bank
against the defaulting Affiliate or any other person or security in connection
with the Loans to such Affiliate, and the Administrative Agent and any such Bank
shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company in seeking recovery
under such claims.


<PAGE>
                                                                              35


         (e) The Company's obligations under this Section 4 constitute a
guarantee of payment and not of collection merely and shall remain in full force
and effect with respect to any Affiliate until the Guaranteed Obligations of
such Affiliate shall have been paid in full in accordance with the terms of the
relevant Accession Memorandum and of this Agreement. If at any time any payment
of any of the Guaranteed Obligations of an Affiliate is rescinded or must be
otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization
of such Affiliate or otherwise, the Company's obligations hereunder with respect
to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had not
been made.

         (f) If demand for, or acceleration of the time for, payment by any
Affiliate to the Administrative Agent or any Bank of any Guaranteed Obligations
of such Affiliate is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or
proposed compromise or arrangement with creditors of such Affiliate, all such
Guaranteed Obligations of which payment or performance is stayed that would
otherwise be subject to demand for payment or acceleration shall nonetheless be
payable by the Company under this Section 4 immediately on demand by the
Administrative Agent or such Bank.

         The Company represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and

Advances hereunder (with accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts owing
under this Agreement (including all amounts of L/C Obligations with respect to
outstanding Letters of Credit issued hereunder, whether or not the beneficiaries
of the then outstanding Letters of Credit shall have presented the documents
required thereunder) shall immediately become due and payable.

         8.4 CASH COLLATERALIZATION OF OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT

         With respect to all Letters of Credit with respect to which presentment
for honor shall not have occurred at the time of an acceleration pursuant to
this Section 8, the Company and/or Affiliate, as the case may be, shall at such
time deposit in a cash collateral account opened by the Administrative Agent an
amount equal to the aggregate then undrawn and unexpired amount of such Letters
of Credit. Amounts held in such cash collateral account shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent to the payment of drafts drawn under such Letters of
Credit, and the unused portion thereof after all such Letters of Credit shall
have expired or been fully drawn upon, if any, shall be applied to repay other
obligations of the Company or Affiliate, as applicable, hereunder. After all
such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, all
Reimbursement Obligations shall have been satisfied and all other obligations of
the Company and/or Affiliate, as the case may be, hereunder shall have been paid
in full, the balance, if any, in such cash collateral account shall be returned
to the Company or Affiliate (or such other Person as may be lawfully entitled
thereto).

SECTION 9. ASSIGNMENT; PARTICIPATIONS

         9.1 ASSIGNMENT

         (a) No Bank shall, without the consent of the Company and the
Administrative Agent (in each case which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld; it being understood, however, that any concern that the Company may
have regarding the availability of a currency as a result of exchange controls
or otherwise is a reasonable basis for the Company to withhold its consent),
transfer to any other office, branch or affiliate of the Bank or to any other
financial institution, person or entity, all or any portion of the Extensions of
Credit, CAF Advances or the Commitment or any of the Bank's other rights and
obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that:

                  (i) without the consent of the Company, a Bank may transfer or
         assign (A) any of its Extensions of Credit or CAF Advances or any
         interest therein as a pledge to any Federal Reserve Bank or other
         similar central bank in another jurisdiction, provided that such pledge
         shall not release the Bank from its obligations hereunder and (B) all
         or any portion of the Extensions of Credit, any CAF Advance, the
         Commitment or any of the Bank's other rights and obligations under this
         Agreement to any one or more assignees that is a Bank immediately prior
         to giving effect to such assignment; and

                  (ii) without the consent of the Company, a Bank may transfer
         or assign all or any portion of the Loans, the Commitment or any of the
         Bank's other rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Person
         (A) five or more days after the occurrence and continuance of an Event
         of Default under Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(d) (in respect of
         Section 4) or (B) upon the occurrence and continuance of any Event of
         Default-Bankruptcy under Section 8.3.

         (b) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
conditions:

                  (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Bank, an
         affiliate of a Bank or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of
         the assigning Bank's Commitments or Extensions of Credit, the amount of
         the Commitments or Extensions of Credit (without duplication) of the
         assigning Bank subject to each such assignment (determined as of the
         date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is
         delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than
         $5,000,000 and, after giving effect thereto, the assigning Bank shall
         have Commitments and Extensions of Credit (without duplication) in an
         aggregate amount of at least $5,000,000, in each case unless the
         Company and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that
         (1) no such consent of the Company shall be required if an Event of
         Default under Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(d) (in respect of
         Section 4) has occurred and is continuing for a period of at least five
         days or an Event of Default-Bankruptcy under Section 8.3 has occurred
         and is continuing and (2) such amounts shall be aggregated in respect
         of each Bank and its affiliates, if any;


<PAGE>
                                                                              48


                  (ii) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver
         to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with
         a processing and recordation fee of $3,500;

                  (iii) the assignee, if it shall not be a Bank, shall deliver
         to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire; and

         (c) In the case of any assignment to financial institutions made
without the consent of the Company, any such transferee or assignee of a Bank
shall not be entitled to receive any greater interest or other payment by reason
of Section 10.3 or 10.4 than such Bank would have been entitled to receive with
respect to the rights so transferred or assigned unless such transfer or
assignment is made by reason of the provisions of Section 10.2, 10.3 or 10.4
requiring the Bank to designate a different lending office under certain
circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater
payment did not exist.

         (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Bank may assign any or
all of the Loans or CAF Advance it may have funded hereunder to its designating
Bank without the consent of the Company or the Administrative Agent and without
regard to the limitations set forth in this Section 9.1. Each of the Company,
each Affiliate, each Bank and the Administrative Agent hereby confirms that it
will not institute against a Conduit Bank or join any other Person in
instituting against a Conduit Bank any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law,
for one year and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing
commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Bank; provided, however, that each
Bank designating any Conduit Bank hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold
harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising
out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Bank
during such period of forbearance.

         9.2 PARTICIPATION.

         Each Bank shall have the right to sell to any bank or other financial
institution (a "Participant") a participating interest in such Bank's Extensions
of Credit, CAF Advances or Commitment held by such Bank; provided, however,
that, following any such sale, (a) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unmodified and fully effective and enforceable against such Bank,
(b) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the Company and its Affiliates
for the performance of such obligations, including, without limitation, its
Commitment and the obligation of such Bank to fund Loans and participate in
Letters of Credit hereunder, (c) the Administrative Agent and the Company and
any Affiliates which have borrowed hereunder shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations
under this Agreement, (d) such Bank shall retain the sole right and
responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Company and Affiliates
hereunder, including, without limitation, the sole right to approve of or
consent to any action hereunder or any amendment, modification or waiver hereof,
except that such Bank may grant to a Participant a joint right to approve of or
consent to any action, amendment, modification or waiver that would (i) reduce
the amount or extend the time for payment (other than pursuant to Section 2.12)
of any principal of, or interest on, the Loans or any CAF Advance, (ii) increase
the amount of such Bank's Commitment or (iii)


<PAGE>
                                                                              49


reduce the amount of the Facility Fee or the Utilization Fee, in each case, from
that in effect at the time of the sale of the participating interest, provided
that if such Bank so grants to a Participant a right to approve of or consent to
a reduction in the Facility Fee and Utilization Fee, the term of the
participating interest sold to such Participant shall not extend beyond, and
unless earlier terminated such participating interest shall automatically
terminate on, the day immediately prior to the day and month of the Effective
Date next following the sale of such participating interest, and (e) any such
participating interest shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 or the
Equivalent thereof on the date the participating interest is sold. On the month
and day of the Effective Date of each year (or, if any such month and day of the
Effective Date is not a Domestic Business Day, on the next succeeding Domestic
Business Day), each relevant Bank shall furnish to the Administrative Agent and
the Company a written notice disclosing the name of each Participant which held
a participating interest in such Bank's Commitment or any Loan held by such Bank
at any time during the 12-month period ended on the day immediately prior to the
day and month of the Effective Date next preceding such date. A Participant
shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 10.3 or 10.4
than the applicable Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to
such Participant is made with the Company's prior written consent. Any
Participant that is a foreign person (i.e., a person organized or incorporated
under the laws of a country other than that under which the Company is
incorporated, if it is the borrower, or an Affiliate is incorporated or
organized, if such Affiliate is the borrower) shall not be entitled to the
benefits of Section 10.4 unless such Participant complies with Section 10.4(c).

SECTION 10. CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

         10.1 BASIS FOR DETERMINING INTEREST RATE INADEQUATE OR UNFAIR

         The Banks shall have no obligation to make a new Eurocurrency Loan, to
extend an outstanding Eurocurrency Loan or to convert an outstanding Loan into a
Eurocurrency Loan if the Administrative Agent determines that:

         (a) by reason of circumstances generally affecting all interbank
markets for deposits in the currency in which the Eurocurrency Loan has been
requested to be denominated (in the applicable amounts), LIBO Rates for such
deposits are not being offered to the Banks for a term equal to any Interest
Period for which such new Loan, extended Loan or converted Loan shall be
requested by the Company or an Affiliate;

         (b) based on notice received from the Required Banks, the LIBO Rate
will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Banks of maintaining or
funding such new Loan, extended Loan or converted Loan as shall be requested by
the Company or an Affiliate;

         (c) deposits in the applicable currency are not generally available, or
cannot be obtained by the Banks, in the applicable market (any Foreign Currency
affected by the circumstances described in clause (a), (b) or (c) is referred to
as an "Affected Foreign Currency").

Upon any such determination, the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or
telephonic notice thereof to the Company and the Banks as soon as practicable.
If such notice is given (y) pursuant


<PAGE>
                                                                              50


to clause (a) or (b) of this Section 10.1 in respect of Eurocurrency Loans
denominated in United States dollars, then (i) any Eurocurrency Loans
denominated in United States dollars requested to be made on the first day of
such Interest Period shall be made as Base Rate Loans, (ii) any Base Rate Loans
that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to
Eurocurrency Loans denominated in United States dollars shall be continued as
Base Rate Loans and (iii) any outstanding Eurocurrency Loans denominated in
United States dollars shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current
Interest Period, to Base Rate Loans and (z) in respect of any Foreign Currency
Loans, then (i) any Foreign Currency Loans in an Affected Foreign Currency
requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall not be made
and (ii) any outstanding Foreign Currency Loans in an Affected Foreign Currency
shall be due and payable on the first day of such Interest Period. Until such
relevant notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further
Eurocurrency Loans denominated in United States dollars or Foreign Currency
Loans in an Affected Foreign Currency shall be made or continued as such, nor
shall the Company have the right to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency
Loans denominated in United States dollars.

         10.2 ILLEGALITY

         (a) If, after the date of this Agreement, the introduction of, or any
change in, any applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental, monetary, or regulatory authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by any
Bank with any request or directive of any such authority shall make it unlawful
for such Bank to make, maintain or fund any Loan or CAF Advance or issue or
participate in any Letter of Credit, such Bank shall give notice thereof to the
Company and, if the Loan or Letter of Credit is to an Affiliate, to such
Affiliate (in each case with a copy to the Administrative Agent). Before giving
any notice pursuant to this Section 10.2, the relevant Bank shall designate a
different lending office if such designation would avoid the need for giving
such notice and it would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Bank in its
reasonable judgment. Upon receipt of such notice the Company shall or, if the
Loan or Letter of Credit is to an Affiliate, the Affiliate shall on either (A)
the last day of the then-current Interest Period applicable to such Loan or CAF
Advance or expiration of the Letter of Credit if such Bank may lawfully continue
to maintain and fund such Loan or Letter of Credit to such day or (B) not later
than the last date such Bank may lawfully continue to fund and maintain such
Loan, CAF Advance or Letter of Credit, either (i) prepay in full, without
premium or penalty, the then outstanding principal amount of each affected Loan
or CAF Advance, together with accrued interest thereon, (ii) convert such Loan
into another category of Loan (which would not be unlawful for the relevant
Banks to make) as provided in Section 2.12 or (iii) arrange for termination of
the Letter of Credit.

         (b) Upon any prepayment of a CAF Advance or prepayment or conversion of
a Loan made pursuant to Section 10.2(a) other than at the end of an Interest
Period, the Company or the Affiliate, as applicable, shall reimburse the Bank
upon demand for any loss incurred by it as a result of the timing of such
prepayment or conversion, in the manner provided in Section 2.18.

                                                                              51


         10.3 INCREASED COST

         (a) If (i) Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Board as in effect on
the Effective Date ("Regulation D"), (ii) minimum reserve requirements of the
Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority as in effect on the
Effective Date ("Mandatory Cost Rate"), or (iii) after the date hereof, the
adoption of any applicable law or regulation, or any change therein, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive
of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency (a "Regulatory
Change"):

                  (A) shall subject any Bank to any tax, duty or other charge
         with respect to Eurocurrency Loans or LIBO Rate CAF Advances or its
         obligation to make Eurocurrency Loans, or shall change the basis of
         taxation of payments to such Bank of the principal of or interest on
         Eurocurrency Loans or LIBO Rate CAF Advances or any other amounts due
         under this Agreement in respect of Eurocurrency Loans or LIBO Rate CAF
         Advances or its obligation to make Eurocurrency Loans (except for
         changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Bank or
         the Eurodollar Lending Office imposed by the jurisdictions in which
         such Bank's principal executive office or Eurodollar Lending Office are
         located); or

                  (B) shall impose, modify or cause to be applicable any reserve
         (including, without limitation, any imposed by the Federal Reserve
         Board), special deposit or similar requirement against assets of,
         deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, such Bank
         or the Eurodollar Lending Office or shall impose on such Bank (or the
         Eurodollar Lending Office) or all interbank markets applicable to such
         Eurocurrency Loans or LIBO Rate CAF Advances any other condition
         affecting the Eurocurrency Loans or LIBO Rate CAF Advances or its
         obligation to make Eurocurrency Loans;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or
the Eurodollar Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loans,
LIBO Rate CAF Advances or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to
reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or the
Eurodollar Lending Office) under this Agreement, by an amount deemed by such
Bank to be material, the Company shall pay or, if such Eurocurrency Loans are to
Affiliates, such Affiliates shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Bank for any such increased cost or reduction
incurred or suffered by such Bank from and after the later of (i) the date that
is 15 days prior to receipt of notice from such Bank of such costs and (ii) the
last date preceding receipt of such notice from such Bank on which interest was
due and payable pursuant to Section 2.9 on any such LIBO Rate CAF Advance or
Section 2.15 on any such Eurocurrency Loan. Any Bank which provides notice to
the Company of increased costs pursuant to this Section 10.3(a) shall also
provide a copy of such notice to the Administrative Agent.

         (b) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing, so long as any Bank
shall be required to maintain reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under
Regulation D (or, so long as such Bank may be required, by any Mandatory Cost
Rate or by reason of any Regulatory Change, to


<PAGE>
                                                                              52


maintain reserves against any other category of liabilities which includes
deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans or LIBO
Rate CAF Advances is determined as provided in this Agreement or against any
category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank which includes any
LIBO Rate CAF Advances or Eurocurrency Loans) (such reserves are collectively
called "Reserves") the Company shall pay or, if such Eurocurrency Loans are to
Affiliates, such Affiliates shall pay to such Bank an amount (reasonably
estimated by such Bank) for each day during each Interest Period for such LIBO
Rate CAF Advances or Eurocurrency Loans equal to the product of the following:

                  (i) the principal amount of each LIBO Rate CAF Advance or
         Eurocurrency Loan to which such Interest Period relates; multiplied by

                  (ii) the difference between (A) a fraction, the numerator of
         which is the LIBO Rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such LIBO
         Rate CAF Advance or Eurocurrency Loan and the denominator of which is
         one (1) minus such Bank's Actual Reserve Cost (defined below)
         (expressed as a decimal) and (B) the LIBO Rate; multiplied by

                  (iii) 1/360.

         For the purposes of this Section 10.3(b), the "Bank's Actual Reserve
Cost" (which shall be reasonably estimated by the relevant Bank) shall be equal
to the cost actually incurred by such Bank from time to time during such
Interest Period as a result of the requirement that such Bank maintain Reserves
with respect to such LIBO Rate CAF Advance or Eurocurrency Loan.

         (c) If any Governmental Authority of the jurisdiction of any Foreign
Currency (or any other jurisdiction in which the funding operations of any Bank
shall be conducted with respect to such Foreign Currency) shall have in effect
any reserve, liquid asset or similar requirement with respect to any category of
deposits or liabilities customarily used to fund loans in such Foreign Currency,
or by reference to which interest rates applicable to loans in such Foreign
Currency are determined, and the result of such requirement shall be to increase
the cost to such Bank of making or maintaining any Foreign Currency Loan in such
Foreign Currency, and such Bank shall deliver to the Company a notice requesting
compensation under this paragraph, then the Company will pay or cause the
relevant Affiliate to pay to such Bank on each Interest Payment Date with
respect to each affected Foreign Currency Loan an amount that will compensate
such Bank for such additional cost.

         (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if, after
the date hereof, there shall have occurred any change in national or
international financial, political or economic conditions (including the
imposition of or any change in exchange controls, but excluding conditions
otherwise covered by this Section 10.3) or currency exchange rates which would
make it impracticable for the Required Banks to make or maintain Foreign
Currency Loans denominated in the relevant currency to, or for the account of,
the Company or any Affiliate, then, by written notice to the Company or such
Affiliate and to the Administrative Agent:


<PAGE>
                                                                              53


                  (i) such Bank or Banks may declare that Foreign Currency Loans
         (in the affected currency or currencies) will not thereafter (for the
         duration of such unlawfulness) be made by such Bank or Banks hereunder
         (or be continued for additional Interest Periods), whereupon any
         request for a Foreign Currency Loan (in the affected currency or
         currencies) or to continue a Foreign Currency Loan (in the affected
         currency or currencies), as the case may be, for an additional Interest
         Period) shall, as to such Bank or Banks only, be of no force and
         effect, unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and

                  (ii) such Bank may require that all outstanding Foreign
         Currency Loans (in the affected currency or currencies), made by it be
         converted to Base Rate Loans or Loans denominated in United States
         dollars, as the case may be (unless repaid by the Company or the
         relevant Affiliate as described below), in which event all such Foreign
         Currency Loans (in the affected currency or currencies) shall be
         converted to Base Rate Loans or Loans denominated in United States
         dollars, as the case may be, as of the effective date of such notice as
         provided below and at the Exchange Rate on the date of such conversion
         or, at the option of the Company or the Affiliate, repaid on the last
         day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto or, if
         earlier, the date on which the applicable notice becomes effective.

In the event any Bank shall exercise its rights under this paragraph (d), all
payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have been applied to
repay the converted Foreign Currency Loans of such Bank shall instead be applied
to repay the Base Rate Loans or Loans denominated in United States dollars, as
the case may be, made by such Bank resulting from such conversion. For purposes
of Section 10.3(d), a notice to the Company or Affiliate by any Bank shall be
effective as to each Foreign Currency Loan made by such Bank, if lawful, on the
last day of the Interest Period currently applicable to such Foreign Currency
Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt
thereof by the Company or Affiliate.

         (e) Each Bank shall take reasonable steps, including without
limitation, the designation of a different Eurodollar Lending Office or Foreign
Currency Lending Office (unless it would otherwise be disadvantageous to the
Bank in its reasonable judgment) if such steps would avoid the need for or
reduce the amount of any payment that otherwise would be due under Section
10.3(a), 10.3(b) or 10.3(c). Any amounts payable by the Company or any Affiliate
under Sections 10.3(a), 10.3(b) or 10.3(c) shall be remitted after the end of
each Interest Period, within 30 days after submission by the Bank to the Company
and such Affiliate (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written
statement setting forth the amount thereof.

         (f) From time to time during the term of this Agreement, upon the
request of the Company, each Bank shall provide to the Company (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent) its best estimate of such Bank's Actual Reserve Cost
incurred or to be incurred with respect to Eurocurrency Loans in the principal
amounts specified in the Company's request.


<PAGE>
                                                                              54


         10.4 WITHHOLDING TAXES

         (a) Each Bank agrees to take reasonable measures, unless it would
otherwise be disadvantageous to such Bank in its reasonable judgment to avoid or
minimize withholding taxes in connection with any payments made to such Bank
hereunder, including without limitation designating another office of the Bank
as the lending office for a Loan.

         (b) If the Company or any Affiliate shall be required by law to deduct
or withhold any taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to the
Administrative Agent or any Bank, then, subject to Sections 10.4(e) and 10.4(f):

                  (i) the Company or the Affiliate, as applicable, shall make
         such deductions;

                  (ii) the Company or the Affiliate, as applicable, shall pay
         the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority in
         accordance with applicable law, and shall provide to the Administrative
         Agent or such Bank upon its request any official receipts or other
         evidence of payment thereof that the Company or such Affiliate may
         obtain or have in its possession; and

                  (iii) if (A) the Administrative Agent or such Bank notifies
         the Company (pursuant to Section 2.6 or 2.12) at the time that the
         Company (on behalf of itself or an Affiliate) gives a notice of
         Borrowing or a notice to extend or convert any Loan that such Bank will
         require a Gross-up for withholding taxes in connection with such Loan,
         as so extended or converted, if applicable, (B) no such notice was
         given by the Administrative Agent or any Bank, but after a notice of
         Borrowing, extension or conversion pursuant to Section 2.6 or 2.12 in
         respect of such Loan was given a change in applicable law or
         regulation, or a change in the interpretation or administration thereof
         by any governmental or comparable authority, occurs that requires the
         Company or any Affiliate to so deduct or withhold taxes from or in
         respect of any sum payable to the Administrative Agent or such Bank or
         (C) payments made with respect to Letters of Credit are subject to
         deduction for withholding taxes, then the sum payable to the
         Administrative Agent or such Bank after the Company or the Affiliate
         makes all required deductions shall be increased by an amount such that
         the Administrative Agent or such Bank receives a total amount equal to
         the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made. If
         neither the Administrative Agent nor the affected Bank notifies the
         Company at or prior to the time that the Company (on behalf of itself
         or an Affiliate) gives a notice of Borrowing or a notice to extend or
         convert a Loan, as applicable, that the Administrative Agent or such
         Bank will require a Gross-up in connection with such Loan, as so
         extended or converted, if applicable, no Gross-up in respect of such
         Loan will be paid to the Administrative Agent or such Bank, except to
         the extent that a subsequent change in applicable law or regulation, or
         a change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
         governmental or comparable authority, requires the Company or any
         Affiliate to deduct or withhold taxes (or an increased amount thereof)
         from or in respect of any sum payable to the Administrative Agent or
         such Bank in respect of such Loan. Notwithstanding anything contained
         in this Section 10.4, in the event that the Company shall fail to
         comply with its obligations under Section 7.2(b) with respect to a
         Loan, the


<PAGE>
                                                                              55


         Company shall pay (or cause its Affiliate to pay) to the Administrative
         Agent or affected Bank an amount such that the Administrative Agent or
         such Bank receives the amount it would have received had no such
         deductions been made with respect to payments in connection with such
         Loan.

         (c) If a Bank or the Bank's lending office is a foreign person (i.e., a
person organized or incorporated under the laws of a country other than that
under which the Company is incorporated, if it is the borrower, or an Affiliate
is incorporated or organized, if such Affiliate is the borrower), such Bank
agrees that:

                  (i) it shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent and
         either the Company or the Affiliate such accurate and complete signed
         forms or documentation as may be required from time to time by any
         applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation as a condition to exemption
         or other relief from or reduction of tax for withholding purposes; and

                  (ii) it shall, before or promptly after the occurrence of any
         event (including the passing of time) requiring a change in or renewal
         of the most recent forms or documentation previously delivered by such
         Bank, deliver to the Administrative Agent and either the Company or the
         Affiliate, as applicable, accurate and complete signed copies of such
         forms or documentation.

         (d) To the extent that, as determined in good faith by the
Administrative Agent or any Bank in its sole discretion and without any
obligation to disclose its tax records, taxes withheld and paid in accordance
with this Section 10.4 for which a Gross-up has been paid have been irrevocably
utilized by the Administrative Agent or such Bank (either as credits or
deductions) to reduce its tax liabilities and such utilization is consistent
with its overall tax policies, the Administrative Agent or such Bank shall pay
to the Company or the relevant Affiliate, as the case may be, an amount equal to
such reduction obtained to the extent of such Gross-up paid by the Company or
the Affiliate to the Administrative Agent or such Bank as aforesaid.

         (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company and
the Affiliates will not be required to pay any Gross-up in respect of taxes
described below:

                  (i) if the obligation to pay such Gross-up would not have
         arisen but for a failure by a Bank to comply with its obligations under
         Section 10.4(c) in respect of the applicable lending office; or

                  (ii) if a Bank shall have delivered to the Company or an
         Affiliate any form or documentation required by Section 10.4(c)
         pursuant to which the Bank claims exemption from withholding tax by any
         jurisdiction or under any treaty of such jurisdiction, and the Bank
         shall not at any time be entitled to exemption from deduction or
         withholding of taxes by such jurisdiction in respect of payment by the
         Company or any Affiliate hereunder for the account of such lending
         office for any reason other than a change in such jurisdiction's law or
         regulations or any applicable tax treaty or regulations or in the
         official interpretation of any such law, treaty or regulations by any
         Governmental


<PAGE>
                                                                              56


         Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof
         after the date of delivery of such form or documentation.

         (f) In the event any Bank sells or grants a participation in its rights
under this Agreement or any Loan hereunder, such Bank agrees to undertake sole
responsibility for complying with any withholding tax requirements relating to
the purchaser thereof imposed by any jurisdiction, including, without
limitation, those imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

         10.5 REPLACEMENT OF BANKS.

         The Company shall be permitted to replace any Bank that (a) requests
reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 10.3 or 10.4(b) or (b)
defaults in its obligation to make Loans hereunder, with a replacement financial
institution; provided that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any
Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default, Affiliate Event of Default or
Event of Default-Bankruptcy shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of
such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement, such Bank shall have
taken no action under Section 10.3(e) or 10.4(a) so as to eliminate the
continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 10.3 or 10.4(b),
(iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans and
other amounts owing to such replaced Bank on or prior to the date of
replacement, (v) the Company shall be liable to such replaced Bank under Section
2.18 if any Eurocurrency Loan owing to such replaced Bank shall be purchased
other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the
replacement financial institution, if not already a Bank, shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Bank shall be
obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section
9.1 (provided that the Company shall be obligated to pay the registration and
processing fee referred to therein), (viii) until such time as such replacement
shall be consummated, the Company shall pay all additional amounts (if any)
required pursuant to Section 10.3 or 10.4(b), as the case may be, and (ix) any
such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the
Company, the Administrative Agent or any other Bank shall have against the
replaced Bank.

SECTION 11. THE AGENTS

         11.1 APPOINTMENT

         Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Administrative
Agent as the agent of such Bank under this Agreement, and each such Bank
irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take such
action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative
Agent by the terms of this Agreement, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties
or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.


<PAGE>
                                                                              57


         11.2 DELEGATION OF DUTIES

         The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to
advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct
of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care in
consultation with the Company.

         11.3 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS

         Neither any Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any
action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such person under or in
connection with this Agreement (except to the extent that any of the foregoing
are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such person's own gross negligence or
willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Banks for
any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Company or
any Affiliate or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by the Agents under or in connection with, this Agreement or for the
value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of
this Agreement or for any failure of the Company or any Affiliate to perform its
obligations hereunder. The Agents shall not be under any obligation to any Bank
to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect the
properties, books or records of the Company or any Affiliate.

         11.4 RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement,
order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or persons and upon
advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Company or any
Affiliate), independent accountants and other experts selected by the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of
any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of
assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall
first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Banks (or, if so
specified by this Agreement, all Banks) as it deems appropriate or it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all
liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement
in accordance with a request of the Required Banks (or, if so specified by this
Agreement, all Banks), and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks and all future holders of
the Loans.


<PAGE>
                                                                              58


         11.5 NOTICE OF DEFAULT

         The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any default or Event of Default, Affiliate Event of
Default or Event of Default-Bankruptcy unless the Administrative Agent has
received notice from a Bank, the Company or an Affiliate referring to this
Agreement, describing such default or Event of Default, Affiliate Event of
Default or Event of Default-Bankruptcy and stating that such notice is a "notice
of default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice,
the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Banks. The
Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such default or
Event of Default, Affiliate Event of Default or Event of Default-Bankruptcy as
shall be reasonably directed by the Required Banks (or, if so specified by this
Agreement, all Banks); provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent
shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not
be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with
respect to such default or Event of Default, Affiliate Event of Default or Event
of Default-Bankruptcy as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the
Banks.

         11.6 NON-RELIANCE ON AGENTS AND OTHER BANKS

         Each Bank expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by
any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Company or
any Affiliate, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by
any Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents to the Agents that it has,
independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Bank, and based
on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Company and its
Affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into
this Agreement. Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to
inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Company and its Affiliates. Except for
notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the
Banks by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial
or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Company and its Affiliates
that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

         11.7 INDEMNIFICATION

         The Banks agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the
extent not reimbursed by the Company and the Affiliates and without limiting the
obligation of the Company and the Affiliates to do so), ratably according to
their respective Aggregate Exposure


<PAGE>
                                                                              59


Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this
Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the
Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full,
ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure Percentages immediately prior
to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment
of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any
way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, the Loans, this Agreement,
any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent
under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Bank shall be
liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the
Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

         11.8 AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY

         Each Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or an Affiliate as
though such Agent were not an Agent. With respect to Loans made or renewed by
it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any
Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms
"Bank" and "Banks" shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.

         11.9 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 45
days' notice to the Banks and the Company. If the Administrative Agent shall
resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement, then the Required Banks
shall appoint from among the Banks a successor administrative agent for the
Banks, which successor administrative agent shall (unless an Event of Default
under Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.3 with respect to the Company shall have
occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Company (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such
successor administrative agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of
the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such
successor administrative agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and
the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative
Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part
of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or
any holders of the Loans. If no successor administrative agent has accepted
appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is 45 days following a
retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become
effective, and the Banks shall assume and perform all of the duties of the
Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Banks
appoint a successor administrative agent as provided for above. After any
retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the
provisions of this Section 11 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken
or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this
Agreement.

                                                                              60


         11.10 SYNDICATION AGENT

         The Syndication Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities
hereunder in its capacity as such.

Commitments or until the payment in full of the Loans, CAF Advances and
Reimbursement Obligations and expiration or termination of all Letters of
Credit, whichever occurs last, provided that the obligations of the Company or
any Affiliate with respect to any payment required to be made by it under this
Agreement shall survive the term of this Agreement.

         12.3 NO WAIVERS

         No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Bank in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

         12.4 NEW YORK LAW AND JURISDICTION

INSTEAD BE DEEMED TO BE REFERENCES TO THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN AND OF
THE UNITED STATES FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN. ENFORCEMENT OF FINAL,
NONAPPEALABLE JUDGMENTS RECEIVED IN ANY OF THE FOREGOING COURTS MAY ALSO BE
SOUGHT IN ANY OTHER APPROPRIATE COURT OR JURISDICTION.

         (c) The Secretary of the Company shall be the agent for service of
process with regard to all claims hereunder by the Administrative Agent or Banks
against any Affiliate.

         12.5 ENTIRE AGREEMENT

         This Agreement, together with any Accession Memoranda, constitutes the
entire understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement and supersedes any prior discussions, negotiations, agreements
and understandings. The parties hereto acknowledge that the general banking or
business conditions or any similar bank lending rules or requirements of any
organization not having the force of law, now or hereafter in effect shall not
be applicable to this Agreement, the Accession Memoranda or any Loans made
hereunder to the Company or any Affiliate by the Banks or any other office,
branch or affiliate included in the term "Bank".


<PAGE>
                                                                              62


         12.6 PAYMENT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES

         (a) Except to the extent otherwise agreed upon in writing by the
parties hereto, the Company agrees to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent
for all its out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
development, preparation and execution of, and any amendment, supplement or
modification to, this Agreement and any other documents prepared in connection
herewith, and the consummation and administration of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel to the Administrative Agent, with statements with respect to the
foregoing to be submitted to the Company prior to the Effective Date (in the
case of amounts to be paid on the Effective Date) and from time to time
thereafter on a quarterly basis or such other periodic basis as the
Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate.

         (b) The Company, with respect to an Event of Default and Event of
Default - Bankruptcy and Loans to it, or an Affiliate, with respect to an
Affiliate Event of Default by such Affiliate and Loans to such Affiliate, will

                  (i) upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Event of
         Default - Bankruptcy, or Affiliate Event of Default, as applicable, pay
         all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
         Agent and the Banks (including counsel fees) in connection with such
         Event of Default, Event of Default - Bankruptcy, or Affiliate Event of
         Default and collection and other enforcement proceedings resulting
         therefrom; and

                  (ii) pay all stamp and other taxes, if any, which may be
         determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery
         of this Agreement and any Accession Memoranda, or in connection with
         any modification of any Accession Memoranda or this Agreement or any
         waiver or consent under or in respect of this Agreement or any
         Accession Memoranda, and will save the Administrative Agent and the
         Banks harmless against any loss or liability (including interest and
         penalties) resulting from nonpayment or delay in payment of any such
         taxes.

         (c) If an Affiliate borrows a Foreign Currency Loan denominated in the
euro from a Foreign Currency Lending Office that is not located in the same
Participating Member State as the Affiliate, the Affiliate will pay all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Banks in making such
cross-border Loan (but limited solely to expenses directly attributable to the
cross-border nature of such Loan, and not including any withholding taxes which
are addressed separately by Section 10.4). Each Bank shall take reasonable
steps, including without limitation, the designation for purposes of such Loan
of a Foreign Currency Lending Office located in a different country (unless it
would otherwise be disadvantageous to such Bank in its reasonable judgment) if
such steps would avoid or reduce such expenses.

         (d) The Company and the Affiliate jointly and severally agree to pay,
indemnify, and hold each Bank and the Administrative Agent and their respective
officers, directors, employees, affiliates, agents and controlling persons
(each, an "Indemnitee") harmless from and against any and all other liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the
execution,


<PAGE>
                                                                              63


delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement,
including any of the foregoing relating to the use of proceeds of the Loans or
the violation of, noncompliance with or liability under, any environmental law
applicable to the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective owned or leased properties and the reasonable fees and expenses
of legal counsel in connection with claims, actions or proceedings by any
Indemnitee against the Company or any Affiliate (all the foregoing in this
clause (d), collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), provided, that neither
the Company nor any Affiliates shall have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnitee with respect to Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such
Indemnified Liabilities are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing, and to
the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company and its Affiliates agree not
to assert and to cause their Subsidiaries not to assert, and hereby waives and
agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to waive all rights for contribution or any
other rights of recovery with respect to all claims, demands, penalties, fines,
liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses of whatever kind or
nature, under or related to environmental laws, that any of them might have by
statute or otherwise against any Indemnitee. All amounts due under this Section
12.6 shall be payable not late than 10 days after written demand therefor.

         (e) The obligations of the Company and the Affiliates under this
Section 12.6 shall survive payment of the Loans.

         12.7 JUDGMENT CURRENCY

         If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary
to convert a sum due from a party borrowing or making Loans hereunder in the
currency expressed to be payable hereunder (for purposes of this Section 12.7,
the "specified currency") into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall
be the Spot Rate on the day that final, nonappealable judgment is given. The
obligations of such parties hereunder in respect of any sum due to another party
hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the
specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Eurodollar
Business Day following receipt by a party of any sum adjudged to be so due in
such other currency such party may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking
or foreign exchange procedures purchase the specified currency with such other
currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the
sum originally due to such party, in the specified currency, the party which
owed such sum agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the
party to which the sum was owed against such loss.

         12.8 CHANGES, WAIVERS, ETC.; ADJUSTMENTS

         (a) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be amended,
supplemented, changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only by a
statement in writing signed by the Company and the Required Banks or, with the
consent of the Required Banks, the Company and the Administrative Agent;
provided, however, that no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or
modification shall (i) forgive the principal amount or extend the final
scheduled date of maturity of any Loan or CAF Advance, reduce the stated rate of
any interest or fee payable hereunder or extend the scheduled date of any
payment thereof, or increase the amount

or extend the termination date of any Bank's Commitment, in each case without
the written consent of each Bank directly affected thereby; (ii) eliminate or
reduce the voting rights of any Bank under this Section 12.8 without the written
consent of such Bank; (iii) reduce any percentage specified in the definition of
Required Banks, consent to the assignment or transfer by the Company of any of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement, or release the Company from its
guarantee obligations under Section 4 in each case without the written consent
of all Banks; (iv) add currencies as Foreign Currencies under this Agreement
without the written consent of all Banks; (v) amend, modify or waive any
provision of Section 11 without the written consent of each Agent; or (vi)
amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 3 without the written consent of
each Issuing Bank. Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or
modification shall apply equally to each of the Banks and shall be binding upon
the Company, the Affiliates, the Banks, the Agents and all future holders of the
Loans. In the case of any waiver, the Company, the Affiliates, the Banks and the
Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights
hereunder, and any default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be
cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.

         (b) Except to the extent that this Agreement expressly provides for
payments to be allocated to a particular Bank, if any Bank (a "Benefitted Bank")
shall receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it in a
greater proportion than any such payment to any other Bank, if any, in respect
of the Obligations owing to such other Bank, such Benefitted Bank shall purchase
for cash from the other Banks a participating interest in such portion of the
Obligations owing to each such other Bank as shall be necessary to cause such
Benefitted Bank to share the excess payment ratably with each of the Banks;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded
and the purchase price returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without
interest.

         12.9 SEVERABILITY

         If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any
person or circumstance shall be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the
remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to persons or
circumstances other than those as to which it is invalid or unenforceable, shall
not be affected thereby, and each provision of this Agreement shall be valid and
enforceable to the extent permitted by law.

         12.10 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS

         This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

         12.11 COUNTERPARTS

         This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. Complete sets of counterparts shall be delivered to the Company, the
Administrative Agent and the Banks.

         12.12 THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES

         Each of the Affiliates of the Company and each office, branch or
affiliate of the Administrative Agent and the Banks which make Loans or CAF
Advances or issues Letters of Credit hereunder shall be a third party
beneficiary of this Agreement.

         12.13 ELECTRONIC RECORDING

         The parties to this Agreement may electronically record any telephone
communications with one another relating to any preliminary or final notices of
any Borrowing, CAF Advance Borrowing, or any extension and conversion of Loans
pursuant to Section 2.6, 2.8 or 2.12. In the event that any electronically
recorded final notice of Borrowing, CAF Advance Borrowing or extension or
conversion differs from the terms of the corresponding written notice of
Borrowing, CAF Advance Borrowing or extension or conversion, the terms of the
electronically recorded notice shall control.

         12.14 AGGREGATION OR COMPARISON OF AMOUNTS IN DIFFERENT CURRENCIES;
CALCULATION OF CERTAIN FEES

         Whenever any provision of this Agreement requires the aggregation of
two or more amounts denominated in different currencies (e.g., the aggregation
of the principal amounts of Loans and CAF Advances outstanding or Letters of
Credit issued in different currencies), or the comparison of two amounts
denominated in different currencies (e.g., the requirement that the principal
amount of Foreign Currency Loans or L/C Obligations not exceed an amount
expressed in United States dollars), such amounts denominated in a Foreign
Currency shall be notionally converted, for purposes of such aggregation or
comparison, to the Equivalent thereof in United States dollars, such that the
result of such aggregation or comparison shall be an amount or amounts expressed
in United States dollars. Similarly, whenever any provision of this Agreement
requires the calculation of a fee as a per annum percentage of a particular
amount (e.g., the Utilization Fee), the amounts upon which such fee is to be
calculated shall be notionally converted to the Equivalent thereof in United
States dollars, so that the result of such calculation shall be a fee amount
expressed in United States dollars.
