Termination under this Section 7 or otherwise as of the date of Executive's
termination of employment with the Company, Executive shall resign, in writing,

            8. Unauthorized Disclosure. During the period of Executive's
employment with the Company and following any termination of such employment,

<PAGE>

                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

during the period of Executive's employment with the Company) or during the
six-month period preceding such solicitation, employment or interference (in the
case of any such activity after the date of Executive's termination of
employment), other than any such solicitation or employment on behalf of the
Company or its Affiliates during Executive's employment with the Company, or
(ii) induce any employee of the Company or its Affiliates who is a member of
management to engage in any activity which Executive is prohibited from engaging

whom initiated, inviting, encouraging or requesting any person or entity to take
or refrain from taking any action.

            11. Non-Solicitation of Customers. During the Restriction Period,
Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, for his own account or for the
account of any other Person, anywhere in the Restricted Territory, solicit or

Affiliates with any Person which is or was a customer, client or distributor of
the Company or any of its Affiliates at any time during which Executive was
employed by the Company (in the case of any such activity during the period of
Executive's employment with the Company) or during the twelve-month period
preceding the Date of Termination (in the case of any such activity after the

on behalf of the Company or any of its Affiliates during Executive's employment
with the Company.

            12. Return of Documents. In the event of the termination of
Executive's employment for any reason, Executive shall deliver to the Company
all of the property of the Company and its Affiliates and the non-personal
documents and data of any nature and in whatever medium of each of the Company
and its Affiliates, and he shall not take with him any such property, documents
or data or any reproduction thereof, or any documents containing or pertaining
to any Confidential Information.

            13. Work Product. Executive agrees to disclose in confidence to the
Company any and all inventions, improvements, designs, original works of
authorship, formulas, processes, computer software programs, databases and trade
secrets (including, but not limited to, market information and marketing
designs, proposals and concepts) (all taken together, the "Developments") that
Executive makes, conceives, first reduces to practice, or creates, either alone
or jointly with others while Executive is employed by the Company and that: (a)
result from any work performed by Executive for the Company, whether or not in
the normal course of Executive's duties or during normal business hours; (b)
reasonably relate to the actual or anticipated business, services, products,
research or development of Executive; or (c) are developed with the use of the
Company time, equipment, supplies or facilities. Executive must promptly
disclose Developments to the Company whether or not such Developments are
patentable, copyrightable or protectible as trade secrets. Executive understands
and agrees that all Developments shall be the sole and exclusive property of the
Company and shall constitute "work made for hire" (as that term is defined under
Section 101 of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Section 101) with the Company
being the person for whom the work was prepared and that all intellectual
property rights therein shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company,
and that in the event that any such Development is deemed not to be a "work made
for hire," Executive hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers and conveys to the
Company, exclusively and


                                       7
<PAGE>
                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

perpetually, all right, title and interest which Executive may have or acquire
in and to such Development throughout the world, including without limitation
any copyrights and patents, and the right to secure registrations, renewals,
reissues, and extensions thereof. Executive agrees to sign any documents and to
do all things necessary, without additional compensation, whether during
Executive's employment or after, to assist the Company to register, perfect,
maintain and/or enforce the Company's rights in any Development, including
without limitation any patent, copyright, trade secret or other right or
interest.

            14. Injunctive Relief with Respect to Covenants; Forum, Venue and
Jurisdiction. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the covenants, obligations
and agreements of Executive contained in Sections 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14
relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters and that a violation of any
of the terms of such covenants, obligations or agreements will cause the Company
irreparable injury for which adequate remedies are not available at law.
Therefore, Executive agrees that the Company shall be entitled to an injunction,
restraining order or such other equitable relief (without the requirement to
post bond) as a court of competent jurisdiction may deem necessary or
appropriate to restrain Executive from committing any violation of such
covenants, obligations or agreements. These injunctive remedies are cumulative
and in addition to any other rights and remedies the Company may have. The
Company and Executive hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the courts of New York, and the Federal courts of the United States of America,
in each case located in New York City in respect of the injunctive remedies set
forth in this Section 14 and the interpretation and enforcement of Sections 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 insofar as such interpretation and enforcement relate
to any request or application for injunctive relief in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 14, and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably agree
that (a) the sole and exclusive appropriate venue for any suit or proceeding
relating solely to such injunctive relief shall be in such a court, (b) all
claims with respect to any request or application for such injunctive relief
shall be heard and determined exclusively in such a court, (c) any such court
shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the
subject matter of any dispute relating to any request or application for such
injunctive relief, and (d) each hereby waives any and all objections and
defenses based on forum, venue or personal or subject matter jurisdiction as
they may relate to an application for such injunctive relief in a suit or
proceeding brought before such a court in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 14. All disputes not relating to any request or application for
injunctive relief in accordance with this Section 14 shall be resolved by
arbitration in accordance with Section 17 (b).

            Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Company's
obligations to pay Executive any amount or provide Executive with any benefit or
right pursuant to Section 7(f) is subject to Executive's compliance with his
obligations under Sections 8 through 14, inclusive.

            15. Assumption of Agreement. The Company shall require any Successor
thereto, by agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same
manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it
if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such
agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of
this Agreement and shall entitle Executive to compensation from the Company in
the same amount and on the same terms as Executive would be entitled hereunder
if the Company had terminated Executive's employment Without Cause as described
in Section 7, except that for


                                       8

purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession
becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination.

            16. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.
All prior correspondence and proposals (including but not limited to summaries
of proposed terms) and all prior promises, representations, understandings,
arrangements and agreements relating to such subject matter (including but not
limited to those made to or with Executive by any other Person and those
contained in any prior employment, consulting or similar agreement entered into
