                         TRANSITIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT

This Agreement is made this 14th day of February, 2003 (the "Effective Date"),
between CanWest Publications Inc., a company governed by the laws of Canada
("CPI"), and Osprey Media Holdings Inc. ("Osprey"), a company governed by the
laws of Ontario, on its own behalf and for and on behalf of each of the
corporations listed in Schedule A (each, a "Company" and, collectively, the
"Companies") as follows:

1.       IT SERVICES

CPI shall provide to each Company the information technology services in
Schedule B (the "IT Services"). Schedule B provides a description of each of the
IT Services, the maximum term of such services and the implications upon the
expiry of the maximum term of such services.

2.       PAYROLL SERVICES

For a period of no longer than six months following the Effective Date, CPI
shall pay the payroll for Southern Ontario Community Newspaper Group Inc. and
Niagara Newspaper Group Inc. ("Payroll Services"). Osprey will provide CPI with
the payroll funds via wire transfer, including an administrative fee of $500,
two days prior to the required disbursal date.

2.       DELIVERY OF THE IT SERVICES

Osprey shall ensure that each of the Companies maintains the appropriate systems
to enable it to receive the IT Services.

3.       FEES FOR IT SERVICES

The fees for each of the IT Services are listed in Schedule C. Where there is no
fee listed, the relevant Companies will be charged only for consulting and
support services, as requested by such Companies, at CPI's then current hourly
rates (which range from $55 to $75 per hour as at the date of this Agreement).

4.       PAYMENT TERMS FOR THE IT SERVICES

In respect of the IT Services, CPI will invoice Osprey on a monthly basis for
the fees incurred during that month by each of the Companies and Osprey shall
pay CPI within 15 days of the date of such invoice.

5.       NO WARRANTY

The IT Services and Payroll Services are provided on an "as is" basis and CPI
makes no representation, warranty, covenant or condition with respect to the IT
Services and Payroll Services.

6.       CONFIDENTIALITY

During the term of the provision of the IT Services and Payroll Services, each
party shall treat and hold as confidential any information concerning any other
party or its business that is not generally available to the public (the
"Confidential Information"), and shall refrain from using

<PAGE>

any of the Confidential Information except in connection with this Agreement. In
the event that a party is requested or required (by oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information, that party shall notify the other relevant parties promptly of the
request or requirement so such other parties may seek an appropriate protective
order.

7.       LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

No party shall have any liability to any other party arising out of, in
connection with, or related to the provision of the IT Services and Payroll
Services, except in respect of gross negligence, the payment of fees hereunder
or any of the confidentiality obligations set forth in section 6 hereunder, and
in no event shall any party be liable to any other party for any indirect,
special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages whatsoever (including,
without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption
or any other pecuniary loss).

8.       TERMINATION

Notwithstanding the term of each service as provided for in Schedule B: (a) CPI
may terminate the provision of any IT Service upon not less than 60 days' prior
written notice to Osprey in the event that it determines to discontinue
providing the IT Service to all of its own or its affiliates' publications; and
(b) Osprey may terminate the provision of any IT Service upon 60 days' written
notice to CPI.

9.       ASSIGNMENT

(a)      Except with the written consent of the other party or as provided in
         this section, this Agreement may not be assigned by either party.

(b)      This Agreement may be assigned by a party to an affiliate of such
         party, provided the assignor shall remain liable for all obligations of
         the assignee.

(c)      This Agreement may be assigned by CPI to any successor to the business
         of CPI Information Technology Group upon notice to Osprey.

10.      RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating an employer-employee
relationship, a partnership, agency, franchise or a joint venture between the
parties and neither party shall have the right, power or authority to obligate
or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever without such party's prior
written consent.

11.      SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS

This Agreement shall enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties and
their respective successors (including any successor by reason of amalgamation
of any party) and permitted assigns.
