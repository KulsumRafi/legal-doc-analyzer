                  Covenant Group, the consideration payable by such a member
                  of the Covenant Group comprises either (i) cash funded or to

                  transactions or (ii) Parent Funding;

         (c)      the consideration payable by the Final Asset Transferee is
                  equal to the consideration received or receivable by the
                  Parent;

         (d)      the consideration payable by each member of the Covenant
                  Group participating in such a series of transactions is

                  Covenant Group in relation to such a


                                      3

                  Subordinated Funding mentioned in paragraph (a) above) and
                  (ii) covenants as to title provided in favour of the Final
                  Asset Transferee on the same terms as such covenants were

2.       THE FACILITY

2.1      Grant of the Facility

         the conditions hereof, a sterling multiple draw loan facility in an
         aggregate amount of (pound)1,300,000,000, as the same may be reduced
         in accordance with the terms hereof.

2.2      Purpose

         The Facility was used to fund loans by the Borrower to other members
         of the UK Group each of which utilized the proceeds thereof to
         finance the working capital requirements of the UK Group, and in no
         event were the proceeds of any Advance used for a purpose other than
         to finance the construction, capital expenditure and working capital
         needs of a Cable Business.

2.3      Application

         The Borrower confirms that it has applied all amounts raised by it
         hereunder in or towards satisfaction of, the purposes specified in
         Clause 2.2 (Purpose) and none of the Finance Parties shall be obliged
         to concern themselves with such application.

2.4      Banks' Obligations Several

         The obligations of each Bank are several and the failure by a Bank to
         perform its obligations hereunder shall not affect the obligations of
         an Obligor towards any other party hereto nor shall any other party
         be liable for the failure by such Bank to perform its obligations
         hereunder.

                                      41
<PAGE>

2.5      Banks' Rights Several

         The rights of each Bank are several and any debt arising hereunder at
         any time from an Obligor to any of the other parties hereto shall be
         a separate and independent debt. Each such party shall, save as
         provided in this Agreement and the Security Trust Agreement, be
         entitled to protect and enforce its individual rights arising out of
         this Agreement independently of any other party (so that it shall not
         be necessary for any party hereto to be joined as an additional party
         in any proceedings for this purpose).

3.       UTILISATION OF THE FACILITY

         With effect from the Restatement Amendment Effective Time, all
         Available Commitments shall be cancelled and reduced to zero.

4.       PAYMENT AND CALCULATION OF INTEREST ON ADVANCES; INTEREST PERIODS

4.1      Payment of Interest

         On the last day of each Interest Period (and, if the Interest Period
         of such Advance exceeds six months, on the expiry of each period of
         six months during such Interest Period) the Borrower shall pay
         accrued interest on the Advance to which such Interest Period
         relates.

4.2      Calculation of Interest

         The rate of interest applicable to an Advance from time to time
         during an Interest Period relating thereto shall be the rate per
         annum which is the lesser of:

         4.2.1      16 per cent. per annum; and

         4.2.2      the sum of:

                    (a) the Margin at such time;

                    (b) the Mandatory Cost Rate; and

                    (c) LIBOR on the Quotation Date therefor.

4.3      Limitations on Cash Interest.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
         to the extent that the rate of interest applicable to an Advance on
         any interest payment date for such Advance exceeds the sum of 14 per
         cent. per annum and the increase, if any, in the rate of interest
         pursuant to Clause 4.4 (Default Interest) such excess interest shall
         be paid by adding such excess interest to the principal amount of
         such Advance unless the Borrower shall have given the Agent notice at
         least three Business Days prior to such interest payment date that it
         shall pay such excess amount in cash.

4.4      Default Interest

         The interest rate determined in accordance with Clause 4.2
         (Calculation of Interest) shall be increased by one per cent. per
         annum (it being understood that the interest

                                      42
<PAGE>


         rate could by reason of such increase exceed 16 per cent. per annum)
         from the date determined by the Agent (acting reasonably) (in
         writing) as being the date on which an Event of Default or Potential
         Event of Default has occurred or come into existence until the date
         specified by the Agent (in writing) as being the date on which it has
         been demonstrated to its satisfaction (acting reasonably) that such
         Event of Default or Potential Event of Default is no longer
         continuing. The Agent shall promptly notify the other parties hereto
         of any determination that an Event of Default or Potential Event of
         Default has occurred or exists or, as the case may be, that it has
         been demonstrated to its satisfaction (acting reasonably) that such
         is no longer continuing.

4.5      Interest Periods

         The period for which an Advance is outstanding shall be divided into
         successive periods each of which (other than the first, which shall
         begin on the day such Advance is made) shall start on the last day of
         the preceding such period.

4.6      Duration

         The duration of each Interest Period shall, save as otherwise
         provided herein, be one, two, three or six months or such other
         period as the Agent (acting on instructions of all the Banks) may
         agree in each case as the Borrower may by not less than five Business
         Days' prior notice to the Agent select, provided that:

         4.6.1      if the Borrower fails to give such notice of its selection
                    in relation to an Interest Period, the duration of that
                    Interest Period shall, subject to sub-clauses 4.6.2 and
                    4.6.3 be one month;

         4.6.2      if there are more than five Advances outstanding any
                    Interest Period which begins during or at the same time as
                    anyone or more other Interest Periods shall end at the
                    same time as such one of those other Interest Periods as
                    the Borrower may, by not less than five Business Days'
                    prior notice to the Agent, select or, failing such
                    selection, the first such other Interest Period to expire;
                    and

         4.6.3      any Interest Period which would otherwise end during the
                    month preceding, or extend beyond, the Final Maturity Date
                    shall be of such duration that it shall end on the Final
                    Maturity Date;

4.7      Consolidation of Advances

         If two or more Interest Periods end at the same time, then, on the
         last day of those Interest Periods, the Advances to which they relate
         shall be consolidated into and treated as a single Advance.

4.8      Division of Advances

         The Borrower may, by not less than five Business Days' prior notice
         to the Agent, direct that any Advance shall, at the beginning of any
         Interest Period relating thereto, be divided into (and thereafter,
         save as otherwise provided herein, treated in all respects as) two or
         more Advances in such amounts (in aggregate, equaling the amount of
         the Advance being so divided) as shall be specified by the Borrower in


                                      43
<PAGE>

         such notice, provided that the Borrower shall not be entitled to
         make such a direction if:

         4.8.1      as a result of so doing, there would be more than five
                    outstanding Advances; or

         4.8.2      any Advance thereby coming into existence would be of an
                    amount less than (pound)50,000,000.

5.       MARKET DISRUPTION AND ALTERNATIVE INTEREST RATES

5.1      Market Disruption

         If, in relation to any Advance:

         5.1.1      LIBOR is to be determined by reference to Reference Banks
                    and at or about 11.00 a.m. on the Quotation Date for the
                    relevant Interest Period none or only one of the Reference
                    Banks supplies a rate for the purpose of determining LIBOR
                    for the relevant Interest Period; or

         5.1.2      before the close of business in London on the Quotation
                    Date for such Advance the Agent has been notified by a
                    Bank or each of a group of Banks, to whom in aggregate
                    fifty per cent. or more of such Advance is owed that LIBOR
                    does not accurately reflect the cost of funding its
                    participation in such Advance,

         then the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Banks of such event
         and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
         Clause 5.2 (Substitute Interest Period and Interest Rate) shall apply
         to such Advance.

5.2      Substitute Interest Period and Interest Rate

         If sub-clause 5.1.1 of Clause 5.1 (Market Disruption) applies to an
         Advance, the duration of the relevant Interest Period shall be one
         month or, if less, such that it shall end on the Final Maturity Date.
         If either sub-clause 5.1.1 or 5.1.2 of Clause 5.1 (Market Disruption)
         applies to an Advance, the rate of interest applicable to each Bank's
         portion of such Advance during the relevant Interest Period shall
         (subject to any agreement reached pursuant to Clause 5.3 (Alternative
         Rate)) be the rate per annum which is the sum of:

         5.2.1      the Margin at such time;

         5.2.2      the Mandatory Cost Rate; and

         5.2.3      the rate per annum notified to the Agent by such Bank
                    before the last day of such Interest Period to be that
                    which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to
                    such Bank of funding from whatever sources it may
                    reasonably select its portion of such Advance during such
                    Interest Period.

5.3      Alternative Rate

         If either of those events mentioned in sub-clauses 5.1.1 or 5.1.2 of
         Clause 5.1 (Market Disruption) occurs in relation to an Advance, then
         if the Agent or the Borrower so

                                      44
<PAGE>

         requires, the Agent and the Borrower shall enter into negotiations
         with a view to agreeing a substitute basis (i) for determining the
         rates of interest from time to time applicable to the Advances and/or
         (ii) upon which the Advances may be maintained (whether in sterling
         or some other currency) thereafter and any such substitute basis that
         is agreed shall take effect in accordance with its terms and be
         binding on each party hereto, provided that the Agent may not agree
         any such substitute basis without the prior consent of each Bank
         (which is not to be unreasonably withheld).

6.       NOTIFICATION

6.1      Interest Periods

         Not less than three Business Days before the first day of an Interest
         Period, the Agent shall notify each Bank of the proposed amount of
         the relevant Advance, the proposed length of such Interest Period and
         the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Advance allocated to
         such Bank pursuant to Clause 3.2 (Each Bank's Participation in
         Advances).

6.2      Interest Rate Determination

         The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Banks of each
         determination of LIBOR, the Mandatory Cost Rate and the Margin.

6.3      Changes to Advances or Interest Rates

         The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Banks of any
         change to (a) the proposed length of an Interest Period or (b) any
         interest rate occasioned by the operation of Clause 5 (Market
         Disruption and Alternative Interest Rates).

7.       REPAYMENT AND REDUCTION OF THE FACILITY

7.1      Repayment

         The Borrower shall repay each Advance made to it in full on the Final
         Maturity Date.

8.       PREPAYMENT

8.1      Prepayment of the Facility

         Subject to the provisions of Clause 8.5 (Limitations on Prepayment of
         the Facility) and Clause 23.4 (Break Costs), the Borrower may, by
         giving to the Agent not less than five Business Days prior written
         notice to that effect, prepay the whole or any part of an Advance
         (being a minimum amount of (pound)50,000,000 and an integral multiple
         of (pound)10,000,000).

8.2      Notice of Prepayment

         Any notice of prepayment given by the Borrower pursuant to this
         Clause 8 (Prepayment) shall be irrevocable, shall specify the date
         upon which such prepayment is to be made and the amount of such
         prepayment and shall oblige the Borrower to make such prepayment on
         such date.

8.3      Repayment of a Bank's Share of the Loan

         If:

         8.3.1      any sum payable to any Bank by an Obligor is required to
                    be increased pursuant to Clause 10.1 (Tax Gross-up); or

         8.3.2      any Bank claims indemnification from an Obligor under
                    Clause 10.2 (Tax Indemnity), the Agent claims
                    indemnification from an Obligor under Clause 10.2 (Tax
                    Indemnity) in respect of a payment received by it and paid
                    by it to a Bank under the Finance Documents or any Bank
                    claims indemnification from the Borrower under Clause 12.1
                    (Increased Costs),

         the Borrower may, whilst such circumstance continues, give the Agent
         at least five Business Days prior written notice (which notice shall
         be irrevocable) of its intention to procure the repayment of such
         Bank's share of the Loan. On the last day of each then current
         Interest Period, or at any other time subject to the provisions of
         Clause 23.4 (Break Costs), the Borrower shall repay such Bank's
         portion of the Advance to which such Interest Period relates.

8.4      No Other Repayments

         The Borrower shall not repay all or any part of the Loan except at
         the times and in the manner expressly provided for in this Agreement
         and shall not be entitled to reborrow any amount repaid.

8.5      Limitations on Prepayment of the Facility

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Clause 8
         (Prepayment), the Borrower may not voluntarily prepay all or any part
         of an Advance pursuant to Clause 8.1 (Prepayment of the Facility) at
         any time that the Senior Bank Credit Agreement is in effect, without
         the consent of the Senior Agent under the Senior Bank Credit
         Facility, unless such reduction or prepayment is permitted under
         Clause 22.28 (Working Capital Facility Amendments) of the Senior Bank
         Credit Agreement.

9.       MANDATORY PREPAYMENT

9.1      Mandatory Prepayment from Excess Cash Flow

         The Borrower shall ensure that within 15 Business Days of delivery of
         the most recent financial statements of the UK Group pursuant to
         Clause 16.2 (Quarterly Statements), commencing with the financial
         statements delivered in respect of the Financial Quarter ending 31
         December 2002, the Borrower's determination of the Excess Cash Flow
         Payment Amount (if any) for the Financial Quarter to which such
         quarterly financial statements relate (such determination of the
         Excess Cash Flow Payment Amount to be made by reference to such
         quarterly financial statements and to be set out in sufficient detail
         (including the relevant numbers used in computing each component part
         of "Operating Cash Flow" and "Group Total Debt Service") delivered
         with such quarterly financial statements)) is applied in repayment of
         the Loan in accordance with Clause 9.6 (Application of Proceeds)
         irrespective of whether or not the Reporting Accountants have, prior
         to the end of such 15 Business Day period, verified the Borrower's
         determination of Excess Cash Flow and the actual Excess

                                      46
<PAGE>

         Cash Flow Payment Amount payable hereunder. The percentage of Excess
         Cash Flow in any Financial Quarter applicable for the purposes of
         paragraph (a) of the definition of "Excess Cash Flow Payment Amount"
         shall be determined by reference to the ratio of UK Group
         Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated Annualised EBITDA of the UK
         Group for such Financial Quarter in accordance with the table below:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

         ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Total Debt to Consolidated Annualised             applicable for the purposes of paragraph
              EBITDA for the UK Group                         (a) of Excess Cash Flow Payment Amount

         ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<S>                                                                    <C>
          Greater than or equal to 4.00:1                                  75 per cent.

         ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Less than 4.00:1                                                 50 per cent.

         ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>


         provided that if, pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Clause
         9.1, any amount is applied in repayment of the Loan in accordance
         with Clause 9.6 (Application of Proceeds) prior to verification by
         the Reporting Accountants of the Borrower's determination of Excess
         Cash Flow and the Excess Cash Flow Payment Amount, and the subsequent
         verification thereof by the Reporting Accountants demonstrates that:

         (a)      any additional amounts constituting the Excess Cash Flow
                  Payment Amount for the relevant Financial Quarter should
                  have been applied in repayment of the Loan in order to fully
                  satisfy the Borrower's obligations under this Clause 9.1,
                  the Borrower shall, within 5 Business Days of receipt of
                  notification to such effect from the Agent or from the
                  Reporting Accountants on behalf of the Agent apply such
                  further amount in repayment of the Loan in accordance with
                  Clause 9.6 (Application of Proceeds); or

         (b)      the Excess Cash Flow Payment Amount which should have been
                  applied in repayment of the Loan in order to fully satisfy
                  the Borrower's obligations under this Clause 9.1 for the
                  relevant Financial Quarter (the "Verified Amount") is less
                  than the amount actually applied by the Borrower in
                  repayment of the Loan in respect of such Financial Quarter
                  (the "Applied Amount"), the difference between the Applied
                  Amount and the Verified Amount shall be deducted (but
                  deducted once only) from any future Excess Cash Flow Payment
                  Amount which falls due, pursuant to the foregoing provisions
                  of this Clause 9.1, to be applied in repayment of the Loan
                  in accordance with Clause 9.6 (Application of Proceeds).

9.2      Mandatory Prepayment from Asset Disposals

9.2.1               Subject to sub-clause 9.2.2 and sub-clause 9.2.3 below, at
                    all times prior to the date upon which the Exit Financing
                    is repaid in full, the Borrower shall ensure that (a) the
                    net proceeds of any disposal falling within paragraph (g)
                    (A) of the definition of Permitted Disposals of any asset
                    by any member of

                           Proceeds represent proceeds received from an
                           insurance claim, applied in amelioration of an
                           involuntary loss, damage, destruction or
                           condemnation of assets, towards the replacement,

                    terms of sub-clause 9.2.1 are no more onerous than the
                    mandatory prepayment from asset disposal provisions
                    contained in the documentation for such refinancing

                             such refinancing are less onerous (in the opinion
                             of an Instructing Group, acting reasonably) than
                             those contained in sub-clause 9.2.1, then the
                             provisions of sub-clause 9.2.3 shall apply in
                             substitution of sub-clause 9.2.1;

                             made to sub-clause 9.2.1 and, for the avoidance
                             of doubt, amendments to sub-clause 9.2.1 may be
                             made by the Agent (on behalf of the Banks) with
                             the prior consent of an Instructing Group; and

                             prepayment from asset disposal provisions than
                             those which are, at such time, applicable under
                             this Agreement.

         9.2.3      At all times following the date upon which the Exit
                    Financing or any refinancing of the Exit Financing

                    of the UK Group can show to the satisfaction of the Agent
                    (acting reasonably) that:

                    (a)      such disposal was on arms' length terms and the
                             net disposal proceeds are to be reinvested in
                             similar or like assets of a comparable or

                    the amended definitions and such other information in
                    relation thereto as the Agent may reasonably request.

         in the prepayment escrow account established under the Senior Bank
         Credit Agreement such Insurance Proceeds are deposited in the
         Prepayment Escrow Account. The relevant member of the UK Group shall
         be entitled, during the period of 365 days from its receipt of
         Insurance Proceeds, to withdraw sums from the Prepayment Escrow
         Account only to the extent that it is able to reasonably demonstrate

         and/or repair of the assets and/or the satisfaction of business
         interruption losses in respect of which the relevant insurance claim
         was made (or to refinance any expenditure incurred in the
         replacement, reinstatement and/or repair of such assets). Any sums
         not so withdrawn during such 365 day period shall thereafter be paid

         proviso, an amount equal to the Capital Event Proceeds Amount as then
         determined is applied in repayment of the Loan in accordance with
         Clause 9.6 (Application of Proceeds).

                    Excess Cash Flow) to Clause 9.5 (Mandatory Prepayments
                    from Capital Event Proceeds) shall be applied (subject to
                    the provisions of Clause 23.4 (Break Costs)) in immediate

                                    the directors or other equivalent officers
                                    of New NTL; or

                           (iii)    give directions with respect to the
                                    operating and financial policies of New
                                    NTL which the directors or other
                                    equivalent officers of New NTL are obliged
                                    to comply with; or

                  (b)      the holding of more than one-half of the issued
                           share capital of New NTL (excluding any part of
                           that issued share capital that carries no voting
                           rights or right).

                  "group of connected persons" means, a group of persons who,
                  pursuant to an agreement or understanding (whether formal or
                  informal), actively co-operate, through the acquisition by
                  any of them, either directly or indirectly, of shares in New
                  NTL, to obtain or consolidate control of New NTL.

         9.7.3    This Clause 9.7 (Mandatory Prepayment due to Change in
                  Control) will not apply and the Loan will not become due and
                  payable in the event that any company acquires control of
                  New NTL as part of a solvent reorganisation of the Group on
                  terms approved by the Agent (acting on the instructions of
                  an Instructing Group).

10.      TAXES

10.1     Tax Gross-up

         All payments to be made by an Obligor to any Finance Party under the
         Finance Documents shall be made free and clear of and without
         deduction for or on account of tax unless such Obligor is required by
         law to make such a payment subject to the deduction or withholding of
         tax, in which case the sum payable by such Obligor (in respect of
         which such deduction or withholding is required to be made) shall,
         subject to Clause 10.6 (Excluded Claims), be increased to the extent
         necessary to ensure that such Finance Party receives a sum net of any
         deduction or withholding equal to the sum which it would have
         received had no such deduction or withholding been made or required
         to be made.

10.2     Tax Indemnity

         Without prejudice to Clause 10.1 (Tax Gross-up), if the Agent or (as
         a result of the introduction of, or change in or in the
         interpretation, administration or application of, any law or
         regulation or order or governmental rule or double taxation agreement
         or any published practice or concession of any relevant taxing
         authority after the Restatement Amendment Effective Date hereof) any
         Bank (a) is required to make any payment of or on account of tax on
         or in relation to any sum received or receivable under the Finance
         Documents (including any sum deemed for purposes of tax to be
         received or receivable by such Finance Party whether or not actually
         received or receivable) or (b) has any liability in respect of any
         such payment asserted, imposed, levied or assessed against it, the
         relevant Obligor shall, within five Business Days of demand by the
         Agent, promptly indemnify the Agent or Bank which suffers a loss or
         liability as a result against such payment or liability, together
         with any interest, penalties, costs and expenses payable or incurred
         in connection therewith, provided that this Clause 10.2 shall not
         apply to:

         10.2.1     any tax imposed on and calculated by reference to the net
                    income, profits or gains actually received or receivable
                    by the Agent or such Bank (but, for the avoidance of
                    doubt, not including any sum deemed for purposes of tax to
                    be received or receivable by the Agent or such Bank but
                    not actually receivable) by the jurisdiction in which the
                    Agent or such Bank is incorporated or, if different, the
                    jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which the Agent or such
                    Bank is treated as resident for tax purposes (but
                    excluding any such tax that would not have arisen but for
                    such Agent or Bank, as the case may be, being treated as a
                    resident in a jurisdiction solely by reason of having
                    entered into this Agreement, performed its obligations or
                    received any payment hereunder or enforced its rights
                    hereunder); or

         10.2.2     any tax imposed on and calculated by reference to the net
                    income, profits or gains of the Facility Office of the
                    Agent or such Bank actually received or receivable by the
                    Agent or such Bank (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not
                    including any sum deemed for purposes of tax to be
                    received or receivable by the Agent or such Bank but not
                    actually receivable) by the jurisdiction in which its
                    Facility Office is located; or

         10.2.3     any tax imposed on the Agent, as a result of the failure
                    by a Bank to satisfy on the due date of a payment of
                    interest either of the conditions set out in sub-clauses
                    10.3.1 and 10.3.2 of Clause 10.3 (Banks' Tax Status
                    Confirmation); or

         10.2.4     for the avoidance of doubt, any tax imposed on a Bank
                    which would not have arisen but for the sub-participation
                    of its rights and benefits under any of the Finance
                    Documents.

10.3     Banks' Tax Status Confirmation

         Each Bank confirms in favour of the Agent (on the date hereof or, in
         the case of a Bank which becomes a party hereto pursuant to a
         transfer or assignment, on the date on which the relevant transfer or
         assignment becomes effective) that either:

                                      54
<PAGE>

         10.3.1     it is not resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom
                    and is beneficially entitled to its share of the Loan and
                    the interest thereon; or

         10.3.2     it is a bank as defined for the purposes of Section 349 of
                    ICTA and is beneficially entitled to its share of the Loan
                    and the interest thereon,

         and each Bank shall promptly notify the Agent if there is any change
         in its position from that set out above.

10.4     U.S. Tax Forms

         Each Bank that is not a United States person (as such term is defined
         in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) for U.S. federal
         income tax purposes agrees to deliver to the Borrower and the Agent
         on or prior to the Initial Advance Date, or in the case of a Bank
         that is an assignee or transferee of an interest under this Agreement
         pursuant to Clause 30.3 (Assignment and Transfers by Banks) (unless
         the respective Bank was already a Bank hereunder immediately prior to
         such assignment or transfer), on the date of such assignment or
         transfer to such Bank, (i) two accurate and complete original signed
         copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with
         respect to a complete exemption under an income tax treaty) (or
         successor forms) certifying to such Bank's entitlement as of such
         date to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with
         respect to payments to be made under this Agreement, or (ii) if the
         Bank is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of
         the Code and cannot deliver either Internal Revenue Service Form
         W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete exemption under an
         income tax treaty) pursuant to clause (i) above, (x) a certificate
         substantially in the form of Schedule 8 (any such certificate, a
         "Non-Bank Certificate") and (y) two accurate and complete original
         signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (with respect
         to the portfolio interest exemption) (or successor form) certifying
         to such Bank's entitlement to a complete exemption from United States
         withholding tax with respect to payments of interest to be made under
         this Agreement. In addition, each Bank agrees that from time to time
         after the Initial Advance Date, upon the reasonable request of the
         Borrower or when a change in circumstances of the Bank renders the
         previous certification obsolete or inaccurate in any material
         respect, it will deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two new
         accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue
         Service W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to the benefits of any
         income tax treaty), or Form W-8BEN (with respect to the portfolio
         interest exemption) and a Non-Bank Certificate, as the case may be,
         and such other forms as may be required in order to confirm or
         establish the entitlement as of such date of such Bank to a continued
         exemption from or (as a result of a change in law, treaty, rule,
         regulations, guideline or order, or in the interpretation thereof)
         reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to payments
         under this Agreement, or it shall notify the Borrower and the Agent
         of its inability to deliver any such Form or Certificate, in which
         case such Bank shall not be required to deliver any such Form or
         Certificate pursuant to this Clause 10.4. Notwithstanding anything to
         the contrary contained in Clause 10.1 (Tax Gross-up), but subject to
         Clause 10.5 (Claims by Banks and the Agent) and the immediately
         succeeding sentence, (x) the Borrower shall be entitled, to the
         extent it is required to do so by law, to deduct or withhold income
         or similar taxes imposed by the United States (or any political
         subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from interest,
         fees or other amounts payable hereunder for the account of any Bank
         which is not a United States person (as such term is

                                      55
<PAGE>

         defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. federal income
         tax purposes to the extent that such Bank has not provided to the
         Borrower U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms that establish a
         complete exemption from such deduction or withholding and (y) the
         Borrower shall not be obligated pursuant to Clause 10.1 to gross-up
         payments to be made to a Bank in respect of income or similar taxes
         imposed by the United States if (I) such Bank has not provided to the
         Borrower the Internal Revenue Service Forms required to be provided
         to the Borrower pursuant to this Clause 10.4 or (II) in the case of a
         payment, other than interest that is treated as interest for U.S.
         federal income tax purposes, to a Bank described in clause (ii)
         above, to the extent that such Forms do not establish a complete
         exemption from withholding of such taxes. Notwithstanding anything to
         the contrary contained in the preceding sentence or elsewhere in this
         Clause 10.4, the Borrower agrees to pay any additional amounts and to
         indemnify each Bank in the manner set forth in Clause 10.1 (Tax
         Gross-up) in respect of any United States taxes deducted or withheld
         by it as described in the immediately preceding sentence as a result
         of any changes that are effective after the Initial Advance Date in
         any applicable law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline
         or order, or in the interpretation thereof, relating to the deducting
         or withholding of such taxes.

10.5     Claims by Banks and the Agent

         A Bank intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 10.2 (Tax
         Indemnity) shall notify the Agent of the event giving rise to the
         claim, whereupon the Agent shall notify the Borrower thereof. If the
         Agent intends to make a claim pursuant to Clause 10.2 (Tax Indemnity)
         it shall notify the Borrower of the event giving rise to the claim.

10.6     Excluded Claims

         If any Finance Party is not or ceases to be a Qualifying Lender, no
         Obligor shall be liable to pay to that Finance Party under Clause
         10.1 (Tax Gross-Up) any amount in respect of taxes levied or imposed
         by the United Kingdom in excess of the amount it would have been
         obliged to pay if that Finance Party had been or had not ceased to be
         a Qualifying Lender provided that this Clause 10.6 shall not apply
         (and each Obligor shall be obliged to comply with its obligations
         under Clause 10.1 (Tax Gross-Up)) if:

         10.6.1     after the Execution Date, there shall have been any
                    introduction of, or change in or in the interpretation,
                    administration or application of, any law or regulation or
                    order or governmental rule or double taxation agreement or
                    any published practice or concession of any relevant
                    taxing authority and as a result thereof such Finance
                    Party ceases to be a Qualifying Lender; or

         10.6.2     such Finance Party is not or ceases to be a Qualifying
                    Lender as a result of the actions of any Obligor.

10.7     Treaty Lenders

         A Treaty Lender and each Obligor which makes a payment to which that
         Treaty Lender is entitled shall co-operate in completing any
         procedural formalities necessary for that Obligor to obtain
         authorisation to make that payment without a deduction or withholding
         for or on account of tax imposed by the United Kingdom. If an Obligor
         is able to demonstrate that a deduction or withholding for or on
         account of tax imposed by the United Kingdom is required to be made
         by it as a result of a Treaty

                                      56
<PAGE>

         Lender's failure to so co-operate, such an Obligor shall not be
         liable to pay any increased amount under Clause 10.1 (Tax Gross-Up)
         as a result of such a deduction or withholding.

10.8     Notification of Status

         Each Bank shall notify the Agent if it is not a Qualifying Lender at
         the time it becomes a Bank hereunder and shall promptly notify the
         Agent if at any time thereafter it ceases to be a Qualifying Lender.
         The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of any notices it
         receives under this Clause 10.8.

11.      TAX RECEIPTS

11.1     Notification of Requirement to Deduct Tax

         If, at any time, an Obligor is required by law to make any deduction
         or withholding from any sum payable by it under the Finance Documents
         (or if thereafter there is any change in the rates at which or the
         manner in which such deductions or withholdings are calculated), such
         Obligor and the Bank to which such sum is payable shall promptly upon
         becoming aware of such a requirement notify the Agent accordingly. If
         the Agent receives such a notification from a Bank it shall promptly
         notify the Borrower and the Obligor who is required to make such a
         deduction or withholding.

11.2     Evidence of Payment of Tax

         If an Obligor makes any payment under the Finance Documents in
         respect of which it is required to make any deduction or withholding,
         it shall pay the full amount required to be deducted or withheld to
         the relevant taxation or other authority within the time allowed for
         such payment under applicable law and shall request and, within
         thirty days of it receiving the same, deliver to the Agent for each
         Bank an original receipt (or a certified copy thereof) issued by such
         authority evidencing the payment to such authority of all amounts so
         required to be deducted or withheld in respect of that Bank's share
         of such payment.

11.3     Tax Credit Payment

         If an additional payment is made under Clause 10 (Taxes) by an
         Obligor or the Borrower for the benefit of any Finance Party and such
         Finance Party, in its sole discretion, determines that it has
         obtained (and has derived full use and benefit from) a credit
         against, a relief or remission for, or repayment of, any tax, then,
         if and to the extent that such Finance Party, in its sole opinion,
         determines that such credit, relief, remission or repayment is in
         respect of or calculated with reference to or otherwise relates to
         the additional payment made pursuant to Clause 10 (Taxes), such
         Finance Party shall, to the extent that it can do so without
         prejudice to the retention of the amount of such credit, relief,
         remission or repayment, pay to such Obligor or, as the case may be,
         the Borrower such amount as such Finance Party shall, in its sole
         opinion, determine to be the amount which will leave such Finance
         Party (after such payment) in no worse after-tax position than it
         would have been in had the additional payment in question not been
         required to be made by such Obligor or the Borrower.

                                      57
<PAGE>

11.4     Tax Credit Clawback

         If any Finance Party makes any payment to an Obligor or the Borrower
         pursuant to Clause 11.3 (Tax Credit Payment) and such Finance Party
         subsequently determines, in its sole opinion, that the credit,
         relief, remission or repayment in respect of which such payment was
         made was not available or has been withdrawn or that it was unable to
         use such credit, relief, remission or repayment in full, such Obligor
         or the Borrower shall reimburse such Finance Party such amount as
         such Finance Party determines, in its sole opinion, is necessary to
         place it in the same after-tax position as it would have been in if
         such credit, relief, remission or repayment had been obtained and
         fully used and retained by such Finance Party.

11.5     Tax and Other Affairs

         Subject to Clause 10.7 (Treaty Lenders), no provision of this
         Agreement shall interfere with the right of any Finance Party to
         arrange its tax or any other affairs in whatever manner it thinks
         fit, oblige any Finance Party to claim any credit, relief, remission
         or repayment in respect of any payment under Clause 10 (Taxes) in
         priority to any other credit, relief, remission or repayment
         available to it nor oblige any Finance Party to disclose any
         information relating to its tax or other affairs or any computations
         in respect thereof.

12.      INCREASED COSTS

12.1     Increased Costs

         If, by reason of the occurrence, in each case after the Execution
         Date, of (a) any change in law or in its interpretation or
         administration and/or (b) compliance with any such new law or with
         any request or requirement relating to the maintenance of capital or
         any other request from or requirement of any central bank or other
         fiscal, monetary or other authority (in each case, where a request or
         requirement that does not have the force of law is a request or
         requirement with which financial institutions subject to such request
         or requirement are generally accustomed to comply):

         12.1.1     a Bank or any holding company of such Bank is unable to
                    obtain the rate of return on its capital which it would
                    have been able to obtain but for such Bank's entering into
                    or assuming or maintaining a commitment or performing its
                    obligations under the Finance Documents;

         12.1.2     a Bank or any holding company of such Bank incurs a cost
                    as a result of such Bank's entering into or assuming or
                    maintaining a commitment or performing its obligations
                    under the Finance Documents; or

         12.1.3     there is any increase in the cost to a Bank or any holding
                    company of such Bank of funding or maintaining such Bank's
                    share of the Advances or any Unpaid Sum,

         then the Borrower shall, within three Business Days of a demand of
         the Agent, pay to the Agent for the account of that Bank amounts
         sufficient to indemnify that Bank or to enable that Bank to indemnify
         its holding company from and against, as the case may be, (i) such
         reduction in the rate of return of capital, (ii) such cost or (iii)
         such increased cost.

                                      58
<PAGE>

12.2     Increased Costs Claims

         A Bank intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 12.1 (Increased
         Costs) shall notify the Agent of the event giving rise to such claim,
         whereupon the Agent shall notify the Borrower thereof.

12.3     Exclusions

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Clause 12 (Increased
         Costs), no Bank shall be entitled to make any claim under this Clause

         return on capital, cost or increased cost:

         12.3.1     attributable to a deduction or withholding for or on

                    required by law to be made by an Obligor and compensated

                    10.1 (Tax Gross-Up) but was not so compensated solely

         12.3.2     compensated by Clause 10.2 (Tax Indemnity) (or would have
                    been compensated for under Clause 10.2 (Tax Indemnity) but

                    Party or its affiliates of any law or regulation.

13.      ILLEGALITY

         If, at any time, it is or will become unlawful for a Bank to make,
         fund or allow to remain outstanding all or part of its share of the
         Advances, then that Bank shall, promptly after becoming aware of the
         same, deliver to the Borrower through the Agent a notice to that
         effect and if the Agent on behalf of such Bank so requires, the
         Borrower shall no later than the last day permitted by law repay such
         Bank's share of any outstanding Advances together with accrued
         interest thereon and all other amounts owing to such Bank under the
         Finance Documents.

14.      MITIGATION

         If, in respect of any Bank, circumstances arise which would or would
         upon the giving of notice result in:

         14.1.1     an increase in any sum payable to it or for its account
                    pursuant to Clause 10.1 (Tax Gross-up);

         14.1.2     a claim for indemnification pursuant to Clause 10.2 (Tax
                    Indemnity) or Clause 12.1 (Increased Costs); or

                    (Illegality),

                                      59

         then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying
         the rights of such Bank or the obligations of the Obligors under any
         of the Clauses referred to above, such Bank shall promptly upon
         becoming aware of such circumstances notify the Agent thereof and, in
         consultation with the Agent and the Borrower and to the extent that
         it can do so lawfully, take reasonable steps (including a change of
         location of its Facility Office or the transfer of its rights,
         benefits and obligations under the Finance Documents to another
         financial institution acceptable to the Borrower and willing to
         participate in the Facility) to mitigate the effects of such
         circumstances, provided that such Bank shall be under no obligation
         to take any such action if, in the opinion of such Bank, to do so
         might have any adverse effect upon its business, operations or
         financial condition (other than any minor costs and expenses of an
         administrative nature).

                    in the latest Budget delivered under Clause 16.6

                  Encumbrance;

         18.30.6  customary non assignment provisions in leases entered into
                  in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
                  practice; and

                  with respect to the rights conferred by those documents to
                  the extent that any such non-assignment provision does not
                  constitute a restriction on the ability of any member of the
                  UK Group to pay dividends, make loans or repay or prepay
                  loans made by the Borrower or any member of the UK Group.

         The Borrower shall procure that notwithstanding anything to the
         contrary set forth in this Agreement all investments by the Borrower
         in the UK Group will be in the form of loans (except that to the
         extent that the Borrower determines in good faith that it is tax
         efficient to make such investments in the form of equity or capital
         contribution, and the outstanding principal amount of inter-company
         loans made by the Borrower is at no time less than

         action by directors or shareholders without a meeting and the
         maintenance of corporate offices and records; and (y) will not take
         any action, or conduct its affairs in a manner, which could result in
         the corporate existence of any such person being ignored, or in the

         consolidated with those of any other such person in a bankruptcy,
         reorganization or other insolvency proceeding.

18.33    Cancellation of Subordinated Debt

         The Parent shall not cancel, write-off or otherwise forgive all or
         any part of any loans made to the Intermediate Parent (being
         Subordinated Debt), without the prior written consent of the Agent,
         if such cancellation, write-off or other forgiveness might reasonably
         be expected to give rise to material tax liabilities for the UK Group
         taken as a whole, which cannot be sheltered by the net operating
         losses of the Group available at the time of such cancellation, write
         off or forgiveness.

         18.34.1. The Borrower undertakes to instruct Sullivan & Cromwell LLC

                  a sample of the UK Group's internal controls including,
                  without limitation, the internal controls relating to the

                  relation to the Profectus Contracts (as defined in S&C's
                  written report dated 18 December 2002 which has been
                  delivered to the Agent) and the Group's information
                  technology services contracts with IBM) and to prepare a
                  written report within 3 months of the execution of the
                  engagement letters with S&C and D&T (or such longer period
                  as may reasonably required in order to complete the relevant
                  investigation). The division of the work between S&C and D&T
                  will reflect their respective expertise. S&C and D&T shall
                  be instructed to detail in the written report the results of
                  such investigation and to recommend any steps to be taken to
                  remedy any material deficiencies in internal controls
                  identified. S&C and D&T shall be instructed by the Borrower
                  to include the Banks as addressees of the written report but
                  only on the basis that neither S&C nor D&T shall have any
                  liability to any of the Banks. The Borrower shall pay all
                  reasonable fees and expenses incurred by S&C and D&T in
                  making such investigation and preparing such written report.
                  The Borrower shall provide S&C and D&T with such access to
                  the books and records and personnel of the Group as may
                  reasonably be required for the purposes of such
                  investigation and written report. S&C and D&T shall be
                  entitled to instruct such third party experts as they may
                  reasonably require to assist them in the investigation and
                  preparation of the written report.

         18.34.2. If the written report referred to at sub-clause 18.34.1 of
                  this Clause 18.34 recommends any proposals to be taken by
                  the UK Group to remedy any material deficiencies in internal
                  controls relating to outsourcing arrangements, the Borrower
                  agrees, after consultation with the Agent, S&C and D&T, to
                  adopt such proposals as are considered reasonably
                  commercially practicable as soon as reasonably practicable
                  after the conclusion of such consultation provided that the
                  adoption of such proposals are subject to final approval by
                  the board of directors of New NTL acting reasonably in its
                  exercise of its fiduciary duties.


         18.34.3. If the written report referred to at sub-clause 18.34.1 of
                  this Clause 18.34 recommends any proposals to be taken by
                  the UK Group to remedy any material deficiencies in internal
                  controls relating to non-outsourcing arrangements, the
                  Borrower agrees to consider such proposals as soon as
                  reasonably practicable after publication of the report,
                  subject to approval of such proposals by the board of
                  directors of New NTL.

         Adverse Change) describes circumstances which constitute an Event of
         Default for the purposes of this Agreement. Clause 19.16
         (Acceleration and Cancellation) and Clause 19.17 (Advances Due on
         Demand) deal with the rights of the Agent and the Banks after the
         occurrence of an Event of Default.

                  the Finance Documents; or

         20.4.7   any other act, event or omission which, but for this Clause
                  20.4, might operate to discharge, impair or otherwise affect

                  the Finance Parties by the Finance Documents or by law.

20.5     Settlement Conditional

         Any settlement or discharge between a Guarantor and any of the
         Finance Parties shall be conditional upon no security or payment to

         Obligor being avoided or reduced by virtue of any laws relating to
         bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or similar laws of general
         application and, if any such security or payment is so avoided or
         reduced, each Finance Party shall be entitled to recover the value or
         amount of such security or payment from such Guarantor subsequently
         as if such settlement or discharge had not occurred.

20.6     Exercise of Rights

         No Finance Party shall be obliged before exercising any of the

         performance by it of its obligations under the Finance Documents:

         20.7.1   to be indemnified by an Obligor; and/or

                                     102

         20.7.3   to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way
                  of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance

                  amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and
                  order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or
                  otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit
                  of the same; and

         20.8.2   hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys
                  received from any Guarantor or on account of any Guarantor's

         sum due and payable by an Obligor under any judgment of any court in
         connection herewith is not paid on the date of such judgment, the
         period beginning on such due date or, as the case may be, the date of
         such judgment and ending on the date upon which the obligation of
         such Obligor to pay such sum is discharged shall be divided into
         successive periods, each of which (other than the first) shall start
         on the last day of the preceding such period and the duration of each
         of which shall (except as otherwise provided in this Clause 23
         (Default Interest and Break Costs)) be selected by the Agent.

         An Unpaid Sum shall bear interest during each Interest Period in
         respect thereof at the rate per annum which is one per cent. per
         annum above the percentage rate which would apply if such Unpaid Sum
         had been an Advance in the amount and currency of such Unpaid Sum and
         for the same Interest Period, provided that if such Unpaid Sum
         relates to an Advance which became due and payable on a day other
         than the last day of an Interest Period relating thereto:

                                     104
<PAGE>

         23.2.1   the first Interest Period applicable to such Unpaid Sum

                  to time during such period shall be that which exceeds by

                  it had it not so fallen due.

23.3     Payment of Default Interest

         Any interest which shall have accrued under Clause 23.2 (Default

         If any Bank or the Agent on its behalf receives or recovers all or
         any part of such Bank's share of an Advance or Unpaid Sum otherwise
         than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, the
         Borrower shall pay to the Agent on demand for account of such Bank an
         amount equal to the amount (if any) by which (a) the additional
         interest which would have been payable on the amount so received or
         recovered had it been received or recovered on the last day of that
         Interest Period exceeds (b) the amount of interest which in the
         opinion of the Agent would have been payable to the Agent on the last
         day of that Interest Period in respect of a deposit in the currency
         of the amount so received or recovered equal to the amount so
         received or recovered placed by it with a prime bank in London for a
         period starting on the Business Day following the date of such
         receipt or recovery and ending on the last day of that Interest
         Period.

                  the occurrence of any Event of Default or any default by any
                  Obligor in the performance of any of the obligations
                  expressed to be assumed by it in the Finance Documents;

                  (Indemnification); and

                  a result of its funding or making arrangements to fund its
                  portion of an Advance requested by the Borrower but not made
                  by reason of the operation of any one or more of the

                          (ii)     secondly, in or towards payment on the same
                                   day to the account of the Borrower with
                                   such bank in London as the Borrower shall
                                   have previously notified to the Agent for
                                   this purpose; and

                  (b)     in the case of any other payment, be made available
                          by the Agent to the person entitled to receive such
                          payment in accordance with this Agreement (in the
                          case of a Bank, for the account of its Facility
                          Office) for value the same day by transfer to such
                          account of such person with such bank in London as
                          such person shall have previously notified to the
                          Agent.

26.3.2              A payment will be deemed to have been made by the Agent on
                    the date on which it is required to be made under this
                    Agreement if the Agent has, on or before that date, taken
                    steps to make that payment in accordance with the
                    regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or
                    settlement system used by the Agent in order to make the
                    payment.

26.4     No Set-off

         All payments required to be made by an Obligor hereunder shall be
         calculated without reference to any set-off or counterclaim and shall
         be made free and clear of and without any deduction for or on account
         of any set-off or counterclaim.

26.5     Clawback

         Where a sum is to be paid hereunder to the Agent for account of
         another person, the Agent shall not be obliged to make the same
         available to that other person until it has been able to establish to
         its satisfaction that it has actually received such sum, but if it
         does so and it proves to be the case that it had not actually
         received such sum, then the person to whom such sum was so made
         available shall on request refund the same to the Agent together with
         an amount sufficient to indemnify the Agent against any cost or loss
         it may have suffered or incurred by reason of its having paid out
         such sum prior to its having received such sum.

26.6     Partial Payments

         If and whenever a payment is made by an Obligor hereunder and the
         Agent receives an amount less than the due amount of such payment the
         Agent may apply the amount received towards the obligations of the
         Obligors under this Agreement in the following order:

         26.6.1   first, in or towards payment of any unpaid costs and
                  expenses of the Agent;

                                     107
<PAGE>

         26.6.2   secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of any accrued
                  interest or commitment commission due but unpaid;

         26.6.3   thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any principal due
                  but unpaid; and

         26.6.4   fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other sum
                  due but unpaid.

26.7     Variation of Partial Payments

         The order of partial payments set out in Clause 26.6 (Partial
         Payments) shall override any appropriation made by the Obligor to
         which the partial payment relates but the order set out in
         sub-clauses 26.6.2, 26.6.3 and 26.6.4 of Clause 26.6 (Partial
         Payments) may be varied if agreed by all the Banks.

26.8     Business Days

         26.8.1   Any payment which is due to be made on a day that is not a
                  Business Day shall be made on the next Business Day in the
                  same calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding
                  Business Day (if there is not).

         26.8.2   During any extension of the due date for payment of any
                  principal or an Unpaid Sum under this Agreement interest
                  is payable on the principal at the rate payable on the
                  original due date.

27.      SET-OFF

27.1     Contractual Set-off

         Each Obligor authorises each Bank, at any time any sum is due and
         payable hereunder and remains unpaid, to apply any credit balance to
         which such Obligor is entitled on any account of such Obligor with
         such Bank in satisfaction of any sum due and payable from such
         Obligor to such Bank under the Finance Documents but unpaid. For this
         purpose, each Bank is authorised to purchase with the moneys standing
         to the credit of any such account such other currencies as may be
         necessary to effect such application.

27.2     Set-off not Mandatory

         No Bank shall be obliged to exercise any right given to it by Clause
         27.1 (Contractual Set-off).

28.      SHARING

28.1     Payments to Banks

         If a Bank (a "Recovering Bank") applies any receipt or recovery from
         an Obligor to a payment due under this Agreement and such amount is
         received or recovered other than in accordance with Clause 26
         (Payments), then such Recovering Bank shall:

         28.1.1   notify the Agent of such receipt or recovery; and

         28.1.2   at the request of the Agent, promptly pay to the Agent an
                  amount (the "Sharing Payment") equal to such receipt or
                  recovery less any amount

                                     108
<PAGE>

                  which the Agent determines may be retained by such
                  Recovering Bank as its share of any payment to be made in
                  accordance with Clause 26.6 (Partial Payments).

28.2     Redistribution of Payments

         The Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by
         the relevant Obligor and distribute it between the Finance Parties
         (other than the Recovering Bank) in accordance with Clause 26.6
         (Partial Payments).

28.3     Recovering Bank's Rights

         The Recovering Bank will be subrogated into the rights of the parties
         which have shared in a redistribution pursuant to Clause 28.2
         (Redistribution of Payments) in respect of the Sharing Payment (and
         the relevant Obligor shall be liable to the Recovering Bank in an
         amount equal to the Sharing Payment).

28.4     Repayable Recoveries

         If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a
         Recovering Bank becomes repayable and is repaid by such Recovering
         Bank, then:

         28.4.1   each party which has received a share of such Sharing
                  Payment pursuant to Clause 28.2 (Redistribution of Payments)
                  shall, upon request of the Agent, pay to the Agent for
                  account of such Recovering Bank an amount equal to its share
                  of such Sharing Payment; and

         28.4.2   such Recovering Bank's rights of subrogation in respect of
                  any reimbursement shall be cancelled and the relevant
                  Obligor will be liable to the reimbursing party for the
                  amount so reimbursed.

28.5     Exception

         This Clause 28 (Sharing) shall not apply if the Recovering Bank would
         not, after making any payment pursuant hereto, have a valid and
         enforceable claim against the relevant Obligor.

28.6     Recoveries Through Legal Proceedings

         If any Bank intends to commence any action in any court it shall give
         prior notice to the Agent and the other Banks. If any Bank shall
         commence any action in any court to enforce its rights hereunder and,
         as a result thereof or in connection therewith, receives any amount,
         then such Bank shall not be required to share any portion of such
         amount with any Bank which has the legal right to, but does not, join
         in such action or commence and diligently prosecute a separate action
         to enforce its rights in another court.

29.      THE AGENT, THE ARRANGERS AND THE BANKS

29.1     Appointment of the Agent

         Each of the Arrangers and the Banks hereby appoints the Agent to act
         as its agent in connection herewith and authorises the Agent to
         exercise such rights, powers,

                                     109
<PAGE>

         Agent by the terms hereof together with all such rights, powers,
         authorities and discretions as are reasonably incidental thereto.

29.2     Agent's Discretions

         The Agent may:

         29.2.1   assume, unless it has, in its capacity as agent for the
                  Banks, received notice to the contrary from any other party
                  hereto, that (a) any representation made or deemed to be
                  made by an Obligor in connection with the Finance Documents
                  is true, (b) no Event of Default or Potential Event of
                  Default has occurred, (c) any Obligor is in breach of or
                  default under its obligations under the Finance Documents
                  and (d) any right, power, authority or discretion vested
                  herein upon an Instructing Group, the Banks or any other
                  person or group of persons has not been exercised;

         29.2.2   assume that (a) the Facility Office of each Bank is that
                  notified to it by such Bank in writing and (b) the
                  information provided by each Bank pursuant to Clause 29.15
                  (Banks' Mandatory Cost Details), Clause 34 (Notices) and
                  Schedule 7 (Mandatory Costs) is true and correct in all
                  respect until it has received from such Bank notice of a
                  change to the Facility Office or any such information and
                  act upon any such notice until the same is superseded by a
                  further notice;

         29.2.3   engage and pay for the advice or services of any lawyers,
                  accountants, surveyors or other experts whose advice or
                  services may to it seem necessary, expedient or desirable
                  and rely upon any advice so obtained;

         29.2.4   rely as to any matters of fact which might reasonably be
                  expected to be within the knowledge of an Obligor upon a
                  certificate signed by or on behalf of such Obligor;

         29.2.5   rely upon any communication or document believed by it to be
                  genuine;

         29.2.6   refrain from exercising any right, power or discretion
                  vested in it as agent hereunder unless and until instructed
                  by an Instructing Group as to whether or not such right,
                  power or discretion is to be exercised and, if it is to be
                  exercised, as to the manner in which it should be exercised;

         29.2.7   refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions of
                  an Instructing Group to begin any legal action or proceeding
                  arising out of or in connection with the Finance Documents
                  until it shall have received such security as it may require
                  (whether by way of payment in advance or otherwise) for all
                  costs, claims, losses, expenses (including legal fees) and
                  liabilities together with any VAT thereon which it will or
                  may expend or incur in complying with such instructions.

         29.2.8   assume (unless it has specific notice to the contrary) that
                  any notice or request made by the Borrower is made on behalf
                  of all the Obligors.

                                     110

29.3     Agent's Obligations

         The Agent shall:

         29.3.1   promptly inform each Bank of the contents of any written
                  notice or document received by it in its capacity as Agent
                  from an Obligor under the Finance Documents;

         29.3.2   promptly notify each Bank of the occurrence of any Event of
                  Default or any default by an Obligor in the due performance
                  of or compliance with its obligations under the Finance
                  Documents of which the Agent has notice from any other party
                  hereto;

         29.3.3   promptly notify each Bank of the occurrence of an Event of
                  Default under Clause 19.1 (Failure to Pay);

         29.3.4   promptly notify each Bank of all or any part of the Advances
                  being declared to be immediately due and payable in
                  accordance with either Clause 19.16 (Acceleration and
                  Cancellation) or Clause 19.17 (Advances Due on Demand);

         29.3.5   save as otherwise provided herein, act as agent hereunder in
                  accordance with any instructions given to it by an
                  Instructing Group, which instructions shall be binding on
                  the Arrangers and the Banks;

         29.3.6   if so instructed by an Instructing Group, refrain from
                  exercising any right, power or discretion vested in it as
                  agent hereunder; and

         29.3.7   unless it has a Bank's consent, refrain from acting on
                  behalf of that Bank in any legal or arbitration proceedings
                  relating to any Finance Document.

         The Agent's duties under the Finance Documents are solely mechanical
         and administrative in nature.

29.4     Excluded Obligations

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary expressed or implied herein,
         neither the Agent nor an Arranger shall:

         29.4.1   be bound to enquire as to (a) whether or not any
                  representation made or deemed to be made by an Obligor in
                  connection with the Finance Documents is true, (b) the
                  occurrence or otherwise of any Event of Default or Potential
                  Event of Default, (c) the performance by an Obligor of its
                  obligations under the Finance Documents or (d) any breach of
                  or default by an Obligor of or under its obligations under
                  the Finance Documents;

         29.4.2   be bound to account to any Bank for any sum or the profit
                  element of any sum received by it for its own account;

         29.4.3   be bound to disclose to any other person any information
                  relating to any member of the Group if (a) such information
                  is confidential or (b) such disclosure would or might in its
                  reasonable opinion constitute a breach of any law or a
                  breach of fiduciary duty;

                                     111
<PAGE>

         29.4.4   be under any obligations other than those for which express
                  provision is made herein; or

         29.4.5   be or be deemed to be a fiduciary for any other party
                  hereto.

29.5     Delegation

         The Agent may delegate, transfer or assign to any of its holding
         companies, subsidiaries or subsidiaries of any of its holding
         companies all or any of the rights, powers, authorities and
         discretions vested in it under the Finance Documents and the
         performance of its duties in accordance therewith, and such
         delegation, transfer or assignment may be made upon such terms and
         subject to such conditions (including the power to sub-delegate) and
         subject to such regulations as the Agent may think fit (and the term
         "Agent" as used in this Agreement shall include any such delegate).

29.6     Indemnification

         Each Bank shall, in its Proportion, from time to time on demand by
         the Agent, indemnify the Agent against any and all costs, claims,
         losses, expenses (including legal fees) and liabilities together with
         any VAT thereon which the Agent may incur, otherwise than by reason
         of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct, in acting in its
         capacity as agent under the Finance Documents (other than any which
         have been reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Clause 24.1
         (Borrowers' Indemnity)).

29.7     Exclusion of Liabilities

         Each Bank confirms that it has read the Notice to Recipients in the
         Information Memorandum, that it has complied with the Recipients'
         Obligations (as set out in the Notice to Recipients) and,
         accordingly, that it enters into this Agreement on the basis of the
         Notice to Recipients. In particular, each of the Banks accepts that
         it is entering into this Agreement in reliance only on the
         representations of the Obligors in this Agreement and on its own
         investigations, that it has not relied on the Arrangers and that,
         except as set out below, it neither has nor will have any claims
         against the Arrangers arising from or in connection with this
         Agreement. Similarly, each of the Banks accepts that the Notice to
         Recipients in the Information Memorandum is applicable also to the
         Agent as if the Agent had been named in addition to the Arrangers in
         the Important Notice.

         Except in the case of gross negligence or wilful default, neither the
         Agent nor any Arranger accepts any responsibility to any of the
         Banks:

         29.7.1   for the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the
                  Information Memorandum or any other information supplied by
                  the Agent or the Arrangers, by an Obligor or by any other
                  person in connection with the Finance Documents or any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                  executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection
                  with the Finance Documents;

         29.7.2   for the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or
                  enforceability of the Finance Documents or any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                  executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection
                  with the Finance Documents; or

                                     112
<PAGE>

         29.7.3   for the exercise of, or the failure to exercise, any
                  judgement, discretion or power given to any of them by or in
                  connection with the Finance Documents or any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                  executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection
                  with the Finance Documents.

         Accordingly, neither the Agent nor an Arranger shall be under any
         liability (whether in negligence or otherwise) in respect of such
         matters, save in the case of gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

29.8     No Actions

         Each of the Banks agrees that it will not assert or seek to assert
         against any director, officer or employee of the Agent or the
         Arrangers any claim it might have against any of them in respect of
         the matters referred to in Clause 29.7 (Exclusion of Liabilities).

29.9     Business with the Group

         The Agent and the Arrangers may accept deposits from, lend money to
         and generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with
         any member of the Group whether or not it may or does lead to a
         conflict with the interests of any of the Banks. Similarly, the Agent
         or the Arrangers may undertake business with or for others even
         though it may lead to a conflict with the interests of any of the
         Banks.

29.10    Resignation

         The Agent may resign its appointment hereunder at any time without
         assigning any reason therefor by giving not less than thirty days'
         prior notice to that effect to each of the other parties hereto,
         provided that no such resignation shall be effective until a
         successor for the Agent is appointed in accordance with the
         succeeding provisions of this Clause 29 (The Agent, the Arrangers and
         the Banks).

29.11    Removal of Agent

         An Instructing Group may, after consultation with the Borrower,
         remove the Agent from its role as agent under the Finance Documents
         by giving notice to that effect to each of the other parties hereto.
         Such removal shall take effect only when a successor to the Agent is
         appointed in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents.

29.12    Successor Agent

         If the Agent gives notice of its resignation pursuant to Clause 29.10
         (Resignation) or it is removed pursuant to Clause 29.11 (Removal of
         Agent), then any reputable and experienced bank or other financial
         institution may, with the prior consent of the Borrower be appointed
         as a successor to the Agent by an Instructing Group during the period
         of such notice but, if no such successor is so appointed, the Agent
         may appoint such a successor itself.

29.13    Rights and Obligations

         If a successor to the Agent is appointed under the provisions of
         Clause 29.12 (Successor Agent), then (a) the retiring or departing
         Agent shall be discharged from

                                     113
<PAGE>


         any further obligation under the Finance Documents but shall remain
         entitled to the benefit of the provisions of this Clause 29 (The
         Agent, the Arrangers and the Banks) and (b) its successor and each of
         the other parties hereto shall have the same rights and obligations
         amongst themselves as they would have had if such successor had been
         a party hereto.

29.14    Own Responsibility

         It is understood and agreed by each Bank that at all times it has
         itself been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making
         its own independent appraisal of and investigation into all risks
         arising under or in connection with the Finance Documents including,
         but not limited to:

         29.14.1  the financial condition, creditworthiness, condition,
                  affairs, status and nature of each member of the Group;

         29.14.2  the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy and
                  enforceability of the Finance Documents and any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                  executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection
                  with the Finance Documents;

         29.14.3  whether such Bank has recourse, and the nature and extent of
                  that recourse, against an Obligor or any other person or any
                  of their respective assets under or in connection with the
                  Finance Documents, the transactions therein contemplated or
                  any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into,
                  made or executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in
                  connection with the Finance Documents; and

         29.14.4  the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the
                  Information Memorandum and any other information provided by
                  the Agent or the Arrangers or an Obligor or by any other
                  person in connection with the Finance Documents, the
                  transactions contemplated therein or any other agreement,
                  arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in
                  anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with the
                  Finance Documents.

         Accordingly, each Bank acknowledges to the Agent and the Arrangers
         that it has not relied on and will not hereafter rely on the Agent
         and the Arrangers or any of them in respect of any of these matters.

29.15    Banks' Mandatory Cost Details

         Each Bank will supply the Agent with such information and in such
         detail as the Agent may require in order to calculate the Mandatory
         Cost Rate in accordance with Schedule 7 (Mandatory Costs).

29.16    Receipt of Information by the Agent

         Any information or document received by the Agent shall only be
         treated as having been received by the Agent if the same has been
         delivered to the Agent's agency department in accordance with Clause
         34 (Notices). Accordingly, any information or documents received by
         the Agent other than by its agency department in accordance with
         Clause 34 (Notices) is not by reason of that receipt to be treated as
         having been


                                     114
<PAGE>

         received by the Agent unless and until the Agent's agency
         department has received actual notice of the same in accordance with
         such Clause. Save as expressly set out in this Agreement and, unless
         the Agent's agency department shall have received information or
         documents in accordance with Clause 34 (Notices) the Agent shall have
         no duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to
         disclose, any information or documents, that are communicated to or
         obtained by the Agent.

30.      ASSIGNMENTS AND TRANSFERS

30.1     Binding Agreement

         The Finance Documents shall be binding upon and enure to the benefit
         of each party hereto and its or any subsequent successors and
         Transferees.

30.2     No Assignments and Transfers by Obligors

         No Obligor shall be entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its
         rights, benefits and obligations under the Finance Documents, other
         than as permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

30.3     Assignment and Transfers by Banks

         30.3.1   Any Bank may, at any time, assign all or any of its rights
                  and benefits hereunder or transfer in accordance with Clause
                  30.5 (Transfers by Banks) all or any of its rights, benefits
                  and obligations hereunder to, or enter into any form of
                  sub-participation agreement with, a bank or financial
                  institution, provided that such Bank procures that the
                  assignee or Transferee executes and delivers to the Agent an
                  Intercreditor Accession Deed in the form attached to the
                  Intercreditor Agreement.

         30.3.2   The prior written consent of the Borrower (which shall be
                  deemed to be given on its own behalf and on behalf of the
                  other Obligors) is required for an assignment or transfer by
                  a Bank unless the assignment or transfer is to:

                  (a)     another Bank; or

                  (b)     any subsidiary or holding company (or to any
                          subsidiary of any holding company) of the
                          transferring Bank.

         30.3.3   The Borrower's consent must not be (a) unreasonably delayed
                  or withheld or (b) withheld solely because the assignment or
                  transfer may result in an increase to the Mandatory Cost
                  Rate.

30.4     Assignments by Banks

         If any Bank assigns all or any of its rights and benefits under the
         Finance Documents in accordance with Clause 30.3 (Assignments and
         Transfers by Banks), then, unless and until the assignee has
         delivered a notice to the Agent confirming in favour of the Agent,
         the Arrangers and the other Banks that it shall be under the same
         obligations towards each of them as it would have been under if it
         had been an original party hereto as a Bank (whereupon such assignee
         shall become a party hereto as a "Bank"), the Agent, the Arrangers
         and the other Banks shall not be obliged to recognise such

                                     115
<PAGE>

         assignee as having the rights against each of them which it would have
         had if it had been such a party hereto.

30.5     Transfers by Banks

         If any Bank wishes to transfer all or any of its rights, benefits
         and/or obligations under the Finance Documents as contemplated in
         Clause 30.3 (Assignments and Transfers by Banks), then such transfer
         may be effected by the delivery to the Agent of a duly completed
         Transfer Certificate executed by such Bank and the relevant
         Transferee in which event, on the later of the Transfer Date
         specified in such Transfer Certificate and the fifth Business Day
         after (or such earlier Business Day endorsed by the Agent on such
         Transfer Certificate falling on or after) the date of delivery of
         such Transfer Certificate to the Agent:

         30.5.1   to the extent that in such Transfer Certificate the Bank
                  party thereto seeks to transfer by novation its rights,
                  benefits and obligations under the Finance Documents, each
                  of the Obligors and such Bank shall be released from further
                  obligations towards one another under the Finance Documents
                  and their respective rights against one another shall be
                  cancelled (such rights and obligations being referred to in
                  this Clause 30.5 (Transfer by Banks) as "discharged rights
                  and obligations");

         30.5.2   each of the Obligors and the Transferee party thereto shall
                  assume obligations towards one another and/or acquire rights
                  against one another which differ from such discharged rights
                  and obligations only insofar as the Obligors and such
                  Transferee have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of
                  the Obligors and such Bank;

         30.5.3   the Agent, the Arrangers, such Transferee and the other
                  Banks shall acquire the same rights and benefits and assume
                  the same obligations between themselves as they would have
                  acquired and assumed had such Transferee been an original
                  party hereto as a Bank with the rights, benefits and/or
                  obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of such
                  transfer and to that extent the Agent, the Arrangers and the
                  relevant Bank shall each be released from further
                  obligations to each other under the Finance Documents; and

         30.5.4   such Transferee shall become a party hereto as a "Bank".

30.6     U.S. Tax Forms

         At the time of a Transfer or Assignment pursuant to Clause 30.3
         (Assignment and Transfers by Banks) to a person which is not already
         a Bank hereunder and which is not a United States person (as such
         term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code)
         for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Transferee or assignee Bank
         must provide the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms (and, if
         applicable, a Non-Bank Certificate) described in Clause 10.4 (U.S.
         Tax Forms).

30.7     No Increased Obligations

         If:

                                     116
<PAGE>

         30.7.1   a Bank assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations
                  under the Finance Documents or changes its Facility Office;
                  and

         30.7.2   as a result of circumstances existing at the date of the
                  assignment, transfer or change of Facility Office, an
                  Obligor would be obliged to make a payment to the assignee,
                  Transferee or the Bank acting through its new Facility
                  Office under Clause 10.1 (Tax Gross-up), Clause 10.2 (Tax
                  Indemnity) or Clause 12 (Increased Costs),

         then the assignee, Transferee or the Bank acting through its new
         Facility Office shall only be entitled to receive payment under those
         Clauses to the same extent as the assignor, transferor or the Bank
         acting through its previous Facility Office would have been if the
         assignment, transfer or change had not occurred.

30.8     Assignment and Transfer Fees

         On the date upon which an assignment takes effect pursuant to Clause
         30.4 (Assignments by Banks) or a transfer takes effect pursuant to
         Clause 30.5 (Transfers by Banks), the relevant assignee or Transferee
         shall pay to the Agent for its own account a fee of (pound)1,000.

30.9     Disclosure of Information

         Any Bank may disclose to any person:

         30.9.1   to (or through) whom such Bank assigns or transfers (or may
                  potentially assign or transfer) all or any of its rights,
                  benefits and obligations under the Finance Documents;

         30.9.2   with (or through) whom such Bank enters into (or may
                  potentially enter into) any sub-participation in relation
                  to, or any other transaction under which payments are to be
                  made by reference to, the Finance Documents or any Obligor;

         30.9.3   to whom information may be required to be disclosed by any
                  applicable law; or

         30.9.4   any of its subsidiaries or any holding company (or any
                  subsidiary of a holding company),

         such information about any Obligor or the Group and the Finance
         Documents as such Bank shall consider appropriate provided that, in
         relation to sub-clauses 30.9.1 and 30.9.2, the person to whom such
         information is to be given has entered into a Confidentiality
         Undertaking. Any Bank which discloses any such information to any of
         the persons referred to in sub-clause 30.9 shall procure that those
         persons keep the information they receive confidential (save for
         disclosures they are required to make by any applicable law).

30.10    Notification

         The Agent shall within fourteen days of receiving a Transfer
         Certificate or a notice relating to an assignment pursuant to Clause
         30.4 (Assignment by Banks) notify the

                                     117
<PAGE>


         Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf of the other Obligors) of
         any assignment or transfer completed pursuant to this Clause 30
         (Assignments and Transfers).

30.11    Morgan Stanley Commitment

         References to the Commitment of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Bank

         to the aggregate Commitment in relation to the Facility of Morgan
         Stanley Dean Witter Bank Limited and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding,
         Inc., in such proportions as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Bank Limited
         notifies to the Agent from time to time and Morgan Stanley Senior

         Unless otherwise prohibited by law, if more than one currency or
         currency unit are at the same time recognised by the Bank of England
         as the lawful currency of the United Kingdom then:

         31.1.1   any reference in the Finance Documents to, and any
                  obligations arising under the Finance Documents in, sterling
                  shall be translated into, or paid in the currency or
                  currency unit of the United Kingdom designated by the Agent
                  (after consultation with the Borrower);

         31.1.2   any translation from one currency or currency unit to
                  another shall be at the official rate of exchange recognised
                  by the Bank of England for the conversion of that currency
                  or currency unit into the other, rounded up or down by the
                  Agent (acting reasonably); and

         31.1.3   if a change in the currency of the United Kingdom occurs,
                  this Agreement will, to the extent the Agent (acting
                  reasonably and after consultation with the Borrower)
                  specifies to be necessary, be amended to comply with any
                  generally accepted conventions and market practice in the

         to or in the effective return on its capital to, or of interest or
         other return foregone by, a Bank or any holding company of such Bank
         as a result of the introduction of, changeover to or operation of the
         euro in the United Kingdom, other than any such cost or reduction or
         amount foregone reflected in the Mandatory Cost Rate.

         If on any occasion a Reference Bank or Bank fails to supply the Agent
         with a quotation required of it under the foregoing provisions of

         be determined from those quotations which are supplied to the Agent,

38.      GOVERNING LAW

         This Agreement is governed by English law.

39.      JURISDICTION

39.1     English Courts

         The courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any
         dispute (a "Dispute") arising out of or in connection with this
         Agreement (including a dispute regarding the

                                     125
<PAGE>

         existence, validity or termination of this Agreement or the
         consequences of its nullity).

39.2     Convenient Forum

         The parties agree that the courts of England are the most appropriate
         and convenient courts to settle Disputes between them and,
         accordingly, that they will not argue to the contrary.

39.3     Non-Exclusive Jurisdiction

         This Clause 39 (Jurisdiction) is for the benefit of the Finance
         Parties only. As a result and notwithstanding Clause 39.1 (English
         Courts), it does not prevent any Finance Party from taking
         proceedings relating to a Dispute ("Proceedings") in any other courts
         with jurisdiction. To the extent allowed by law, the Finance Parties
         may take concurrent Proceedings in any number of jurisdictions.

39.4     Service of Process

         Each Guarantor agrees that the documents which start any Proceedings
         and any other documents required to be served in relation to those
         Proceedings may be served on it by service of such documents on NTL
         Group Limited at NTL House, Bartley Wood Business Park, Hook,
         Hampshire RG27 9XA (marked for the attention of Robert Mackenzie) or,
         if different, its registered office.

         If any Guarantor ceases to have a place of business in Great Britain
         or, as the case may be, the appointment of the person mentioned in
         this Clause 39.4 ceases to be effective, such person shall
         immediately appoint another person in England to accept service of
         process on its behalf in England. If any Guarantor fails to do so
         (and such failure continues for a period of not less than fourteen
         days), the Agent shall be entitled to appoint such a person by notice
         to such person. Nothing contained herein shall restrict the right to
         serve process in any other manner allowed by law. This Clause 39.4
         applies to Proceedings in England and to Proceedings elsewhere.

40.      INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT

         Each Obligor acknowledges that the Banks have entered into the
         Intercreditor Agreement (including, without limitation, Clause 2.1
         (Waiver of Drawdown Conditions) thereof and that they have been
         provided with a copy thereof. Each Obligor acknowledges that (x)
         neither it nor any other member of the Group nor any other person
         shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of the Intercreditor
         Agreement or have any right to enforce or cause the enforcement of
         any right, remedy or obligation of any party to the Intercreditor
         Agreement and (y) the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement can be
         amended, modified, waived or terminated without their consent. The
         Agent shall notify the Borrower of any such amendment, modification,
         waiver or termination promptly after its occurrence.

                                  SCHEDULE 5

                                Mandatory Costs

1.       The Mandatory Cost Rate is an addition to the interest rate to
         compensate Banks for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements
         of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or,
         in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its
         functions) or (b) the requirements of the European Central Bank.

2.       On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible
         thereafter) the Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate
         (the "additional costs rate") for each Bank, in accordance with the
         formula set out below. The Mandatory Cost Rate will be calculated by
         the Agent as a weighted average of the Banks' additional costs rates
         rounded to five decimal places (weighted in proportion to the
         percentage participation of each Bank in the relevant Advance) and
         will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum.

3.       The additional costs rate for any Bank lending from a Facility Office
         in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by
         that Bank to the Agent. This percentage will be certified by that
         Bank in its notice to the Agent to be its reasonable determination of
         the cost (expressed as a percentage of that Bank's participation in
         all Advances made from that Facility Office) of complying with the
         minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect
         of loans made from that Facility Office.

4.       The additional cost rate for any Bank lending from a Facility Office
         in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Agent as follows:

                              AB + C(B-D) + E x0.01
                              ----------------------  per cent. per annum.
                                   100 - (A + C)

         Where:

         A        is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to
                  be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Bank is from
                  time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash
                  ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash
                  ratio requirements.

         B        is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Margin and
                  the Mandatory Cost Rate and, if the Advance is an Unpaid
                  Sum, the additional rate of interest specified in Clause
                  23.2 (Default Interest) payable for the relevant Interest
                  Period of the Loan.

         C        is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which
                  that Bank is required from time to time to maintain as
                  interest bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.

         D        is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of
                  England to the Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.

         E        is designed to compensate the Banks for amounts payable
                  under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the Agent as being
                  the average of the most recent

                                     139
<PAGE>


                  rates of charge supplied by the Reference Banks to the Agent
                  pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in pounds per
                  (pound)1,000,000.

5.       For the purposes of this Schedule:

         (a)      "Eligible Liabilities" and "Special Deposits" have the
                  meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant
                  to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate)
                  by the Bank of England;

         (b)      "Fees Rules" means the rules on periodic fees contained in
                  the FSA Supervision Manual or such other law or regulation
                  as may be in force from time to time in respect of the
                  payment of fees for the acceptance of deposits;

         (c)      "Fee Tariffs" mean the fee tariffs specified in the Fees
                  Rules under the activity group A.1. Deposit acceptors
                  (ignoring any minimum fee or zero rated fee required
                  pursuant to the Fees Rules but taking into account any
                  applicable discount rate; and

         (d)      "Tariff Base" has the meaning given to it in, and will be
                  calculated in accordance with, the Fees Rules.

6.       In application of the above formula, A, B, C and D will be included
         in the formula as percentages (i.e. 5 per cent. will be included in
         the formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by
         subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero. The resulting figure
         shall be rounded to four decimal places.

7.       If requested by the Agent, each Reference Bank shall, as soon as
         practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority,
         supply to the Agent, the rate of charge payable by that Reference
         Bank to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules
         in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services
         Authority (calculated for this purpose by that Reference Bank as
         being the average of the Fee Tariff applicable to that Reference Bank
         for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per (pound)1,000,000
         of the Tariff Base of that Reference Bank.

8.       Each Bank shall supply any information required by the Agent for the
         purpose of calculating its additional costs rate. In particular, but
         without limitation, each Bank shall supply the following information
         in writing on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank:

         (a)      the jurisdiction of its Facility Office; and

         (b)      such other information that the Agent may reasonably require
                  for such purpose.

         Each Bank shall promptly notify the Agent in writing of any change to
         the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.

9.       The percentages of each Bank for the purpose of A and C above and the
         rates of charge of each Reference Bank for the purpose of E above
         shall be determined by the Agent based upon the information supplied
         to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that
         unless a Bank notifies the Agent to the contrary, each Bank's
         obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits
         are the same

                                     140
<PAGE>


         as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with
         a Facility Office in the same jurisdiction as its Facility Office.

10.      The Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination
         results in an additional costs rate which over or under compensates
         any Bank and shall be entitled to assume that the information
         provided by any Bank or Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7
         and 8 above is true and correct in all respects.

11.      The Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received pursuant
         to the Mandatory Cost Rate to the Banks on basis of the additional
         cost rate for each Bank, as calculated in accordance with the above
         formula and based on the information provided by each Bank pursuant
         to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above.

12.      Any determination by the Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation
         to a formula, the Mandatory Cost Rate, an additional costs rate or
         any amount payable to a Bank shall, in the absence of manifest error,
         be conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto.

13.      The Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Parent,
         the Borrower and the Banks, determine and notify to all parties any
         amendments or variations which are required to be made to this
         Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any
         requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the
         Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in
         either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its
         functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of
         manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto.

                           Historic Representations

Unless otherwise provided, each capitalised term used in this Schedule 9, each
capitalised term used in the Clauses referred to in this Schedule 9 and each
definition used in any of such capitalised terms, shall for the purposes of
interpretation of this Schedule 9, bear the meanings ascribed to those terms
in the form of this Agreement in force at the time the relevant representation
and warranty was made or deemed to be repeated and each reference to a Clause
number in Section B of this Schedule 9 shall, for the purposes of
interpretation of Part B of Schedule 9, be to the Clause bearing such number
in the form of this Agreement in force as at the time the relevant
representation and warranty was made or deemed to be repeated. This Schedule 9
does not serve to amend or vary the form of any representation made or deemed
to be repeated or the identity of any party described as making such
representation but is intended solely as a description of the content of such
representations and warranties, when such representations and warranties were
made or deemed repeated and the identities of the parties making such
representations. The contents of this Schedule 9 shall create no additional
legal obligations on the parties making or deemed to be making such
representations over and above the obligations contained in this Agreement in
the form in force as at the time such representation was made or deemed
repeated.

A.       Representing Parties

1.       On the Execution Date, each Covenant Group Obligor made the
         representations and warranties set out in paragraph 1 (Status and Due
         Authorisation) to paragraph 28 (The Scheme) of Section B (Historic
         Representations) of this Schedule 9; provided that insofar as the
         representations and warranties set out in sub-paragraph (c) of
         paragraph 14 (Business Plan and Information Memorandum) and paragraph
         26 (Group Structure) of Section B (Historic Representations) of this
         Schedule 9 relate to the Target Group, the Borrower made such
         representations and warranties to the best of its knowledge and
         belief and without liability to pay damages for breach thereof.

2.       On the Execution Date, New NTL made the representations and
         warranties set out in paragraph 1 (Status and Due Authorisation) to
         paragraph 7 (No Winding-Up), paragraph 20 (Execution of this
         Agreement) and paragraph 25 (Security Interest) of Section B
         (Historic Representations) of this Schedule 9 with respect to itself
         (as applicable).

3.       Each Obligor acknowledged that the Finance Parties entered into the
         Finance Documents in reliance on those representations and
         warranties.

         and Due Authorisation), 3 (No Immunity), 6 (Binding Obligations), 8

         Property), 25 (Security Interest) and 26 (Group Structure) of Section

         repeated by New NTL, the Intermediate Parent and the Borrower on each
         date on which an Advance was made and the representation set out in
         sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 14 (Business Plan and Information
         Memorandum) of Section B was deemed to have been made on the date
         that the Information Memorandum was approved by the Borrower and
         (save as disclosed by the Borrower in writing to the Agent, prior to
         the Syndication Date) on the Syndication Date.

B.       Historic Representations

1.       Status and Due Authorisation

         It is duly organised under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
         is established or incorporated with power to enter into each of the
         Finance Documents to which it is a party and to exercise its rights
         and perform its obligations thereunder and all corporate and other
         action required to authorise its execution of each of the Finance
         Documents to which it is a party and its performance of its
         obligations thereunder has been duly taken. No limit on its powers
         will be exceeded as a result of the borrowings, granting of security
         or giving of guarantees contemplated by the Finance Documents to
         which it is a party.

2.       No Deductions or Withholding; Entity Classification Election

         Under the laws of its jurisdiction in which it is established or
         incorporated in force at the Execution Date (as such term is defined
         in this Agreement), it will not be required to make any deduction or
         withholding from any payment it may make under any Finance Document
         to any Bank which is a Qualifying Lender (assuming in the case of a
         Treaty Lender, that it has secured a direction from the UK Inland
         Revenue to pay interest gross and assuming in the case of United
         States taxes that the tax forms required to be provided in Clause
         10.4 (U.S. Tax Forms) have been so provided). The Borrower has filed
         a valid election to be treated as a disregarded entity for U.S.
         federal income tax purposes and such election currently remains in
         effect.

3.       No Immunity

         In any proceedings taken in the jurisdiction in which it is
         incorporated or established in relation to any Finance Document to
         which it is party, it is not entitled to claim for itself or any of
         its assets immunity from suit, execution, attachment or other legal
         process.

4.       Validity and Admissibility in Evidence

         All acts, conditions and things required to be done, fulfilled and
performed in order:

         (a)      to enable it lawfully to enter into, exercise its rights
                  under and perform and comply with the obligations expressed
                  to be assumed by it in each of the Finance Documents to
                  which it is party;

         (b)      to ensure that the obligations expressed to be assumed by it
                  in each such Finance Document are legal, valid and (subject
                  to the Reservations) binding and enforceable; and

         (c)      (subject to the Reservations) to make each such Finance
                  Document admissible in evidence in England and the United
                  States,

         have been done, fulfilled and performed (other than the registration
         of the Encumbrances created by the Security Documents with the
         Registrar of Companies under Sections 395 and 398 of the Companies
         Act 1985).

                                     147

5.       No Filing or Stamp Taxes

         Under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or
         established in force at the Execution Date (as such term is defined
         in this Agreement), it is not necessary that any of the Finance
         Documents to which it is a party be filed, recorded or enrolled with
         any court or other authority in such jurisdiction or that any stamp,

         statements (where required by Clause 16.1 (Annual Statements),
         consolidated, in the case of the Borrower) were stated to be
         prepared, there has been no change in its business or financial
         condition or, in the business or financial condition of any member of
         the UK Group or of the UK Group taken as a whole or, in the business
         or financial condition of any member of the Target Group or of the
         Target Group taken as a whole which, in each case, could reasonably
         be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

13.      Full Disclosure

         It is not aware of any material facts or circumstances that have not
         been disclosed to the Finance Parties originally party hereto and
         which would, in its reasonable opinion, if disclosed, adversely
         affect the decision of a person considering whether or not to provide
         finance for the purposes set out in Clause 2.2 (Purpose) on the terms
         of the Finance Documents.

14.      Business Plan and Information Memorandum

         The Borrower:

                                     149
<PAGE>

         (a)      does not regard any of the forecasts or projections set out
                  in the Business Plan as unreasonable or, to any material
                  extent, unattainable;

         (b)      considers (having made all reasonable enquiries) the
                  assumptions upon which the forecasts and projections
                  contained in the Business Plan are based to be fair and
                  reasonable in all material respects; and

         (c)      confirms that the factual information contained in the
                  Information Memorandum and any other written factual
                  information supplied by any member of the UK Group or any
                  member of the Target Group (in the latter case, supplied
                  after the Acquisition Date or, if supplied before the
                  Acquisition Date, supplied with the Borrower's knowledge) to
                  the Agent, the Arrangers and the Banks in connection

                  respects.

15.      Budgets

         It:

         (a)      regards (as at the date each Budget is delivered to the
                  Agent) as neither unreasonable, nor to any material extent
                  unattainable, any of the forecasts or projections set out in
                  the latest Budget delivered under Clause 16.5 (Budgets);

         (b)      believes (having made all reasonable enquiries) the
                  assumptions, upon which the forecasts and projections in
                  relation to the CWC ConsumerCo Business contained in the
                  latest Budget delivered under Clause 16.5 (Budgets) are
                  based, to be fair and reasonable; and

         (c)      has, to the best of its knowledge and belief (having made
                  all reasonable efforts to make due and careful enquiry),
                  made full disclosure of all material facts relating to the
                  CWC ConsumerCo Business to all the persons responsible for

         respects with all Environmental Law and obtained and maintained any
         Environmental Permits breach of which or, as the case may be, failure
         to obtain or maintain which, could reasonably be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

17.      Environmental Claims

         No Environmental Claim has been commenced or (to the best of the
         Borrower's knowledge and belief) is threatened against any member of
         the Covenant Group where such claim would be reasonably likely, if
         determined against such member of the Covenant Group to have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

18.      No Encumbrances

         Save (in each case) for Permitted Encumbrances, no Encumbrance exists

20.      Execution of this Agreement

         Its execution of each Finance Document to which it is a party and the
         performance of its obligations thereunder do not and will not:

                  instrument or treaty to which it is party or which is
                  binding upon it or any of its assets (including, without
                  limitation, the NTL CC Notes) in a manner that could
                  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

         (b)      conflict with its constitutive documents and rules and
                  regulations; or

         (c)      conflict with any applicable law.

         Prepayment due to Change in Control)) of, NTL Holdings.

22.      Licences and Consents

         Each member of the Covenant Group has, at all relevant times,

         "approval") required for the conduct of its business as carried on
         from time to time, and all such approvals are valid and subsisting
         save in any such case where failure to obtain such an approval or the
         invalidity of such an approval or its failure to subsist could not
         reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and to the
         best of its knowledge and belief there has been no act or omission on
         the part of it, any Covenant Group member which is likely to give
         rise to the enforcement, revocation, material amendment, suspension,
         withdrawal or avoidance of any of the approvals or any of the
         material terms or conditions thereof, which enforcement, revocation,
         amendment, withdrawal, suspension or avoidance could reasonably be
         expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

23.      Government or Regulatory Authority Inquiry

         No member of the Covenant Group has to the best of its knowledge and
         belief after due and careful inquiry received any notice or
         communication which has not been disclosed to the Agent on or prior

         from, or is aware of, any inquiry, investigation or proceeding on the

         It is not aware of any adverse circumstance relating to the validity,
         subsistence or use of any member of the Covenant Group's Intellectual

25.      Security Interest

         (a)      Subject (in each case) to the Reservations, each Security
                  Document creates the security interest which that Security
                  Document purports to create or, if that Security Document
                  purports to evidence a security interest, accurately
                  evidences a security interest which has been validly created
                  and each security interest ranks in priority as specified in
                  the Security Document creating or evidencing that interest.

                  subject to an Encumbrance under the Security Documents are
                  fully paid and not subject to any option to purchase or
                  similar rights and the constitutional documents of such
                  persons do not and could not restrict or inhibit (whether
                  absolutely, partly, under a discretionary power or
                  otherwise) any transfer of such shares pursuant to
                  enforcement of the Security Documents.

         knowledge and belief, the CWC ConsumerCo Business is true, complete
