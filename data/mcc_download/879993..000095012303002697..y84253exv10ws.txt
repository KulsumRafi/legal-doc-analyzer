Breaching Party by the Non-breaching Party (or, if such default cannot be cured
within such [ * ] period, if the Breaching Party does not commence and
diligently continue actions to cure such default during such [ * ]day period).
Any such termination shall become effective at the end of such [ * ]day period
unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the
expiration of such [ * ]day period (or, if such default cannot be cured within
such [ * ]day period, if the Breaching Party has commenced and diligently
continued actions to cure such default). The right of either Party to terminate
this Agreement as provided in this Section 11.3 shall not be affected in any way
by such Party's waiver or failure to take action with respect to any previous
default.

     11.4 Termination for Other Reasons:

          11.4.1 DUSA may terminate this Agreement under Section 5.11 by giving
medac [ * ] days prior written notice.

          11.4.2 DUSA may terminate this Agreement for any reason by giving
medac [ * ] prior written notice, provided that such notice may not be given
unless DUSA has provided notice of termination to PN, under the License and
Development Agreement under Section 13 thereof.

     11.5 Effect of Expiration or Termination: Following any termination by DUSA
or the expiration of the Term of this Agreement, medac shall, for a period of
[ * ], continue to provide DUSA with its requirements of any formulation of the

AMENDED.

          11.6.1 Termination, relinquishment or expiration of this Agreement for
any reason shall be without prejudice to any rights that shall have accrued to
the benefit of either Party prior to such termination, relinquishment or
expiration. Such termination, relinquishment or expiration shall not relieve
either Party from obligations which are expressly indicated to survive
termination or expiration of this Agreement.


12.  FORCE MAJEURE

     Neither Party shall be held liable or responsible to the other Party nor be
deemed to be in default under, or in breach of any provision of, this Agreement
for failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any obligation of this
Agreement when such failure or delay is due to Force Majeure, and without the
fault or negligence of the Party so failing or delaying. For purposes of this
Agreement, Force Majeure is defined as causes beyond the control of the Party,
including, without limitation, acts of God; acts, regulations, or laws of any
government; war; civil commotion; destruction of production facilities or
materials by fire, flood, earthquake, explosion or storm; labor disturbances;
epidemic; and failure of public utilities or common carriers. In such event DUSA
or medac, as the case may be, shall immediately notify the other Party of such
inability and of the period for which such inability is expected to continue.
The Party giving such notice shall thereupon be excused from such of its
obligations under this Agreement as it is thereby disabled from performing for
so long as it is so disabled and the thirty (30) days thereafter. To the extent
possible, each Party shall use reasonable efforts to minimize the duration of
any Force Majeure.
