        shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim or demand). The Indemnifying

        prior to and during the Notice Period to file any motion, answer, or other pleading that
        it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
        Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the
        Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or

Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in all
