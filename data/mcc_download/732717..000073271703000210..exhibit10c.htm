If
a Participant dies prior to his or her Retirement, a pre-retirement death
benefit will be calculated and paid as though the Participant had Retired
(determined without regard to the 5 Years of Service requirement otherwise
applicable to certain Participants age 55 or older) on the day prior to the date
of death. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.3, if a Participant&#146;s
Agreement or benefit payout election form fails to show an election of a Benefit
Payout Alternative, or if the Participant, having chosen to defer his benefit
election, failed to make a timely election of a Benefit Payout Alternative prior
to his or her death, the form of the pre-retirement death benefit shall, at the
option of the Participant&#146;s Beneficiary, be either the Life With 10-Year
Certain Benefit form of the Participant&#146;s benefit, a Beneficiary Life
Annuity (as such term is hereinafter described) based on the life expectancy of
the Beneficiary, or, if the Participant was eligible to make a Lump Sum Benefit
election as of his or her date of death, a Lump Sum Benefit (calculated in the
manner described in this Section 4.1). If paid as a Beneficiary Life Annuity
based on the Life of the Beneficiary, such benefit shall be the actuarially
determined equivalent (as determined by the Administrative Committee in its
complete and sole discretion) of the Life With 10-Year Certain Benefit;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, should the Beneficiary die prior to the payment
to the Beneficiary of the total dollar amount of the Life with 10-Year Certain
Benefit, the remaining dollar balance of such Life With 10-Year Certain Benefit
shall be paid in accordance with the Participant&#146;s beneficiary designation
and the Rules at the same monthly rate of payment as would have been the monthly
payment pursuant to the 10-year payment schedule had the Life With 10-Year
Certain Benefit been selected. For purposes of this Section 4.1, a Lump Sum
Benefit shall be calculated in the same manner as provided in Section 3.4 as if
the Participant were alive; e.g., calculated as of the Participant&#146;s Death
applying the Mortality Tables and the GAAP Rate, both as in effect as of the end
of the calendar year immediately preceding the Participant&#146;s Death, but
using the Participant&#146;s age, Years of Service and other factors as of the
Participants date of death.</FONT></TD>

This
Plan may be modified or terminated at any time in accordance with the provisions
of SBC&#146;s Schedule of Authorizations. A modification may affect present and
future Eligible Employees. SBC also reserves the sole right to terminate at any
time any or all Agreements. In the event of termination of the Plan or of a
Participant&#146;s Agreement, a Participant shall be entitled to benefits
hereunder, if prior to the date of termination of the Plan or of his or her
Agreement, such Participant has attained 5 Years of Service, in which case,
regardless of the termination of the Plan/Participant&#146;s Agreement, such
Participant shall be entitled to benefits at such time as provided in and as
otherwise in accordance with the Plan and his or her Agreement, provided,
however, Participant&#146;s benefit shall be computed as if Participant had
terminated employment as of the date of termination of the Plan or of his or her
Agreement; provided further, however, Participant&#146;s service subsequent to
Plan/Agreement termination shall be recognized for purposes of reducing or
eliminating the Age discount provided for by Section 3.1(d). No amendment,
including an amendment to this Section 6.5, shall be effective, without the
written consent of a Participant, to alter, to the detriment of such
Participant, the benefits described in this Plan as applicable to such
Participant as of the effective date of such amendment. For purposes of this
Section 6.5, an alteration to the detriment of a Participant shall mean a
reduction in the amount payable hereunder to a Participant to which such
Participant would be entitled if such Participant terminated employment at such
time, or any change in the form of benefit payable hereunder to a Participant to
which such Participant would be entitled if such Participant terminated
employment at such time. Any amendment which reduces Participant&#146;s benefit
hereunder to adjust for a change in his or her pension benefit resulting from an
amendment to any company-sponsored defined benefit pension plan which changes
the pension benefits payable to all employees, shall not require the
Participant&#146;s consent. Written notice of any amendment shall be given to
each Participant.</FONT></TD>

Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Plan, all benefits provided under the Plan with
respect to a Participant shall be forfeited and canceled in their entirety if
the Participant, without the consent of SBC and while employed by SBC or any
subsidiary thereof or within three (3) years after termination of such
employment, engages in competition with SBC or any subsidiary thereof or with
any business with which SBC or a subsidiary or affiliated company has a
substantial interest (collectively referred to herein as &#147;Employer
business&#148;) and fails to cease and desist from engaging in said competitive
activity within 120 days following receipt of written notice from SBC to
Participant demanding that Participant cease and desist from engaging in said
competitive activity. For purposes of this Plan, engaging in competition with
any Employer business shall mean engaging by the Participant in any business or
activity in the same geographical market where the same or substantially similar
business or activity is being carried on as an Employer business. Such term
shall not include owning a nonsubstantial publicly traded interest as a
shareholder in a business that competes with an Employer business. However,
engaging in competition with an Employer business shall include representing or
providing consulting services to, or being an employee of, any person or entity
that is engaged in competition with any Employer business or that takes a
position adverse to any Employer business. Accordingly, benefits shall not be
provided under this Plan if, within the time period and without the written
consent specified, Participant either engages directly in competitive activity
or in any capacity in any location becomes employed by, associated with, or
renders service to any company, or parent or affiliate thereof, or any
subsidiary of any of them, if any of them is engaged in competition with an
Employer business, regardless of the position or duties the Participant takes
and regardless of whether or not the employing company, or the company that
Participant becomes associated with or renders service to, is itself engaged in
direct competition with an Employer business.</FONT></TD>
