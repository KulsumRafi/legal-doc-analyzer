               privilege of such Pledgor relating to such Partnership Interests,
               including any power to terminate, cancel or modify any
               partnership agreement or operating agreement, to execute any
               instruments and to take any and all other action on behalf of and
               in the name of any Pledgor in respect of such Partnership
               Interests and any such partnership, to make determinations, to
               exercise any election (including, but not limited to, election of

               other property and all cash, securities, interest, dividends,
               rights and other property at any time and from time to time
               received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of or in

               Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 3.1 or in Section 3.3 hereof, (x) except as otherwise provided in
subsection 6.11 of the Credit Agreement no Pledgor (to the extent that it is a
Borrower or a Domestic Subsidiary of Holdings) shall be required at any time to
pledge hereunder (and the Collateral of such Pledgor shall not include) more
than 65% of the Voting Stock of any Foreign Corporation and (y) so long as it
does not cause any materially adverse tax consequences to Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries, each Pledgor shall be required to pledge hereunder 100% of any
Non-Voting Stock at any time and from time to time acquired by such Pledgor of
any Foreign Corporation.

               3.2    Procedures. (a) To the extent that any Pledgor at any
time or from time to time owns, acquires or obtains any right, title or interest
in any Collateral, such Collateral shall automatically (and without the taking
of any action by the respective Pledgor) be pledged pursuant to Section 3.1 of
this Agreement and, in addition thereto, such Pledgor shall (to the extent

                                       -9-

<PAGE>

provided below) take the following actions as set forth below (as promptly as
practicable and, in any event, within 30 days after it obtains such Collateral)
for the benefit of the Pledgee and the other Secured Creditors:

               (i)    with respect to a Certificated Security (other than a
         Certificated Security credited on the books of a Clearing Corporation),
         the respective Pledgor shall physically deliver such Certificated
         Security to the Pledgee, endorsed to the Pledgee or endorsed in blank;

               (ii)   with respect to an Uncertificated Security (other than an
         Uncertificated Security credited on the books of a Clearing
         Corporation), upon the occurrence and continuation of a Specified
         Collateral Event or an Event of Default and if requested by the
         Collateral Agent, the respective Pledgor shall cause the issuer of such
         Uncertificated Security (or, in the case of an issuer that is not a
         Subsidiary of such Pledgor, will use its best efforts to cause such
         issuer) to duly authorize, execute and deliver to the Pledgee an
         agreement for the benefit of the Pledgee and the other Secured Parties
         substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (appropriately completed
         to the satisfaction of the Pledgee and with such modifications, if any,
         as shall be satisfactory to the Pledgee) pursuant to which such issuer
         agrees to comply with any and all instructions originated by the
         Pledgee without further consent by the registered owner and not to
         comply with instructions regarding such Uncertificated Security (and
         any Partnership Interests and Limited Liability Company Interests
         issued by such issuer) originated by any other Person other than a
         court of competent jurisdiction; provided that Pledgee hereby agrees
         that it will not provide any instructions to any such issuer unless and
         until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

               (iii)  with respect to a Certificated Security, Uncertificated
         Security, Partnership Interest or Limited Liability Company Interest
         credited on the books of a Clearing Corporation (including a Federal
         Reserve Bank, Participants Trust Company or The Depository Trust
         Company), the respective Pledgor shall notify the Pledgee thereof and
         shall take all actions required (i) to comply with the applicable rules
         of such Clearing Corporation and (ii) upon the occurrence and
         continuation of a Specified Collateral Event or an Event of Default and
         if requested by the Collateral Agent, to perfect the security interest
         of the Pledgee under applicable law (including, in any event, under
         Sections 9-314(a), (b) and (c), 9-106 and 8-106(d) of the UCC). Each
         such Pledgor further agrees to take such actions as the Pledgee deems
         reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the foregoing;

               (iv)   with respect to a Partnership Interest or a Limited
         Liability Company Interest (other than a Partnership Interest or
         Limited Liability Company Interest credited on the books of a Clearing
         Corporation), (1) if such Partnership Interest or Limited Liability
         Company Interest is represented by a certificate and is a Security for
         purposes of the UCC, the procedure set forth in Section 3.2(a)(i)
         hereof, and (2) if such Partnership Interest or Limited Liability
         Company Interest is not represented by a certificate or is not a
         Security for purposes of the UCC, the procedure set forth in Section
         3.2(a)(ii) hereof;

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

               (v)    with respect to any Note (other than, to the extent no
         Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, a Note that
         constitutes Chattel Paper or any Note evidencing an aggregate amount of
         outstanding Indebtedness less than $750,000 at any time), physical
         delivery of such Note to the Pledgee, endorsed to the Pledgee or
         endorsed in blank; and

               (vi)   after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
         with respect to cash, to the extent not otherwise provided in the
         Security Agreement, (i) establishment by the Pledgee of a cash account
         in the name of such Pledgor over which the Pledgee shall have exclusive
         and absolute control and dominion (and no withdrawals or transfers may
         be made therefrom by any Person except with the prior written consent
         of the Pledgee) and (ii) deposit of such cash in such cash account.

               (b)    In addition to the actions required to be taken pursuant
to preceding Section 3.2(a) hereof, each Pledgor shall take the following
additional actions with respect to the Securities and Collateral:

               (i)    with respect to all Collateral of such Pledgor of which
         the Pledgee may obtain "control" within the meaning of Section 8-106 of
         the UCC (or under any provision of the UCC as same may be amended or
         supplemented from time to time, or under the laws of any relevant State
         other than the State of New York), upon the occurrence and continuation
         of a Specified Collateral Event or an Event of Default, the respective
         Pledgor shall take all actions as may be requested from time to time by
         the Pledgee so that "control" of such Collateral is obtained and at all
         times held by the Pledgee; and

               (ii)   each Pledgor shall from time to time cause appropriate
         financing statements (on appropriate forms) under the Uniform
         Commercial Code as in effect in the various relevant States, in form
         satisfactory to the Pledgee and covering all Collateral hereunder, to
         be filed in the relevant filing offices so that at all times the
         Pledgee has a security interest in all Investment Property and other
         Collateral which is perfected by the filing of such financing
         statements (in each case to the maximum extent perfection by filing may
         be obtained under the laws of the relevant States, including, without
         limitation, Section 9-312(a) of the UCC).

               3.3    Subsequently Acquired Collateral. If any Pledgor shall
acquire (by purchase, stock dividend or otherwise) any additional Collateral at
any time or from time to time after the date hereof, such Collateral shall
automatically (and without any further action being required to be taken) be
subject to the pledge and security interests created pursuant to Section 3.1
hereof and, furthermore, the Pledgor will thereafter take (or cause to be taken)
all action (as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within 30 days after
it obtains such Collateral) with respect to such Collateral in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Section 3.2 hereof, and will promptly thereafter
deliver to the Pledgee (i) a certificate executed by a senior financial officer
of such Pledgor describing such Collateral and certifying that the same has been
duly pledged in favor of the Pledgee (for the benefit of the Secured Creditors)
hereunder and (ii) supplements to Annexes B through G hereto as are necessary to
cause such annexes to be complete and accurate at such time.

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

               3.4    Transfer  Taxes.  Each  pledge of  Collateral  under
Section 3.1 or Section 3.3 hereof shall be accompanied by any transfer tax
stamps required in connection with the pledge of such Collateral.

               3.5    Definition of Pledged Notes. All Notes at any time pledged
or required to be pledged hereunder are hereinafter called the "Pledged Notes."

               3.6    Certain Representations and Warranties Regarding the
Collateral. Each Pledgor represents and warrants that on the date hereof: (i)
each Subsidiary of such Pledgor, and the direct ownership thereof, is listed on
Annex B hereto; (ii) the Stock held by such Pledgor consists of the number and
type of shares of the stock of the corporations as described in Annex C hereto;
(iii) such Stock referenced in clause (ii) of this paragraph constitutes that

corporation as is set forth in Annex C hereto; (iv) the Notes held by such
Pledgor consist of the promissory notes described in Annex D hereto where such
Pledgor is listed as the lender; (v) the Limited Liability Company Interests
held by such Pledgor consist of the number and type of interests of the Persons

referenced in clause (v) of this paragraph constitutes that percentage of the

(viii) each such Partnership Interest referenced in clause (vii) of this

Section 3.2(a) hereof with respect to each item of Collateral described in
Annexes C through F hereto; and (xi) such Pledgor owns no other Securities,
Limited Liability Company Interests or Partnership Interests; provided, that in
respect to the representations and warranties set forth in clauses (iii), (vi)
and (viii) above, to the extent that such Stock, Limited Liability Company
Interest or Partnership Interest, as applicable, is an ownership interest in a
Person other than a Subsidiary or Affiliate of Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries, the applicable Pledgor shall make the aforementioned
representations and warranties on the basis of its knowledge after using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary information from such
Person or its officers, employees or agents.

               4. APPOINTMENT OF SUB-AGENTS; ENDORSEMENTS, ETC. If and to the
extent necessary to enable the Pledgee to perfect its security interest in any
of the Collateral or to exercise any of its remedies hereunder, the Pledgee
shall have the right to appoint one or more sub-agents for the purpose of
retaining physical possession of the Collateral, which may be held (in the
discretion of the Pledgee) in the name of the relevant Pledgor, endorsed or
assigned in blank or in favor of the Pledgee or any nominee or nominees of the
Pledgee or a sub-agent appointed by the Pledgee.

               5. VOTING, ETC., WHILE NO EVENT OF DEFAULT. Unless and until
there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default, each Pledgor
shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and other consensual rights
pertaining to the Collateral owned by it, and to give consents, waivers or
ratifications in respect thereof; provided, that, in each case, no vote shall be
cast or any consent, waiver or ratification given or any action taken or omitted
to be

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

taken which would violate, result in breach of any covenant contained in, or be
inconsistent with any of the terms of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, any
other Loan Document, any Secured Hedging Agreements entitled to the benefits of
this Agreement (collectively, the "Secured Debt Agreements"), or which would
have the effect of materially impairing the value of the Collateral or any part
thereof or the position or interests of the Pledgee or any other Secured
Creditor in the Collateral. All such rights of each Pledgor to vote and to give
consents, waivers and ratifications shall cease in case an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, and Section 7 hereof shall become applicable.

               6. DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS. Unless and until there
shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default, all cash dividends,
cash distributions, cash Proceeds and other cash amounts payable in respect of
the Collateral shall be paid to the respective Pledgor. The Pledgee shall be
entitled to receive directly, and to retain as part of the Collateral:

               (i)    all other or additional stock, notes, limited liability
         company interests, partnership interests, instruments or other
         securities or property (including, but not limited to, cash dividends
         other than as set forth above) paid or distributed by way of dividend
         or otherwise in respect of the Collateral;

               (ii)   all other or additional stock, notes, limited liability
         company interests, partnership interests, instruments or other
         securities or property (including, but not limited to, cash) paid or
         distributed in respect of the Collateral by way of stock-split,
         spin-off, split-up, reclassification, combination of shares or similar
         rearrangement; and

               (iii)  all other or additional stock, notes, limited liability
         company interests, partnership interests, instruments or other
         securities or property (including, but not limited to, cash) which may
         be paid in respect of the Collateral by reason of any consolidation,
         merger, exchange of stock, conveyance of assets, liquidation or similar
         corporate reorganization.

Nothing contained in this Section 6 shall limit or restrict in any way the
Pledgee's right to receive proceeds of the Collateral in any form in accordance
with Section 3 of this Agreement. All dividends, distributions or other payments
which are received by any Pledgor contrary to the provisions of this Section 6
and Section 7 hereof shall be held for the benefit of the Pledgee, shall be
segregated from other property or funds of such Pledgor and shall be forthwith
paid over to the Pledgee as Collateral in the same form as so received (with any
necessary endorsement).

               7. REMEDIES IN CASE OF EVENT OF DEFAULT. Each Pledgor agrees that
if any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then and in every
such case, the Pledgee in addition to any rights now or hereafter existing under
applicable law, the other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall be entitled to exercise all of the rights, powers and remedies
(whether vested in it by this Agreement, any other Secured Debt Agreement or by
law) for the protection and enforcement of its rights in respect of the
Collateral, and the Pledgee shall be entitled to exercise all the rights and
remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in
any relevant jurisdiction and also shall be entitled,

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

without limitation, to exercise the following rights, which each Pledgor hereby
agrees to be commercially reasonable:

               (i)    to receive all amounts payable in respect of the
         Collateral otherwise payable under Section 6 hereof to the respective
         Pledgor;

               (ii)   to transfer all or any part of the Collateral into the
         Pledgee's name or the name of its nominee or nominees;

               (iii)  to accelerate any Pledged Note which may be accelerated in
         accordance with its terms, and take any other lawful action to collect
         upon any Pledged Note (including, without limitation, to make any
         demand for payment thereon);

               (iv)   to vote all or any part of the Collateral (whether or not
         transferred into the name of the Pledgee) and give all consents,
         waivers and ratifications in respect of the Collateral and, subject to
         provisions of all applicable law, otherwise act with respect thereto as
         though it were the outright owner thereof (each Pledgor hereby
         irrevocably constituting and appointing the Pledgee the proxy and
         attorney-in-fact of such Pledgor, with full power of substitution to do
         so);

               (v)    at any time and from time to time to sell, assign and
         deliver, or grant options to purchase, all or any part of the
         Collateral, or any interest therein, at any public or private sale,
         without demand of performance, advertisement or notice of intention to
         sell or of the time or place of sale or adjournment thereof or to
         redeem or otherwise purchase or dispose (all of which are hereby waived
         by each Pledgor), for cash, on credit or for other property, for
         immediate or future delivery without any assumption of credit risk, and
         for such price or prices and on such terms as the Pledgee in its
         absolute discretion may determine, provided that at least 10 days'
         written notice of the time and place of any such sale shall be given to
         the respective Pledgor. The Pledgee shall not be obligated to make any
         such sale of Collateral regardless of whether any such notice of sale
         has theretofore been given. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold
         the property so sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the
         part of each Pledgor, and each Pledgor hereby waives and releases to
         the fullest extent permitted by law any right or equity of redemption
         with respect to the Collateral, whether before or after sale hereunder,
         and all rights, if any, of marshalling the Collateral and any other
         security for the Obligations or otherwise and all rights, if any, of
         stay and/or appraisal which it now has or may at any time in the future
         have under rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. At
         any such sale, unless prohibited by applicable law, the Pledgee on
         behalf of the Secured Parties may bid for and purchase all or any part
         of the Collateral so sold free, to the extent permitted by applicable
         law, from any such right or equity of redemption. Neither the Pledgee
         nor any other Secured Party shall be liable for failure to collect or
         realize upon any or all of the Collateral or for any delay in so doing
         nor shall any of them be under any obligation to take any action
         whatsoever with regard thereto; and

               (vi)   to set-off any and all Collateral against any and all
         Obligations, and to withdraw any and all cash or other Collateral from
         any and all Collateral Accounts and to apply such cash and other
         Collateral to the payment of any and all Obligations;

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

provided that, it being understood that each Pledgor's obligation to so deliver
the Collateral is of the essence of this Agreement and that, accordingly, upon
application to a court of equity having jurisdiction, the Pledgee shall be
entitled to a decree requiring specific performance by such Pledgor of said
obligation. By accepting the benefits of this Agreement and each other
Collateral Document, the Secured Creditors expressly acknowledge and agree that
this Agreement and each other Collateral Document may be enforced only by the
action of the Administrative Agent or the Pledgee acting upon the instructions
of the Required Secured Creditors and that no other Secured Creditor shall have
any right individually to seek to enforce this Agreement or any other Collateral
Document or to realize upon the security to be granted hereby or thereby, it
being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by
the Pledgee for the benefit of the Secured Creditors upon the terms of this
Agreement and the other Collateral Documents.

               8. REMEDIES, CUMULATIVE, ETC. Each and every right, power and
remedy of the Pledgee or any other Secured Creditor provided for in this
Agreement or in any other Secured Debt Agreement, or now or hereafter existing
at law or in equity or by statute shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall
be in addition to every other such right, power or remedy. The exercise or
beginning of the exercise by the Pledgee or any other Secured Creditor of any
one or more of the rights, powers or remedies provided for in this Agreement or
any other Secured Debt Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in
equity or by statute or otherwise shall not preclude the simultaneous or later
exercise by the Pledgee or any other Secured Creditor of all such other rights,
powers or remedies, and no failure or delay on the part of the Pledgee or any
other Secured Creditor to exercise any such right, power or remedy shall operate
as a waiver thereof. No notice to or demand on any Pledgor in any case shall
entitle it to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances or constitute a waiver of any of the rights of the Pledgee or any
other Secured Creditor to any other or further action in any circumstances
without notice or demand. The Secured Creditors agree that this Agreement may be
enforced only by the action of the Pledgee, acting upon the instructions of the
Requisite Lenders (or, after the date on which all Credit Agreement Obligations
have been paid in full, the holders of at least a majority of the Other
Obligations) and that no other Secured Creditor shall have any right
individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Agreement or to realize upon
the security to be granted hereby, it being understood and agreed that such
rights and remedies may be exercised by the Pledgee or the holders of at least a
majority of the Other Obligations, as the case may be, for the benefit of the
Secured Creditors upon the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

               9. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. (a) All monies collected by the
Pledgee upon any sale or other disposition of the Collateral pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, together with all other monies received by the Pledgee
hereunder, shall be applied in the manner provided in Section 7.4 of the
Security Agreement.

               (b)    It is understood and agreed that the Pledgors shall remain
jointly and severally liable to the extent of any deficiency between the amount
of the proceeds of the Collateral hereunder and the aggregate amount of the
Obligations.

               10. PURCHASERS OF COLLATERAL. Upon any sale of the Collateral by
the Pledgee hereunder (whether by virtue of the power of sale herein granted,
pursuant to judicial

                                      -15-

process or otherwise), the receipt of the Pledgee or the officer making the sale
shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral
so sold, and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the
application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Pledgee or such
officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication or nonapplication
thereof.

               11. INDEMNITY. Each Pledgor jointly and severally agrees (i) to
indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless the Pledgee, each other Secured Creditor
and their respective successors, assigns, employees, agents, affiliates and
servants (individually an "Indemnitee," and collectively the "Indemnitees") from
and against any and all liabilities, obligations, damages, injuries, penalties,
claims, demands, actions, suits, judgments and losses of whatsoever kind or
nature, and (ii) to reimburse each Indemnitee for any and all reasonable costs,
expenses and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses,
in each case growing out of or resulting from this Agreement or the exercise by
any Indemnitee of any right or remedy granted to it hereunder or under any other
Secured Debt Agreement (but excluding any liabilities, obligations, damages,
injuries, penalties, claims, demands, actions, suits, judgments and losses or
expenses to the extent incurred by reason of gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. In no event shall the Pledgee be liable,
in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part,
for any matter or thing in connection with this Agreement other than to account
for monies actually received by it in accordance with the terms hereof. If and
to the extent that the obligations of any Pledgor under this Section 11 are
unenforceable for any reason, such Pledgor hereby agrees to make the maximum
contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such obligations which is
permissible under applicable law. The indemnity obligations of each Pledgor
contained in this Section 11 shall continue in full force and effect
notwithstanding the full payment of all Notes issued under the Credit Agreement,
the termination of all Secured Hedging Agreements and Letters of Credit, and the
payment of all Obligations and notwithstanding the discharge thereof.

               12. PLEDGEE NOT A PARTNER OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY MEMBER.
(a) Nothing herein shall be construed to make the Pledgee or any other Secured
Creditor liable as a member of any limited liability company or as a partner of
any partnership and neither the Pledgee nor any other Secured Creditor by virtue
of this Agreement or otherwise (except as referred to in the following sentence)
shall have any of the duties, obligations or liabilities of a member of any
limited liability company or as a partner in any partnership. The parties hereto
expressly agree that, unless the Pledgee shall become the absolute owner of
Collateral consisting of a Limited Liability Company Interest or Partnership
Interest pursuant hereto, this Agreement shall not be construed as creating a
partnership or joint venture among the Pledgee, any other Secured Creditor, any
Pledgor and/or any other Person.

               (b)    Except as provided in the last sentence of paragraph (a)
of this Section 12, the Pledgee, by accepting this Agreement, did not intend to
become a member of any limited liability company or a partner of any partnership
or otherwise be deemed to be a co-venturer with respect to any Pledgor, or any
limited liability company or partnership either before or after an Event of
Default shall have occurred. The Pledgee shall have only those powers set forth
herein and the Secured Parties shall assume none of the duties, obligations or
liabilities of a member of any limited liability company or as a partner of any
partnership or any Pledgor except as provided in the last sentence of paragraph
(a) of this Section 12.

                                      -16-

<PAGE>

               (c)    The Pledgee and the other Secured Parties shall not be
obligated to perform or discharge any obligation of any Pledgor as a result of
the pledge hereby effected.

               (d)    The acceptance by the Pledgee of this Agreement, with all
the rights, powers, privileges and authority so created, shall not at any time
or in any event obligate the Pledgee or any other Secured Party to appear in or
defend any action or proceeding relating to the Collateral to which it is not a
party, or to take any action hereunder or thereunder, or to expend any money or
incur any expenses or perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability
under the Collateral.

               13. FURTHER ASSURANCES; POWER-OF-ATTORNEY. (a) Each Pledgor
agrees to execute and deliver to the Pledgee such financing statements, in form
reasonably acceptable to the Pledgee, as the Pledgee may from time to time
reasonably request or as are reasonably necessary or desirable in the opinion of
the Pledgee to establish and maintain a valid, enforceable, perfected security
interest in the Collateral as provided herein. Each Pledgor will pay any
applicable filing fees, recordation taxes and related expenses relating to the
perfection of Pledgee's security interest in its Collateral. Each Pledgor hereby
authorizes the Pledgee to file any such financing statements without the
signature of such Pledgor where permitted by law.

               (b)    Each Pledgor hereby constitutes and appoints the Pledgee
its true and lawful attorney, irrevocably, with full power after the occurrence
of and during the continuance of an Event of Default (in the name of such
Pledgor or otherwise) to act, require, demand, receive and give acquittance for
any and all monies and claims for monies due or to become due to such Pledgor
under or arising out of the Collateral, to endorse any checks or other
instruments or orders in connection therewith and to file any claims or take any
action or institute any proceedings which the Pledgee may deem to be necessary
or advisable to protect the interests of the Secured Parties, which appointment
as attorney is coupled with an interest.

               14. THE PLEDGEE AS COLLATERAL AGENT. The Pledgee will hold in
accordance with this Agreement all items of the Collateral at any time received
under this Agreement. It is expressly understood and agreed by each Secured
Creditor that by accepting the benefits of this Agreement each such Secured
Creditor acknowledges and agrees that the obligations of the Pledgee as holder
of the Collateral and interests therein and with respect to the disposition
thereof, and otherwise under this Agreement, are only those expressly set forth
in this Agreement and in Section 9 of the Credit Agreement. The Pledgee shall
act hereunder on the terms and conditions set forth herein and in Section 9 of
the Credit Agreement.

               15. TRANSFER BY THE PLEDGORS. No Pledgor will sell or otherwise
dispose of, grant any option with respect to, or mortgage, pledge or otherwise
encumber any of the Collateral or any interest therein (except as may be
permitted in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement).

               16. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE PLEDGORS.
(a) Each Pledgor represents, warrants and covenants that:

               (i)    it is the legal, beneficial and record owner of, and has
         good and marketable title to, all Collateral and that it has sufficient
         interest in all Collateral in which a

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

         security interest is purported to be created hereunder for such
         security interest to attach (subject, in each case, to no pledge, lien,
         mortgage, hypothecation, security interest, charge, option, Adverse
         Claim or other encumbrance whatsoever, except the liens and security
         interests created by this Agreement or permitted under the Secured Debt
         Agreements);

               (ii)   it has full power, authority and legal right to pledge all
         the Collateral pledged by it pursuant to this Agreement;

               (iii)  this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
         delivered by such Pledgor and constitutes a legal, valid and binding
         obligation of such Pledgor enforceable against such Pledgor in
         accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability
         hereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
         reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws generally affecting
         creditors' rights and by equitable principles (regardless of whether
         enforcement is sought in equity or at law);

               (iv)   except to the extent already obtained or made, no consent
         of any other party (including, without limitation, any stockholder,
         partner, member or creditor of such Pledgor or any of its Subsidiaries)
         and no consent, license, permit, approval or authorization of,
         exemption by, notice or report to, or registration, filing or
         declaration with, any governmental authority is required to be obtained
         by such Pledgor in connection with (a) the execution, delivery or
         performance of this Agreement, (b) the validity or enforceability of
         this Agreement (except as set forth in clause (iii) above), (c) the
         perfection or enforceability of the Pledgee's security interest in the
         Collateral or (d) except for compliance with or as may be required by
         applicable securities laws, the exercise by the Pledgee of any of its
         rights or remedies provided herein;

               (v)    the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
         will not violate any provision of any applicable law or regulation or
         of any order, judgment, writ, award or decree of any court, arbitrator
         or governmental authority, domestic or foreign, applicable to such
         Pledgor, or of the certificate of incorporation, operating agreement,
         limited liability company agreement, partnership agreement or by-laws
         of such Pledgor or of any securities issued by such Pledgor or any of
         its Subsidiaries, or of any mortgage, deed of trust, indenture, lease,
         loan agreement, credit agreement or other material contract, agreement
         or instrument or undertaking to which such Pledgor or any of its
         Subsidiaries is a party or which purports to be binding upon such
         Pledgor or any of its Subsidiaries or upon any of their respective
         assets and will not result in the creation or imposition of (or the
         obligation to create or impose) any lien or encumbrance on any of the
         assets of such Pledgor or any of its Subsidiaries except as
         contemplated by this Agreement (other than the Liens created by the
         Collateral Documents);

               (vi)   all of the Collateral (consisting of Securities, Limited
         Liability Company Interests or Partnership Interests) has been duly and
         validly acquired, is fully paid and non-assessable and is subject to no
         options to purchase or similar rights;

               (vii)  each of the Pledged Notes, in respect to which any
         Subsidiary or Affiliate of Holdings is the obligor thereof,constitutes,
         or when executed by the obligor thereof

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

         will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of such
         obligor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the
         extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable
         bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
         laws generally affecting creditors' rights and by equitable principles
         (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law);

               (viii) the pledge, collateral assignment and delivery to the
         Pledgee of the Collateral consisting of Certificated Securities
         pursuant to this Agreement creates a valid and perfected first priority
         security interest in such Certificated Securities, and the proceeds
         thereof, subject to no prior Lien or encumbrance or to any agreement
         purporting to grant to any third party a Lien or encumbrance on the
         property or assets of such Pledgor which would include the Securities
         (other than those Liens permitted to exist with respect to the
         Collateral pursuant to the terms of the Secured Debt Agreements then in
         effect) and the Pledgee is entitled to all the rights, priorities and
         benefits afforded by the UCC or other relevant law as enacted in any
         relevant jurisdiction to perfect security interests in respect of such
         Collateral; and

               (ix)   "control" (as defined in Section 8-106 of the UCC) has
         been obtained by the Pledgee over all Collateral consisting of
         Securities with respect to which such "control" may be obtained
         pursuant to Section 8-106 of the UCC, except to the extent that the
         obligation of the applicable Pledgor to provide the Pledgee with
         "control" of such Collateral has not yet arisen under this Agreement;
         provided that in the case of the Pledgee obtaining "control" over
         Collateral consisting of a Security Entitlement, such Pledgor shall
         have taken all steps in its control so that the Pledgee obtains
         "control" over such Security Entitlement.

               (b)    Each Pledgor covenants and agrees that it will defend the
Pledgee's right, title and security interest in and to the Securities and the
proceeds thereof against the claims and demands of all persons whomsoever; and
each Pledgor covenants and agrees that it will have like title to and right to
pledge any other property at any time hereafter pledged to the Pledgee as
Collateral hereunder and will likewise defend the right thereto and security
interest therein of the Pledgee and the other Secured Parties.

               (c)    Each Pledgor covenants and agrees that it will take no
action which would violate any of the terms of any Loan Document.

ORGANIZATION AND/OR A TRANSMITTING UTILITY); JURISDICTION OF ORGANIZATION;

legal name of each Pledgor, the type of organization of such Pledgor, whether or
not such Pledgor is a Registered Organization, the jurisdiction of organization
of such Pledgor, such Pledgor's Location, the organizational identification
number (if any) of each Pledgor, and whether or not such Pledgor is a
Transmitting Utility, is listed on Annex A hereto for such Pledgor. No Pledgor
shall change its legal name, its type of organization, its status as a
Registered Organization (in the case of a Registered Organization), its status
as a Transmitting Utility or as a Person which is not a Transmitting Utility, as
the case may be, its jurisdiction of organization, its Location, or its
organizational identification number

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

(if any), except that any such changes shall be permitted (so long as not in
violation of the applicable requirements of the Secured Debt Agreements and so
long as same do not involve (x) a Registered Organization ceasing to constitute
same or (y) any Pledgor changing its jurisdiction of organization or Location
from the United States or a State thereof to a jurisdiction of organization or
Location, as the case may be, outside the United States or a State thereof) if
(i) it shall have given to the Collateral Agent not less than 15 days' prior
written notice of each change to the information listed on Annex A (as adjusted
for any subsequent changes thereto previously made in accordance with this
sentence), together with a supplement to Annex A which shall correct all
information contained therein for the respective Pledgor, and (ii) in connection
with the respective such change or changes, it shall have taken all action
reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent to maintain the security interests
of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral intended to be granted hereby at all
times fully perfected and in full force and effect. In addition, to the extent
that any Pledgor does not have an organizational identification number on the
date hereof and later obtains one, such Pledgor shall promptly thereafter
deliver a notification of the Collateral Agent of such organizational
identification number and shall take all actions reasonably satisfactory to the
Collateral Agent to the extent necessary to maintain the security interest of
the Collateral Agent in the Collateral intended to be granted hereby fully
perfected and in full force and effect.

               18. PLEDGORS' OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE, ETC. The obligations of each
Pledgor under this Agreement shall be absolute and unconditional and shall
remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released,
suspended, discharged, terminated or otherwise affected by, any circumstance or
occurrence whatsoever (other than termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 20 hereof), including, without limitation: (i) any renewal, extension,
amendment or modification of or addition or supplement to or deletion from any
Secured Debt Agreement (other than this Agreement in accordance with its terms)
or any other instrument or agreement referred to therein, or any assignment or
transfer of any thereof; (ii) any waiver, consent, extension, indulgence or
other action or inaction under or in respect of any such agreement or instrument
including, without limitation, this Agreement (other than a waiver, consent or
extension with respect to this Agreement in accordance with its terms); (iii)
any furnishing of any additional security to the Pledgee or its assignee or any
acceptance thereof or any release of any security by the Pledgee or its
assignee; (iv) any limitation on any party's liability or obligations under any
such instrument or agreement or any invalidity or unenforceability, in whole or
in part, of any such instrument or agreement or any term thereof; or (v) any
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, composition, adjustment, dissolution,
liquidation or other like proceeding relating to any Pledgor or any Subsidiary
of any Pledgor, or any action taken with respect to this Agreement by any
trustee or receiver, or by any court, in any such proceeding, whether or not
such Pledgor shall have notice or knowledge of any of the foregoing.

               19. REGISTRATION, ETC. If at any time when the Pledgee shall
determine to exercise its right to sell all or any part of the Collateral
consisting of Securities, Limited Liability Company Interests or Partnership
Interests pursuant to Section 7 hereof, and the Collateral or the part thereof
to be sold shall not, for any reason whatsoever, be effectively registered under
the Securities Act, as then in effect, the Pledgee may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, sell such Collateral, as the case may be, or part thereof by private
sale in such manner and under such circumstances as the Pledgee may deem
necessary or advisable in order that such sale may legally be effected without
such registration. Without limiting the generality of the

                                      -20-

<PAGE>

foregoing, in any such event the Pledgee, in its sole and absolute discretion
(i) may proceed to make such private sale notwithstanding that a registration
statement for the purpose of registering such Collateral or part thereof shall
have been filed under such Securities Act, (ii) may approach and negotiate with
a single possible purchaser to effect such sale, and (iii) may restrict such
sale to a purchaser who will represent and agree that such purchaser is
purchasing for its own account, for investment, and not with a view to the
distribution or sale of such Collateral or part thereof. In the event of any
such sale, the Pledgee shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling
all or any part of the Collateral at a price which the Pledgee, in its sole and
absolute discretion, in good faith deems reasonable under the circumstances,
notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might be
realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid.

               20. TERMINATION; RELEASE. (a) On the Termination Date, this
Agreement shall terminate (provided that all indemnities set forth herein
including, without limitation, in Section 11 hereof shall survive such
termination) and the Pledgee, at the request and expense of the respective
Pledgor, will promptly execute and deliver to such Pledgor a proper instrument
or instruments (including Uniform Commercial Code termination statements)
acknowledging the satisfaction and termination of this Agreement, and will duly
assign, transfer and deliver to such Pledgor (without recourse and without any
representation or warranty) such of the Collateral as may be in the possession
of the Pledgee and as has not theretofore been sold or otherwise applied or
released pursuant to this Agreement, together with any moneys at the time held
by the Pledgee or any of its sub-agents hereunder and, with respect to any
Collateral consisting of an Uncertificated Security (other than an
Uncertificated Security credited on the books of a Clearing Corporation), a
Partnership Interest or a Limited Liability Company Interest, a termination of
the agreement relating thereto executed and delivered by the issuer of such
Uncertificated Security pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(ii) or by the respective
partnership or limited liability company pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(iv). As used
in this Agreement, "Termination Date" shall mean the date upon which the
Commitments under the Credit Agreement have been terminated and all Secured
Hedging Agreements entitled to the benefits of this Agreement have been
terminated, no Note, Loan or Letter of Credit is outstanding and all other
Obligations (other than indemnities described in Section 11 hereof and described
in Section 10.3 of the Credit Agreement, and any other indemnities set forth in
any other Collateral Documents, in each case which are not then due and payable)
then due and payable have been paid in full in cash.

               (b)    In the event that any part of the Collateral is sold or
otherwise disposed of (x) at any time prior to the time at which all Loan
Document Obligations have been paid in full and all Commitments and Letters of
Credit under the Credit Agreement have been terminated, in connection with a
sale or disposition permitted by subsection 7.7 of the Credit Agreement or is
otherwise released at the direction of the Required Lenders (or all the Lenders
if required by subsection 10.6 of the Credit Agreement) or (y) at any time
thereafter, to the extent permitted by the other Secured Debt Agreements, and in
the case of clauses (x) and (y), the proceeds of such sale or disposition (or
from such release) are applied in accordance with the terms of the Credit
Agreement or such other Secured Debt Agreement, as the case may be, to the
extent required to be so applied, the Pledgee, at the request and expense of
such Pledgor, will duly release from the security interest created hereby (and
will execute and deliver such documentation, including termination or partial
release statements and the like in connection therewith) and assign, transfer
and deliver to such Pledgor (without recourse and without any representation or
warranty) such

                                      -21-

<PAGE>

of the Collateral as is then being (or has been) so sold or released and as may
be in the possession of the Pledgee and has not theretofore been released
pursuant to this Agreement.

               (c)    At any time that the respective Pledgor desires that
Collateral be released as provided in the foregoing Section 20(a) or (b), it
shall deliver to the Pledgee a certificate signed by an authorized officer of
such Pledgor stating that the release of the respective Collateral is permitted
pursuant to Section 20(a) or (b) hereof. If reasonably requested by the Pledgee
(although the Pledgee shall have no obligation to make any such request), the
relevant Pledgor shall furnish appropriate legal opinions (from counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Pledgee) to the effect set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence. The Pledgee shall have no liability whatsoever to any
Secured Party as the result of any release of Collateral by it as permitted by
this Section 20.

               (d)    The Pledgee shall have no liability whatsoever to any
other Secured Party as the result of any release of Collateral by it in
accordance with (or which the Collateral Agent in the absence of gross
negligence and willful misconduct believes to be in accordance with) this
Section 20.

               21. NOTICES, ETC. Except as otherwise specified herein, all

hereof, none of the terms and conditions of this Agreement may be changed,
waived, modified or varied in any manner whatsoever unless in writing duly

Agreement and the other Secured Debt Agreements regardless of any investigation
made by the Secured Creditors or on their behalf.

AND HEREBY FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY
SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN
BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

               (c)    EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

               26. PLEDGOR'S DUTIES. It is expressly agreed, anything herein
contained to the contrary notwithstanding, that each Pledgor shall remain liable
to perform all of the obligations, if any, assumed by it with respect to the
Collateral and the Pledgee shall not have any obligations or liabilities with
respect to any Collateral by reason of or arising out of this Agreement, except
for the safekeeping of Collateral actually in Pledgor's possession, nor shall
the Pledgee be required or obligated in any manner to perform or fulfill any of
the obligations of any Pledgor under or with respect to any Collateral.

               27. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each
of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which
shall together constitute one and the

                                      -24-

<PAGE>

same instrument. A set of counterparts executed by all the parties hereto shall
be lodged with each Pledgor and the Pledgee.

               28. SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

               29. RECOURSE. This Agreement is made with full recourse to each
Pledgor and pursuant to and upon all the warranties, representations, covenants
and agreements on the part of such Pledgor contained herein and in the other
Secured Debt Agreements and otherwise in writing in connection herewith or
therewith.

               30. ADDITIONAL PLEDGORS. It is understood and agreed that any
Subsidiary of Holdings that is required to execute a counterpart of this
Agreement after the date hereof pursuant to the requirements of the Credit
Agreement or any other Loan Document, shall automatically become a Pledgor
hereunder by executing a counterpart hereof and delivering the same to the
Pledgee. Each of Holdings and the Borrowers hereby agree that they shall and
shall cause any of their respective Subsidiaries that become a Pledgor hereunder
to (i) deliver supplements to Annexes A through G, inclusive, hereto, as are
necessary to cause such Annexes to be complete and accurate with respect to such
additional Pledgor on such date and (ii) take all actions as specified in this
Agreement as would have been taken by such Pledgor had it been an original party
to this Agreement, in each case with all documents required above to be
delivered to the Pledgee and with all documents and actions required above to be
taken to the reasonable satisfaction of the Pledgee.

               31. RELEASE OF PLEDGORS. If at any time all of the Equity
Interests of any Pledgor owned by Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries
are sold (to a Person other than either Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor) in
a transaction permitted pursuant to the Credit Agreement (and which does not
violate the terms of any other Secured Debt Agreement then in effect), then,
such Pledgor shall be released as a Pledgor pursuant to this Agreement without
any further action hereunder (it being understood that the sale of all of the
Equity Interests in any Person that owns, directly or indirectly, all of the
Equity Interests in any Pledgor shall be deemed to be a sale of all of the
Equity Interests in such Pledgor for purposes of this Section), and Pledgee is
authorized and directed to execute and deliver such instruments of release as
are reasonably satisfactory to it. At any time that Holdings desires that a
Pledgor be released from this Agreement as provided in this Section 31, Holdings
shall deliver to Pledgee a certificate signed by a principal executive officer
of Holdings stating that the release of the respective Pledgor is permitted
pursuant to this Section 31. If requested by Pledgee (although the Pledgee shall
have no obligation to make any such request), Holdings shall furnish legal
opinions (from counsel acceptable to the Pledgee) to the effect set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence. Pledgee shall have no liability whatsoever to
any other Secured Creditor as a result of the release of any Pledgor by it in
accordance with, or which it believes to be in accordance with, this Section 31.

                                      -25-

               IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each Pledgor and the Pledgee have caused this
Agreement to be executed by their duly elected officers duly authorized as of
the date first above written.
