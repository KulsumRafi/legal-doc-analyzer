and program management services for desktop, server and network assets (the
"Customer Services") required to be provided by the Seller under the Customer

and, for purposes of this Agreement, such Employees who accept an offer of
employment with the Purchaser shall be referred to herein as "Transitioned

         EXCEPT FOR SPECIFIC REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS

         IS" BASIS AND SELLER MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF
         MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUIRED

         Section 1.3 Assumed Liabilities. On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the Purchaser shall
assume from the Seller and thereafter pay, perform or otherwise discharge in
accordance with their terms, and shall hold the Seller harmless from, all of
the liabilities and obligations of the Seller with respect to, arising out of
or relating to (collectively, the "Assumed Liabilities") the ownership,
possession or use of the Acquired Assets (of any nature or kind, and whether
based in common law or statute or arising under written contract or otherwise,
known or unknown, fixed or contingent, accrued or unaccrued on a daily pro
rata basis, liquidated or unliquidated, real or potential) arising on and
after the Closing Date, including, without limitation, all of the obligations
and liabilities arising under the agreements, contracts and arrangements
included in the Acquired Assets, and liabilities relating to Transitioned
Employees as provided in Schedule 5.8.

         Section 1.4 Excluded Liabilities. The Purchaser shall not assume or
agree to pay, perform or otherwise discharge any liabilities, obligations or
expenses other than the Assumed Liabilities. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Purchaser does not assume or agree to pay, perform or otherwise discharge
the payables, liabilities and obligations of any nature or kind arising prior
to the Closing Date, whether based in common law or statute or arising under
written contract or otherwise, known or unknown, fixed or contingent, accrued
or unaccrued, liquidated or unliquidated, real or potential, as to which the
Seller or any of its affiliates is an obligor or is otherwise responsible or
liable.

         Section 1.5 Purchase Price. In consideration for the Acquired Assets,
the Purchaser shall, in addition to the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities,
pay to the Seller the sum of Six Million Eight Hundred Forty Six Thousand Four
Hundred Fifty Two Dollars ($6,846,452.00), subject to adjustment pursuant to
Section 1.6 hereafter (the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price will be paid
to the Seller as set forth in, and subject to, the terms and conditions of
Section 1.6 below.

         Section 1.6 Purchase Price: Adjustment and Payment Provisions. The
Purchaser will pay the Purchase Price in accordance with the following terms
and provisions:

         (a) At Closing, the Purchaser shall:

         (i) transfer, assign, convey and deliver to the Seller, and the
Seller shall otherwise be entitled to take possession of and retain, the bid
deposit amount previously deposited by the Purchaser, in the amount of Four
Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($420,000.00), plus interest accrued thereon
as of the Closing Date (collectively, the "Bid Deposit Payment"), said Bid
Deposit Payment to be free and clear of all liens, claims, encumbrances and
security interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser hereby agrees
that the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for payment of all Taxes
relating to interest included in the Bid Deposit Payment; and

         (ii) pay the Seller the amount of Four Million Seventy Five Thousand
Two Hundred Sixty Nine Dollars ($4,075,269.00) less the Bid Deposit Payment
(the "Cash Payment"). The Cash Payment will be made in one lump sum by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by the Seller. The Bid Deposit Payment and the Cash Payment, taken together,
in the amount of Four Million Seventy Five Thousand Two Hundred Sixty Nine
Dollars ($4,075,269.00), will be collectively referred to in this Agreement as
the "First Payment".

         (b) On or before the date that is nine (9) months after the Closing
Date, the Purchaser will pay to the Seller the amount of Two Million Three
Hundred Sixty Three Thousand Six Hundred Fifty Six Dollars ($2,363,656.00).
Purchaser's obligation to make such payment is unconditional and shall not be
subject to setoff or reduction in respect of any amount owed or claimed to be
owed by the Seller or any of its affiliates.

         (c) The Purchaser will pay the balance of the Purchase Price, Four
Hundred Seven Thousand Five Hundred Twenty Seven Dollars ($407,527.00) (the
"Holdback"), in accordance with the following terms and conditions. After any
adjustments required by the terms of this Section 1.6, the Holdback will be
paid as set forth below:

         (i) Schedule 1.6 sets forth an estimated gross profit of
approximately $16,768,000.00 in the aggregate (the "Projected Gross Profits")
to be earned from the Customer Contracts for the period from January 1, 2002
until the end of the contract terms of the Customer Contracts (for each of the
Customer Contracts, the "Runoff Term").

         (ii) In order to verify the Projected Gross Profits, the Purchaser,
within seven (7) months after the Closing Date, will verify the assumptions
and basis underlying the gross profit projections set forth on Schedule 1.6
for each of the Customer Contracts, in the aggregate, for the first six (6)
months following the Closing Date (the "Evaluation Period"). Such verification
will be limited to reviewing the following items only: (a) the Customer
Contracts; (b) the vendor contracts listed on Schedule 1.1(b)(ii); (c) actual
customer invoices; (d) actual vendor invoices; and (e) salary, incentive bonus
and retention bonus expenses for those certain Employees used to calculate the
"Projected Comdisco Cost Only" listed on Schedule 1.6. Based on the foregoing
verification, the Purchaser will adjust, if necessary, the estimated gross
profit from the Customer Contracts in the aggregate over the Runoff Term (the
"Verified Projected Gross Profits"). For the sake of clarity, the parties
hereto do not intend for the Projected Gross Profits to be measured against
the actual results obtained by the Purchaser in operating under the Customer
Contracts, but rather that the verification of Projected Gross Profits shall
be limited to a review of the underlying assumptions and basis for the
Projected Gross Profits as set forth in Schedule 1.6.

         (iii) In the event the Verified Projected Gross Profits is less than
the Projected Gross Profits, the Purchaser will decrement the Holdback on a
dollar for dollar basis for the difference. The final payment made after such
adjustment will be referred to as the "Holdback Payment". If the Purchaser
decrements the Holdback pursuant to the terms of this Section 1.6(c)(iii), the
Purchaser will be entitled to retain any balance of the Holdback remaining
after the payment to the Seller of the Holdback Payment, and the Purchase
Price will be adjusted accordingly. In no event shall the decrement to the
Holdback pursuant to the terms of this Section 1.6(c) exceed the sum of Four
Hundred Seven Thousand Five Hundred Twenty Seven Dollars ($407,527.00).

         (iv) In the event the Verified Projected Gross Profits are equal to
or greater than the Projected Gross Profits, the Purchaser will pay the Seller
the full amount of the Holdback.

         (v) The Purchaser shall perform the calculations specified above in
Sections 1.6(c)(ii), 1.6(c)(iii) and 1.6(c)(iv) and shall notify the Seller in
writing of the detail and result of those calculations (the "Holdback Notice")
not later than eight (8) months after the Closing Date (the "Holdback Notice
Date"). If the Purchaser fails to notify the Seller of the detail and result
of such calculations by the Holdback Notice Date, the Purchaser waives any and
all rights to decrement the Holdback pursuant to this Section 1.6(c), and the
Seller shall be entitled to receive the full amount of the Holdback as the
Holdback Payment. If the Seller disputes the Purchaser's calculations, the
Seller must notify the Purchaser in writing within thirty (30) days of the
Holdback Notice Date. If the Seller does not timely serve notice of the
Seller's objections, the Purchaser's calculations shall be conclusive and
binding. If the Seller disputes the Purchaser's calculations, the Purchaser
and the Seller agree to work in good faith to establish a final calculation
reasonably acceptable to both parties as promptly as practicable.

         (vi) In the event that the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to
establish a final calculation of the Holdback Payment that is reasonably
acceptable to both parties, within ninety (90) days of the Holdback Notice
Date, at the election of either party by notice to the other, the final
calculation of the Holdback Payment will be settled exclusively by arbitration
as provided in this Section 1.6(c)(vi). The arbitration and all preliminary
proceedings related thereto will be conducted in accordance with such rules as
may be agreed upon by the parties, or failing such agreement on such rules, in
accordance with the Rules for Commercial Arbitration of the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as amended from time to time and as modified
by this Agreement. The dispute will be presented to an arbitrator sitting in
Chicago, Illinois. If, within thirty (30) days of the date of the election by
a party to submit the dispute to arbitration, the parties have been unable to
agree on an arbitrator, the parties, or either of them, may submit the dispute
to the AAA for arbitration. If, within fifteen (15) days after the AAA has
provided a list of possible arbitrators, the parties are unable to agree on an
arbitrator, then either of the parties may request that the AAA select the
arbitrator. The arbitrator will possess appropriate business experience in the
principal issues in dispute and will be independent of the Purchaser and the
Seller. The arbitrator will be officed in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan
area. Except as may otherwise be agreed in writing by the parties or as
ordered by the arbitrators upon substantial justification shown, the hearing
for the dispute will be held within sixty (60) days of submission of the
dispute to arbitration. The arbitrator will render the final award within
thirty (30) days following conclusion of the hearing and any required
post-hearing briefing or other proceedings ordered by the arbitrator. The
arbitrator will state the factual basis for the award. The decision of the
arbitrator will be final and binding, except as provided in the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.ss.1, et seq., and except for errors of law based on
the findings of fact. Final judgment may be entered upon such an award in any
court of competent jurisdiction, but entry of such judgment will not be
required to make such award effective.

         (vii) Except for any amount in dispute under this Section 1.6, the
Purchaser will pay the Holdback Payment or the Holdback, as applicable, to the
Seller on the date that is nine (9) months from the Closing Date (the
"Holdback Period").

         (viii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in no event shall the Holdback Payment be negatively impacted by,
among other things: (a) actions taken solely by the Purchaser with respect to
any of the Customer Contracts after the Closing Date that adversely affect the
actual gross profits or revenue realized from the Customer Contracts during
the Evaluation Period; (b) receivable collectibility; (c) delivery failures
after the Closing Date unless due to a breach by the Seller under the Software
License Agreement; (d) defaults by customers under the Customer Contracts; or
(e) actions mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto.

         (d) The Purchase Price and the First Payment shall be reduced by
Twelve Thousand One Hundred Twelve Dollars ($12,112.00) for each calendar day
after January 1, 2002 through and including the Closing Date, until the
Closing occurs; provided, however, that neither the Purchase Price nor the
First Payment shall be reduced as otherwise provided in this Section 1.6(d) if
such delay in Closing is in any way attributable to the Purchaser's material
breach of the terms of this Agreement, provided that the Seller is not in
material breach of any of the terms of this Agreement.

         Section 1.7 Commission on Sales after Closing.

         (a) The Purchaser anticipates acquiring per contract revenue for each
of the Customer Contracts, as set forth under the "Revenue" heading in
Schedule 1.6 (the "Projected Revenue") during the Runoff Term.

         (b) As detailed below, for qualified increases or adjustments
(including, but not limited to, contract extensions, increased seat counts,
utilization of demand services, additional site rollouts and new sales to
existing customers) ("Adjustments") made to the existing scope of the Customer
Services provided under each of the Customer Contracts, the Purchaser will pay
to the Seller eight percent (8%) of any additional committed sales or revenue
as calculated on a contract-by-contract basis for each of the Customer
Contracts (as opposed to the aggregate Projected Revenue for all Customer
Contracts combined), derived from such Adjustments (the "Additional Revenue").
Purchaser's obligation to pay such Additional Revenue is unconditional and
shall not be subject to setoff or reduction in respect of any amount owed or
claimed to be owed by the Seller or any of its affiliates.

         (c) In order to qualify for payment under this Section 1.7(c),
Adjustments must be made during the period of time starting on the day after
the Closing Date and extending through the last day of the twenty-third (23rd)
calendar month thereafter (the "Adjustment Period"), regardless of whether the
Customer Services to be provided pursuant to such Adjustments are actually
commenced. Adjustments contemplated by the express terms of the Customer
Contracts, and/or any Additional Revenue that is generated by the Customer
Contracts in the course of the performance of the Customer Services, that
result in per contract revenue greater than that specified on Schedule 1.6, on
a contract-by-contract basis, for each of the Customer Contracts will qualify
for the payment as provided in Section 1.7(b). In addition, renewals and/or
extensions of the Customer Services set forth in the Customer Contracts as of
the Closing Date, and any sales of the Purchaser's information technology
management services, that result in per contract revenue greater than that
specified on Schedule 1.6, on a contract-by-contract basis, for each of the
Customer Contracts will qualify for the payment as provided in Section 1.7(b).

         (d) The Seller will not have any right to receive any payments under
Section 1.7(b) for: (a) revenue attributable to sales of any services to any
entity other than the customers specified in the Customer Contracts; or (b)
any sales to the customers specified in the Customer Contracts other than the
services contemplated by the terms of Section 1.7(c) above (i.e., sales of
network management services are not included).

         (e) The Purchaser will determine the Additional Revenue expected by
the Purchaser, on a contract-by-contract basis, within seven (7) days after
the date that the Purchaser enters into an Adjustment to a Customer Contract
during the Adjustment Period. Any such Additional Revenue shall be paid to the
Seller according to the following schedule: (a) within forty-five (45) days of
the Purchaser entering into any Adjustment, twenty-five percent (25%) of any
such Additional Revenue; (b) within six (6) months thereof, another
twenty-five percent (25%) of any such Additional Revenue; (c) within twelve
(12) months thereof, another twenty-five percent (25%) of any such Adjustment
Payment; and (d) within eighteen (18) months thereof, the final twenty-five
percent (25%) of any such Additional Revenue. The expiration of the Adjustment
Period shall not limit the Purchaser's obligation to make the foregoing
payments with respect to an Adjustment occurring during the Adjustment Period.
Additional Revenue will be paid to the Seller on a contract-by-contract basis
according to the foregoing schedule regardless of whether such revenue is
actually realized by the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall provide the Seller
with quarterly written reports that compare and itemize, on a
contract-by-contract basis, the actual revenues and Additional Revenues
realized by the Purchaser during such calendar quarter to the corresponding
periodic Projected Revenue for such calendar quarter.

         (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 1.7, for the
duration of the Adjustment Period, the Purchaser agrees that any Additional
Revenue attributable solely to a customer seat buy-down Adjustment under the
terms of the Deluxe Corporation Customer Contract listed on Schedule 1.1(b)(i)
shall be paid to the Seller as follows: (i) within five (5) days after the
date that the Purchaser receives payment of such customer seat buy-down
Adjustment, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller one hundred percent (100%)
of the portion of such Additional Revenue that is allocable to the provision
of leased equipment, hardware and other assets as provided in the Deluxe
Agreement; and (ii) within thirty (30) days after the date that the Purchaser
receives payment of such customer seat buy-down Adjustment, the Purchaser
shall pay to the Seller the sum of eight percent (8%) of the portion of such
Additional Revenue that is allocable to the provision of Customer Services.
Except as expressly provided in this Section 1.7(f), Purchaser shall pay all
other Additional Revenue to the Seller pursuant to the terms otherwise set
forth in Section 1.7.

         Section 1.8 Allocation of Purchase Price for Tax Purposes. The Seller
and the Purchaser agree that the allocation of the Purchase Price and the
Assumed Liabilities to the Acquired Assets shall be as set forth on Schedule
1.8 attached hereto, which has been approved by arm's length negotiation. If
there is any adjustment to the First Payment, other payment, or the Assumed
Liabilities, the Seller and the Purchaser agree to make appropriate
adjustments to the allocation set forth in Schedule 1.8 attached hereto. The
Seller and the Purchaser shall be bound by such allocation (and if necessary,
any revised allocation), and shall file, or cause to be filed, all applicable
federal, state, local and foreign income, franchise and excise Tax Returns in
a manner that is consistent with such allocation, unless otherwise required by
law, in which case the party making such a determination will notify the other
party of that determination as promptly as possible with the justification
therefore. If the allocation set forth on Schedule 1.8 is disputed by any
taxing authority, the party receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly
notify the other party hereto concerning the existence of such dispute and the
parties shall consult with each other with respect to all issues related to
the allocation in connection with such dispute.

         Except as disclosed in the written statement delivered by the Seller

standing (or its equivalent) under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to be so existing and in good standing or to have such power
and authority would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Seller is duly
qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure
to be so duly qualified, licensed and in good standing would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Seller has heretofore made available to the
Purchaser a complete and correct copy of the organizational documents of the
Seller, as currently in effect.

         Section 3.2 Authority Relative to this Agreement. The Seller has the
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out
its obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and of the other agreements contemplated hereby by the Seller and
the consummation by the Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action. Subject
to the entry and effectiveness of the Section 363/365 Order, this Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Seller and (assuming
this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser)
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Seller, enforceable against
the Seller in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors'
rights generally from time to time in effect and to general equitable
principles.

         Section 3.3 Consents and Approvals. No consent, approval, or
authorization of, or declaration, filing or registration with, any
Governmental Entity is required to be made or obtained by the Seller in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Acquisition, except (a) for consents, approvals or
authorizations of, or declarations or filings with, the Bankruptcy Court, and
(b) for consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, filings or
registrations, which, if not obtained, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.4 No Violations. Assuming that the consents, approvals,
authorizations, declarations, and filings referred to in Section 3.3 have been
made or obtained and shall remain in full force and effect and the conditions
set forth in Article VI shall have been satisfied or waived, neither the
execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement by the Seller, nor the
consummation by the Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by the Seller with any of the provisions hereof or of the
agreements contemplated hereby will (a) conflict with or result in any breach
of any provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Seller,
(b) result in a violation, or breach of, or constitute (with or without due
notice or lapse of time) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, vesting, payment, exercise, acceleration, suspension or
revocation) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any contract
(including the Customer Contracts), agreement or arrangement that is included
as an Acquired Asset or any note, bond, mortgage, deed of trust, security
interest, indenture, license, contract, agreement, plan or other instrument or
obligation by which the Seller's properties or any of the Acquired Assets may
be bound or affected or (c) violate any federal, state, local, foreign or
administrative order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment, principal of common
law, constitution, statute, rule or regulation ("Legal Requirements")
applicable to the Seller, its subsidiaries or the Acquired Assets, except in
the case of clauses (b) or (c) for violations, breaches, defaults,
terminations, cancellations, accelerations, creations, impositions,
suspensions or revocations that (i) would not individually or in the aggregate
have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) are excused by or unenforceable as a
result of the filing of the Petitions.

         Section 3.5 [Intentionally Omitted]

         Section 3.6 Title to Property. Upon the entry and effectiveness of

shall comply with the covenants and provisions set forth in Schedule 5.8.

         Section 5.9 Books and Records; Personnel. For a period of three (3)
years after the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be required by any
Governmental Entity or legal proceeding):

         (a) the Purchaser shall not dispose of or destroy any of the business

or under its control; and

         (b) the Purchaser shall allow the Seller and any of its directors,

         Section 5.10 [Intentionally Omitted].

         Section 5.11 Resolution of Claims.

         (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or
elsewhere, with respect to all liabilities that arise from the Seller's acts
or omissions which occur prior to the Closing Date, and which are based in any
way on the services provided by the Seller under the Customer Contracts
(including, but not limited to, disputes, claims, litigation and/or
liabilities based on incomplete or deficient service), subcontracts associated
with the Customer Contracts, and/or any liabilities arising from employment of
the Employees hired by the Purchaser, the Seller agrees as follows: either (A)
all such claims, litigation and/or liabilities will be settled and disposed of
prior to the Closing Date by the Seller at the Seller's expense; or (B) if
such claims, litigation and/or liabilities are not so settled and disposed of
prior to the Closing Date, such claims, litigation and liabilities will be
treated as Excluded Liabilities.

         (b) In addition, prior to the Closing Date, the Seller must disclose

the Seller or any of its affiliates from employing or otherwise engaging any
such employee who responds to any general public solicitation of employment
opportunities or from employing or otherwise engaging any such employee of the
Purchaser terminated by the Purchaser after the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.12 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prevent the Seller from utilizing the CLASS or IT-CAP software for the purpose
of delivering leasing or other asset management services.

any Customer Contract and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide
to the Seller timely file outputs from the CLASS, IT-CAP or equivalent

Evaluation Period and the one (1) year period after the Closing Date,
following the Seller's request a reasonable time in advance, including a
statement of the extent of the access desired and its purpose, and subject to
the Purchaser's reasonable requirements to protect confidential information,
the Purchaser shall allow the Seller and any of its directors, officers,
employees, counsel, representatives, accountants and auditors timely access to
all Employees and all business records relating to the Customer Contracts or
the Acquired Assets as are needed by the Seller for any reasonable purpose.

as if made at and as of such date (other than representations and warranties
that are made as of a specific date, which need be true and correct as of such
date), except where the failure of such representation and warranty to be true

                                 ARTICLE VIII

                         SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

         Section 8.1 Survival. All representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto shall be deemed to be material and to have been relied upon by the
parties hereto. All covenants and agreements shall survive the Closing and
shall be fully effective and enforceable until the covenant or agreement has
been fully performed in all material respects. All representations and
warranties shall survive the Closing for a period of nine (9) months after
Closing, at which time such representations and warranties shall cease to have
any further force and effect, and any claims to be made by Purchaser hereunder
for a breach of any such representations or warranties must be made prior to
any such expiration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the representations and warranties made by any party to this Agreement
shall not be affected by any investigation, verification or examination by any
other party or by anyone on behalf of any such party in connection with their
due diligence review or otherwise.

         Section 8.2 Indemnification by Purchaser. Subject to the provisions
of Section 7.3, the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold the Seller harmless
from and against any and all loss, cost, damage, expense (including court
costs and reasonable attorneys' fees), suit, action, claim, deficiency,
liability or obligation related to, caused by or arising from (i) any breach
of any representation or warranty or failure to fulfill any covenant or
agreement of Purchaser contained herein or (ii) the Assumed Liabilities.

         Section 8.3 Indemnification by the Seller. The Seller shall indemnify
and hold the Purchaser harmless from and against any and all loss, cost,
damage, diminution of value, expense (including court costs and reasonable
attorneys' fees) suit, action, claim, deficiency, liability or obligation
related to, caused by or arising from (i) any breach of representation or
warranty or failure to fulfill any covenant or agreement of the Seller
contained in this Agreement or any agreement, instrument or document
contemplated hereby, or (ii) the Excluded Liabilities.

         Section 8.4 Notice and Defense of Claims. Each indemnified party
agrees to give the indemnifying party prompt written notice of any event or
matter for which such indemnified party intends to assert a right of
indemnification under this Agreement; provided that any failure to provide
such notice shall not reduce the amount of indemnification to which the
indemnified party is otherwise entitled, except to the extent that such
failure prejudices the indemnifying party. If a third party claim is made for
which an indemnified party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Article VIII, then the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of such claim and the indemnifying party may assume primary
responsibility for the defense of such claim with counsel selected by the
indemnifying party and not reasonably objected to by the indemnified party. If
the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a third party claim as set forth
in this paragraph, then (i) in no event shall the indemnified party admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any such claim
without the indemnifying party's prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, (ii) the indemnified party shall be entitled to
participate in, but not control, the defense of such claim with its own
counsel at its own expense, and (iii) in no event shall the indemnifying party
enter into any settlement or compromise without the written consent of the
indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the
indemnifying party does not assume the defense of any such claim, the
indemnified party may defend such claim in a manner as it may deem appropriate
(including, but not limited to, settling such claim on such terms as the
indemnified party may deem appropriate). Any claim by either party for
indemnification hereunder must be asserted in writing prior to the expiration
of the survival period set forth in Section 8.1.

         Section 8.5 Liability Minimum and Limit on Liability. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser will not have the
right to receive any compensation for any claims, losses or damages suffered
by the Purchaser due to breaches by the Seller of any representations or
warranties or covenants under this Agreement, which are, in the aggregate,
less than the sum of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Seller's total
liability to the Purchaser for all claims, losses or damages of any kind under
this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement and the Software License
Agreement will not exceed the sum of One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($1,500,000.00); provided, however, that the Seller's liability to the
Purchaser for any claims, losses or damages related to the Excluded
Liabilities shall not be subject to such sum.

         Section 8.6 Exclusive Remedy. The indemnification provided for in
this Article VIII shall be the exclusive remedy for the Purchaser to assert
monetary claims for any and all losses, costs, damages, diminution in value,
expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees), suits,
actions, claims, deficiencies, liabilities or obligations related to, caused
by or arising from, (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by
the Seller in this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or the
Software License Agreement, (ii) the failure to perform any covenant,
agreement or undertaking contained in this Agreement, the Transition Services
Agreement or the Software License Agreement on the part of the Seller or (iii)
the Excluded Liabilities; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
prohibit or restrict the Purchaser from pursuing any additional remedies that
are expressly provided to the Purchaser under the Software License Agreement
or seeking or being granted equitable relief under this Agreement, the
Transition Services Agreement or the Software License Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE IX

                              GENERAL PROVISIONS

         Section 9.1 Taxes. The Seller and the Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to exempt the
sale, conveyance, assignments, transfers and deliveries to be made to the
Purchaser hereunder from any sales, use, transfer and documentary taxes or
fees (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), payable in connection with such sale,
conveyance, assignments, transfers and deliveries, to the extent provided by
Section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code. In the event that any Transfer Taxes
are payable with respect to such sale, conveyance, assignments, transfers or
deliveries, such Transfer Taxes shall be equally shared by the Seller and the
Purchaser.

communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given upon

                                 Schedule 5.8

                   Employee Benefits and Related Obligations

A.       The Purchaser shall provide the following with respect to all
Employees:

              1.  No later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, the
         Purchaser shall make offers of employment to, effective as of the
         Closing, the twenty-eight (28) Employees of the Seller identified in
         Schedule 1.1(b)(iii) in accordance with the terms set forth below.

              2.  The Purchaser shall offer to each Transitioned Employee a
         base salary equal to or better than the base salary such Transitioned
         Employee was earning on December 15, 2001. In addition, Purchaser
         will offer each Transitioned Employee a performance bonus in
         accordance with the Purchaser's general policies relating to such
         bonuses. Each Transitioned Employee shall be qualified for all
         benefits provided to the Purchaser's employees, in accordance with
         the Purchaser's policies. Each Transitioned Employee shall be given
         full service credit for the purpose of eligibility, vesting and
         accruals in the Purchaser's benefits programs, including, but not
         limited to, vacation and 401(k).

              3.  As of the Closing Date, the Transitioned Employees and their
         respective eligible dependents shall be fully covered under the
         Purchaser's health, dental, vision and other medical benefits plans
         as of the first day of the month following the day on which such
         Transitioned Employees become employees of the Purchaser; provided,
         however, that such coverage under the Purchaser's health, dental,
         vision and other medical benefits plans shall be conditioned on the
         timely completion by the Transitioned Employee of any forms or other
         documentation as required under such of the Purchaser's benefits
         plans. If necessary, in order to ensure that no lapse in coverage
         occurs for any Transitioned Employee, the Purchaser shall pay for
         COBRA coverage for the period following the Closing until such date
         that the Transitioned Employees are covered under the Purchaser's
         health, dental, vision and other medical benefits plans.

              4.  As of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall take all steps
         reasonably necessary to allow the Transitioned Employees currently
         located in Seller's Rosemont, Illinois office to transfer their work
         location to Purchaser's offices in Lisle, Illinois at a time to be
         determined by Purchaser, which shall be no later than sixty (60)
         calendar days after the Closing Date.

              5.  As of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall guarantee each
         Transitioned Employee continued employment with Purchaser for a
         period of six (6) months after the Closing Date, in accordance with
         the following terms. In the event that Purchaser terminates any
         Transitioned Employee other than for cause during such six-month
         period, Purchaser shall pay such Transitioned Employee, within 30
         days of the employee's termination date (or earlier if required by
         law), the greater of: (i) a lump sum payment amount equivalent to the
         salary or wages and retention bonuses that the Transitioned Employee
         would have been entitled to receive had he or she been employed
         throughout the remainder of the six-month period; or (ii) an amount
         equal to two (2) months of salary or wages (in the form of salary
         continuation), and two months of health benefits (including
         Purchaser's health, dental, vision and other medical benefits plans,
         in the form of a lump sum payment equal to two months' COBRA
         payments), at the monthly rates in effect in the two-month period
         immediately prior to such Transitioned Employee's termination date;
         provided, further, that the payment obligations set forth in this
         paragraph 5 shall not apply to any Transitioned Employee who
         voluntarily terminates his or her employment with the Purchaser
         during such six-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
         Purchaser reserves the right to terminate any Transitioned Employee
         at any time for cause.

              6. (a) Effective as of the Closing, each Transitioned Employee
         shall be eligible to receive from the Seller a payment in an amount
         equal to the unused vacation days/hours that were accrued with the
         Seller as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any provision to the
         contrary in this Agreement or the Schedules thereunder, within five
         (5) days of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall reimburse the
         Seller for half of the aggregate amount of any such vacation benefit
         payments made by the Seller to the Transitioned Employees; provided,
         however, that such reimbursement shall not exceed Thirty Five
         Thousand Dollars ($35,000.00).

         (b) Following the Closing Date, upon the request of the Purchaser,
         the Seller shall provide to the Purchaser within five (5) days of
         such request, for each Transitioned Employee, the number of accrued
         but unused vacation days/hours as of the Closing Date under the
         Seller's vacation benefit policy. All accrued vacation time for all
         Employees who do not accept Purchaser's offer of employment will be
         Excluded Liabilities.

B.       Purchaser may request that each Transitioned Employee submit to a
background check and drug test, in accordance with the Purchaser's policy of
requiring such verifications from all new employees. Purchaser's obligation to
employ any Transitioned Employee will be subject to the results of such check
and test.

C.       The Seller shall provide the following with respect to all Employees:

              1.  The Seller shall be solely responsible for the payment, in
         accordance with the Seller's policies and plans, of all employee
         incentive bonuses of any kind that are attributable to service by the
         Employees to the Seller before the Closing Date, and/or that accrue
         and vest prior to the Closing Date. The Seller shall be solely
         responsible for the payment, in accordance with the Seller's policies
         and plans, of all retention bonuses that are attributable to the
         Employees' service with the Seller prior to the Closing Date, and/or
         that accrue and vest prior to the Closing Date, and the Purchaser
         shall be solely responsible for the payment, in accordance with the
         Seller's policies and plans, of all retention bonuses that are
         attributable to the Transitioned Employees' service with the
         Purchaser as of and following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any
         provision in the Agreement or this Schedule 5.8, the Seller shall not
         be liable for or responsible for the payment of any benefits
         (including, without limitation, disability benefits and unemployment
         benefits) that may be payable to any Transitioned Employee as of or
         following the Closing Date and, for the avoidance of doubt, the
         Purchaser shall be liable for and solely responsible for the payment
         of any benefits (including without limitation, disability benefits
         and unemployment benefits) that may be payable to any Transitioned
         Employee as of and following the Closing Date. Further, the Purchaser
         shall indemnify and hold the Seller, its affiliates and their
         respective employees, officers directors, agents successors and
         assigns, harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
         obligations or damages (including without limitation, any penalties
         or assessments imposed by any governmental agency) with respect to
         the Transitioned Employees arising or occurring after the Closing
         Date.

              2.  The Seller shall assist in providing a COBRA election for
         any Transitioned Employee and his or her eligible dependents for whom
         such election is requested by the Purchaser, provided that the
         Purchaser shall remain responsible for all costs thereof, and the
         Purchaser shall indemnify and reimburse the Seller for all costs and
         liabilities associated with such COBRA coverage for the entire period
         elected by such Transitioned Employee and his or her eligible
         dependents.

              3.  The Seller shall allow the Transitioned Employees to work
         from the Seller's offices in Rosemont, Illinois for up to sixty (60)
         calendar days after the Closing Date.

              4.  The Seller shall take all steps reasonably necessary to
         allow the Transitioned Employees currently located in the Seller's
         Rosemont, Illinois office to transfer their work location to the
         Purchaser's offices in Lisle, Illinois no later than sixty (60)
