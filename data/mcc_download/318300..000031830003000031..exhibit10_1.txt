                  WHEREAS, the Company and Acquiror are concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
"Merger Agreement");

                  WHEREAS, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company
will call a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of voting upon the
approval of the merger described in the Merger Agreement (the "Merger") (such
meeting, together with any adjournments thereof, the "Stockholders' Meeting");

                  WHEREAS, it is the belief of the Stockholders that the Merger
is in the best interests of the Stockholders and the Company; and

                  WHEREAS, in order to induce Acquiror to enter into the Merger
Agreement, the Stockholders are willing to make certain agreements with respect
to the Stockholders' Shares.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and to induce
the Company and Acquiror to negotiate the Merger Agreement and to encourage the
Company and Acquiror to enter into the Merger Agreement and complete the Merger,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

       1.     AGREEMENT TO VOTE. The Stockholders agree to vote the
              Stockholders' Shares (and any other Shares of the Company over
              which the Stockholders have voting power) as follows:

              (a)    in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger
                     Agreement and the Merger at any Stockholders' Meeting. Any
                     such vote shall be cast (or consent in writing given, if
                     applicable) in accordance with procedures to assure that it
                     is duly counted for purposes of establishing a quorum and
                     to record the results;

              (b)    against the approval of an Acquisition Proposal (as defined
                     below) with any third party; and

              (c)    against any other transaction which is inconsistent with
                     the obligation of the Company to consummate the Merger in
                     accordance with the Merger Agreement.


       2.     LIMITATION ON VOTING POWER. The parties hereto acknowledge and
              agree that nothing contained herein is intended to restrict any
              Stockholder from voting on any matter, or otherwise from acting,
              in the Stockholder's capacity as a director of the Company with
              respect to any matter, including but not limited to, the
              management or operation of the Company.

       3.     TERMINATION. This Agreement shall terminate on the earlier of:

              (a)    by mutual consent of Acquiror and the Stockholders;

              (b)    the date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated in
                     accordance with its terms, or

              (c)    the date on which the Merger is consummated. Upon any such
                     termination, the obligations of each party to this
                     Agreement shall be extinguished.

       4.     REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE
              STOCKHOLDERS. The Stockholders hereby covenant, represent and
              warrant to the Acquiror that:

              (a)    Stockholders have the capacity and all necessary power and
                     authority to vote the Stockholders' Shares;

              (b)    this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
                     obligation of the Stockholders, enforceable in accordance
                     with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by
                     bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting
                     enforcement of creditors' rights generally;

              (c)    this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
                     delivered by the Stockholders or by the persons executing
                     this Agreement on behalf of the Stockholders;

              (d)    this Agreement will not violate, conflict with, require a
                     consent, waiver or approval under, or result in a breach or
                     default under any of the terms of any contract or
                     obligation, order, writ, injunction, decree or statute,
                     law, rule or regulation to which any Stockholder is a
                     party, which is applicable to a Stockholder or the
                     Stockholder's Shares, or by which a Stockholder is bound;

              (e)    the Stockholders further agree that, during the term of
                     this Agreement, the Stockholders will not, without the
                     prior written consent of Acquiror, sell, pledge, transfer
                     or otherwise voluntarily dispose of any of the
                     Stockholders' Shares held by the Stockholders, grant any
                     proxy with respect to the Stockholders' Shares or take any
                     other voluntary action which would have the effect of
                     removing the Stockholders' power to vote the Stockholders'
                     Shares or which would be inconsistent with this Agreement;
                     and

              (f)    this Agreement shall apply to all additional shares of
                     capital stock of the Company acquired by the Stockholders
                     on or after the date of this Agreement.

       5.     AFFILIATE'S AGREEMENT. If any of the Stockholders is determined by
              the Company to be an affiliate of the Company, such Stockholder
              shall sign an agreement regarding transfers of shares in the form
              prescribed under the Merger Agreement for affiliates of the
              Company.

       6.     SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The Stockholders hereby acknowledge that
              damages would be an inadequate remedy for any breach of the
              provisions of this Agreement and agree that the obligations of the
              Stockholders shall be specifically enforceable and that Acquiror
              shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief upon
              such a breach by the Stockholders. The Stockholders further agree
              to waive any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such
              injunctive or equitable relief. This provision is without
              prejudice to any other rights that Acquiror may have against
              Stockholders for any failure to perform the Stockholders'
              obligations under this Agreement.

       7.     GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be enforceable under and
              construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio.

       8.     DEFINITION. For purposes of this Agreement, an Acquisition
              Proposal means the acquisition or purchase of all or a material
              amount of the assets of the Company or its subsidiaries, or any
              securities of the Company or its subsidiaries, or any merger,
              tender offer, consolidation or business combination involving the
              Company or its subsidiaries.
