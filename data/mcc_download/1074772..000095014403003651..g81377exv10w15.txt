                       FIRST AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT


         THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT (this "Amendment") is dated as
of April 30, 2002 by and among LIFEPOINT HOSPITALS HOLDINGS, INC. (the
"Borrower"); the financial institutions which are now, or in accordance with
SECTION 10.6 of the Credit Agreement (hereinafter described) hereafter, parties
to the Credit Agreement hereto by execution of the signature pages to the Credit
Agreement or otherwise (collectively, the "Lenders" and each individually, a
"Lender"); FLEET NATIONAL BANK, as administrative agent ("Administrative
Agent"), for the Lenders (in such capacity as Administrative Agent, together
with its successors and assigns in such capacity, the "Agent"); CREDIT LYONNAIS
NEW YORK BRANCH and SUNTRUST BANK, as co-documentation agents (in such capacity,
together with their successors and assigns in such capacity, the "Documentation
Agents"); and DEUTSCHE BANK ALEX. BROWN INC. and BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., as
co-syndication agents (in such capacity, together with their successors and
assigns in such capacity, the "Syndication Agents").

                                    RECITALS

         A.       The Borrower, the Lenders, the Agent, the Syndication Agents
and the Documentation Agents are parties to an Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement dated as of June 19, 2001 (the "Credit Agreement"). Capitalized terms
used herein without definition have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit
Agreement.

         B.       The Borrower has requested the Lenders' consent to the
issuance of up to $300,000,000 in a public offering of Subordinated Debt by
LifePoint Parent and the payment of regularly scheduled payments of interest
thereon. Such Subordinated Debt may be convertible into common Equity Interests
of LifePoint Parent, will have a maturity at least one year after the Scheduled
Revolving Termination Date and will have no current principal payment feature.
The material terms of such Subordinated Debt are set forth on Schedule A hereto.
If no less than $150,000,000 is raised by such issuance, the Borrower has also
requested that LifePoint Parent be permitted to use up to 30% of the aggregate
total proceeds of such issuance to buy back common Equity Interests of
LifePoint Parent.

         C.       The Lenders signing below are willing to consent to such
requests on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

         NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

I.       AMENDMENTS TO CREDIT AGREEMENT. Subject to the satisfaction of each of
the conditions set forth herein, the Credit Agreement is hereby amended as
follows:


<PAGE>

         A.       ISSUANCE OF SUBORDINATED DEBT. Section 7.2(g) of the Credit
Agreement is revised by substituting the amount of $300,000,000 for $150,000,000
therein with respect to the issuance by LifePoint Parent of Subordinated Debt in
a public offering.

         B.       BUYBACK OF COMMON EQUITY INTERESTS. Section 7.8(k) of the
Credit Agreement is revised by adding the following additional language at the
end thereof:

         "and provided the public offering of Subordinated Debt by LifePoint
         Parent in 2002 has been consummated, the proceeds of such public
         offering equal or exceed $150,000,000, and further provided that no
         Default exists or could reasonably be expected to result from such
         stock repurchases, stock repurchases by LifePoint Parent of its
         publicly traded common Equity Interests for purchase prices which in
         the aggregate do not exceed 30% of the aggregate amount of total
         proceeds of such public offering."

         C.       INTEREST PAYMENTS ON SUBORDINATED DEBT. Section 7.6(g) of the
Credit Agreement is amended by adding the following language at the end of the
existing language thereto:

         "... LifePoint Parent may make regularly scheduled payments (but not
         prepayments) of interest under its Subordinated Debt issued in a public
         offering in 2002 unless, on the date of any such proposed payment or
         after giving effect thereto, a Default shall have occurred and be
         continuing or could reasonably be expected to result therefrom; and"

         D.       BUYBACK OF HIGH YIELD NOTES. By letter agreement dated 4/2/02,
the Required Lenders approved the repurchase of all of the High Yield Notes on
or before December 31, 2002. The Borrower had requested that the date by which
such High Yield Notes may be repurchased be extended from December 31, 2002 to
the Scheduled Revolving Termination Date. By agreeing to this Amendment, the
Required Lenders agree to such extension.

II.      REFERENCES IN SECURITY DOCUMENTS; CONFIRMATION OF SECURITY. All
references to the "Credit Agreement" in all Security Documents, and in any
other Loan Documents shall, from and after the date hereof, refer to the
Credit Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, and all obligations of the
Loan Parties under the Loan Documents shall be secured by and be entitled to
the benefits of said Security Documents and such other Loan Documents. All
Security Documents heretofore executed by any of the Loan Parties shall remain
in full force and effect and , by the Borrower's signature hereto and each
other Loan Party's consent hereto, such Security Documents are hereby ratified
and affirmed.

III.     REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE BORROWER. The
Borrower hereby represents and warrants to, and covenants and agrees with, the
Lenders that:

in the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all
material respects on and as of the date of this Amendment as though made at and

or existed which could reasonably be expected to have Material Adverse Effect.
As of the date hereof and after giving effect to this Amendment, no Default has
occurred and is continuing.

         C.       No Loan Party is required to obtain any consent, approval or
authorization from, or to file any declaration or statement with, any
governmental instrumentality or other agency or any other person or entity in
connection with or as a condition to the execution, delivery or performance of
this Amendment.

         D.       This Amendment constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of each Loan Party signatory hereto, enforceable against it in
accordance with their respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of
creditors generally or the application of principles of equity, whether in any
action at law or proceeding in equity, and subject to the availability of the
remedy of specific performance or of any other equitable remedy or relief to
enforce any right thereunder.

         E.       The Borrower will satisfy all of the conditions set forth in
SECTION IV.
