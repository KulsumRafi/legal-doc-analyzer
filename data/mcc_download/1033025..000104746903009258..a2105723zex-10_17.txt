            Plan. PRAECIS shall deliver to BAXTER the information that BAXTER
            and PRAECIS agree in writing is necessary for BAXTER to prepare each
            Product Master Plan. BAXTER then shall deliver two (2) copies of
            each Product Master Plan to PRAECIS within three (3) weeks of
            receipt of PRAECIS' information. PRAECIS shall either sign such

            return an amended Product Master Plan acceptable to PRAECIS, in each
            case within ten (10) business days of receipt of such Product Master
            Plan from BAXTER. If such amended Product Master Plan is not

            (10) business days of BAXTER's receipt of such amended Product
            Master Plan, and the parties shall promptly meet in order to resolve
            in good faith any outstanding disagreements with respect to such
            amended

                                        5
<Page>

            Product Master Plan. In no event shall BAXTER be required to
            schedule the Production of any Product until a Product Master Plan

            PRAECIS.

     2.2    PROJECT PLAN. For each Presentation of Product to be Produced

            amended Project Plan acceptable to PRAECIS, in each case within ten
            (10) business days of receipt of such Project Plan from BAXTER. If

            shall so notify PRAECIS within ten (10) business days of BAXTER's
            receipt of such amended Project Plan, and the parties shall promptly
            meet in order to resolve in good faith any outstanding disagreements

            be required to schedule or commence the Production of the
            Presentation of the applicable Product until a Project Plan for such
            Presentation of Product has been approved in writing by both BAXTER
            and PRAECIS.

     2.3    REGULATORY PLAN. If requested by PRAECIS, BAXTER shall provide

            for a Product. BAXTER shall deliver to PRAECIS two (2) copies of the
            Regulatory Plan for each Product requested by PRAECIS at least
            fourteen (14) calendar days after such PRAECIS request and prior to
            the date that BAXTER is to initiate Production of the registration
            Batches of the applicable Product. PRAECIS shall either sign such
            Regulatory Plan and return one (1) copy to BAXTER or shall return an
            amended Regulatory Plan acceptable to PRAECIS, in each case within
            ten (10) business days of receipt of such Regulatory Plan from
            BAXTER. If such amended Regulatory Plan is not acceptable to BAXTER,
            then BAXTER shall so notify PRAECIS within ten (10) business days of
            BAXTER's receipt of such amended Regulatory Plan, and the parties
            shall promptly meet in order to resolve in good faith any
            outstanding disagreements with respect to such amended Regulatory
            Plan. BAXTER shall have no obligation to conduct regulatory services
            for a Product until the Regulatory Plan for such Product has been
            agreed upon by the parties.

     2.4    AMENDMENT OF PLANS. Each Project Plan, Regulatory Plan and Product
            Master Plan may be amended from time to time only upon mutual
            written agreement of PRAECIS and BAXTER.

     2.5    NO AMENDMENT OF AGREEMENT. No Project Plan, Regulatory Plan or
            Product Master Plan shall be deemed to amend this Agreement. In the
            event that the terms of any Project Plan, Regulatory Plan or Product
            Master Plan are inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, this
            Agreement shall control, unless otherwise

            indicating an intent by the parties to amend this Agreement in
            accordance with Article 26. Upon approval in writing by both BAXTER
            and PRAECIS of any Project Plan, Regulatory Plan or Product Master
            Plan, such Project Plan, Regulatory Plan or Product Master Plan
            shall be deemed to be incorporated herein by reference and made a
            part of this Agreement.

     2.6    EFFECT OF FAILURE TO EXECUTE PLANS OR ADDENDUM. No failure to
            execute a Project Plan, Product Master Plan or Regulatory Plan with
            respect to a particular Product will relieve either party of any
            obligation that has accrued with respect to such Product. Provided,
            however, that PRAECIS shall not be liable for any such accrued costs
            or expenses incurred by BAXTER in connection with such Product
            unless such costs or expenses had been expressly approved in writing
            by PRAECIS prior to such costs or expenses having been incurred.

            connection with such reprocessing, rework, reproduction or change

            BAXTER, its officers, directors, employees or agents; (b) breach by
            BAXTER of its representations, warranties, covenants or other

            the Product.

            expense, the BAXTER Supplied Components, including without
            limitation all packaging materials listed in the applicable Product

            Components and Drug Product Intermediate, is imported into the

ARTICLE 4, FORECASTS, ORDERS AND CAPACITY

     4.1    FORECASTS AND COMMITMENTS.

            4.1.1   LONG RANGE FORECAST. Within   ***   from the Signing Date,
                    and prior to   ***   , 2003, and   ***   of each

                    Product to be Produced and delivered to PRAECIS (the "Long
                    Range Forecast"). BAXTER specifically agrees that the Long
                    Range Forecasts submitted by PRAECIS will be for general
                    planning purposes only, and shall not be binding on PRAECIS

                    (the "Rolling Forecast") for the following four (4) calendar
                    quarters. BAXTER specifically agrees that the Rolling
                    Forecasts submitted by PRAECIS will be for general planning
                    purposes only, and shall not be binding on PRAECIS or
                    BAXTER.

            4.1.3   PURCHASE AND SUPPLY COMMITMENTS.

                    (a)  BAXTER shall supply PRAECIS with the quantity of
                    Product ordered by PRAECIS, unless the overall quantity
                    ordered for a calendar quarter   ***   of the quantity of
                    Product forecasted in the immediately preceding Rolling
                    Forecast for such calendar quarter, in which case BAXTER
                    shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to supply
                    quantities   ***   of such quantity forecasted by PRAECIS
                    in the immediately preceding Rolling Forecast for such
                    calendar quarter.

                    (b)  From the Effective Date through the first anniversary
                    of the Delivery Date of the first Batch shipped by or on
                    behalf of PRAECIS to third parties for commercial use in the
                    United States (the "Initial Annual Minimums Period"),
                    PRAECIS shall order and purchase in any calendar year no
                    less than three hundred seventy five thousand dollars
                    ($375,000) of Product (the "Initial Annual Minimum"). The
                    Initial Annual Minimum shall be prorated for any period
                    covered by the Initial Annual Minimums Period that does not
                    constitute a full calendar year. In the event PRAECIS orders
                    and purchases less than the Initial Annual Minimum in any
                    calendar year, then, at the end of such calendar year,
                    BAXTER may invoice PRAECIS for the difference between the
                    Purchase Price of Product actually ordered and purchased and
                    the Initial Annual Minimum and PRAECIS shall pay such amount
                    within thirty (30) days from the date of invoice.

                    (c)  After the Initial Annual Minimums Period, the first
                    calendar year of each Long Range Forecast will be used to
                    determine the minimum quantity that PRAECIS shall purchase
                    from BAXTER for such calendar year (the "Annual
                    Obligation"). The Annual Obligation will be calculated as
                    ***   of the forecasted quantity for the first year of the
                    Long Range Forecast (for purposes of calculating the first
                    such Annual Obligation, using the Long Range Forecast whose
                    first calendar year includes the date on which the Initial
                    Annual Minimums Period expired, and prorating such Annual
                    Obligation based on the months remaining in such calendar
                    year); provided, however, in no event shall the Annual
                    Obligation be a quantity which would generate an aggregate
                    Purchase Price of Product less than six hundred fifty
                    thousand dollars ($650,000). The Annual Obligation shall be
                    applicable only when BAXTER is not in breach of its
                    obligations under this Agreement and all Firm Purchase
                    Orders (as defined in Section 4.2)

                    have been filled in accordance with the terms and conditions
                    of this Agreement.

     4.2    PURCHASE ORDERS. In order to purchase Product under this Agreement,
            PRAECIS shall submit Purchase Orders to BAXTER. PRAECIS shall not,
            without the written consent of BAXTER, propose a Delivery Date in a
            Purchase Order earlier than   ***   from the date PRAECIS submits
            the Purchase Order; provided, however, that for Purchase Orders that
            PRAECIS designates are for audit dose Batches, such proposed
            Delivery Date shall not be earlier than   ***   from the date
            PRAECIS submits the Purchase Order. No later than ten (10) days
            after receipt by BAXTER of a Purchase Order, BAXTER shall provide a
            confirmation of receipt of such Purchase Order confirming the
            Delivery Date of the Product, BAXTER's scheduled date of filling for
            the Product, and the scheduled date for PRAECIS delivery of the Drug
            Product Intermediate for the Product ordered thereunder. Upon
            PRAECIS' receipt of the confirmation, such Purchase Order shall
            become a "Firm Purchase Order" and the Delivery Date set forth
            therein shall be a "Firm Delivery Date" binding upon BAXTER. In the
            event that PRAECIS cancels a Firm Purchase Order without BAXTER's
            written consent, PRAECIS shall pay the Cancellation Fees, if any, as
            set forth in the Product Master Plan as may be modified by each
            Project Plan; provided, however, that PRAECIS shall be entitled to
            postpone a Firm Delivery Date for up to   ***   without penalty upon
            written notice to BAXTER, which written notice shall not be given
            ***   prior to the scheduled date of filling for the Product (such
            date provided by BAXTER to PRAECIS as set forth in Section 4.2). To
            the extent of any conflict between Purchase Orders submitted by
            PRAECIS and this Agreement, this Agreement shall control.

     4.3    DELIVERY DELAYS.

            4.3.1   FAILURE TO MEET FIRM DELIVERY DATE. If BAXTER is unable to
                    meet the Firm Delivery Date, then BAXTER shall so notify
                    PRAECIS promptly upon becoming aware thereof and shall
                    provide to PRAECIS an alternative delivery date which shall
                    not be more than   ***   later than the Firm Delivery Date
                    (or such later date as may be agreed by both parties);
                    provided, however that: (a) BAXTER shall use commercially
                    reasonable efforts to make delivery earlier than the
                    alternative delivery date and as close as possible to the
                    Firm Delivery Date; and (b) unless otherwise agreed by both
                    parties, such alternative delivery date may not subsequently
                    be extended again pursuant to this sentence. In the event
                    that BAXTER's failure to meet the Firm Delivery Date, or any
                    alternative delivery date, is   ***   APPROXIMATELY 5 LINES
                    OMITTED   ***   , then, in addition to any other rights and
                    remedies that may be available to PRAECIS,   ***   .

            4.3.2   DELAYS IN DRUG PRODUCT INTERMEDIATE AND PRAECIS SUPPLIED
                    COMPONENTS. BAXTER shall have no responsibility for delays
                    in delivery of Product caused solely by delays in receipt of
                    Drug Product Intermediate or PRAECIS Supplied Components.
                    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Firm
                    Purchase Order to the contrary, in the event that BAXTER
                    receives the Drug Product Intermediate for the Production of
                    Product from PRAECIS outside of the timeframe specified in
                    Section 3.3, BAXTER shall   ***   and BAXTER shall Produce
                    such Product as per the original schedule. BAXTER shall
                    invoice PRAECIS for such fee and PRAECIS shall pay such fee
                    within thirty (30) days from the date of invoice.
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event BAXTER receives
                    the Drug Product Intermediate for Production of Product from
                    PRAECIS less than   ***   prior to the scheduled date of
                    ***   for such Product, BAXTER may cancel Production of such
                    Product and invoice PRAECIS the Cancellation Fees as set
                    forth in the Product Master Plan and PRAECIS shall pay such
                    fees within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice.

            directly in connection with the Production of Product. BAXTER shall
            provide PRAECIS with no less than   ***   written notice of any such
            Purchase Price adjustment, which notice shall set forth the amount
            of such Purchase Price adjustment and the effective date of such

ARTICLE 7, ACCEPTANCE OF PRODUCT

     7.1    CONFORMITY REVIEW. Within   ***   (the "Document Review Period")
            from the date the Released Executed Batch Record with respect to a
            Batch of Product is delivered to PRAECIS, PRAECIS shall deliver to
            BAXTER a Quality Assurance Disposition or a written notice of
            nonconformance ("Notice of Nonconformance") indicating that such
            Batch does not conform to cGMPs, Product Specifications, Master
            Batch Record or BAXTER SOPs (collectively the "Product
            Requirements"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
            upon receipt of the Released Executed Batch Record PRAECIS discovers
            minor issues, inconsistencies or deviations in such Released
            Executed Batch Record, then PRAECIS shall notify BAXTER promptly and
            BAXTER shall have   ***   from the date of notification to address
            and correct such minor issues, inconsistencies or deviations and
            resubmit the Released Executed Batch Record to PRAECIS. Upon receipt
            of the resubmitted Released Executed Batch Record, PRAECIS shall
            have   ***   to: (a) issue a Quality Assurance Disposition; (b)
            issue a Notice of Nonconformance; or (c) extend the time period for
            correction of the outstanding issues, not to exceed an additional
            ***   unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.

     7.2    NOTICE OF NONCONFORMANCE. If PRAECIS delivers a Notice of
            Nonconformance to BAXTER indicating that a Batch does not conform to
            the Product Requirements, then BAXTER will investigate such alleged
            non-conformity, and: (a) if BAXTER agrees such Batch is
            non-conforming, deliver to PRAECIS a corrective action plan within
            ***   after receipt of PRAECIS' Notice of Nonconformance, or such
            additional time as is reasonably required if such investigation or
            plan requires data from sources other than PRAECIS or BAXTER; or (b)
            if BAXTER disagrees with PRAECIS' determination that the Batch is
            non-conforming, then BAXTER shall so notify PRAECIS by telephone
            within the   ***   period and confirm such notice in writing by
            overnight delivery.

     7.3    REMEDIES FOR NON-CONFORMING PRODUCT.

            7.3.1   RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES. If the parties dispute whether a
                    Batch is conforming or non-conforming,   ***   , then
                    samples or documents from the Batch will be submitted to a
                    mutually acceptable third party laboratory or consultant for
                    resolution, whose determination of conformity or
                    non-conformity, and the cause thereof, shall be binding upon
                    the parties. The non-prevailing party shall bear the costs
                    of such laboratory or consultant.

            7.3.2   REPLACEMENT PRODUCT. In the event BAXTER agrees that the
                    Batch is non-conforming or the laboratory or consultant
                    determines that the Batch is non-conforming pursuant to
                    Section 7.3.1, BAXTER shall replace such non-conforming
                    Batch within the later of: (a)   ***   from receipt of
                    replacement Drug Product Intermediate from PRAECIS, or (b)
                    ***   from the date of determination by the laboratory or
                    consultant of non-conformity or agreement by BAXTER of such
                    non-conformity, and such replaced Batch again shall be
                    subject to the acceptance procedures of this Article 7.

            7.3.3   PRAECIS COSTS FOR REPLACEMENT PRODUCT. PRAECIS shall pay for
                    all Product, including replacement Product and the cost of
                    Drug Product Intermediate therefor, except as specifically
                    set forth in Section 7.3.4.

            7.3.4   BAXTER COSTS FOR REPLACEMENT PRODUCT. In the event BAXTER
                    agrees, or the laboratory or consultant determines, that a
                    Batch is non-conforming,   ***   as a result of:   ***
                    APPROXIMATELY 4 LINES OMITTED   ***   , then BAXTER shall
                    incur the cost of Production of the replacement Batch, shall
                    reimburse PRAECIS for its actual cost of the Drug Product
                    Intermediate for the replacement Batch which cost shall not
                    exceed the amount set forth in the Product Master Plan, and
                    shall reimburse PRAECIS for its actual cost of the PRAECIS
                    Supplied Components for the replacement Batch, as specified
                    in the Product Master Plan.

            7.3.5   SOLE REMEDIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Except as
                    provided in Section 7.4, Section 9.4 and Section 14.2, this
                    Section 7.3 sets forth BAXTER's entire liability and
                    PRAECIS' sole and exclusive remedies for delivery of
                    non-conforming Product.

     7.4    DRUG PRODUCT INTERMEDIATE YIELD ACCOUNTABILITY.

            7.4.1   GUARANTEED YIELD The Purchase Price is based upon a
                    guaranteed yield, expressed as a percentage, of conforming
                    vials of Product in each Batch (the "Guaranteed Yield").

                    Batches), within   ***   after the end of each   ***
                    period thereafter BAXTER shall provide PRAECIS with a
                    written report showing the actual yield of conforming vials
                    of Product in each Batch during such   ***   period (the
                    "Yield") calculated as set forth in the Product Master Plan.
                    If the average Yield, expressed as a percentage, for all
                    such Batches during such   ***   period (the "Average
                    Yield") is less than the Guaranteed Yield (as determined
                    pursuant to Section 7.4.2), then BAXTER shall credit PRAECIS
                    with a dollar amount equal to the product of: (a) the cost
                    to PRAECIS of the Drug Product Intermediate contained   ***
                    in the Batch, multiplied by (b) the difference between the
                    Guaranteed Yield and the Average Yield, expressed as a
                    percentage, multiplied by (c) the number of vials filled in
                    connection with such Batches, calculated as specified in the
                    Product Master Plan; provided, however, that such dollar
                    amount shall not exceed the amount set forth in the Product
                    Master Plan. BAXTER at all times shall endeavor in good
                    faith to achieve the highest practical Yield on all Batches.

            7.4.2   SETTING THE GUARANTEED YIELD. The Guaranteed Yield for the
                    first   ***   Batches (not including process validation
                    Batches) (the "Initial Guaranteed Yield") shall be the
                    average yield of conforming vials in the process validation
                    Batches, which shall be agreed in writing by the parties no
                    later than the date of the   ***   non-process validation
                    shipment of commercial Product to PRAECIS and shall remain
                    in effect through the   ***   Batch (not including process
                    validation Batches). The Guaranteed Yield for the   ***
                    commercial Batch (not including process validation Batches)
                    and subsequent Batches shall be the average yield of
                    conforming vials in the first   ***   Batches (not including
                    process validation Batches) which shall be agreed in writing
                    by the parties no later than the date of shipment of such
                    Batch to PRAECIS and shall remain in effect through the  ***
                    period following the shipment of such Batch. At the end of
                    such   ***   period, and every subsequent   ***   period
                    thereafter, BAXTER and PRAECIS shall review the Average
                    Yield for all Batches of such Product accepted by PRAECIS
                    during such   ***   period. If such Average Yield has been
                    consistently higher or lower than the Guaranteed Yield
                    during the course of such period, then the Guaranteed Yield
                    may be revised by the mutual agreement of the parties in
                    writing. In addition, the Guaranteed Yield may be revised by
                    mutual agreement of the parties in writing whenever
                    significant changes are made to the Production process.

     7.5    NON-CONFORMING DRUG PRODUCT INTERMEDIATE. If Product is rejected by
            PRAECIS and such Product's failure to meet the Product Requirements
            is determined in accordance with Section 7.3.1 to be the result of
            the failure at the time delivered to BAXTER of Drug Product
            Intermediate to meet the Component

            shall be solely responsible for such non-conformity and such
            non-conformity shall not be deemed to be non-conforming solely as a
            result of the negligence or willful misconduct of BAXTER.

     7.6    PRODUCT COMPLAINTS. PRAECIS will promptly notify BAXTER of any
            Product complaints received by PRAECIS which may be related to
            Production by BAXTER and will supply to BAXTER any samples of
            Product which are the subject of such complaint. BAXTER will notify
            PRAECIS promptly of any Product complaints received by BAXTER which
            relate to the Product or the Production. Each party shall provide
            reasonable details of the complaint along with the notification.
            Upon BAXTER's receipt of any such notification from PRAECIS, BAXTER
            promptly shall investigate the complaint and shall provide PRAECIS
            with a written report of such investigation, including a review of
            the BAXTER SOPs related to such complaint, within thirty (30)
            calendar days of BAXTER's receipt of PRAECIS' written notification
            unless additional time is required for investigation. In the event
            that the parties dispute the cause of or corrective action plan
            required to address the complaint, the matter shall be handled in
            accordance with Section 7.3.1.

                    of any regulatory development or any additions or changes
                    that materially affect the Production of or Presentation for
                    Product. BAXTER agrees to inform PRAECIS within   ***   of
                    the result of any regulatory development or any additions or
                    changes to BAXTER SOPs that materially affect the Production
                    or Presentation of a Product. Each party shall notify the
                    other of any proposed changes to Master Batch Records,
                    Product Specifications or other Production changes with

                    from the other prior to implementation of any such changes.

            9.9.2   PRODUCT-SPECIFIC CHANGES. If, after the Effective Date,
                    either party determines that facility, equipment, process or
                    system changes are required as a result of changes in
                    requirements set forth by the FDA or any other Regulatory
                    Authority, and such regulatory changes apply primarily to
                    the Production and supply of one or more Products, then
                    PRAECIS and BAXTER jointly will review and discuss such
                    requirements. If the parties agree in writing that such
                    changes are mandated by the change in Regulatory Authority
                    requirements, then PRAECIS shall have the option to: (a)

                    primarily to the Production and supply of one or more
                    Products; or (b) terminate this Agreement, in whole, or in
                    part as it relates to the applicable Product, upon   ***
                    written notice to BAXTER.

            equipment in order to Produce Product for PRAECIS, then the costs of
            such equipment and all spare parts and replacement parts shall be
            paid by PRAECIS. BAXTER shall advise PRAECIS of the specialized
            equipment required and the estimated costs associated with the
            purchase and installation of such equipment prior to any such
            equipment purchase. If PRAECIS, in its sole discretion, determines
            that it does not desire to pay the costs for such equipment, then
            PRAECIS shall have the right to terminate this Agreement only with
            respect to such Product for which such equipment is required, upon
            ***   prior written notice to BAXTER. PRAECIS shall be invoiced for
            all approved equipment and spare part costs after installation and
            acceptance of such equipment by BAXTER, and PRAECIS shall make
            payments promptly thereafter.

                    of the Uniform Commercial Code. Such financing statement
                    shall specifically describe the Equipment and shall
                    otherwise be in a standard and customary form as agreed to
                    by BAXTER and PRAECIS. PRAECIS shall deliver a termination
                    statement to BAXTER at or prior to removal of the Equipment
                    from BAXTER's premises or at or prior to BAXTER's purchase
                    of such Equipment as provided herein.

            9.11.3  EQUIPMENT INSURANCE. PRAECIS shall procure and maintain, at
                    its expense, from, with respect to the Equipment described
                    in Section 9.10, the delivery date, and, with respect to
                    Equipment delivered prior to the date hereof, the date
                    hereof, through either the date such Equipment is removed
                    from BAXTER's facility by PRAECIS or the consummation of the
                    purchase of such Equipment by BAXTER pursuant to Section
                    9.11.4, insurance covering the Equipment of not less than
                    two and one half

                    million dollars ($2,500,000) for all such Equipment. Upon
                    the written request of BAXTER, PRAECIS promptly shall
                    deliver to BAXTER a certificate of insurance evidencing the
                    insurance required hereunder. If PRAECIS fails to furnish
                    such certificate within fifteen (15) calendar days after
                    BAXTER's written request, BAXTER, at its option, may obtain
                    the PRAECIS insurance and PRAECIS shall promptly reimburse
                    BAXTER for the direct cost of the same. Any deductible shall
                    be the sole responsibility of PRAECIS.

            9.11.4  REMOVAL OF EQUIPMENT. Within thirty (30) days from the date
                    of termination or expiration of this Agreement, PRAECIS, at
                    its option, shall either: (a) remove the Equipment from
                    BAXTER's facility at PRAECIS' expense; or (b) offer to sell
                    such Equipment (in whole or in part), in writing, to BAXTER
                    at a purchase price equal to the fair market value of such
                    Equipment; provided, that in no case shall the fair market
                    value of such Equipment be less than the then current book
                    value of such Equipment, calculating depreciation of such
                    Equipment in accordance with United States generally
                    accepted accounting principals. If PRAECIS offers to sell
                    such Equipment to BAXTER pursuant to the preceding sentence,
                    BAXTER must deliver its acceptance of such offer, in
                    writing, to PRAECIS within ten (10) days after receipt of
                    such offer. If the purchase and sale of such Equipment is
                    not completed within thirty (30) days after PRAECIS' receipt
                    of such acceptance, PRAECIS' obligation to sell, and
                    BAXTER's obligation to purchase, such Equipment shall be
                    null and void, unless the parties otherwise agree in
                    writing. In the event PRAECIS offers to sell the Equipment
                    to BAXTER and BAXTER declines or otherwise fails to purchase
                    such Equipment, PRAECIS shall submit to BAXTER a written
                    plan to remove such Equipment from BAXTER's facility no
                    later than thirty (30) days following the date that BAXTER
                    so declines or fails to purchase such Equipment and shall
                    complete removal of such Equipment from BAXTER's facility no
                    later than sixty (60) days following the date that BAXTER so
                    declines or fails to purchase such Equipment.

     9.12   ANNUAL PRODUCT REVIEW. BAXTER shall conduct an annual review of the
            commercial services performed by BAXTER under this Agreement which
            review shall include, but not be limited to, tracking and trending
            of all Batch records, stability and Production data. BAXTER and
            PRAECIS will determine, via a protocol, a mutually agreed upon date
            for completion of the review each year. BAXTER shall provide to
            PRAECIS a written report containing the results of such annual
            review according to the time line established in the protocol.

ARTICLE 10, REGULATORY

     10.1   REGULATORY APPROVALS. PRAECIS will diligently pursue Regulatory
            Approval of marketing licenses for each Product Produced by BAXTER
            hereunder. PRAECIS will advise BAXTER of document requirements in
            support of NDA and/or ANDA and similar applications required of
            foreign governments and agencies including amendments, license
            applications, supplements and maintenance of such. BAXTER will
            provide documents and assist PRAECIS in preparation of submissions
            to Regulatory Authorities (both U.S. and foreign) designated by
            PRAECIS in support of PRAECIS' NDAs, ANDAs, similar applications
            required by foreign governments and licenses. All regulatory
            submission preparation and maintenance to be performed by BAXTER for
            PRAECIS shall be specified in the Regulatory Plan. Prior to
            submission to the Regulatory Authority, PRAECIS will provide BAXTER
            with a copy of the CMC section of any NDA or ANDA for review and
            comment. A final copy of the CMC section will be provided by PRAECIS
            to BAXTER upon submission to the Regulatory Authority. Within   ***
            of Regulatory Approval, PRAECIS will notify BAXTER of such approval
            and the anticipated date of Product launch to the market.

     10.2   REGULATORY AUTHORITY INSPECTIONS. At PRAECIS' request, BAXTER will
            authorize Regulatory Authorities to review any of PRAECIS'
            applications on PRAECIS' behalf. BAXTER will notify PRAECIS within
            ***   of all contacts with Regulatory Authorities (both written and
            verbal) related to each Product. BAXTER shall permit PRAECIS to be
            on site at the BAXTER facility during any such inspection that
            directly affects the Production of Product. BAXTER shall inform
            PRAECIS of the result of any regulatory inspection that directly or
            indirectly affects the Production of a Product, including without
            limitation any notice of inspection, notice of violation or other
            similar notice received by BAXTER affecting Production, testing,
            storage or handling of a Product. In the event of an FDA inspection
            which directly involves the Production of a Product, PRAECIS shall
            be immediately informed by BAXTER of the issuance of the Notice of
            Inspection (FDA Form 482) and provided a copy thereof. In the event
            that there are Inspectional Observations (FDA Form 483) resulting
            from an inspection that directly involves the Product, PRAECIS shall
            be informed immediately by BAXTER and provided a copy thereof as
            promptly as possible. BAXTER shall provide PRAECIS the opportunity
            to participate in the preparation of BAXTER's responses to any
            Regulatory Authority directly concerning Production of Product;
            provided, however, that BAXTER shall have final authority as to the
            content of any such responses. In addition, BAXTER shall supply
            PRAECIS with any manufacturing, testing or in-process control data
            within   ***   , if requested as the result of a regulatory
            inspection, an annual audit by PRAECIS or a potential regulatory
            exposure such as a recall or significant complaint relating to the
            Product or the Production services.

            to BAXTER a non-exclusive, royalty free license, without the right
            to sublicense, to display the PRAECIS Trademarks for the sole
            purpose of allowing BAXTER to fulfill its express Production
            responsibilities under this Agreement in accordance with the
            relevant Master Batch Record and subject at all times to the
            trademark usage standards and policies provided by PRAECIS to BAXTER

            part.

     11.2   USE OF TRADEMARKS. PRAECIS may at any time, in PRAECIS' sole and
            absolute discretion, and at PRAECIS' expense, require that BAXTER
            modify the display of the PRAECIS Trademarks, or substitute an
            alternative mark for any PRAECIS Trademark, and BAXTER shall comply
            with such requirement promptly. Title to and ownership of the
            PRAECIS Trademarks at all times shall remain with PRAECIS. All uses
            of the PRAECIS Trademarks will inure solely to PRAECIS and BAXTER
            hereby irrevocably assigns to PRAECIS all such right, title and
            interest, together with any goodwill or other benefits, if any, in

            PRAECIS Trademarks hereunder. At no time during or after the Term of
            this Agreement shall BAXTER attempt to register or cause to be
            registered PRAECIS Trademarks or any trademarks, service marks or
            trade names confusingly similar to those of PRAECIS. BAXTER shall
            not form and use for itself any combination marks with the PRAECIS
            Trademarks.

     11.3   ENFORCEMENT OF TRADEMARKS. PRAECIS shall be solely responsible for
            selecting, registering and enforcing the PRAECIS Trademarks used to
            identify the Product (it being understood that PRAECIS shall
            determine in which jurisdictions such registration and/or
            enforcement is appropriate) and, except as set forth in Section
            11.1, BAXTER shall have no right, title or interest in or to PRAECIS
            Trademarks.

            harmless PRAECIS and its Affiliates and any of their respective
            directors, officers, managers, employees, subcontractors and agents
            (the "PRAECIS Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all
            Losses resulting solely from: (a) the negligence or willful
            misconduct of a BAXTER Indemnified Party; or (b) a breach by BAXTER
            of its representations, warranties, covenants or other obligations
            under this Agreement.

     14.3   INDEMNITEE OBLIGATIONS. A party (the "Indemnitee") which intends to
            claim indemnification under this Article 14 shall promptly notify
            the other party (the "Indemnitor") in writing of any action, claim
            or other matter in respect of which the Indemnitee or any of its
            Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers,
            employees, subcontractors, or agents, intend to claim such
            indemnification; provided, however, that failure to provide such
            notice within a reasonable period of time shall not relieve the
            Indemnitor of any of its obligations

                                       30
<Page>

            hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor is prejudiced by such
            failure. The Indemnitee shall permit, and shall cause its
            Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees,
            subcontractors and agents to permit, the Indemnitor, at its
            discretion, to settle any such action, claim or other matter, and
            the Indemnitee agrees to the complete control of such defense or
            settlement by the Indemnitor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
            Indemnitor shall not enter into any settlement that would adversely
            affect the Indemnitee's rights hereunder, or impose any obligations
            on the Indemnitee in addition to those set forth herein, in order
            for it to exercise such rights, without Indemnitee's prior written
            consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
            delayed. No such action, claim or other matter shall be settled
            without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor, which shall not
            be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnitee,
            its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees,
            subcontractors and agents shall fully cooperate with the Indemnitor
            and its legal representatives in the investigation and defense of
            any action, claim or other matter covered by the indemnification
            obligations of this Article 14. The Indemnitee shall have the right,
            but not the obligation, to be represented in such defense by counsel
            of its own selection and at its own expense.

ARTICLE 15, INSURANCE

     15.1   PRAECIS INSURANCE. PRAECIS shall procure and maintain, during the
            Term of this Agreement and for a period one (1) year beyond the
            expiration date of Product, Commercial General Liability Insurance,
            including without limitation, Product Liability and Contractual
            Liability coverage (the "PRAECIS Insurance"). The PRAECIS Insurance
            shall cover amounts not less than fifteen million dollars
            ($15,000,000) combined single limit and shall be with an insurance

            PRAECIS promptly shall deliver to BAXTER a certificate of the
            PRAECIS Insurance evidencing such coverage and, if applicable, the
            endorsement of BAXTER as an additional insured. If PRAECIS fails to
            furnish such certificate within fifteen (15) calendar days after
            BAXTER's request, BAXTER, at its option, may obtain the PRAECIS
            Insurance and PRAECIS promptly shall reimburse BAXTER for the direct
            cost of the same. Any deductible and/or self insurance retention
            shall be the sole responsibility of PRAECIS.

     15.2   BAXTER INSURANCE. BAXTER is, and shall during the Term of this
            Agreement remain, self-insured for liabilities typically covered by
            Commercial General Liability policies, including contractual
            liability and liability related to bodily injury and property
            damage, in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.

ARTICLE 16, RECALL OF PRODUCT

     In the event PRAECIS shall be required to recall any Product Produced
     hereunder because such Product may violate local, state or federal laws or
     regulations, the laws or regulations of any applicable foreign government
     or agency or the Product Specifications, or in the event that PRAECIS
     elects to institute a voluntary recall, PRAECIS shall be responsible for
     coordinating such recall. PRAECIS promptly shall notify BAXTER if any
     Product Produced hereunder is the subject of a recall and provide BAXTER
     with a copy of all documents relating to such recall. BAXTER shall
     cooperate with PRAECIS in connection with any such recall. PRAECIS shall be
     responsible for all of the costs and expenses of any such recall unless
     such recall is caused   ***   APPROXIMATELY 3 LINES OMITTED   ***   , in
     which case BAXTER will bear all reasonable costs associated with such
     recall, product withdrawal or field correction (including but not limited
     to costs associated with receiving and administering the recalled Product
     and notification of the recall to those persons whom PRAECIS deems
     appropriate); provided however that solely in respect of administrative and
     operating costs and expenses, BAXTER's liability for conducting the recall
     shall be in accordance with and up to a cumulative total maximum amount set
     forth in the chart below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
     BAXTER's liability for costs associated with such recall, product
     withdrawal or field correction exceed the Purchase Price for the Product
     which is the subject of such recall, product withdrawal or field
     correction.

            copyright purposes. For the purposes of all matters other than
            United States copyright laws, and to the extent that the PRAECIS
            Inventions may not fall within the specifically enumerated works
            that constitute works made for hire under the United States
            copyright laws, BAXTER hereby assigns all copyrights, trademarks,
            trade secrets, patents or other proprietary rights and all other
            right, title and interest throughout the world and without further
            consideration in and to the PRAECIS Inventions to PRAECIS. For
            purposes of this Agreement, "Invention" shall mean information
            relating to any innovation, improvement, development, discovery,
            computer program, device, trade secret, method, know-how, process,
            technique or the like, whether or not written or otherwise fixed in
            any form or medium, regardless of the media on which contained and
            whether or not patentable or copyrightable.

     17.2   PATENT PROSECUTION. PRAECIS shall have the world wide right to
            control the drafting, filing, prosecution and maintenance of patents
            covering the PRAECIS Inventions or otherwise relating to its

            Patent costs associated with the patent activities described in this
            Section 17.2 shall be borne by PRAECIS. BAXTER will cooperate with
            PRAECIS, at PRAECIS' expense, in the filing and prosecution of
            patent applications. Such cooperation will include, but not be
            limited to, furnishing supporting data and affidavits for the
            prosecution of patent applications and completing and signing forms
            needed for the prosecution, assignment and maintenance of patent
            applications.

     17.3   RETENTION OF RIGHTS. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
            nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed or
            interpreted, either expressly or by implication, estoppel or
            otherwise, as: (a) a grant, transfer or other conveyance by either
            party to the other of any right, title, license or other interest of
            any kind in any of its patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade
            secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary information
            (collectively, "Intellectual Property") and, except as otherwise
            expressly provided herein, each party shall retain all rights in its
            Intellectual Property without conferring any right, title or
            interest therein to the other party; (b) creating an obligation on
            the part of either party to make any such grant, transfer or other
            conveyance; or (c) requiring either party to participate with the

ARTICLE 18, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, NONDISCLOSURE AND PUBLICITY

     18.1   CONFIDENTIALITY. It is contemplated that in the course of the
            performance of this Agreement each party may, from time to time,
            disclose Confidential Information to the other. Each party agrees to
            take all reasonable steps to prevent disclosure of Confidential
            Information to third parties. No provision of this Agreement shall
            be construed so as to preclude disclosure of Confidential
            Information as may be reasonably necessary to secure from any
            governmental agency necessary approvals or licenses or to file and
            prosecute applications for, or obtain, patents with respect to the
            Product.

     18.2   PRIOR CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT. This Agreement, by reference,
            incorporates the Confidentiality Agreement dated December 4th, 2001
            (the "Confidentiality Agreement") by and between Baxter Healthcare
            Corporation and PRAECIS, and which was subsequently assigned by
            Baxter Healthcare Corporation to BAXTER on or about January 1, 2002,
            and such Confidentiality Agreement is made a part hereof as though
            fully set forth herein, as such Confidentiality Agreement may be
            modified by Sections 18.3 through 18.7 hereof.

     18.3   THIRD PARTY DISCLOSURE. BAXTER shall be permitted to disclose
            Product information to third party developmental and analytical
            services providers solely in connection with, and only to the extent
            reasonably necessary for, performance of its obligations hereunder;
            provided that such providers shall be subject to confidentiality
            agreements which protect the disclosure and use of any such Product
            information to the same extent as, or greater than, provided
            hereunder. Either party may disclose Confidential Information of the
            disclosing party to those Affiliates, agents, consultants and
            employees of the receiving party who need to know such information
            to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement (collectively,
            "Permitted Recipients"); provided that such Permitted Recipients are
            bound to maintain such Confidential Information in confidence in
            accordance with the terms herein.

     18.4   LITIGATION AND GOVERNMENTAL DISCLOSURE. Each party may disclose
            Confidential Information hereunder to the extent such disclosure is
            reasonably necessary for complying with applicable governmental
            regulations or conducting pre-clinical or clinical trials, provided
            that if a party is required by law or regulation to make any such
            disclosure of the other party's Confidential Information it will,
            except where impractical for necessary disclosures, for example in
            the event of a medical emergency, give reasonable advance notice to
            the other party of such disclosure requirement and will use good
            faith efforts to assist such other party to secure a protective
            order or confidential treatment of such Confidential Information
            required to be disclosed. Disclosure of Confidential Information in
            connection

                                       34
<Page>

            with any Legal Proceeding (as defined in the Confidentiality
            Agreement) shall be governed by Section 4 of the Confidentiality
            Agreement.

     18.5   PUBLICITY AND DISCLOSURE OF TERMS. The parties agree that the public
            announcement of the execution of this Agreement shall only be by one
            or more press releases mutually agreed to by the parties. The
            failure of a party to return a draft of a press release with its
            proposed amendments or modifications to such press release to the
            other party within five (5) days of such party's receipt of such
            press release shall be deemed as such party's approval of such press
            release as received by such party. Neither party shall disclose the
            terms of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
            other party hereto, except: (a) as may be required by a court of
            competent jurisdiction, in which case the disclosing party shall
            immediately notify the non-disclosing party so that the
            non-disclosing party may seek a protective order or other remedy;
            provided that if no protective order or other remedy is obtained,
            then the disclosing party shall disclose only that portion of this
            Agreement which, in the opinion of the disclosing party's legal
            counsel, is required to be disclosed, and the disclosing party shall
            use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an order or other
            reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be given to the
            disclosed portion of this Agreement; (b) as may be required by
            federal law or the regulations of Regulatory Authorities, including
            without limitation the United States Securities and Exchange
            Commission; or (c) if PRAECIS determines in good faith that such
            disclosure is necessary or appropriate in connection with any
            financing, strategic transaction, acquisition or disposition
            involving PRAECIS or any Affiliate of PRAECIS, provided, however,
            with respect to disclosures pursuant to this clause 18.5(c), in no
            event may such disclosure be made to any contract drug manufacturer
            or any Affiliate of a contract drug manufacturer unless such
            disclosures are subject to a confidentiality agreement that protects
            disclosure of and Confidential Information to the same extent, or
            greater than, provided hereunder.

     18.6   LIMITATION OF DISCLOSURE. The parties agree that, except as
            expressly authorized in this Agreement or in the Confidentiality
            Agreement, no information concerning this Agreement and the
            transactions contemplated herein shall be made public by either
            party without the prior written consent of the other.

     18.7   DURATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY. All obligations of confidentiality and
            non-use imposed upon the parties under this Agreement and the
            Confidentiality Agreement shall expire ten (10) years after the
            expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement; provided,
            however, that Confidential Information which constitutes the trade
            secrets of a party shall be kept confidential indefinitely, subject
            to the limitations set forth in Sections 18.4 through 18.6.

ARTICLE 19, FORCE MAJEURE

     Any delay in the performance of any of the duties or obligations of either
     party hereto (except the payment of money) caused by an event outside the
     affected party's reasonable control shall not be considered a breach of
     this Agreement, and unless provided to the contrary herein, the time
     required for performance shall be extended for a period equal to the period
     of such delay. Such events shall include without limitation, acts of God;
     acts of public enemies; insurrections; riots; embargoes; labor disputes,
     including strikes, lockouts, job actions, or boycotts; fires; explosions;
     floods; shortages of material or energy; delays in the delivery of raw
     materials; acts or orders of any government or agency thereof or other
     unforeseeable causes beyond the reasonable control and without the fault or
     negligence of the party so affected. The party so affected shall give
     prompt notice to the other party of such cause and a good faith estimate of
     the continuing effect of the force majeure condition and duration of the
     affected party's nonperformance, and shall take whatever reasonable steps
     are appropriate to relieve the effect of such causes as rapidly as
     possible. If the period of nonperformance by BAXTER because of BAXTER force
     majeure conditions exceeds   ***   , then PRAECIS may terminate this
     Agreement by written notice to BAXTER. If the period of nonperformance by
     PRAECIS because of PRAECIS force majeure conditions exceeds   ***   , then
     BAXTER may terminate this Agreement by written notice to PRAECIS.
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any Product
     Master Plan, termination of this Agreement by either party pursuant to this
     Article 19 shall not result in the imposition of Cancellation Fees, if any.

     Intent into the Project Plans hereunder.

ARTICLE 25, SEVERABILITY

     If any term or provision of this Agreement shall for any reason be held
     invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
     illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision

ARTICLE 29, GUARANTY

     Baxter Healthcare Corporation (the "Guarantor") shall, and hereby does,
     absolutely and completely guarantee the payment and performance by BAXTER
     of the obligations of BAXTER hereunder; provided, however, that, except as
     provided below in this Article 29, this guaranty is contingent, and may be
     enforced against the Guarantor only, upon either: (a) recourse being taken
     first against BAXTER, final judgment obtained against BAXTER and execution
     thereon returned unsatisfied, or (b) if it is shown that BAXTER has
     insufficient assets available for the performance by BAXTER of BAXTER's
     obligations hereunder. The aforesaid guaranty by the Guarantor shall become
     the primary and independent obligation of the Guarantor and shall be
     enforceable directly against the Guarantor, following written notice and
     demand to Guarantor by PRAECIS, without the necessity of: (i) any suit or
     proceeding against BAXTER, (ii) any notice of nonperformance or
     nonobservance, or (iii) any notice of acceptance thereof, all of which the
     Guarantor hereby expressly and irrevocably waives, in the event that (1)
     BAXTER shall have filed a petition in bankruptcy or for any relief relating
     to reorganization, arrangement, readjustment of debt, dissolution or
     liquidation, or BAXTER shall have had any such petition filed against it in
     which an adjudication of bankruptcy or insolvency is made or an order for
     relief is entered, which remains undismissed for a period of sixty (60)
     days (or to which it shall have consented or acquiesced) or (2) BAXTER
     shall have had a receiver, custodian or trustee appointed for all or a
     substantial part of its property. The Guarantor's obligations under the
     aforesaid guaranty shall not be affected in any way

                                       39
<Page>

     by the reason of any amendment, renewal, supplement or modification of this
     Agreement. In the event that BAXTER assigns this Agreement to an Affiliate
     of BAXTER in accordance with Section 21.1, then the Guarantor's guarantee
     hereunder automatically shall continue in full force and effect with
     respect to the obligations of such BAXTER Affiliate hereunder. This
     guaranty shall be binding upon, and enforceable by PRAECIS against, the
     successors of the Guarantor.

                                       40
