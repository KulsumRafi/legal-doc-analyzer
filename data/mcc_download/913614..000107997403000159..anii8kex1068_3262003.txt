                        TERM LOAN, AND SECURITY AGREEMENT
                        ---------------------------------

     THIS REVOLVING CREDIT,  TERM LOAN AND SECURITY  AGREEMENT (the "Agreement")
dated  as  of  March  21,  2003,   is  entered   into  by  and  among   ADVANCED
NUTRACEUTICALS,  INC., a Texas corporation  ("Parent"),  BACTOLAC PHARMACEUTICAL
INC. a Delaware  corporation  ("Bactolac"),  and ANI  PHARMACEUTICALS,  INC.,  a
Mississippi  corporation ("ANIP") (Parent,  Bactolac and ANIP are each sometimes
referred  to  herein as a  "Borrower"  and  collectively  as  "Borrowers"),  and
CAPITALSOURCE    FINANCE   LLC,   a   Delaware   limited    liability    company
("CapitalSource"),  as  administrative,  payment  and  collateral  agent for the
Lenders (in such capacities, the "Agent"), and the Lenders.

     WHEREAS,  Borrowers have requested that Lenders make available to Borrowers
(i)  a  revolving  credit  facility  (the  "Revolving  Facility")  in a  maximum
principal  amount  at  any  time  outstanding  of up  to  Four  Million  Dollars
($4,000,000)  (the "Facility Cap"), and (ii) a term loan (the "Term Loan") in an
aggregate  maximum  principal  amount of One Million Dollars  ($1,000,000),  the
proceeds of which Revolving Facility and Term Loan shall be used by Borrowers to
refinance  Borrowers' existing  obligations and indebtedness to General Electric
Capital  Corporation  ("GECC"),  to repay  $500,000 on a related party note plus
accrued  interest  thereon due to Dr. Pailla M. Reddy (subject to the receipt by
Agent of a satisfactory no offset  agreement from VitaRich  Laboratories,  Inc.)
and to finance the working  capital needs of Borrowers in connection  with their
nutraceutical   (vitamin)   and  over  the  counter   liquid  and  powder  based
pharmaceuticals and health and beauty products business (the "Business");

     WHEREAS,  Borrowers  also have  requested  that Lenders  make  available to
Borrowers  an  equipment   acquisition   term  loan  facility  (the   "Equipment

Thousand  Dollars  ($500,000)  (the  "Maximum  Equipment  Acquisition  Term Loan
Amount") the proceeds of which will be used by Borrowers for the  acquisition of
Eligible Equipment to be used solely in connection with the Business;

     WHEREAS,  Lenders are willing to make the Revolving Facility, Term Loan and
Equipment  Acquisition  Term  Loan  available  to  Borrowers  upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein.

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable   consideration,   the  receipt  and   adequacy  of  which  hereby  are
acknowledged, Borrowers, Agent and Lenders hereby agree as follows:

I.   DEFINITIONS

     1.1 General Terms

          (a) For purposes of the Loan  Documents  and all Annexes  thereto,  in
     addition to the  definitions  above and elsewhere in this  Agreement or the
     other Loan Documents,  the terms listed in Appendix A hereto shall have the
     meanings given such terms in Appendix A, which is  incorporated  herein and
     made a part hereof.  All capitalized  terms used which are not specifically
     defined shall have

                                        1
<PAGE>

     meanings  provided  in Article 9 of the UCC in effect on the date hereof to
     the extent the same are used or defined therein. Unless otherwise specified
     herein or in  Appendix  A, this  Agreement  and any  agreement  or contract
     referred to herein or in Appendix A shall mean such  agreement as modified,
     amended or supplemented from time to time. Unless otherwise  specified,  as
     used in the Loan  Documents or in any  certificate,  report,  instrument or
     other document made or delivered pursuant to any of the Loan Documents, all
     accounting  terms not defined in Appendix A or elsewhere in this  Agreement
     shall have the meanings  given to such terms in and shall be interpreted in
     accordance with GAAP.

II.  LOANS, PAYMENTS, AND INTEREST AND COLLATERAL

     2.1 The Revolving Facility

     Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,  each Revolving  Lender agrees
to make  available  its Pro Rata  Share  of  Advances  to  Borrowers  under  the
Revolving Facility from time to time during the Term; provided, that (i) the Pro
Rata Share of the Advances of any Revolving  Lender shall not at any time exceed
its separate  Commitment,  and (ii) the aggregate  amount of all Advances at any
time outstanding under the Revolving Facility shall not exceed the lesser of (A)
the Facility Cap and (B) the Availability.  The obligations of Revolving Lenders
hereunder shall be several, and not joint or joint and several, up to the amount
of the Commitments.  The Revolving Facility is a revolving credit facility which
may be drawn,  repaid  and  redrawn  from time to time as  permitted  under this
Agreement.  Any  determination  as to whether there is  availability  within the
Borrowing  Base for requested  Advances  shall be made by Agent in its Permitted
Discretion  and shall be final and  binding  upon  Borrowers.  Unless  otherwise
permitted by Agent,  each Advance  shall be in an amount of at least One Hundred
Thousand  Dollars  ($100,000).  Subject  to the  provisions  of this  Agreement,
Borrowers may request  Advances up to and including the value, in Dollars of (a)
the  Receivables  Percentage of the  Receivables  Borrowing  Base,  plus (b) the
Inventory Percentage of the Inventory Borrowing Base but not to exceed $750,000,
minus amounts reserved  pursuant to this Agreement (such calculated amount being
referred to herein as the "Availability"). Advances under the Revolving Facility
automatically  shall be made for the  payment of interest on the Notes and other
Obligations  on the date when due to the extent  available  and as provided  for
herein.  Borrowers may not at any time increase,  reduce or otherwise adjust the
Facility Cap.  Agent shall have the right to establish and readjust from time to
time, in its Permitted  Discretion,  reserves  against the Borrowing Base, which
reserves shall have the effect of reducing the amounts otherwise  eligible to be
disbursed to Borrowers under the Revolving Facility pursuant to this Agreement.

     2.2 The Revolving Notes; Maturity

          (a) All Advances  under the Revolving  Facility  shall be evidenced by
     the Revolving  Notes,  payable to the order of each Revolving Lender in the
     principal amount of the Commitment of such Revolving Lender,  duly executed
     and  delivered  by  Borrowers.  The  Revolving  Notes  shall  evidence  the
     aggregate  Indebtedness  of Borrowers to Revolving  Lenders  resulting from
     Advances  under the Revolving  Facility from time to time.  Each  Revolving

                                        2
<PAGE>

     Lender hereby is authorized,  but is not obligated,  to enter the amount of
     such Revolving  Lender's Pro Rata Share of each Advance under the Revolving
     Facility,  and the amount of each  payment or  prepayment  of  principal or
     interest  thereon  in the  appropriate  spaces on the  reverse  of or on an
     attachment to such Revolving Lender's Revolving Note(s). Agent will account
     to  Borrowers  monthly  with a statement  of Advances  under the  Revolving
     Facility, and any charges and payments made pursuant to this Agreement, and
     in the absence of manifest error,  such accounting  rendered by Agent shall
     be deemed  final,  binding  and  conclusive  unless  Agent is  notified  by
     Borrowers in writing to the contrary  within  fifteen (15) calendar days of
     Receipt of each accounting,  which notice shall be deemed an objection only
     to items specifically objected to therein.

          (b) All amounts  outstanding  under the Revolving  Notes and all other
     Obligations under the Revolving  Facility shall be due and payable in full,
     if not earlier in accordance with this Agreement, on the Maturity Date.

     2.3  Interest on the Revolving Notes

     Interest on outstanding Advances under the Revolving Notes shall be payable
monthly  in arrears on the first day of each  calendar  month at an annual  rate
equal to the  Prime  Rate  plus two  percent  (2.00%),  provided,  however  that
notwithstanding any provision of any Loan Documents, the interest on outstanding
Advances  under the  Revolving  Notes shall be not less than six and one half of
one  percent  (6.50%)  per annum,  calculated,  in each case,  on the basis of a
360-day year and for the actual number of calendar days elapsed in each interest
calculation  period.  Interest accrued on each Advance under the Revolving Notes
shall be due and payable on the first day of each calendar  month, in accordance
with the procedures  provided for in Section 2.9,  commencing  April 1, 2003 and
continuing  until  the  later  of  the  expiration  of the  Term  and  the  full
performance  and  indefeasible  payment in full in cash of the  Obligations  and
termination of this Agreement.

     2.4 Revolving  Facility  Disbursements;  Requirement  to Deliver  Borrowing
Certificate

     So long as no  Default  or Event of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
continuing,  Borrowers may give Agent  irrevocable  written notice requesting an
Advance under the Revolving Facility by delivering to Agent not later than 12:00
noon (New York City  time) at least one (1) but not more than four (4)  Business
Days before the proposed  Business Day on which such requested  Advance is to be
made (the "Borrowing Date"), a completed Borrowing  Certificate  requesting such
Advance accompanied by relevant supporting  documentation  satisfactory to Agent
in its Permitted Discretion, which shall (a) specify the proposed Borrowing Date
of such Advance, (b) specify the principal amount of such requested Advance, and
(c) certify the matters contained in Section 4.2 and, to the extent  applicable,
provide  calculations  evidencing  satisfaction  of the  conditions set forth in
Section 4.2. Each Wednesday  during the Term (and more frequently if Agent shall
so request) until the Obligations are indefeasibly paid in cash in full and this
Agreement  is  terminated  and  each  time a  request  for an  Advance  is made,
Borrowers  shall  deliver  to Agent a  Borrowing  Certificate  accompanied  by a
separate detailed aging and categorization of Borrowers' accounts receivable and
accounts  payable and such other  supporting  documentation  with respect to the
figures and  information in the Borrowing  Certificate as Agent shall request in
its  Permitted  Discretion.   On  each  Borrowing  Date,  Borrowers  irrevocably
authorize Agent and Lenders to disburse the proceeds of the requested Advance to

the applicable  account(s) of Borrowers  specified in the  applicable  Borrowing
Certificate, each of which accounts shall constitute one or more of the accounts
set forth on Schedule  2.4, in all cases for credit to the  applicable  Borrower
(or to such other  account as to which such  Borrower  shall  instruct  Agent in
writing) via Federal  funds wire transfer no later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City
time).

     2.5 Collections; Repayment; Borrowing and Lockbox

     Borrowers  shall  maintain  a  lockbox  together  with  a  blocked  account
(individually  and collectively,  the "Blocked  Account") with one or more banks
acceptable  to Agent  (each,  a "Lockbox  Bank"),  and shall  execute  with each
Lockbox  Bank  one or more  agreements  acceptable  to Agent  (individually  and
collectively,  the  "Lockbox  Agreement"),  and such  other  agreements  related
thereto as Agent may require.  Borrowers  shall ensure that all  collections  of
their  respective  Accounts  and all other cash  payments  received by Borrowers
(other  than  direct  proceeds of sales of  Permitted  Securities)  are paid and
delivered  directly  from  Account  Debtors and other  Persons  into the Blocked
Account. The Lockbox Agreements shall provide that the Lockbox Banks immediately
will transfer all funds paid into the Blocked Accounts into a depository account
or accounts  maintained  by Agent or an Affiliate of Agent at such bank as Agent
may  communicate to Borrowers from time to time (the  "Concentration  Account").
Notwithstanding  and without  limiting any other provision of any Loan Document,
Agent  shall  apply,  on  a  daily  basis,   all  funds   transferred  into  the
Concentration  Account pursuant to the Lockbox Agreement and this Section 2.5 in
such order and manner as  determined  by Agent.  To the extent that any Accounts
collections  of Borrowers or any other cash  payments  received by Borrowers are
not sent directly to the Blocked Account but are received by any Borrower or any
of Borrowers'  Affiliates,  such collections and proceeds shall be held in trust
for the benefit of Agent and Lenders and immediately  remitted (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days), in the form received,  to the Blocked Account for
immediate transfer to the Concentration Account. Borrowers acknowledge and agree
that  compliance with the terms of this Section 2.5 is an essential term of this
Agreement,  and that nothing shall prevent Agent from considering any failure to
comply with the terms of this Section 2.5 to be a Default or an Event of Default
or from taking any action or exercising  any right or remedy  available to Agent
or any  Lender  with  respect  to any  Default  or Event of  Default.  All funds
transferred to the  Concentration  Account for  application  to the  Obligations
under the Revolving  Facility shall be applied to reduce the  Obligations  under
the Revolving  Facility,  but, for purposes of calculating  interest  hereunder,
shall be subject to a five (5) Business Day clearance  charge.  If as the result
of collections of Accounts and/or any other cash payments  received by Borrowers
(other than Permitted  Securities) pursuant to this Section 2.5 a credit balance
exists with respect to the Concentration  Account, such credit balance shall not
accrue interest in favor of a Borrower, but shall be available to Borrowers upon
written request in accordance  with the terms of this Agreement.  If applicable,
at any time prior to the execution of all or any of the Lockbox  Agreements  and
operation of the Blocked  Account,  Borrowers and their  Affiliates shall direct
all collections or proceeds they receive on Accounts or from other Collateral or
any other cash payment received by Borrowers  (except for Permitted  Securities)
to the  accounts(s)  and in the  manner  specified  by  Agent  in its  Permitted
Discretion.

     outstanding  principal  balance of the Term Loan under the Term Notes shall
     not be less than nine and one  quarter of one  percent  (9.25%)  per annum,
     calculated, in each case, on the basis of a 360-day year and for the actual

     for herein.

     2.8 Repayment of Term Loan; Maturity

     2.9 Equipment Acquisition Term Loan

          (a) Subject to the terms and conditions  set forth in this  Agreement,
     each Equipment  Acquisition Term Lender agrees to loan to Borrowers its Pro
     Rata Share of the  Maximum  Equipment  Acquisition  Term Loan Amount in the
     form of draws  ("Draws"),  in each case subject to the conditions set forth
     in this  Agreement;  provided that the aggregate  amount of all Draws shall
     never  exceed the lesser of the  Maximum  Equipment  Acquisition  Term Loan

     Agreement and the Pro Rata Share of Draws under the  Equipment  Acquisition

     time in excess of the foregoing limits shall be immediately due and payable
     by Borrowers  without the  necessity  of any demand at the Payment  Office,
     whether or not a Default or Event of Default has occurred or is continuing,

     notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, shall be an Event of
     Default  hereunder.   All  Draws  shall  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrowers'
     account(s)  as set forth on  Schedule  2.4 (or to such other  account as to
     which  the  Borrower  shall  instruct  Agent  in  writing).  The  Equipment
     Acquisition  Term Loan is not a revolving  credit  facility  and may not be
     drawn,  repaid and redrawn.  Any  repayments  of principal on the Equipment
     Acquisition Term Loan shall be applied to permanently  reduce the Equipment
     Acquisition  Term Loan and Maximum Loan Amount.  The Equipment  Acquisition
     Term Loan and all Draws shall be evidenced by  Equipment  Acquisition  Term
     Notes,  payable to the order of each Lender in the principal  amount of the
     Commitment  of the  applicable  Lender,  duly  executed  and  delivered  by
     Borrowers and dated the Closing Date. The Equipment  Acquisition Term Notes
     shall evidence the aggregate Indebtedness of Borrowers to Lenders resulting
     from Draws  under the  Equipment  Acquisition  Term Loan from time to time.
     Each Lender hereby is authorized, but is not obligated, to enter the amount
     of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of each Draw and  outstanding  principal of
     the  Equipment  Acquisition  Term Loan and the  amount of each  payment  or
     prepayment  of principal  and  interest  thereon on the reverse of or on an
     attachment to such Lender's Equipment Acquisition Term Note.

          (b)  Unless  otherwise  permitted  by Agent,  each Draw shall be in an
     amount of at least  $100,000.  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
     Borrowers  may  request  a Draw  up to and  including  the  value,  in U.S.
     dollars, of eighty-five  percent (85%) (the "Equipment  Percentage") of the
     lesser of (i) the actual invoice purchase  price/cost of Eligible Equipment
     purchased by any Borrower  (excluding all soft costs,  such as installation
     costs, insurance policies, warranty plans, etc. (i.e., all costs other than
     the actual hard cost of  purchasing  the Eligible  Equipment)  and (ii) the
     liquidation  auction value of the Eligible Equipment as determined pursuant
     to an  appraisal  in form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  Agent,  in its
     Permitted  Discretion,  from  an  appraiser  acceptable  to  Agent,  in its

          (c) So long as no Default or Event of Default  shall have occurred and
     be  continuing,   Borrowers  may  give  Agent  irrevocable  written  notice
     requesting a Draw under the Equipment  Acquisition  Term Loan by delivering
     to Agent not later than  11:00  a.m.  (New York City time) at least two (2)

     Draw Date of such Draw  which  shall be a Business  Day,  (b)  specify  the
     principal  amount of such  requested  Draw,  and (c)  certify  the  matters

of  Lenders,  by way of direct  payment  of the  relevant  amount,  interest  or
Obligations  without  necessity  of any demand  and  whether or not a Default or
Event of Default has occurred or is continuing.  No payment or prepayment of any
amount by Agent,  Lenders or any other  Person  shall  entitle  any Person to be
subrogated to the rights of Agent and/or Lenders under any Loan Document  unless
and until the  Obligations  have been fully  performed and paid  indefeasibly in
cash and this Agreement has been  terminated.  Any sums expended or amounts paid
by Agent and/or Lenders as a result of any Borrower's or any Guarantor's failure
to pay,  perform or comply with any Loan Document or any of the  Obligations may
be charged to Borrowers'  account as an Advance under the Revolving Facility and
added to the Obligations.

          Contracts and rights  thereunder and the related  Government  Accounts
          and  proceeds  thereof,  now or  hereafter  owned or  acquired by such
          Borrower;  provided,  however,  that  Agent  shall not have a security
          interest in any rights under any Government  Contract of such Borrower
          or in the related Government Account where the taking of such security
          interest would be a violation of an express  prohibition  contained in
          the  Government  Contract (for purposes of this  limitation,  the fact
          that a  Government  Contract  is subject to, or  otherwise  refers to,

          (b)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions of this Section 2.11,
     such  grant of a  security  interest  shall  not  extend  to,  and the term
     "Collateral" shall not include,  any General Intangibles of any Borrower to
     the extent that (but only to the extent  that) (i) they are not  assignable
     or capable of being encumbered as a matter of law or under the terms of any
     license or other  agreement  applicable  thereto  (but solely to the extent
     that any  such  restriction  shall be  enforceable  under  applicable  law)
     without  the  consent of the  licensor  thereof or other  applicable  party
     thereto,  and (ii) such consent has not been obtained;  provided,  however,
     that the foregoing  grant of a security  interest  shall extend to, and the
     term  "Collateral"  shall include,  each of the following:  (A) any General
     Intangible  which is in the nature of an Account or a right to the  payment
     of money or a proceed  of,  or  otherwise  related  to the  enforcement  or

     are the subject of any  Account or right to the  payment of money,  (B) any
     and all proceeds of any General  Intangible  that is otherwise  excluded to
     the extent that the  assignment,  pledge or encumbrance of such proceeds is

     or other  applicable  party  with  respect to any such  otherwise  excluded
     General Intangible, such General Intangible as well as any and all proceeds
     thereof  that might  theretofore  have been  excluded  from such grant of a
     security interest and from the term "Collateral."

          (c)  In  addition  to  the  foregoing,   to  secure  the  payment  and
     performance of the  Obligations,  each Borrower has pledged or shall pledge
     to Agent,  for its  benefit  and the  benefit  of the  Lenders,  all of the
     securities it owns in any  Subsidiary  pursuant to the Pledge  Agreement to
     which it is a party, and each Guarantor,  if any, has pledged to Agent, for
     its benefit and the benefit of the Lenders,  certain securities pursuant to
     the Pledge Agreement to which such Guarantor is a party.

          (d) Each Borrower shall promptly  notify Agent of any Commercial  Tort
     Claims in which such  Borrower  has an interest  arising  after the Closing
     Date and shall  provide  all  necessary  information  concerning  each such
     Commercial  Tort Claim and make all necessary  filings with respect thereto
     to perfect  Agent's (for its benefit and the benefit of the Lenders)  first
     priority security interest therein.

          (e) Each Borrower has full right and power to grant to Agent,  for the
     benefit of itself and the Lenders, a perfected,  first priority (other than
     with  respect to property or assets  covered by Priority  Permitted  Liens)
     security  interest and Lien in the Collateral  pursuant to this  Agreement,
     subject to the following sentence.  Upon the execution and delivery of this
     Agreement, and upon the filing of the necessary financing statements and/or
     appropriate   filings  and/or   delivery  of  the  necessary   certificates
     evidencing an equity interest,  control and/or  possession,  as applicable,
     without  any  further  action,  Agent,  for the  benefit  of itself and the
     Lenders,  will  have a good,  valid  and first  priority  (other  than with
     respect to property  or assets  covered by  Priority  Permitted  Liens) and
     perfected  Lien and  security  interest  in the  Collateral,  subject to no
     transfer or other  restrictions  or Liens of any kind in favor of any other
     Person except for Permitted Liens. No financing  statement  relating to any
     of the  Collateral  is on file in any  public  office  except  those (i) on
     behalf of Agent, for the benefit of itself and the Lenders,  and/or (ii) in
     connection  with  Permitted  Liens.  No Borrower is party to any agreement,
     document or instrument that conflicts with this Section 2.16.

     2.17 Collateral Administration

          (a) All  Collateral  (except  Deposit  Accounts and  Collateral in the
     possession  of  Agent)  will  at all  times  be kept  by  Borrowers  at the
     locations set forth on Schedule 5.18B hereto, and shall not, without thirty
     (30) calendar days prior written notice to Agent,  be moved therefrom other
     than to another such  location,  and in any case shall not be moved outside
     the  continental  United  States.  Whether or not an Event of  Default  has
     occurred,  any of Agent's officers,  employees,  representatives  or agents
     shall have the right, at any time during normal business hours, in the name
     of Agent,  or any designee of Agent or  Borrowers,  to verify the validity,
     amount or any other  matter  relating to the  Collateral.  Borrowers  shall
     cooperate fully with Agent in an effort to facilitate and promptly conclude
     such verification process. In addition to and notwithstanding any provision
     of any Loan  Document,  Agent  shall have the right at all times  after the
     occurrence  and  during  the  continuance  of an Event of Default to notify
     Persons owing  Accounts to Borrowers that their Accounts have been assigned
     to Agent  and to  collect  such  Accounts  directly  in its own name and to
     charge collection costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees,
     to  Borrowers.  Borrowers  shall  endeavor  in the first  instance  to make
     collection  of their  respective  Accounts  for Agent,  for the  account of
     Lenders.

          (b) As and when determined by Agent in its Permitted Discretion, Agent
     will perform the searches  described in clauses (i) and (ii) below  against
     Borrowers  (the  results  of which  are to be  consistent  with  Borrowers'
     representations  and warranties  under this  Agreement),  all at Borrowers'
     expense:  (i) UCC  searches  with the  Secretary  of State and local filing

                                       11
<PAGE>

     offices of each  jurisdiction  where any Borrower and/or any Guarantors are
     organized and/or maintain their respective  executive  offices,  a place of
     business or assets;  and (ii) judgment,  federal tax lien and corporate and
     partnership tax lien searches,  in each jurisdiction  searched under clause
     (i) above.

          (c) Upon Agent's  request,  Borrowers shall promptly  deliver to Agent
     all items for which  Agent must  receive  possession  to obtain a perfected
     Lien and security  interest and all notes,  certificates,  and documents of
     title,  Chattel  Paper,  warehouse  receipts,  Instruments,  and any  other
     similar Instruments constituting Collateral, in each case to the extent not
     already in possession of Agent.

          (d)  Borrowers  shall,  and shall  cause their  Subsidiaries  to, keep
     accurate  and  complete  records of the  Collateral  and all  payments  and
     collections thereon and shall submit such records to Agent on such periodic
     bases as Agent may request in its  Permitted  Discretion.  In addition,  if
     Accounts of  Borrowers  in an  aggregate  face amount in excess of $100,000
     become ineligible because they fall within one of the specified  categories
     of  ineligibility  set forth in the  definition  of  Eligible  Receivables,
     Borrowers  shall  notify  Agent of such  occurrence  no later than five (5)
     Business  Days  following  such  occurrence  and the  Borrowing  Base shall
     thereupon  be adjusted to reflect  such  occurrence.  In  addition,  if any
     Eligible  Equipment of Borrower the purchase of which was in part funded by
     any Draw,  becomes  ineligible because it falls within one of the specified
     categories  of  ineligibility  set  forth  in the  definition  of  Eligible
     Equipment,  Borrowers shall notify Agent of such occurrence within five (5)
     Business Days following such  occurrence.  If requested by Agent upon or at
     any time after the  occurrence and during the  continuation  of an Event of
     Default, Borrowers shall execute and deliver to Agent, and shall cause each
     of their Subsidiaries to execute and deliver, formal written assignments of
     all of their  respective  Accounts  as Agent  may  request,  including  all
     Accounts  created  since  the date of the last  assignment,  together  with
     copies of claims, invoices and/or other information related thereto. To the
     extent that  collections  from such assigned  Accounts exceed the amount of
     the  Obligations,  such excess amount shall not accrue interest in favor of
     Borrowers  but shall be  available to  Borrowers  upon  written  request in
     accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (e) Borrowers (i) shall provide prompt written notice to their current
     bank  to  transfer  all  items,   collections   and   remittances   to  the
     Concentration  Account,  (ii) shall provide  prompt  written notice to each
     Account Debtor that Agent,  for itself and the benefit of the Lenders,  has
     been  granted a lien and  security  interest  in, upon and to all  Accounts
     payable by such Account  Debtor,  shall direct or shall have  directed each
     Account Debtor to make payments to the appropriate Blocked Account, in each
     case not later than (A) ten (10) calendar  days after the  occurrence of an
     Event of Default, or (B) ten (10) calendar days after the Person becomes an
     Account Debtor, and hereby authorize Agent and/or Lenders, upon any failure
     to send such directions  within the applicable time period, to send any and
     all similar  directions or notice to such Account Debtors,  and (iii) shall
     do anything further that may be lawfully required by Agent in its Permitted
     Discretion  to secure  Agent,  for the benefit of itself and  Lenders,  and
     effectuate the intentions of the Loan Documents.

     2.18 Power of Attorney

     Agent is hereby  irrevocably  made,  constituted and appointed the true and
lawful attorney for Borrowers (without requiring Agent to act as such) with full
power of  substitution  to do the  following:  (i)  endorse the name of any such

                                       12
<PAGE>

Person upon any and all checks,  drafts,  money orders and other instruments for
the payment of money that are payable to such Person and constitute  collections
on such Person's Accounts;  (ii) execute and/or file in the name of any Borrower
any  financing  statements,  amendments  to financing  statements,  schedules to
financing statements, releases or terminations thereof (and such Borrower hereby
waives  any  right  to file  any of the  foregoing  until  the  Obligations  are
indefeasibly paid in full in cash and this Agreement is terminated or with prior
written  consent of Agent,  in its Permitted  Discretion),  (iii) execute and/or
file in the name of each Borrower assignments, instruments, documents, schedules
and  statements  that  it is  obligated  to give  Agent  under  any of the  Loan
Documents  (to the extent such Borrower  fails to so execute  and/or file any of
the foregoing  within two (2) Business Days of Agent's  request or the time when
such Borrower is otherwise  obligated to do so);  (iv) execute  and/or file such
documents as may be necessary to register and/or otherwise  perfect Agent's (for
the benefit of the Lenders) Lien on such Borrower's  owned motor  vehicles,  and
(v) do such other and further  acts and deeds in the name of any  Borrower  that
Agent may deem  necessary or desirable in its  Permitted  Discretion to enforce,
make, create, maintain,  continue or enforce or perfect Agent's, for the benefit
of itself and Lenders, security interest or lien or rights in any Collateral. In
addition,  if any Borrower breaches its obligation  hereunder to direct payments
of Accounts or the proceeds of any other  Collateral to the appropriate  Blocked
Account,  Agent,  as the  irrevocably  made,  constituted and appointed true and
lawful  attorney  for  such  Person  pursuant  to this  paragraph,  may,  by the
signature  or other act of any of Agent's  officers  or  authorized  signatories
(without  requiring any of them to do so), direct any federal,  state or private
payor or fiscal intermediary to pay proceeds of Accounts or any other Collateral
to the appropriate Blocked Account.

     2.19 Notes

     Upon  Agent's or any  Lender's  request,  and in any event within three (3)
Business Days of any such request,  Borrowers shall execute and deliver to Agent
new Notes and/or  divide the Notes in exchange for then  existing  Notes in such
smaller amounts or  denominations as Agent or such Lender shall specify in their
respective sole and absolute  discretion,  provided that the aggregate principal
amount of such new Notes does not exceed the aggregate  principal  amount of the
Notes outstanding at the time such request is made.

     2.20 Replacement of Lost Notes

     Upon receipt of evidence  reasonably  satisfactory  to the Borrowers of the
mutilation,  destruction,  loss or theft of any Notes and the ownership thereof,
the  Borrowers  shall,  upon the  written  request of the holder of such  Notes,
execute and deliver in  replacement  thereof new Notes in the same form,  in the
same  original  principal  amount  and  dated  the  same  date as the  Notes  so
mutilated,  destroyed,  lost or stolen; and such Notes so mutilated,  destroyed,
lost or stolen  shall  then be deemed no longer  outstanding  hereunder.  If the
Notes being  replaced  have been  mutilated,  they shall be  surrendered  to the
Borrowers after Agent's receipt of the replacement  Notes;  and if such replaced
Notes have been  destroyed,  lost or  stolen,  such  holder  shall  furnish  the
Borrowers with an indemnity in writing reasonably acceptable to the Borrowers to
save them harmless in respect of such replaced Note.

                                       13

     2.21 Right of First Refusal

     Each  Borrower  agrees that if it seeks or is  approached  to refinance the
Revolving  Facility,  the Term Loan, the Equipment  Acquisition Term Loan or any
other  financing  or  Indebtedness  prior  to the end of the  Term  or the  full
performance and  irrevocable  payment in full in cash of the  Obligations,  such
Borrower  shall  notify  Agent in  writing of its  intention  to  refinance  the
Revolving  Facility,  the Term Loan, the Equipment  Acquisition Term Loan and/or
obtain other financing or other Indebtedness by delivering to Agent a summary of
the material terms and conditions  offered for such financing from a third-party
lender that is not an Affiliate of such Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries  or
any  Guarantor  ("Third-Party  Offer") at least  fifteen (15)  calendar  days in
advance of the date such Borrower  intends to enter into such  financing.  Agent
shall have fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of such notice or request to
notify such Borrower that Agent is willing to extend  financing on substantially
the same terms and  conditions (or terms more favorable to such Borrower) as set
forth in the Third-Party  Offer, in which case such Borrower shall consider such
refinancing  from Agent and Borrower may elect the financing option that is more
favorable to Borrower.

     If (a)  Borrowers  terminate  this  Agreement  under Section 11.1 hereof or
otherwise make final payment of the Obligations, (b) Agent or any Lender demands
or  accelerates  the  Obligations,  or Borrowers are otherwise  required to make
payment in full of the Obligations,  or Lender's obligations to make loans shall
terminate  under the occurrence of an Event of Default,  (c) a Change of Control
occurs  that  has not  been  consented  to in  writing  by  Agent  prior  to the
consummation  thereof,  and/or  final  payment  of all  outstanding  Obligations
pursuant  to  Section  2.14  occurs  or is  required  to  occur,  (d) any  other
termination of this Agreement and/or final prepayment of the Obligations occurs,
whether by virtue of Agent's  exercising  its right of set-off or otherwise,  or
(e) any  automatic  acceleration  of any Loan or  Obligations  or  cessation  of
lending on account of or during or payment or reduction of any outstanding  Loan
or Obligations is made on account of or during a bankruptcy,  reorganization  or
other  proceeding or  liquidation  or pursuant to any Debtor Relief Law (each, a

outstanding principal,  accrued interest and other Obligations owing pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement and any other Loan Document),  as yield  maintenance
for the loss of bargain and not as a penalty,  an amount equal to the applicable

     3.5 Computation of Fees; Lawful Limits

     All fees hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and
for the actual number of days elapsed in each calculation period, as applicable.

otherwise,  shall the  interest  and other  charges paid or agreed to be paid to
Agent,  for the benefit of Lenders,  for the use,  forbearance  or  detention of
money hereunder exceed the maximum rate permissible under applicable law which a
court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable
hereto.  If, due to any  circumstance  whatsoever,  fulfillment of any provision
hereof, at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall exceed any
such limit,  then,  the  obligation to be so fulfilled  shall be reduced to such
lawful limit, and, if Agent or Lenders shall have received interest or any other
charges of any kind which might be deemed to be interest under applicable law in
excess of the maximum  lawful rate,  then such excess shall be applied  first to
any unpaid fees and charges hereunder,  then to unpaid principal balance owed by
Borrowers  hereunder,  and if the then remaining excess interest is greater than
the previously unpaid principal balance, Agent and Lenders shall promptly refund
such  excess  amount to  Borrowers  and the  provisions  hereof  shall be deemed
amended to provide for such  permissible  rate. The terms and provisions of this
Section 3.5 shall control to the extent any other provision of any Loan Document
is inconsistent herewith.

     3.6 Default Rate of Interest

     Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the
Applicable  Rate  of  interest  in  effect  at such  time  with  respect  to the
Obligations  shall be increased by three percent  (3.0%) per annum (the "Default
Rate") upon written  notice of such  increase  given by Agent to Borrowers or if
such Event of Default occurs under Sections VIII (g) or (h),  automatically upon
the occurrence of the event or condition that triggered such Event of Default.

     3.7  Acknowledgement  of Joint and Several  Liability,  Cross-Guaranty  and
Contribution Rights; Guaranty Enforcement

          (a) Each Borrower acknowledges that it is jointly and severally liable
     for  all of  the  Obligations  under  the  Loan  Documents.  Each  Borrower
     expressly  understands,  agrees and acknowledges that (i) Borrowers are all
     Affiliated entities by common ownership, (ii) each Borrower desires to have
     the  availability of one common credit facility  instead of separate credit
     facilities,  (iii) each Borrower has requested that the Lenders extend such
     a common  credit  facility on the terms herein  provided,  (iv) the Lenders
     will be lending  against,  and  relying on a lien upon,  all of  Borrowers'
     assets even though the proceeds of any  particular  loan made hereunder may
     not be advanced directly to a particular  Borrower,  (v) each Borrower will
     nonetheless  benefit by the making of all such loans by each Lender and the
     availability  of a single credit facility of a size greater than each could
     independently  warrant,  (vi)  all  of  the  representations,   warranties,
     covenants, obligations, conditions, agreements and other terms contained in
     the Loan  Documents  shall be  applicable to and shall be binding upon each
     Borrower, and (vii) the Borrowers have each executed the Notes as co-makers
     of the Notes and that it would not be able to obtain the credit provided by
     the Lenders  hereunder  without the financial support provided by the other
     Borrowers.

          (b) Each Borrower hereby guarantees the prompt payment and performance
     in full of all  Obligations.  Such  guarantee  constitutes  a guarantee  of
     payment  and not of  collection.  Each  Borrower's  obligations  under this
     Agreement  shall, to the fullest extent  permitted by law, be unconditional
     irrespective  of  (i)  the  validity  or  enforceability,   avoidance,   or
     subordination of the Obligations of any other Borrower or of any promissory
     note or other document evidencing all or any part of the Obligations of any
     other Borrower,  (ii) the absence of any attempt to collect the Obligations
     from any other  Borrower,  any  Guarantor,  if any,  or any other  security

                                       16
<PAGE>

     therefor, or the absence of any other action to enforce the same, (iii) the
     waiver, consent,  extension,  forbearance, or granting of any indulgence by
     the Agent and/or any Lender with respect to any provision of any instrument
     evidencing the  Obligations of any other Borrower or Guarantor,  if any, or
     any part thereof,  or any other agreement now or hereafter  executed by any
     other Borrower or Guarantor,  if any, and delivered to the Agent and/or any
     Lender,  (iv) the failure by the Agent  and/or any Lender to take any steps
     to perfect and maintain its security interest in, or to preserve its rights
     to, any security or collateral for the Obligations of any other Borrower or
     Guarantor,  if any, (v) the Agent's  and/or any Lender's  election,  in any
     proceeding   instituted  under  the  United  States  Bankruptcy  Code  (the
     "Bankruptcy  Code"),  of  the  application  of  Section  1111(b)(2)  of the
     Bankruptcy Code, (vi) any borrowing or grant of a security  interest by any
     other Borrower, as debtor-in-possession under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy
     Code,  (vii) the  disallowance  of all or any portion of the Agent's and/or
     any Lender's  claim(s) for the  repayment of the  Obligations  of any other
     Borrower  under  Section 502 of the  Bankruptcy  Code,  or (viii) any other
     circumstances  which might  constitute  a legal or  equitable  discharge or
     defense  of a  guarantor  or of  any  other  Borrower  (other  than  actual
     indefeasible  payment  in full in cash).  With  respect  to any  Borrower's
     Obligations  arising as a result of the joint and several  liability of the
     Borrowers  hereunder with respect to Advances or other extensions of credit
     made to any of the other Borrowers  hereunder,  such Borrower waives, until
     the Obligations (other than indemnity  obligations under the Loan Documents
     not then due and  payable  for any  events of claims  that  would give rise
     thereto that are not then  pending)  shall have been  indefeasibly  paid in
     full and this Agreement  shall have been  terminated,  any right to enforce
     any right of  subrogation  or any remedy  which the Agent and/or any Lender
     now has or may hereafter have against any other  Borrower,  any endorser or
     any  Guarantor,  if any,  of all or any  part of the  Obligations,  and any
     benefit of, and any right to  participate  in, any  security or  collateral
     given to the Agent and/or any Lender to secure  payment of the  Obligations
     or any other  liability  of any  Borrower  to the Agent  and/or any Lender.
     During any Event of Default,  the Agent may proceed  directly  and at once,
     without  notice,  against  any  Borrower  to collect  and  recover the full
     amount, or any portion of the Obligations, without first proceeding against
     any  other  Borrower  or any other  Person,  or  against  any  security  or
     collateral for the Obligations.  Each Borrower consents and agrees that the
     Agent  shall be under no  obligation  to marshal any assets in favor of any
     Borrower or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations.

          (c) Each Borrower is obligated to repay the  Obligations  as joint and
     several  obligors  under this  Agreement.  To the extent that any  Borrower
     shall,  under this Agreement as a joint and several  obligor,  repay any of
     the Obligations constituting Advances made to another Borrower hereunder or
     other Obligations incurred directly and primarily by any other Borrower (an
     "Accommodation  Payment"),  then the  Borrower  making  such  Accommodation
     Payment shall be entitled to contribution and indemnification  from, and be
     reimbursed by, each of the other  Borrowers in an amount,  for each of such
     other Borrowers,  equal to a fraction of such  Accommodation  Payment,  the
     numerator of which fraction is such other  Borrower's  Allocable Amount and
     the denominator of which is the sum of the Allocable  Amounts of all of the
     Borrowers. As of any date of determination,  the "Allocable Amount" of each
     Borrower   shall  be  equal  to  the  maximum   amount  of  liability   for
     Accommodation  Payments  which  could be  asserted  against  such  Borrower
     hereunder  without  (i)  rendering  such  Borrower  "insolvent"  within the
     meaning  of  Section  101 (31) of the  Bankruptcy  Code,  Section  2 of the
     Uniform  Fraudulent  Transfer  Act  ("UFTA")  or  Section 2 of the  Uniform
     Fraudulent  Conveyance  Act  ("UFCA"),  (ii)  leaving  such  Borrower  with
     unreasonably small capital or assets,  within the meaning of Section 548 of
     the  Bankruptcy  Code,  Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA, or
     (iii)  leaving  such  Borrower  unable to pay its debts as they  become due
     within the  meaning of Section 548 of the  Bankruptcy  Code or Section 4 of
     the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA. All rights and claims of  contribution,
     indemnification,   and  reimbursement  under  this  Section  3.7  shall  be
     subordinate  in  right  of  payment  to the  prior  payment  in full of the
     Obligations.  The  provisions  of this  Section  3.7  shall,  to the extent
     inconsistent  with any  provision  in any  Loan  Document,  supersede  such
     inconsistent provision.

          (d) If (i) any court holds that the Borrowers are  guarantors  and not
     jointly  and  severally   liable  or  (ii)  bankruptcy  or   reorganization
     proceedings at any time are instituted by or against any Borrower under any
     Debtor Relief Law, each Borrower hereby: (A) until indefeasible  payment in
     full of the Obligations,  expressly and irrevocably  waives, to the fullest
     extent possible,  on behalf of such Borrower,  any and all rights at law or
     in  equity  to  subrogation,   to   reimbursement,   to   exoneration,   to
     contribution,  to  indemnification,  to set off or to any other rights that
     could  accrue to a surety  against a  principal,  to a guarantor  against a
     maker or obligor, to an accommodation party against the party accommodated,
     to a holder  or  transferee  against a maker,  or to the  holder of a claim
     against any Person,  and which such Borrower may have or hereafter  acquire
     against  any Person in  connection  with or as a result of such  Borrower's
     execution,  delivery  and/or  performance of this  Agreement,  or any other
     documents  to which  such  Borrower  is a party  or  otherwise;  (B)  until
     indefeasible payment in full of the Obligations,  expressly and irrevocably
     waives any "claim" (as such term is defined in the Bankruptcy  Code) of any
     kind against any other Borrower,  and further agrees that it shall not have
     or assert any such rights against any Person (including any surety), either

                                       17
<PAGE>

     directly or as an attempted  set off to any action  commenced  against such
     Borrower by the Agent or a Lender or any other Person; and (C) acknowledges
     and agrees (I) that this  waiver is  intended  to benefit the Agent and the
     Lenders and shall not limit or otherwise  affect such Borrower's  liability
     hereunder or the enforceability of this Agreement,  and (II) that the Agent
     and the Lenders and their successors and assigns are intended beneficiaries
     of this  waiver,  and  agreements  set forth in this  Section 3.7 and their
     rights  under  this  Section  3.7  shall  survive  payment  in  full of the
     Obligations.

          (e) This Agreement  shall in all respects be continuing,  absolute and
     unconditional,  and shall  remain in full force and effect with  respect to
     each Borrower until all  Obligations  created or existing before receipt of
     such  notice  shall  have been  indefeasibly  fully  paid.  No  compromise,
     settlement,  release or  discharge  of, or  indulgence  with respect to, or
     failure,  neglect or omission to enforce or exercise any right against, any
     one or more Borrowers shall release or discharge the other Borrowers.

          (f) EACH  BORROWER  WAIVES  THE  FILING OF A CLAIM WITH A COURT IN THE
     EVENT OF  RECEIVERSHIP  OR  BANKRUPTCY  OF ANY  BORROWER,  AND WAIVES EVERY
     DEFENSE, CAUSE OF ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR SETOFF WHICH ANY BORROWER MAY NOW
     HAVE OR  HEREAFTER  MAY HAVE TO ANY  ACTION BY THE  AGENT OR ANY  LENDER IN
     ENFORCING THIS AGREEMENT,  INCLUDING,  WITHOUT  LIMITATION,  EVERY DEFENSE,
     COUNTERCLAIM  OR SETOFF WHICH SUCH  BORROWER MAY NOW HAVE, OR HEREAFTER MAY
     HAVE,  AGAINST  ANOTHER  BORROWER OR ANY OTHER PARTY LIABLE TO THE AGENT OR
     ANY  LENDER  IN ANY  MANNER.  AS  FURTHER  SECURITY,  ANY AND ALL DEBTS AND
     LIABILITIES NOW OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND OWING TO ANY BORROWER BY ANY OTHER
     BORROWER,  OR TO ANY OTHER  PARTY  LIABLE TO THE AGENT OR ANY  LENDER,  ARE
     HEREBY  SUBORDINATED  TO THE AGENT'S AND ANY SUCH LENDER'S  CLAIMS AND UPON
     THE  OCCURRENCE  OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT  ARE  ASSIGNED TO THE AGENT FOR THE
     BENEFIT OF THE LENDERS.  EACH BORROWER  RATIFIES AND CONFIRMS  WHATEVER THE
     AGENT OR A LENDER MAY DO  PURSUANT  TO THE TERMS  HEREOF,  AND AGREES  THAT
     NEITHER THE AGENT NOR ANY LENDER  SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY ERROR IN JUDGMENT
     OR  MISTAKES OF FACT OR LAW.  EACH  BORROWER  HEREBY  AGREES THAT IT MAY BE
     JOINED AS A PARTY  DEFENDANT IN ANY LEGAL  PROCEEDING  (INCLUDING,  BUT NOT
     LIMITED TO, A FORECLOSURE PROCEEDING) INSTITUTED BY THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER
     AGAINST ANY OTHER BORROWER.

          (g)  Should a claim be made upon the  Agent or any  Lender at any time
     for repayment of any amount  received by the Agent or any Lender in payment
     of the Obligations, or any part thereof, whether received from any Borrower
     or received by the Agent or any Lender as the  proceeds of  Collateral,  by
     reason of: (1) any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative
     body  having  jurisdiction  over the  Agent or any  Lender  or any of their
     property, or (2) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by
     the  Agent  or any  Lender,  in its  sole  discretion,  with  the  claimant
     (including a Borrower),  each Borrower  shall remain liable to the Agent or
     any such  Lender  for the  amount so  repaid to the same  extent as if such
     amount had never  originally been received by the Agent or any such Lender,
     notwithstanding  any termination  hereof or the cancellation of any note or
     other  instrument  evidencing  any of the  indebtedness.  To the extent the

                                       18
<PAGE>

     Agent is  required to repay any such  amount,  each  Lender  shall,  to the
     extent  the Agent  previously  paid to such  Lender a portion of the amount
     which must be  repaid,  upon  demand of the Agent,  return to the Agent the
     amount which had previously been paid by the Agent to such Lender.

          (h) To the extent that any payment to, or  realization  by, the Lender
     or the Agent on the Obligations exceeds the limitations of this Section 3.7
     and is otherwise  subject to avoidance and recovery in any such proceeding,
     the  amount  subject  to  avoidance  shall in all  events be limited to the
     amount by which such actual payment or realization exceeds such limitation,
     and this  Agreement as limited shall in all events remain in full force and
     effect and be fully enforceable against such Borrower.  This Section 3.7 is
     intended  solely  to  reserve  the  rights  of the  Lenders  and the  Agent
     hereunder  against each Borrower,  in such proceeding to the maximum extent
     permitted by applicable  Debtor Relief Laws and neither the Borrowers,  any
     guarantor  of the  Obligations  nor any other  Person shall have any right,
     claim or  defense  under  this  Section  3.7 that  would not  otherwise  be
     available under applicable Debtor Relief Laws in such proceeding.

     5.1 Organization and Authority

     Each Borrower is a corporation or limited liability company duly organized,
validly  existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of formation.
Each  Borrower (a) has all requisite  power and authority to own its  properties
and assets (including,  without limitation,  the Collateral) and to carry on its
business as now being conducted and as  contemplated in the Loan Documents,  (b)
is duly qualified to do business in the jurisdictions set forth on Schedule 5.1,

the transactions  contemplated  under the Loan Documents,  and (iv) to grant the
Liens with regard to the Collateral  pursuant to the Security Documents to which

                                       23
<PAGE>

     5.2 Loan Documents and Acquisition Documents

     The execution,  delivery and performance by Borrowers of the Loan Documents
to which any  Borrower  is a party,  and the  consummation  of the  transactions
contemplated  thereby,  (a) have been duly authorized by all requisite action of
such  Borrower and have been duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of such
Borrower;  (b) do not violate any provisions of (i) any applicable law, statute,
rule,  regulation,  ordinance  or  tariff,  (ii) any  order of any  Governmental
Authority  binding  on such  Borrower  or any of its  properties,  or (iii)  the
certificate  of  incorporation  or  bylaws  (or any other  equivalent  governing

and its  shareholders,  members,  partners  or  equity  owners or among any such
shareholders,  members, partners or equity owners; (c) are not in conflict with,
and do not result in a breach or default of or  constitute  an event of default,
or an event,  fact,  condition or circumstance  which, with notice or passage of
time,  or both,  would  constitute or result in a conflict,  breach,  default or
event of default under,  any indenture,  agreement or other  instrument to which
such Borrower is a party,  or by which the properties or assets of such Borrower
are bound,  the effect of which  could  reasonably  be  expected  to be, have or

will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien of any nature upon any
of the  properties  or assets of any  Borrower,  and (e)  except as set forth on

Liens,  do not require the  consent,  approval or  authorization  of, or filing,

Person.  When executed and  delivered,  each of the Loan Documents to which such
Borrower is a party will constitute the legal,  valid and binding  obligation of
each Borrower,  enforceable  against each Borrower in accordance with its terms,
subject  to the effect of any  applicable  bankruptcy,  moratorium,  insolvency,
reorganization  or other similar law affecting the  enforceability of creditors'

of equity securities and/or  ownership,  voting or partnership  interests issued
and  outstanding  of such Borrower and the  beneficial and record owners thereof
(including  options,  warrants and other rights to acquire any of the foregoing)
as of the Closing Date. The  outstanding  equity  securities  and/or  ownership,

IX.  RIGHTS AND REMEDIES AFTER DEFAULT

     9.1 Rights and Remedies

          (a) In addition to the  acceleration  provisions  set forth in Article
     VIII above,  upon the occurrence and  continuation  of an Event of Default,
     Agent  shall have the right to (and at the  request of  Requisite  Lenders,
     shall)  exercise any and all rights,  options and remedies  provided for in
     any Loan Document, under the UCC or at law or in equity, including, without
     limitation,  the right to (i) apply any  property  of any  Borrower  or any
     Guarantor held by Agent,  for the benefit of Lenders,  or Lenders to reduce
     the Obligations, (ii) foreclose the Liens created under the Loan Documents,
     (iii)  realize  upon,  take  possession  of and/or sell any  Collateral  or
     securities  pledged,  with or without judicial  process,  (iv) exercise all
     rights and powers with  respect to the  Collateral  as any  Borrower or any
     Guarantor,  as  applicable,  might  exercise,  (v) collect and send notices
     regarding the Collateral, with or without judicial process, (vi) by its own
     means or with judicial  assistance,  enter any premises at which Collateral
     and/or  pledged  securities  are  located,  or render any of the  foregoing
     unusable or dispose of the  Collateral  and/or  pledged  securities on such
     premises without any liability for rent, storage, utilities, or other sums,
     and no Borrower or Guarantor  shall  resist or interfere  with such action,
     (vii) at Borrowers' expense, require that all or any part of the Collateral
     be assembled and made  available to Agent at any place  designated by Agent
     in its Permitted Discretion, (viii) reduce or otherwise change the Facility
     Cap,  the   Receivables   Percentage,   the   Inventory   Percentage,   the
     Availability,  the Maximum  Equipment  Acquisition  Term Loan  Amount,  the
     Equipment  Percentage,  and/or any component of the foregoing,  and/or (ix)
     relinquish  or abandon any  Collateral  or  securities  pledged or any Lien
     thereon.  Notwithstanding any provision of any Loan Document, Agent, in its
     Permitted  Discretion,  shall have the right, at any time that any Borrower
     fails to do so, and from time to time, without prior notice, to: (i) obtain
     insurance covering any of the Collateral to the extent required  hereunder;
     (ii) pay for the  performance of any of the  Obligations;  (iii)  discharge
     taxes,  levies and/or Liens on any of the Collateral  that are in violation
     of any  Loan  Document  unless  such  Borrower  is in good  faith  with due

                                       48
<PAGE>

     diligence by appropriate  proceedings  contesting those items; and (iv) pay
     for the  maintenance,  repair and/or  preservation of the Collateral.  Such
     expenses and advances shall be added to the Obligations until reimbursed to
     Agent and shall be secured by the  Collateral,  and such  payments by Agent
     shall  not be  construed  as a waiver by Agent or  Lenders  of any Event of
     Default or any other rights or remedies of Agent and Lenders.

          (b) Borrowers  agree that notice  received by any of them at least ten
     (10) calendar days before the time of any intended public sale, or the time
     after which any private sale or other  disposition  of  Collateral is to be
     made,  shall  be  deemed  to be  reasonable  notice  of such  sale or other
     disposition.  If permitted by  applicable  law, any  perishable  Collateral
     which  threatens  to  speedily  decline  in  value  or  which  is sold on a
     recognized  market may be sold immediately by Agent without prior notice to
     Borrowers.  At any sale or disposition of Collateral or securities pledged,
     Agent may (to the extent  permitted by applicable  law) purchase all or any
     part  thereof  free  from  any  right of  redemption  by  Borrowers  or any
     Guarantor which right is hereby waived and released.  Borrowers jointly and
     severally  covenant  and  agree  not to,  and not to permit or cause any of
     their  Subsidiaries  to,  interfere  with or impose any obstacle to Agent's
     exercise of its rights and  remedies  with  respect to the  Collateral.  In
     dealing with or disposing of the Collateral or any part thereof,  Agent and
     Lenders shall not be required to give priority or preference to any item of
     Collateral or otherwise to marshal assets or to take possession or sell any
     Collateral with judicial process.

     9.2 Application of Proceeds

     In addition to any other  rights,  options and  remedies  Agent and Lenders
have under the Loan  Documents,  the UCC,  at law or in equity,  all  dividends,
interest,  rents, issues,  profits,  fees,  revenues,  income and other proceeds
collected or received from collecting,  holding, managing,  renting, selling, or
otherwise disposing of all or any part of the Collateral or any proceeds thereof
upon exercise of its remedies  hereunder upon the occurrence and continuation of
an Event of Default  shall be applied in the  following  order of priority:  (i)
first,  to the payment of all costs and  expenses of such  collection,  storage,
lease,  holding,  operation,  management,  sale,  disposition or delivery and of
conducting  Borrowers'  business  and  of  maintenance,  repairs,  replacements,
alterations,  additions and  improvements  of or to the  Collateral,  and to the
payment of all sums which  Agent or Lenders may be required or may elect to pay,
if any, for taxes, assessments,  insurance and other charges upon the Collateral
or any part  thereof,  and all  other  payments  that  Agent or  Lenders  may be
required or authorized to make under any provision of this Agreement (including,
without limitation, in each such case, in-house documentation and diligence fees
and legal expenses,  search, audit, recording,  professional and filing fees and
expenses  and  reasonable  attorneys'  fees and all  expenses,  liabilities  and
advances made or incurred in connection therewith);  (ii) second, to the payment
of all Obligations in such order as determined by Agent in its sole  discretion;
(iii) third,  to the  satisfaction  of  indebtedness  secured by any subordinate
security interest of record in the Collateral if written  notification of demand
therefor is received before distribution of the proceeds is completed, provided,
that, if requested by Agent, the holder of a subordinate security interest shall
furnish  reasonable  proof of its  interest,  and  unless it does so,  Agent and
Lenders need not address  their claims;  and (iv) fourth,  to the payment of any
surplus  then  remaining  to  Borrowers,  unless  otherwise  provided  by law or
directed by a court of competent jurisdiction,  provided that Borrowers shall be
liable for any  deficiency  if such  proceeds  are  insufficient  to satisfy the
Obligations  or any of the other items  referred to in this Section  (other than
Section  9.2(iii) to the extent the Obligations have been  indefeasibly  paid in
full in cash).

                                       49

     9.3 Rights to Appoint Receiver

     Without limiting and in addition to any other rights,  options and remedies
Agent and Lenders have under the Loan  Documents,  the UCC, at law or in equity,
upon the occurrence and  continuation of an Event of Default,  Agent and Lenders
shall  have the right to apply for and have a receiver  appointed  by a court of
competent  jurisdiction in any action taken by Agent to enforce its and Lenders'
rights and remedies in order to manage,  protect and preserve the Collateral and
continue the  operation of the business of Borrowers and to collect all revenues
and profits  thereof and apply the same to the payment of all expenses and other
charges of such  receivership  including the compensation of the receiver and to
the payments as aforesaid  until a sale or other  disposition of such Collateral
shall be finally made and consummated.

     9.4 Attorney in Fact

     Each Borrower hereby  irrevocably  appoints Agent,  for its benefit and the
benefit of  Lenders,  as its  attorney  in fact to take any action  Agent  deems
necessary or  desirable  upon the  occurrence  and  continuation  of an Event of
Default to protect and realize  upon its and  Lenders'  Lien in the  Collateral,
including the  execution  and delivery of any and all  documents or  instruments
related to the Collateral in such Borrower's  name, and said  appointment  shall
create in Agent,  for its benefit and the  benefit of Lenders,  a power  coupled
with an interest.

     9.5 Blocked Accounts

     Without  limiting any other  provision of any Loan Document and in addition
to any other rights, options and remedies, Agent and Lenders have under the Loan
Documents, the UCC, at law or in equity, upon the occurrence and continuation of
any Event of Default,  Agent shall have the right to require that all amounts in
all Deposit Accounts of any Borrower and that all cash payments received by such
Borrower are paid and delivered  directly into a blocked  account under the sole
dominion  and  control  of  Agent  and that all  such  amounts  are  immediately
transferred  into a  depository  account or accounts  maintained  by Agent or an
Affiliate of Agent at such bank as Agent may determine in its sole discretion.

     9.6 Rights and Remedies not Exclusive

     Agent  shall  have the  right in its sole  discretion  to  determine  which
rights,  Liens  and/or  remedies  Agent  or  Lenders  may  at any  time  pursue,
relinquish,  subordinate or modify,  and such  determination will not in any way
modify or affect any of Agent's or Lenders' rights,  Liens or remedies under any
Loan  Document,  applicable  law or equity.  The  enumeration  of any rights and
remedies in any Loan Document is not intended to be  exhaustive,  and all rights
and remedies of Agent  described in any Loan Document are cumulative and are not
alternative  to or  exclusive  of any  other  rights  or  remedies  which  Agent
otherwise  may have.  The  partial or  complete  exercise of any right or remedy
shall not  preclude  any other  further  exercise  of such or any other right or
remedy.

X.   WAIVERS AND JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS

     10.1 Waivers

     Except as expressly  provided for herein,  each Borrower  hereby waives set
off, counterclaim,  demand,  presentment,  protest, all defenses with respect to
any and all instruments and all notices and demands of any description,  and the
pleading of any statute of limitations as a defense to any demand under any Loan
Document.  Each Borrower hereby waives any and all defenses and counterclaims it
may have or could  interpose in any action or procedure  brought by Agent or any
Lender to obtain an order of court  recognizing  the  assignment  of, or Lien of
Agent, for the benefit of itself and Lenders, in and to, any Collateral.

     10.2 Delay; No Waiver of Defaults

     No course of  action or  dealing,  renewal,  release  or  extension  of any
provision  of any Loan  Document,  or single  or  partial  exercise  of any such
provision,  or delay,  failure  or  omission  on  Agent's  or  Lenders'  part in
enforcing any such  provision  shall affect the liability of any Borrower or any
Guarantor or operate as a waiver of such  provision  or affect the  liability of
any Borrower or any Guarantor or preclude any other or further  exercise of such
provision.  No  waiver  by any  party  to any Loan  Document  of any one or more
defaults by any other party in the  performance  of any of the provisions of any
Loan Document  shall operate or be construed as a waiver of any future  default,
whether of a like or  different  nature,  and each such waiver  shall be limited
solely to the express terms and provisions of such waiver.  Notwithstanding  any
other  provision of any Loan  Document,  by  completing  the Closing  under this
Agreement and/or by making Advances and/or funding the Term Loan,  neither Agent
nor any Lender waives any breach of any  representation or warranty of under any
Loan Document,  and all of Agent's and Lenders' claims and rights resulting from
any such breach or misrepresentation are specifically reserved.

     10.3 Jury Waiver

THE  LOAN  DOCUMENTS  OR THE  TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED  THEREBY,  WHETHER  NOW
EXISTING OR  HEREAFTER  ARISING,  AND  WHETHER  SOUNDING  IN  CONTRACT,  TORT OR
OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF
ACTION  SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT  TRIAL  WITHOUT A JURY,  AND THAT ANY PARTY TO
THIS  AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL  COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH
ANY COURT AS WRITTEN  EVIDENCE  OF THE  CONSENTS OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF
THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY.

     10.4 Cooperation in Discovery and Litigation

     In any  litigation,  arbitration  or other  dispute  resolution  proceeding
relating  to any Loan  Document,  each  Borrower  waives  any and all  defenses,

                                       51
<PAGE>

objections and  counterclaims it may have or could interpose with respect to (a)
any of its directors, officers, employees or agents being deemed to be employees
or managing  agents of such Borrower for purposes of all applicable law or court
rules regarding the production of witnesses by notice for testimony  (whether in
a  deposition,  at trial or  otherwise),  (b)  Agent's or any  Lender's  counsel
examining  any such  individuals  as if under  cross-examination  and  using any
discovery deposition of any of them as if it were an evidence deposition, and/or
(c) using all  commercially  reasonable  efforts to produce in any such  dispute
resolution  proceeding,  at the time and in the manner  requested by Agent,  all
Persons, documents (whether in tangible,  electronic or other form) and/or other
things under its control and relating to the dispute.

     10.5 Amendment and Waivers

          (a) Except as otherwise  provided herein, no amendment,  modification,
     termination,  or  waiver of any  provision  of this  Agreement  or any Loan
     Document, or consent to any departure by Borrowers therefrom,  shall in any
     event be  effective  unless  the same  shall be in  writing  and  signed by
     Requisite  Lenders,  Agent  and  Borrowers;  provided,  that no  amendment,
     modification, termination, or waiver shall, unless in writing and signed by
     each Lender directly affected thereby, do any of the following and that the
     agreement   of  Borrowers   shall  not  be  required  for  any   amendment,
     modification,  termination, or waiver that does any of the following (other
     than item (vi) below to the extent  adverse to Borrowers  and unless any of
     the following  would increase any  commitment fee owing by Borrowers):  (i)
     increase the  Commitment  of any  individual  Lender (which action shall be
     deemed to directly affect all Lenders);  (ii) reduce the principal of, rate
     of interest on or fees payable  with respect to any Loan;  (iii) extend the
     scheduled  due date, or reduce the amount due on any scheduled due date, of

     (iv) change the  percentage of the  Commitments,  of the  aggregate  unpaid
     principal  amount of the Loans,  or of Lenders  which shall be required for
     Lenders or any of them to take any action  hereunder (which action shall be
     deemed to directly  affect all  Lenders) or alter,  as between or among the
     Revolving Lenders and Term Lenders and Equipment  Acquisition Term Lenders,
     the amount  payable to each  hereunder;  (v) except as otherwise  permitted
     herein or in the other Loan Documents,  release any Guaranty or release any
     of the  Collateral  (which  action  shall be deemed to directly  affect all
     Lenders)  (provided,  that consent to such release shall not be required if
     such  release  is made  after and  during  the  continuance  of an Event of
     Default in connection  with the sale or  disposition  of the  Collateral by
     Agent); (vi) amend, modify or waive this Section 10.5 or the definitions of
     the terms used in this Section 10.5 insofar as the  definitions  affect the
     substance of this  Section  10.5 (which  action shall be deemed to directly
     affect all Lenders);  (vii) consent to the  assignment or other transfer by
     any  Borrower  or any other  party  (other than Agent or any Lender) to any
     Loan  Documents  of any of their  rights  and  obligations  under  any Loan
     Document;  and,  provided,   further,  that  no  amendment,   modification,
     termination  or waiver  affecting  the rights or duties of Agent  under any
     Loan Document shall in any event be effective, unless in writing and signed
     by Agent, in addition to Lenders required herein above to take such action.
     Notwithstanding  anything  contained in this Agreement to the contrary,  no
     waiver or consent with respect to any Default (if in  connection  therewith
     Revolving  Lenders  have  exercised  their  right to suspend  the making or
     incurrence of further  Advances) or any Event of Default shall be effective
     for purposes of the conditions  precedent to the making of Advances  unless
     the same  shall be in  writing  and signed by the  Requisite  Lenders  with
     respect to the Revolving Lenders and Borrowers.

<PAGE>

          (b) Each  amendment,  modification,  termination  or  waiver  shall be
     effective  only in the specific  instance and for the specific  purpose for
     which it was given. No amendment, modification, termination or waiver shall
     be  required  for  Agent,  for the  benefit  of itself  and the  benefit of
     Lenders, to take additional Collateral pursuant to any Loan Document.

          (c)  Any  amendment,  modification,  termination,  waiver  or  consent
     effected in accordance  with this Section 10.5 shall be binding upon Agent,
     each Lender and Borrowers.

XI.  EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERMINATION

     11.1 Effectiveness and Termination

     Subject to Agent's and Lenders rights to accelerate the Loans and terminate
and cease making and funding  Advances upon or after any Event of Default,  this
Agreement  shall  continue  in full force and effect  until the  Maturity  Date,
unless  terminated  sooner as provided in this Section  11.1.  Borrowers may not
terminate  this  Agreement or the Revolving  Facility  without  terminating  the
entire  Agreement and all Loans.  Borrowers may terminate  this Agreement at any
time upon not less than thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice to Agent
and  upon  full  performance  and  indefeasible  payment  in full in cash of all
Obligations on or prior to such 30th calendar day after Receipt by Agent of such
written notice. Upon the earlier of the Maturity Date or any such termination by
Borrowers,  the  obligation  of Lenders  to make  Advances  under the  Revolving
Facility shall  terminate.  All of the Obligations  shall be immediately due and
payable upon the earlier of the  Maturity  Date or any such  termination  on the
Maturity Date or the termination  date stated in any notice of  termination,  as
applicable (the "Termination Date"); provided,  that,  notwithstanding any other
provision  of any Loan  Document,  a  Termination  Date  voluntarily  caused  by
Borrowers shall be effective no earlier than the first Business Day of the month
following the  expiration of the thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice
period.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any  termination  notice by Borrowers
pursuant to this Section 11.1 shall be revocable;  provided, that any revocation
shall be by written  notice by  Borrowers  to Agent and to the extent  Borrowers
wish to terminate this Agreement after any such revocation they shall do so only
in compliance with the time periods and other  requirements of this Section 11.1
(i.e., once a termination notice is revoked,  any subsequent  termination notice
shall be subject to the full advance notice and  effectiveness  requirements  of
this Section 11.1). Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document, no
termination of this Agreement shall affect any Lender's or Agent's rights or any
of the Obligations  existing as of the effective date of such  termination,  and
the provisions of the Loan Documents  shall continue to be fully operative until
the Obligations have been fully performed and indefeasibly paid in cash in full.
The Liens  granted to Agent,  for the benefit of itself and  Lenders,  under the
Security  Documents and the financing  statements filed pursuant thereto and the
rights and powers of Agent and Lenders  shall  continue in full force and effect
notwithstanding the fact that Borrowers'  borrowings  hereunder may from time to
time be in a zero or  credit  position  until all of the  Obligations  have been
fully performed and indefeasibly paid in full in cash.

     11.2 Survival

     All  obligations,  covenants,  agreements,   representations,   warranties,
waivers  and  indemnities  made by any  Borrower  or any  Guarantor  in any Loan
Document  shall survive the execution  and delivery of the Loan  Documents,  the
Closing,  the  making  and  funding  of the  Loans and any  termination  of this

                                       53
<PAGE>

Agreement until all Obligations  are fully  performed and  indefeasibly  paid in
full in cash. The obligations  and provisions of Sections 3.4, 3.6, 6.13,  10.1,
10.3,  11.1, 11.2, 13.3, 13.4, 13.7, 13.9, 13.10 and 13.11 and Article XII shall
survive  termination of the Loan Documents and any payment,  in full or in part,
of the Obligations.

XII. AGENCY PROVISIONS

     12.1 Agent

          (a)   Appointment.   Each  Lender  hereby   designates   and  appoints
     CapitalSource  as the  administrative  agent,  payment agent and collateral
     agent,  under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,  and each Lender
     hereby irrevocably authorizes  CapitalSource,  as the administrative agent,
     payment agent and collateral agent for such Lender,  to take such action or
     to refrain  from taking such action on its behalf under the  provisions  of
     this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and
     perform  such  duties  as are  delegated  to the Agent by the terms of this
     Agreement and the other Loan Documents,  together with such other powers as
     are  reasonably  incidental  thereto.  Agent  agrees  to act as such on the
     conditions  contained in this Article XII. The  provisions  of this Article
     XII are solely for the benefit of Agent and Lenders,  and  Borrowers  shall
     have no rights as a  third-party  beneficiary  of any of the  provisions of
     this  Article XII other than the second  sentence of Section  12.1(h)(iii).
     Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder, or under the Loan Documents,
     by or through its agents or employees.

          (b) Nature of Duties.  In  performing  its  functions and duties under
     this Agreement,  Agent is acting solely on behalf of Lenders and its duties
     are administrative in nature and does not assume and shall not be deemed to
     have assumed any obligation  toward or relationship of agency or trust with
     or for Lenders,  other than as expressly  set forth herein and in the other
     Loan Documents,  or Borrowers.  Agent shall have no duties,  obligations or
     responsibilities  except those  expressly set forth in this Agreement or in
     the other Loan Documents.  Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement
     or any other  Loan  Document  a  fiduciary  relationship  in respect of any
     Lender.  Except for  information,  notices,  reports,  and other  documents
     expressly  required to be  furnished  to Lenders by the Agent  hereunder or
     given to the Agent for the  account  of or with  copies for  Lenders,  each
     Lender  shall  make  its own  independent  investigation  of the  financial
     condition  and affairs of Borrowers  in  connection  with the  extension of
     credit  hereunder and shall make its own appraisal of the  creditworthiness
     of  Borrowers,  and  Agent  shall  have no duty or  responsibility,  either
     initially or on a continuing  basis,  to provide any Lender with any credit
     or  other  information  with  respect  thereto,  whether  coming  into  its
     possession before the Closing Date or at any time or times  thereafter.  If
     Agent  seeks the  consent  or  approval  of any  Lenders  to the  taking or
     refraining  from taking any action  hereunder,  then Agent shall send prior
     written  notice  thereof to each Lender.  Agent shall  promptly  notify (in
     writing)  each Lender any time that the  applicable  percentage  of Lenders
     have instructed Agent to act or refrain from acting pursuant hereto.

          (c) Rights,  Exculpation,  Etc. Neither Agent nor any of its officers,
     directors,  managers,  members, equity owners, employees or agents shall be
     liable to any  Lender  for any  action  lawfully  taken or  omitted by them
     hereunder  or under  any of the  other  Loan  Documents,  or in  connection
     herewith  or  therewith.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  Agent  shall be
     obligated  on the terms set forth  herein for  performance  of its  express

                                       54
<PAGE>

     duties and obligations hereunder, and Agent shall be liable with respect to
     its own gross negligence or willful  misconduct.  Agent shall not be liable
     for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith,
     and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to
     have been made in error,  the sole  recourse of any Lender to whom  payment
     was due but not made shall be to recover from other  Lenders any payment in
     excess of the amount to which they are  determined to be entitled (and such
     other  Lenders  hereby  agree to return to such  Lender any such  erroneous
     payments  received  by  them).  In  performing  its  functions  and  duties
     hereunder,  Agent  shall  exercise  the same care which it would in dealing
     with  loans for its own  account.  Agent  shall not be  responsible  to any
     Lender for any recitals, statements,  representations or warranties made by
     Borrowers  herein  or  for  the  execution,   effectiveness,   genuineness,
     validity, enforceability,  collectability, or sufficiency of this Agreement
     or  any of the  other  Loan  Documents  or  the  transactions  contemplated
     thereby,  or for the financial  condition of Borrowers.  Agent shall not be
     required  to  make  any  inquiry   concerning  either  the  performance  or
     observance of any of the terms, provisions, or conditions of this Agreement
     or any of the Loan  Documents or the financial  condition of Borrowers,  or
     the  existence  or possible  existence  of any Default or Event of Default.
     Agent may at any time request instructions from Lenders with respect to any
     actions or approvals  which by the terms of this Agreement or of any of the
     other Loan  Documents  Agent is  permitted or required to take or to grant,
     and Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from taking any action or
     to withhold any approval and shall not be under any liability whatsoever to
     any Person  for  refraining  from  taking  any  action or  withholding  any
     approval under any of the Loan Documents  until it shall have received such
     instructions  from the applicable  percentage of Lenders.  Without limiting
     the foregoing,  no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against
     Agent as a result of Agent  acting or  refraining  from  acting  under this
     Agreement  or any of the  other  Loan  Documents  in  accordance  with  the
     instructions  of the applicable  percentage of Lenders and  notwithstanding
     the  instructions  of Lenders,  Agent shall have no  obligation to take any
     action if it, in good faith  believes that such action exposes Agent or any
     of its officers, directors,  managers, members, equity owners, employees or
     agents to any personal  liability unless Agent receives an  indemnification
     reasonably satisfactory to it from Lenders with respect to such action.

          (d)  Reliance.  Agent  shall be  entitled  to rely  upon  any  written
     notices,  statements,  certificates,  orders  or  other  documents  or  any
     telephone  message or other  communication  (including any writing,  telex,
     telecopy  or  telegram)  believed  by it in good  faith to be  genuine  and
     correct and to have been  signed,  sent or made by the proper  Person,  and
     with  respect to all matters  pertaining  to this  Agreement  or any of the
     other Loan Documents and its duties hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of
     legal counsel, independent accountants, and other experts selected by Agent
     in its sole discretion.

          (e)  Indemnification.  Each Lender,  severally  and not (i) jointly or
     (ii) jointly and  severally,  agrees to reimburse  and  indemnify  and hold
     harmless  Agent and its  officers,  directors,  managers,  members,  equity
     owners,  employees and agents (to the extent not reimbursed by Borrowers or
     the Guarantors,  if any),  ratably  according to their  respective Pro Rata
     Share in effect on the date on which  indemnification  is sought under this

                                       55
<PAGE>

     subsection of the total outstanding  obligations (or, if indemnification is
     sought after the date upon which the Commitments  shall have terminated and
     the Loans shall have been paid in full,  ratably in  accordance  with their
     Pro Rata  Share  immediately  prior to such date of the  total  outstanding
     obligations),  from  and  against  any  and all  liabilities,  obligations,
     losses, damages,  penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits, costs, expenses,
     advances,  or disbursements  of any kind or nature  whatsoever which may be
     imposed on, incurred by, or asserted  against Agent or any of its officers,
     directors, managers, members, equity owners, employees or agents in any way
     relating  to or  arising  out of this  Agreement  or any of the other  Loan
     Documents or any action  taken or omitted by Agent under this  Agreement or
     any of the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that no Lender shall be
     liable for the  payment of any  portion of such  liabilities,  obligations,
     losses, damages,  penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits, costs, expenses,
     advances or  disbursements  resulting  from  Agent's  gross  negligence  or
     willful misconduct. The obligations of Lenders under this Article XII shall
     survive the payment in full of the  Obligations and the termination of this
     Agreement.

          (f) CapitalSource Individually.  With respect to the Loans made by it,
     and the Notes issued to it,  CapitalSource  shall have and may exercise the
     same rights and powers  hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and is
     subject to the same  obligations  and  liabilities as and to the extent set
     forth herein and the other Loan  Documents as any other  Lender.  The terms
     "Lenders" or  "Requisite  Lenders" or any similar  terms shall,  unless the
     context  clearly  otherwise   indicates,   include   CapitalSource  in  its
     individual   capacity  as  a  Lender  or  one  of  the  Requisite  Lenders.
     CapitalSource  may lend  money  to,  and  generally  engage  in any kind of
     banking,  trust or other  business  with any Borrower or any  Subsidiary or
     Affiliates  of any  Borrower  as if it were not  acting  as Agent  pursuant
     hereto.

          (g) Successor Agent.

               (i) Resignation.  Agent may resign from the performance of all or
          part of its  functions  and duties  hereunder at any time by giving at
          least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Borrowers and Lenders.
          Such resignation  shall take effect upon the acceptance by a successor
          Agent of  appointment  pursuant to clause  (ii) below or as  otherwise
          provided below.

               (ii)   Appointment   of  Successor.   Upon  any  such  notice  of
          resignation  pursuant to clause (g)(i) above,  Requisite Lenders shall
          appoint a successor Agent  reasonably  acceptable to Borrowers,  which
          consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If
          a successor Agent shall not have been so appointed  within said thirty
          (30) day period, the retiring Agent, upon notice to Borrowers, may, on
          behalf  of  Lenders,   then  appoint  a  successor  Agent   reasonably
          acceptable  to  Borrowers,  which  consent  shall not be  unreasonably
          withheld, delayed or conditioned,  who shall serve as Agent until such
          time,  as  Requisite  Lenders,  appoint a successor  Agent as provided
          above.  If no  successor  Agent  has been  appointed  pursuant  to the
          foregoing  within said thirty (30) day period,  the resignation  shall
          become effective and Requisite  Lenders shall  thereafter  perform all
          the duties of Agent  hereunder,  until such time, if any, as Requisite
          Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided above.

               (iii) Successor Agent.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
          Agent under the Loan  Documents by a successor  Agent,  such successor
          Agent  shall  thereupon  succeed  to and  become  vested  with all the
          rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and, upon
          the earlier of such  acceptance or the effective  date of the retiring
          Agent's  resignation,  the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its
          duties  and  obligations  under the Loan  Documents,  except  that any

                                       56
<PAGE>

          indemnity rights or other rights in favor of such retiring Agent shall
          continue.  After any retiring  Agent's  resignation as Agent under the
          Loan Documents,  the provisions of this Article XII shall inure to its
          benefit as to any actions  taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
          was Agent under the Loan Documents.

          (h) Collateral Matters.

               (i)  Collateral.  Each Lender agrees that any action taken by the
          Agent or the  Requisite  Lenders  (or,  where  required by the express
          terms  of  this  Agreement,   a  greater  proportion  of  Lenders)  in
          accordance  with the provisions of this Agreement or of the other Loan
          Documents relating to the Collateral, and the exercise by the Agent or
          the Requisite Lenders (or, where so required, such greater proportion)
          of the powers set forth  herein or therein,  together  with such other
          powers as are reasonably  incidental thereto,  shall be authorized and
          binding  upon all of  Lenders  and the  Agent.  Without  limiting  the
          generality  of the  foregoing,  the  Agent  shall  have  the  sole and
          exclusive  right  and  authority  to (i)  act as  the  disbursing  and
          collecting  agent  for  Lenders  with  respect  to  all  payments  and
          collections arising in connection herewith and with the Loan Documents
          in connection with the Collateral;  (ii) execute and deliver each Loan
          Document  relating to the Collateral and accept  delivery of each such
          agreement delivered by Borrowers or any of their  Subsidiaries;  (iii)
          act as collateral  agent for Lenders for purposes of the perfection of
          all security  interests and Liens created by such  agreements  and all
          other purposes  stated therein;  (iv) manage,  supervise and otherwise
          deal with the  Collateral;  (v) take such  action as is  necessary  or
          desirable  to maintain  the  perfection  and  priority of the security
          interests  and Liens  created or  purported  to be created by the Loan
          Documents  relating  to the  Collateral,  and  (vi)  except  as may be
          otherwise specifically  restricted by the terms hereof or of any other
          Loan  Document,  exercise all remedies given to such Agent and Lenders
          with  respect  to the  Collateral  under the Loan  Documents  relating
          thereto, applicable law or otherwise.

               (ii) Release of Collateral.  Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize
          Agent,  at its  option  and in its  discretion,  to  release  any Lien
          granted  to or held by  Agent  for the  benefit  of  Lenders  upon any
          property  covered by the Loan  Documents (A) upon  termination of this
          Agreement and payment and satisfaction in full of all Obligations; (B)
          constituting  property being sold or disposed of if Borrowers  certify
          to Agent that the sale or disposition  is made in compliance  with the
          provisions  of the Loan  Documents  (and  Agent may rely in good faith
          conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry); or (C)
          constituting  property  leased to any Borrower under a lease which has
          expired  or been  terminated  in a  transaction  permitted  under this
          Agreement  or is about to expire  and  which has not been,  and is not
          intended by such Borrower to be, renewed or extended.

               (iii) Confirmation of Authority;  Execution of Releases.  Without
          in any manner limiting  Agent's  authority to act without any specific
          or  further  authorization  or  consent  by  Lenders  (as set forth in
          Section  12.1(h)(i)  and  (ii)),  each  Lender  agrees to  confirm  in
          writing,  upon  request by  Borrowers,  the  authority  to release any
          property  covered by this  Agreement or the Loan  Documents  conferred
          upon Agent under Section  12.1(h)(ii).  So long as no Event of Default
          is then  continuing,  upon receipt by Agent of  confirmation  from the
          requisite  percentage  of  Lenders,  of its  authority  to release any
          particular item or types of property  covered by this Agreement or the
          Loan Documents, and upon at least five (5) Business Days prior written
          request  by  Borrowers,   Agent  shall  (and  is  hereby   irrevocably
          authorized  by Lenders to) execute such  documents as may be necessary

                                       57
<PAGE>

          to evidence the release of the Liens  granted to Agent for the benefit
          of Lenders herein or pursuant hereto upon such  Collateral;  provided,
          however,  that (A) Agent  shall not be  required  to execute  any such
          document on terms  which,  in Agent's  opinion,  would expose Agent to
          liability or create any  obligation  or entail any  consequence  other
          than the release of such Liens  without  recourse  or warranty  (other
          than  that  such  Collateral  is free and  clear,  on the date of such
          delivery,  of any and all Liens  arising from such Person's own acts),
          and (B) such  release  shall not in any  manner  discharge,  affect or
          impair the  Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of Borrowers
          or any Subsidiary of Borrowers, in respect of), all interests retained
          by  Borrowers  or any  Subsidiary  of  Borrowers,  including,  without
          limitation,  the proceeds of any sale,  all of which shall continue to
          constitute part of the property  covered by this Agreement or the Loan
          Documents.

               (iv) Absence of Duty.  Agent shall have no obligation  whatsoever
          to any Lender or any other Person to assure that the property  covered
          by  this  Agreement  or the  Loan  Documents  exists  or is  owned  by
          Borrowers or is cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered
          or that the Liens  granted  to Agent on behalf  of  Lenders  herein or
          pursuant  hereto  have  been  properly  or  sufficiently  or  lawfully
          created, perfected,  protected, enforced or maintained or are entitled
          to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular
          manner  or under  any duty of care,  disclosure,  or  fidelity,  or to
          continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers granted
          or available  to Agent in this  Section  12.1(h) or in any of the Loan
          Documents,  it being  understood  and  agreed  that in  respect of the
          property  covered by this  Agreement or the Loan Documents or any act,
          omission, or event related thereto, Agent may act in any manner it may
          deem  appropriate,  in its  discretion,  given Agent's own interest in
          property  covered by this  Agreement  or the Loan  Documents as one of
          Lenders and that Agent shall have no duty or liability  whatsoever  to
          any of the other Lenders; provided, that Agent shall exercise the same
          care  which  it would  in  dealing  with  loans  for its own  account.
          Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Agent shall be liable with respect to
          its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

          (i) Agency for Perfection.  Each Lender hereby appoints Agent as agent
     for the purpose of  perfecting  Lenders'  security  interest in  Collateral
     which,  in  accordance  with  Article  9  of  the  UCC  in  any  applicable
     jurisdiction, can be perfected only by possession. Should any Lender (other
     than Agent)  obtain  possession of any such  Collateral,  such Lender shall
     notify Agent thereof,  and, promptly upon Agent's request  therefor,  shall
     deliver  such   Collateral   to  Agent  or  in   accordance   with  Agent's
     instructions.

          (j) Exercise of Remedies.  Except as set forth in Section  12.3,  each
     Lender  agrees that it will not have any right  individually  to enforce or
     seek to enforce this  Agreement or any Loan Document or to realize upon any
     collateral security for the Loans, it being understood and agreed that such
     rights and remedies may be exercised only by Agent.

     12.2 Consents

          (a) In the event Agent  requests  the consent of a Lender and does not
     receive a written  denial  thereof within five (5) Business Days after such
     Lender's  receipt of such request,  then such Lender will be deemed to have
     given such consent so long as such request  contained a notice stating that
     such failure to respond within five (5) Business Days would be deemed to be
     a consent by such Lender.

                                       58
<PAGE>

          (b) In the event Agent requests the consent of a Lender in a situation
     where such  Lender's  consent would be required and such consent is denied,
     then Agent may, at its option,  require  such Lender to assign its interest
     in the Loans to Agent for a price equal to the then  outstanding  principal
     amount  thereof due such Lender plus  accrued and unpaid  interest and fees
     due such  Lender,  which  principal,  interest and fees will be paid to the
     Lender when  collected  from  Borrowers.  In the event that Agent elects to
     require any Lender to assign its interest to Agent pursuant to this Section
     12.2,  Agent will so notify such Lender in writing within  forty-five  (45)
     days  following  such  Lender's  denial,  and such  Lender  will assign its
     interest to Agent no later than five (5) calendar days following receipt of
     such notice.

     12.3 Set Off and Sharing of Payments

     In addition  to any rights and  remedies  now or  hereafter  granted  under
applicable  law  and not by way of  limitation  of any  such  rights,  upon  the
occurrence and during the  continuance  of any Event of Default,  each Lender is
hereby  authorized by Borrowers at any time or from time to time, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, with reasonably  prompt  subsequent notice to Borrowers
or to any  other  Person  (any  prior or  contemporaneous  notice  being  hereby
expressly  waived)  to set off and to  appropriate  and to apply any and all (a)
balances (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) held by such
Lender or such holder at any of its offices for the account of  Borrowers or any
of their  Subsidiaries  (regardless  of whether  such  balances  are then due to
Borrowers  or their  Subsidiaries),  and (b) other  property at any time held or
owing by such  Lender or such  holder to or for the credit or for the account of
Borrowers  or any of their  Subsidiaries,  against  and on account of any of the
Obligations  which  are not paid  when  due;  except  that no Lender or any such
holder shall  exercise any such right  without  prior  written  notice to Agent;
provided,  however, that the failure to give notice to Borrowers or to any other
Person shall not affect the validity of such set-off and  application.  Any Term
Lender or  Equipment  Acquisition  Term  Lender,  as the case may be,  which has
exercised  its right to set off or otherwise has received any payment on account
of the  Obligations  shall,  to the  extent  the  amount  of any such set off or
payment  exceeds  its Pro Rata  Share of  payments  obtained  by all of the Term
Lenders or Equipment Acquisition Term Lenders, as the case may be, on account of
such  Obligations,  purchase  for cash (and the other Term  Lenders or Equipment
Acquisition Term Lenders, as the case may be, shall sell) participations in each
such other Term Lender's or Equipment  Acquisition  Term Lender's Pro Rata Share
of  Obligations  as would be  necessary  to cause such Term Lender or  Equipment
Acquisition  Term  Lender,  as the case may be, to share such  excess  with each
other Term Lenders or Equipment Acquisition Term Lenders, as the case may be, in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares; provided, however, that if all
or any portion of such excess  payment or benefits is thereafter  recovered from
such purchasing Term Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded,  and the purchase
price and  benefits  returned,  to the extent of such  recovery.  Any  Revolving
Lender which has  exercised  its right to set off or otherwise  has received any
payment  on account of the  Obligations  shall,  to the extent the amount of any
such set off or payment  exceeds its Pro Rata Share of payments  obtained by all
the Revolving  Lenders on account of such  Obligations  shall, to the extent the
amount of any such set off or  payment  exceeds  it Pro Rata  Share of  payments
obtained by all the Revolving Lenders on account of such  Obligations,  purchase
for cash (and the other  Revolving  Lenders or holders of Revolving  Loans shall

                                       59

sell)  participations in each such other Revolving Lender's or holder's Pro Rata
Share of the Obligations as would be necessary to cause such Revolving Lender to
share such excess with each other Revolving Lender or holders in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Share;  provided,  however, that if all or any portion
of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter  recovered from such purchasing
Revolving Lender,  such purchase shall be rescinded,  and the purchase price and
benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery.  Each Borrower agrees, to the
fullest extent  permitted by law, that (a) any Lender or holder may exercise its
right to set off with  respect to amounts in excess of its Pro Rata Share of the
Obligations  and may sell  participations  in such  excess to other  Lenders and
holders, and (b) any Lender or holder so purchasing a participation in the Loans
made or other  Obligations  held by other  Lenders or holders may  exercise  all
rights of set-off, bankers' lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to
such  participation as fully as if such Lender or holder were a direct holder of
Loans and other Obligations in the amount of such participation.

     12.4 Disbursement of Funds

     Agent may, on behalf of Revolving Lenders,  disburse funds to Borrowers for
Advances  requested.  Each Revolving  Lender shall reimburse Agent on demand for
its Pro Rata Share of all funds disbursed on its behalf by Agent, or if Agent so
requests,  each  Revolving  Lender will remit to Agent its Pro Rata Share of any
Advance  before Agent  disburses  same to Borrowers.  If Agent elects to require
that funds be made available  prior to  disbursement  to Borrowers,  Agent shall
advise each  Revolving  Lender by telephone,  telex or telecopy of the amount of
such Revolving  Lender's Pro Rata Share of such requested  Advance no later than
one (1) Business Day prior to the funding date applicable thereto, and each such
Revolving Lender shall pay Agent such Revolving  Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
requested Loan, in same day funds, by wire transfer to Agent's account not later
than 3:00 p.m. (New York City time).  If any  Revolving  Lender fails to pay the
amount of its Pro Rata Share forthwith upon Agent's demand, Agent shall promptly
notify  Borrowers,  and Borrowers shall  immediately repay such amount to Agent.
Any repayment required pursuant to this Section 12.4 shall be without premium or
penalty.  Nothing in this Section  12.4 or  elsewhere  in this  Agreement or the
other Loan  Documents,  including  without  limitation the provisions of Section
12.5,  shall be deemed to require Agent to advance funds on behalf of any Lender
or to  relieve  any  Lender  from its  obligation  to  fulfill  its  commitments
hereunder  or to prejudice  any rights that Agent or Borrowers  may have against
any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

     12.5 Settlements; Payments and Information

          (a) Advances; Payments; Interest and Fee Payments.

               (i) The amount of  outstanding  Loans  pursuant to  Advances  may
          fluctuate from day to day through  Agent's  disbursement  of funds to,
          and  receipt  of funds  from,  Borrowers.  In order  to  minimize  the
          frequency  of  transfers  of  funds  between  Agent  and  each  Lender
          notwithstanding  terms to the  contrary  set  forth in  Section  12.4,
          Advances and  repayments  may be settled  according to the  procedures
          described in Sections  12.5(a)(ii) and 12.5(a)(iii) of this Agreement.
          Payments of principal,  interest and fees in respect of the Loans will
          be settled,  in accordance with each Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share
          on  the  first   Business  Day  after  such   payments  are  received.
          Notwithstanding these procedures, each Lender's obligation to fund its

                                       60
<PAGE>

          Pro  Rata  Share of any  Advances  made by  Agent  to  Borrowers  will
          commence  on the  date  such  Advances  are made by  Agent;  provided,
          however,  nothing  contained in this Agreement shall obligate a Lender
          to make an  Advance  at any  time an  Event of  Default  exists.  Such
          payments will be made by such Lender without set-off,  counterclaim or
          reduction of any kind.

               (ii) Once each week, or more  frequently  (including  daily),  if
          Agent so elects (each such day being a "Settlement Date"),  Agent will
          advise  each  Lender by 1:00 p.m.  (New York City time) by  telephone,
          telex,  or telecopy of the amount of each such Lender's Pro Rata Share
          of the  outstanding  Loans.  In the event  payments  are  necessary to
          adjust the amount of such Lender's share of the Loans to such Lender's
          Pro Rata Share of the Loans,  the party from which such payment is due
          will pay the other, in same day funds, by wire transfer to the other's
          account not later than 3:00 p.m.  (New York City time) on the Business
          Day following the Settlement Date.

               (iii)  On  the  first  Business  Day  of  each  month  ("Interest
          Settlement  Date"),  Agent will  advise each  Lender by  telephone  or
          facsimile of the amount of interest and fees charged to and  collected
          from Borrowers for the  proceeding  month in respect of the applicable
          Loans.  Provided that such Lender has made all payments required to be
          made by it under this  Agreement,  Agent will pay to such  Lender,  by
          wire transfer to such Lender's account (as specified by such Lender on
          Schedule A of this  Agreement  as amended by such  Lender from time to
          time after the date hereof pursuant to the notice provisions contained
          herein or in the applicable Lender Addition  Agreement) not later than
          3:00 p.m.  (New York City time) on the next Business Day following the
          Interest  Settlement  Date such  Lender's  share of such  interest and
          fees.

          (b) Availability of Lenders' Pro Rata Share.

               (i) Unless Agent has been notified by a Revolving Lender prior to
          any proposed  funding date of such Lender's  intention not to fund its
          Pro Rata Share of the Advance amount requested by Borrowers, Agent may
          assume that such Lender  will make such amount  available  to Agent on
          the  proposed  funding date or the  Business  Day  following  the next
          Settlement Date, as applicable;  provided,  however, nothing contained
          in this  Agreement  shall  obligate a Lender to make an Advance at any
          time an Event of Default exists.  If such amount is not, in fact, made
          available to Agent by such Lender when due,  Agent will be entitled to
          recover  such  amount on  demand  from such  Lender  without  set-off,
          counterclaim, or deduction of any kind.

                                       61
<PAGE>

               (ii) Nothing  contained in this Section 12.5(b) will be deemed to
          relieve a Lender of its  obligation to fulfill its  commitments  or to
          prejudice  any rights Agent or Borrowers  may have against such Lender
          as a result of any default by such Lender under this Agreement.

          (c) Return of Payments.

               (i) If Agent pays an amount to a Lender  under this  Agreement in
          the belief or expectation  that a related  payment has been or will be
          received  by Agent  from  Borrowers  and such  related  payment is not
          received by Agent,  then Agent will be entitled to recover such amount
          from such Lender  without  set-off,  counterclaim  or deduction of any
          kind.

               (ii) If Agent  determines at any time that any amount received by
          Agent under this  Agreement  must be returned to  Borrowers or paid to
          any other  Person  pursuant to any solvency  law or  otherwise,  then,
          notwithstanding  any other term or condition of this Agreement,  Agent
          will not be required to distribute any portion  thereof to any Lender.
          In addition,  each Lender will repay to Agent on demand any portion of
          such amount that Agent has  distributed to such Lender,  together with
          interest  at such  rate,  if  any,  as  Agent  is  required  to pay to
          Borrowers  or such other  Person,  without  set-off,  counterclaim  or
          deduction of any kind.

     12.6 Dissemination of Information

     Upon request by each  Lender,  the Agent will  distribute  promptly to such
Lender,  unless previously  provided by Borrowers to such Lender,  copies of all
notices, schedules, reports, projections,  financial statements,  agreements and
other material and other information,  including,  but not limited to, financial
and reporting  information  received  from  Borrowers or their  Subsidiaries  or
generated by a third party (and excluding only internal information generated by
CapitalSource  for its own use as a Lender or as Agent), as provided for in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents as received by Agent.  Agent shall not be
liable to Lenders  for any  failure to comply  with its  obligations  under this
Section 12.6,  except to the extent that such failure is attributable to Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

XIII. MISCELLANEOUS

     13.1 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Venue

     The Loan  Documents  shall be governed by and construed in accordance  with
the internal laws of the State of Maryland  without  giving effect to its choice
of law provisions. Any judicial proceeding against Borrowers with respect to the
Obligations,  any Loan  Document or any related  agreement may be brought in any
federal  or state  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  located  in the  State of
Maryland.  By  execution  and  delivery  of each Loan  Document to which it is a
party, each Borrower (i) accepts the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any judgment rendered thereby, (ii)
waives personal service of process, (iii) agrees that service of process upon it
may be made by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,  pursuant
to Section 13.5 hereof,  and (iv) waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue
of any action instituted hereunder and agrees not to assert any defense based on
lack of jurisdiction,  venue, convenience or forum non conveniens. Nothing shall
affect the right of Agent or any Lender to serve process in any manner permitted
by law or shall  limit  the right of Agent or any  Lender  to bring  proceedings
against  any   Borrower  in  the  courts  of  any  other   jurisdiction   having
jurisdiction.  Any judicial  proceedings  against Agent or any Lender involving,
directly  or  indirectly,  the  Obligations,  any Loan  Document  or any related
agreement shall be brought only in a federal or state court located in the State
of Maryland.  All parties  acknowledge that they participated in the negotiation
and  drafting  of this  Agreement  with the  assistance  of  counsel  and  that,
accordingly,  no party shall move or petition a court  construing this Agreement
to construe it more stringently against one party than against any other.

     13.2 Successors and Assigns; Assignments and Participations

          (a) Each  Lender may at any time assign all or a portion of its rights
     and delegate all or a portion of its  obligations  under this Agreement and
     the other Loan  Documents  (including all its rights and  obligations  with
     respect to the Loans) to one or more  Persons (a  "Transferee");  provided,
     that (i) so long as no  Default  or Event of Default  has  occurred  and is
     continuing and subject to the provisions of Section  13.2(h)  hereof,  such
     Transferee  shall be a Qualified  Lender and (ii) such  Transferee and such
     assigning  Lender  shall  execute and deliver to Agent for  acceptance  and
     recording in the Register,  a Lender Addition Agreement,  which shall be in
     form  and  substance  reasonably  acceptable  to  Agent  in  its  Permitted
     Discretion. Upon such execution,  delivery,  acceptance and recording, from
     and after the effective date  determined  pursuant to such Lender  Addition
     Agreement,  (A) the Transferee  thereunder  shall be a party hereto and, to
     the  extent  provided  in such  Lender  Addition  Agreement,  have the same
     rights, benefits and obligations as it would if it were a Lender hereunder,
     (B) the  assigning  Lender shall be relieved of its  obligations  hereunder
     with respect to its Commitment or assigned portion thereof, as the case may
     be, to the extent that such obligations  shall have been expressly  assumed
     by the Transferee  pursuant to such Lender Addition  Agreement (and, in the
     case of a Lender Addition  Agreement  covering all or the remaining portion
     of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement,  such
     assigning  Lender shall cease to be a party  hereto but shall  nevertheless
     continue  to be  entitled  to the  benefits  of  Sections  13.4 and  13.7).
     Borrowers  hereby  acknowledge and agree that any assignment will give rise
     to a  direct  obligation  of  Borrowers  to the  Transferee  and  that  the
     Transferee  shall be considered to be a "Lender"  hereunder.  Borrowers may
     not sell,  assign or transfer  any interest in this  Agreement,  any of the
     other Loan Documents,  or any of the  Obligations,  or any portion thereof,
     including Borrowers' rights, title, interests, remedies, powers, and duties
     hereunder or thereunder.

          (b) Each Lender may at any time sell participations in all or any part
     of its  rights and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  and the other Loan
     Documents  (including  all its rights and  obligations  with respect to the
     Loans) to one or more Persons (each, a "Participant").  In the event of any
     such sale by a Lender of a  participation  to a Participant,  such Lender's
     obligations  under this  Agreement to the other  parties to this  Agreement
     shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the
     performance  thereof,  such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Loan
     (and any Note  evidencing  such Loan) for all purposes under this Agreement
     and the other Loan Documents and Borrowers and Agent shall continue to deal
     solely and  directly  with such  Lender in  connection  with such  Lender's
     rights and  obligations  under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
     Any   agreement   pursuant  to  which  any  Lender   shall  sell  any  such
     participation  shall  provide  that such Lender shall retain the sole right
     and  responsibility  to exercise such  Lender's  rights and enforce each of
     Borrowers'  obligations  hereunder,  including  the right to consent to any
     amendment,  supplement,  modification  or waiver of any  provision  of this
     Agreement  or  any  of  the  other  Loan  Documents;  provided,  that  such
     participation  agreement  may  provide  that such  Lender  will not  agree,
     without  the  consent of the  Participant,  to any  amendment,  supplement,
     modification  or waiver  of: (i) any  reduction  in the  principal  amount,
     interest rate or fees payable with respect to any Loan in which such holder
     participates;  (ii) any extension of the termination date of this Agreement
     or the date fixed for any payment of  principal,  interest or fees  payable
     with respect to any Loan in which such holder  participates;  and (iii) any
     release  of all or  substantially  all of the  Collateral  (other  than  in
     accordance  with  the  terms  of this  Agreement  or the  Loan  Documents).
     Borrowers  hereby  acknowledge  and agree that the  Participant  under each
     participation  shall,  solely for the purposes of Sections  10.5,  13.4 and
     13.7 of this Agreement be considered to be a "Lender" hereunder.

                                       63
<PAGE>

          (c) Agent,  on behalf of  Borrowers,  shall  maintain  at its  address
     referred  to in  Section  13.5 a copy of  each  Lender  Addition  Agreement
     delivered to it and a written or electronic  register (the  "Register") for
     the  recordation  of the  names  and  addresses  of  the  Lenders  and  the
     Commitment  of,  and the  principal  amount of the Loans  owing to, and the
     Notes  evidencing  such  Loans  owned by,  each  Lender  from time to time.
     Notwithstanding  anything  in  this  Agreement  to the  contrary,  each  of
     Borrowers,  the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is
     recorded  in the  Register  as the  owner of the  Loans,  the Notes and the
     Commitment  recorded  therein  for  all  purposes  of this  Agreement.  The
     Register  shall be available for  inspection by the Borrowers or any Lender
     at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

          (d)  Notwithstanding  anything in this  Agreement to the contrary,  no
     assignment  under Section 13.2(a) of any rights or obligations  under or in
     respect of the Loans or the Notes  evidencing such Loans shall be effective
     unless and until  Agent  shall have  recorded  the  assignment  pursuant to
     Section 13.2(c).  Upon its receipt of a Lender Addition  Agreement executed
     by an assigning  Lender and an Transferee,  Agent shall (i) promptly accept
     such Lender  Addition  Agreement and (ii) on the effective date  determined
     pursuant thereto record the information  contained  therein in the Register
     and give prompt notice of such  acceptance  and  recordation to the Lenders
     and  Borrowers.  On or prior to such effective  date, the assigning  Lender
     shall surrender any outstanding  Notes held by it all or a portion of which
     are being assigned,  and Borrowers,  at their own expense,  shall, upon the
     request of Agent by the assigning Lender or the Transferee,  as applicable,
     execute and deliver to Agent, within five (5) Business Days of any request,
     new Notes to reflect  the  interest  held by the  assigning  Lender and its
     Transferee.

          (e) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 13.2 no Lender shall,
     as between Borrowers and that Lender, be relieved of any of its obligations
     hereunder as a result of any sale, assignment,  transfer or negotiation of,
     or  granting  of  participation  in,  all or any part of the Loans or other
     Obligations  owed to such Lender.  Each Lender may furnish any  information
     concerning  Borrowers  and their  Subsidiaries  in the  possession  of that
     Lender  from  time  to  time  to  assignees  and  participants   (including
     prospective   assignees  and  participants),   subject  to  confidentiality
     requirements hereunder.

          (f)  Notwithstanding  any other provision set forth in this Agreement,
     any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion
     of its rights under this  Agreement,  including,  without  limitation,  the
     Loans owing to it and the Notes held by it and the other Loan Documents and
     Collateral.

          (g) Borrowers  agree to use  commercially  reasonable  best efforts to
     assist any Lender in assigning or selling participations in all or any part
     of any Loans  made by such  Lender to  another  Person  identified  by such
     Lender.

                                       64
<PAGE>

          (h)  Notwithstanding  anything in the Loan  Documents to the contrary,
     (i)  CapitalSource  and its Affiliates shall not be required to execute and
     deliver a Lender  Addition  Agreement in  connection  with any  transaction
     involving  its  Affiliates  or its or their lenders or financing or funding
     sources,  (ii) no lender to or funding or financing source of CapitalSource
     or its Affiliates shall be considered a Transferee and (iii) there shall be
     no limitation or  restriction on (A)  CapitalSource's  ability to assign or
     otherwise  transfer  any  Loan  Document  or any  Obligation  to  any  such
     Affiliate  or lender  or  funding  or  financing  source,  and (B) any such
     lender's or  financing or funding  source's  ability to assign or otherwise
     transfer any Loan Document or Obligation;  provided, however, CapitalSource
     shall continue to be liable as a "Lender"  under the Loan Documents  unless
     such Affiliate or lender executes a Lender  Addition  Agreement and thereby
     becomes a "Lender."

          (i) The Loan  Documents  shall  inure to the  benefit of each  Lender,
     Agent, Transferees,  Participants (to the extent expressly provided therein
     only) and all future holders of the Note, the Obligations and/or any of the
     Collateral,  and each of their respective successors and assigns. Each Loan
     Document shall be binding upon the Persons other than Lender and Agent that
     are parties  thereto and their  respective  successors and assigns,  and no
     such Person may assign,  delegate or transfer  any Loan  Document or any of
     its rights or obligations  thereunder  without the prior written consent of
     Agent. No rights are intended to be created under any Loan Document for the
     benefit of any third party donee, creditor or incidental beneficiary of any
     Borrower or any Guarantor.  Nothing contained in any Loan Document shall be
     construed as a delegation to Agent or any Lender of any other Person's duty
     of performance. BORROWERS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT AGENT OR ANY LENDER AT
     ANY  TIME  AND  FROM  TIME TO TIME  MAY (I)  DIVIDE  AND  REISSUE  (WITHOUT
     SUBSTANTIVE  CHANGES  OTHER THAN THOSE  RESULTING  FROM SUCH  DIVISION) THE
     NOTES,  AND/OR (II) SELL,  ASSIGN OR GRANT  PARTICIPATING  INTERESTS  IN OR
     TRANSFER  ALL OR ANY  PART OF ITS  RIGHTS  OR  OBLIGATIONS  UNDER  ANY LOAN
     DOCUMENT,  NOTE, THE OBLIGATIONS AND/OR THE COLLATERAL TO OTHER PERSONS, IN
     EACH CASE ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS  PROVIDED HEREIN. Each Transferee and
     Participant  shall have all of the rights and benefits  with respect to the
     Obligations, Notes, Collateral and/or Loan Documents held by it as fully as
     if the original holder thereof, provided that,  notwithstanding anything to
     the contrary in any Loan  Document,  no Borrower  shall be obligated to pay
     under this Agreement to any Transferee or Participant  any sum in excess of
     the sum  which it would  have been  obligated  to pay to  Lenders  had such
     participation not been effected. Notwithstanding any other provision of any
     Loan  Document,  Agent  and  Lenders  may  disclose  to any  Transferee  or
     Participant all information,  reports,  financial statements,  certificates
     and documents obtained under any provision of any Loan Document;  provided,
     that Transferees and Participants  shall be subject to the  confidentiality
     provisions contained herein that are applicable to Agent and Lenders.

     13.3 Application of Payments

     To the  extent  that any  payment  made or  received  with  respect  to the
Obligations  is  subsequently  invalidated,   determined  to  be  fraudulent  or
preferential,  set aside, defeased or required to be repaid to a trustee, debtor
in possession,  receiver,  custodian or any other Person under any Debtor Relief
Law,  common  law or  equitable  cause or any other  law,  then the  Obligations
intended to be satisfied by such payment shall be revived and shall  continue as
if such  payment  had not been  received  by Agent of any  Lender  and the Liens
created hereby shall be revived  automatically without any action on the part of

                                       65
<PAGE>

any party hereto and shall  continue as if such payment had not been received by
Agent or any Lender.  Except as  specifically  provided in this  Agreement,  any
payments with respect to the Obligations  received shall be credited and applied
in such manner and order as Agent shall decide in its sole discretion.

     13.4 Indemnity

     Borrowers,  jointly and severally,  shall  indemnify Agent and each Lender,
their  respective  Affiliates  and  managers,   members,  officers,   employees,
Affiliates,  agents,  representatives,   successors,  assigns,  accountants  and
attorneys (collectively, the "Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs,  expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever  (including,
without  limitation,  reasonable fees and  disbursements of counsel and in-house
documentation  and diligence fees and legal  expenses)  which may be imposed on,
incurred  by or  asserted  against any  Indemnified  Person  with  respect to or
arising out of, or in any litigation,  proceeding or investigation instituted or
conducted  by any Person  with  respect  to any  aspect  of, or any  transaction
contemplated  by, or any matter  related to, any Loan Document or any agreement,
document or transaction  contemplated  thereby,  whether or not such Indemnified
Person is a party thereto,  except to the extent that such  litigation is solely
between or among  Lenders  and  relates  solely to issues  between the Lenders a
final and nonappealable  order of judgment binding on such Indemnified Person of
a court of competent  jurisdiction  determines that any of the foregoing  arises
out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person. If
any Indemnified Person uses in-house counsel for any purpose for which Borrowers
are  responsible  to pay or  indemnify,  Borrowers  expressly  agree  that their
indemnification   obligations   include   reasonable   charges   for  such  work
commensurate  with the fees that would  otherwise  be  charged by outside  legal
counsel selected by such Indemnified  Person in its sole discretion for the work
performed.  Agent  agrees to give  Borrowers  reasonable  notice of any event of
which Agent becomes aware for which  indemnification  may be required under this
Section 13.4,  and Agent may elect (but is not  obligated) to direct the defense
thereof;  provided, that the selection of counsel shall be subject to Borrowers'
consent,  which  consent  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or  delayed,  and
Borrowers  shall be  entitled  to  participate  in the defense of any matter for
which  indemnification  may be required  under this  Section  13.4 and to employ
counsel  at its own  expense  to  assist in the  handling  of such  matter.  Any
Indemnified  Person may, in its reasonable  discretion,  take such actions as it
deems necessary and  appropriate to  investigate,  defend or settle any event or
take  other  remedial  or  corrective  actions  with  respect  thereto as may be
necessary  for the  protection  of such  Indemnified  Person or the  Collateral,
subject to  Borrowers'  prior  approval  of any  settlement,  which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any insurer
agrees to undertake the defense of an event (an "Insured  Event"),  Agent agrees
not to  exercise  its right to select  counsel to defend the event if that would
cause  Borrowers'  insurer  to deny  coverage;  provided,  however,  that  Agent
reserves the right to retain  counsel to represent any  Indemnified  Person with
respect to an Insured  Event at its sole cost and  expense.  To the extent  that
Agent  or any  Lender  obtains  recovery  from  a  third  party  other  than  an
Indemnified  Person of any of the amounts that  Borrowers  have paid to Agent or
any Lender  pursuant to the indemnity set forth in this Section 13.4, then Agent
and/or  Lender  shall  promptly pay to  Borrowers  the amount of such  recovery.
Without  limiting  any of  the  foregoing,  Borrowers,  jointly  and  severally,
indemnifies  the  Indemnified  Parties  for all  claims  for  brokerage  fees or
commissions  (other than claims of a broker with whom such Indemnified Party has

                                       66

directly  contracted in writing) which may be made in connection with respect to
any aspect of, or any  transaction  contemplated  by or  referred  to in, or any
matter  related to, any Loan  Document,  Acquisition  Document or any agreement,
document or transaction contemplated thereby.

     13.5 Notice

     Any notice or request under any Loan  Document  shall be given to any party
to this Agreement at such party's address set forth beneath its signature on the
signature  page to this  Agreement,  or at such other  address as such party may
hereafter  specify in a notice given in the manner  required  under this Section
13.5.  Any  notice or  request  hereunder  shall be given  only by, and shall be
deemed to have been  received  upon  (each,  a  "Receipt"):  (i)  registered  or
certified mail, return receipt requested,  on the date on which such received as
indicated  in such return  receipt,  (ii)  delivery by a  nationally  recognized
overnight  courier,  one (1) Business Day after  deposit with such  courier,  or
(iii)  facsimile  or  electronic  transmission,  in each case upon  telephone or
further  electronic  communication  from  the  recipient  acknowledging  receipt
(whether automatic or manual from recipient), as applicable.

     13.6 Severability; Captions; Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures

     If any  provision of any Loan Document is  adjudicated  to be invalid under
applicable  laws or  regulations,  such provision  shall be  inapplicable to the
extent of such invalidity  without  affecting the validity or  enforceability of
the  remainder  of the Loan  Documents  which  shall be given  effect  so far as
possible.  The captions in the Loan Documents are intended for  convenience  and
reference  only and shall not affect the meaning or  interpretation  of the Loan
Documents. The Loan Documents may be executed in one or more counterparts (which
taken together, as applicable, shall constitute one and the same instrument) and
by  facsimile  transmission,  which  facsimile  signatures  shall be  considered
original executed counterparts. Each party to this Agreement agrees that it will
be bound  by its own  facsimile  signature  and that it  accepts  the  facsimile
signature of each other party.

     13.7 Expenses

     Borrowers  shall pay,  whether  or not the  Closing  occurs,  all costs and
expenses incurred by Agent, Lenders and/or their Affiliates,  including, without
limitation,  documentation and diligence fees and expenses,  all search,  audit,
appraisal,  recording,  professional  and filing fees and expenses and all other
out-of-pocket  charges and  expenses  (including,  without  limitation,  UCC and
judgment and tax lien searches and UCC filings and fees for post-Closing UCC and
judgment and tax lien searches and wire transfer fees and audit  expenses),  and
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses,  (i) in any effort to enforce,  protect
or collect  payment of any  Obligation  or to enforce  any Loan  Document or any
related  agreement,  document or  instrument,  (ii) in connection  with entering
into, negotiating,  preparing, reviewing and executing the Loan Documents and/or
any related agreements,  documents or instruments,  (iii) arising in any way out

Agent or Lender of any action  requested by Borrowers,  (iv) in connection  with
instituting,  maintaining,  preserving, enforcing and/or foreclosing on Agent's,
for the  benefit  of  itself  and  Lenders,  Liens in any of the  Collateral  or
securities   pledged  under  the  Loan  Documents,   whether  through   judicial
proceedings or otherwise, (v) in defending or prosecuting any actions, claims or

                                       67
<PAGE>

proceedings  arising out of or relating to Agent's and/or Lenders'  transactions
with Borrowers, (vi) in seeking,  obtaining or receiving any advice with respect
to its rights and obligations under any Loan Document and any related agreement,
document or instrument, (vii) arising out of or relating to any Default or Event
of Default or occurring thereafter or as a result thereof,  (viii) in connection
with all actions,  visits, audits and inspections undertaken by Agent or Lenders
or their  Affiliates  pursuant to the Loan Documents,  and/or (ix) in connection
with any modification,  restatement,  supplement, amendment, waiver or extension
of any Loan Document and/or any related agreement,  document or instrument.  All
of the foregoing shall be charged to Borrowers' account and shall be part of the
Obligations  and absent a Default or Event of Default all the foregoing shall be
reasonable  in  amount.  If Agent,  any Lender or any of their  Affiliates  uses
in-house counsel for any purpose under any Loan Document for which Borrowers are
responsible  to  pay  or  indemnify,   Borrowers   expressly  agree  that  their
Obligations  include reasonable charges for such work commensurate with the fees
that would otherwise be charged by outside legal counsel selected by Agent, such
Lender or such Affiliate in its sole discretion for the work performed.  Without
limiting the  foregoing,  Borrowers  shall pay all taxes (other than taxes based
upon or measured by each  Lender's  income or revenues or any personal  property
tax), if any, in connection  with the issuance of any Note and the filing and/or
recording of any documents and/or financing statements.

     13.8 Entire Agreement

     This Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which  Borrowers are parties
constitute  the entire  agreement  between  Borrowers,  Agent and  Lenders  with
respect to the  subject  matter  hereof and  thereof,  and  supersede  all prior
agreements and understandings (including but not limited to the term sheet dated
on or about February 25, 2003, if any,  relating to the subject matter hereof or
thereof.  Any promises,  representations,  warranties  or guarantees  not herein
contained and hereinafter  made shall have no force and effect unless in writing
signed by Borrowers,  Agent and Lenders or Requisite  Lenders,  as  appropriate.
Except as set forth in and subject to Section  10.5,  no  provision  of any Loan
Document may be changed,  modified,  amended,  restated,  waived,  supplemented,
discharged,  canceled or terminated orally or by any course of dealing or in any
other manner other than by an agreement in writing  signed by  Borrowers,  Agent
and Requisite Lenders; provided, that no consent or agreement by Borrowers shall
be required to amend, modify, change,  restate,  waive,  supplement,  discharge,
cancel or terminate any provision of Article XII so long as no additional duties
are required to be assumed by Borrowers.  Each party hereto acknowledges that it
has been advised by counsel in connection  with the negotiation and execution of
this  Agreement  and is not  relying  upon oral  representations  or  statements
inconsistent with the terms and provisions hereof. The schedules attached hereto
may be amended or  supplemented  by  Borrowers  upon  delivery  to Agent of such
amendments or supplements  and, except as expressly  provided  otherwise in this
Agreement, the written approval thereof by Agent.

     13.9 Approvals and Duties

     Unless expressly  provided herein to the contrary,  any approval,  consent,
waiver or  satisfaction  of Agent or Lenders  with respect to any matter that is
subject of any Loan Document may be granted or withheld by Agent or Lenders,  as
applicable,  in their sole and absolute  discretion.  Other than Agent's duty of
reasonable  care with  respect to  Collateral  delivered  pursuant to the Pledge

                                       68
<PAGE>

Agreements,  Agent and Lenders shall have no responsibility for or obligation or
duty with respect to any of the  Collateral or any matter or proceeding  arising
out of or relating thereto,  including,  without  limitation,  any obligation or
duty to collect any sums due in respect  thereof or to protect or  preserve  any
rights pertaining thereto.

     13.10 Confidentiality and Publicity

     Agent and each Lender reserve the right to review and approve all materials
that Borrowers or any of their Affiliates  prepares that contain Agent's or such
Lender's  name or  describe  or  refer to any Loan  Document,  any of the  terms
thereof or any of the transactions  contemplated  thereby.  Borrowers shall not,
and shall not permit  any of their  Affiliates  to,  use  either  Agent's or any
Lender's  name (or the name of any of Agent's  or any  Lenders'  Affiliates)  in
connection  with any of its business  operations,  provided,  that Borrowers may
disclose  the  Lenders'  names,  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of the Loans
outstanding  and other  principal  terms of such Loans to its  shareholders  and
other equity owners and prospective  purchasers of debt or equity  securities of
Borrowers  so  long as  Borrowers  inform  such  prospective  purchasers  of the
confidential nature of such information and such Persons agree in writing not to
disclose  the same to any other  Person  and to be bound by the  confidentiality
provisions of this Agreement. Nothing contained in any Loan Document is intended
to permit or  authorize  any  Borrower or any of its  Affiliates  to contract on
behalf of Agent or any Lender.

     13.11 Release of Collateral

     Subject  to  Section  12.3,   promptly   following  full   performance  and
satisfaction and indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Obligations and the
termination  of this  Agreement,  the Liens created  hereby shall  terminate and
Agent and Lenders  shall  execute  and deliver  such  documents,  at  Borrowers'
expense,  as are necessary to release Lenders' Liens in the Collateral and shall
return the Collateral to Borrowers;  provided,  however,  that the parties agree
that, notwithstanding any such termination or release or the execution, delivery
or filing of any such documents or the return of any  Collateral,  if and to the
extent that any such payment made or received with respect to the Obligations is
subsequently  invalidated,  determined  to be fraudulent  or  preferential,  set
aside,  defeased or required  to be repaid to a trustee,  debtor in  possession,
receiver,  custodian or any other Person under any Debtor Relief Law, common law
or  equitable  cause or any  other  law,  then the  Obligations  intended  to be
satisfied by such payment shall be revived and shall continue as if such payment
had not been received by Agent or any Lender and the Liens created  hereby shall
be revived  automatically without any action on the part of any party hereto and
shall  continue as if such payment had not been received by Agent or any Lender.
Agent  and  Lenders  shall not be  deemed  to have  made any  representation  or
warranty with respect to any Collateral so delivered except that such Collateral
is free and clear,  on the date of such  delivery,  of any and all Liens arising
from such Person's own acts.

taken and/or  delivered to Agent's  satisfaction on or before the date specified
