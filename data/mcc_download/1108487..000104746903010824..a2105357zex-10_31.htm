<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement to Guarantee.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Guarantor hereby agrees, jointly and severally, to guarantee to each holder of a

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;As
between the Guarantors, on the one hand and, the Holders, on the other hand, (i)&nbsp;the maturity of the Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as

the foregoing, in the event that this Guarantee would constitute or result in a violation of any applicable fraudulent conveyance or similar law of any

created or acquired, provided that (i)&nbsp;immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Event of Default exists under the Purchase Agreement, and (ii)&nbsp;such Subsidiary becomes a
Guarantor hereunder, or (b)&nbsp;shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to Borrower or another Guarantor or to a
Subsidiary of Borrower or any Guarantor hereafter created or acquired, provided that (i)&nbsp;immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Event of Default exists under the Purchase

for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Series&nbsp;B Note waives and releases all such liability. This waiver and
release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Series&nbsp;B Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the
Commission that such a waiver is against public policy. </FONT></P>
