                                                                   EXHIBIT 10.36

                         FIRST AMENDMENT TO MASTER LEASE

         THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO MASTER LEASE (this "Amendment") is made as of
February 1, 2002, by and between DOUBLE 9 PROPERTY II LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("Lessor"), whose address is c/o U.S. Realty Advisors, LLC,
1370 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10019, and DOE FAMILY II LLC, a
Massachusetts limited liability company ("Lessee"), whose address is 160 Olympia
Avenue, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801.

                             PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

         Lessor and Lessee entered into that certain Master Lease, dated as of
December 4, 2001 (the "Lease"). Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all
defined terms used in this Amendment shall have the meanings ascribed to them in
the Lease.

         Lessor and Lessee desire to amend the Lease to add the property located
at 10 St. Laurent Street, Nashua, New Hampshire (FFC No. 8001-3356, Store No.
3027) (the "New Property").

                                    AGREEMENT

         In consideration of the mutual covenants and provisions of this
Amendment, the parties agree as follows:

         1.       AMENDMENT. A. Exhibit A of the Lease is hereby amended to
delete such Exhibit originally attached to the Lease and substitute in lieu
thereof the Exhibit A attached to this Amendment.

         B.       Exhibit A-1 of the Lease is hereby amended to add thereto the
legal description attached as Exhibit A-1 to this Amendment.

         C.       The definition of "Base Annual Rental" in Section 1 of the
Lease is hereby amended to read as follows from and after the date of this
Amendment:

         "Base Annual Rental" means $1,257,618.00, subject to the increases
provided in Section 5.B.

         D.       Lessee acknowledges that the New Property is a condominium
unit. During the Lease Term, Lessee shall promptly pay, perform and comply with
all obligations imposed on the owner of the New Property by the applicable
condominium declaration, by-laws and related documents (collectively, the
"Condominium Documents") and shall provide Lessor with copies of any notices
received by Lessee from the condominium board, its managing agent or from the
owner of any other condominium unit, including, without limitation, notices
asserting or claiming a default or breach by Lessee under the Condominium
Documents, such copies to be provided to Lessor within five (5) days after
Lessee's receipt of the applicable notice. Lessee shall indemnify, protect,
defend and hold harmless each of the Indemnified Parties from and against any
and all Losses (excluding Losses suffered by an Indemnified Party arising out of
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that the

<PAGE>

term "gross negligence" shall not include gross negligence imputed as a matter
of law to any of the Indemnified Parties solely by reason of the Lessor's
interest in any of the Properties or Lessor's failure to act in respect of
matters which are or were the obligation of Lessee under the Lease or this
Amendment) caused by, incurred or resulting from Lessee's failure to pay,
perform and comply with the terms and conditions of the Condominium Documents or
this Section. If Lessee fails to pay, perform or comply with any of its
obligations under the Condominium Documents or this Section, Lessor may pay or
perform such obligations; provided, however, in no event shall Lessor be
obligated to pay or perform such obligations, and in no event shall payment or
performance of such obligations by Lessor constitute a cure of any Event of
Default arising under the Lease as a result of Lessee's failure to pay, perform
or comply with such obligations. Any amounts disbursed by Lessor as a result of
Lessor's performance of such obligations shall bear interest at the Default Rate
from and including the date of such advance to and including the date such
advance is repaid.

         2.       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations and
warranties of Lessee in the Lease with respect to the properties covered by the
Lease (including, without limitation, those contained in Sections 7 and 16 of
the Lease) are hereby made by Lessee as of the date hereof with respect to the
New Property.

         3.       RATIFICATION. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Amendment, the Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect.

         4.       COUNTERPARTS. This Amendment may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original.

         5.       LIABILITY LIMITATION. The liabilities and obligations of
Lessor and Lessee under this Amendment are subject to the provisions of Section
36 of the Lease, the terms of which are incorporated herein by this reference.

                                       2
