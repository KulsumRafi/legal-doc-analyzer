     amount available to Agent in immediately available funds on the Funding
     Date and Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon

                                      -29-

<PAGE>

     such assumption, make available to Borrowers on such date a corresponding
     amount. If and to the extent any Lender shall not have made its full amount
     available to Agent in immediately available funds and Agent in such
     circumstances has made available to Borrowers such amount, that Lender
     shall on the Business Day following such Funding Date make such amount
     available to Agent, together with interest at the Defaulting Lender Rate
     for each day during such period. A notice submitted by Agent to any Lender
     with respect to amounts owing under this subsection shall be conclusive,
     absent manifest error. If such amount is so made available, such payment to
     Agent shall constitute such Lender's Advance on the date of Borrowing for
     all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to
     Agent on the Business Day following the Funding Date, Agent will notify
     Administrative Borrower of such failure to fund and, upon demand by Agent,
     Borrowers shall pay such amount to Agent for Agent's account, together with
     interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at
     a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the
     Advances composing such Borrowing. The failure of any Lender to make any
     Advance on any Funding Date shall not relieve any other Lender of any
     obligation hereunder to make an Advance on such Funding Date, but no Lender
     shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
     Advance to be made by such other Lender on any Funding Date.

                    (iii) Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a
     Defaulting Lender any payments made by Borrowers to Agent for the
     Defaulting Lender's benefit, and, in the absence of such transfer to the
     Defaulting Lender, Agent shall transfer any such payments to each other
     non-Defaulting Lender member of the Lender Group ratably in accordance with
     their Commitments (but only to the extent that such Defaulting Lender's
     Advance was funded by the other members of the Lender Group) or, if so
     directed by Administrative Borrower and if no Default or Event of Default
     had occurred and is continuing (and to the extent such Defaulting Lender's
     Advance was not funded by the Lender Group), retain same to be re-advanced
     to Borrowers as if such Defaulting Lender had made Advances to Borrowers.
     Subject to the foregoing, Agent may hold and, in its Permitted Discretion,
     re-lend to Borrowers for the account of such Defaulting Lender the amount
     of all such payments received and retained by it for the account of such
     Defaulting Lender. Solely for the purposes of voting or consenting to
     matters with respect to the Loan Documents, such Defaulting Lender shall be
     deemed not to be a "Lender" and such Lender's Commitment shall be deemed to
     be zero. This Section shall remain effective with respect to such Lender
     until (x) the Obligations under this Agreement shall have been declared or
     shall have become immediately due and payable, (y) the non-Defaulting
     Lenders, Agent, and Administrative Borrower shall have waived such
     Defaulting Lender's default in writing, or (z) the Defaulting Lender makes
     its Pro Rata Share of the applicable Advance and pays to Agent all amounts
     owing by Defaulting Lender in respect thereof. The operation of this
     Section shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the
     Commitment of any Lender, to relieve or excuse the performance by such
     Defaulting Lender or any other Lender of its duties and obligations
     hereunder, or to relieve or excuse the performance by Borrowers of their
     duties and obligations hereunder to Agent or to the Lenders other than such
     Defaulting Lender. Any such failure to fund by any Defaulting Lender shall
     constitute a material breach by such Defaulting Lender of this Agreement
     and shall entitle Administrative Borrower at its option, upon written
     notice to Agent, to arrange for a substitute Lender to assume the

                                      -30-

<PAGE>

     Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, such substitute Lender to be
     acceptable to Agent. In connection with the arrangement of such a
     substitute Lender, the Defaulting Lender shall have no right to refuse to
     be replaced hereunder, and agrees to execute and deliver a completed form
     of Assignment and Acceptance Agreement in favor of the substitute Lender
     (and agrees that it shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such
     document if it fails to do so) subject only to being repaid its share of
     the outstanding Obligations (other than Bank Product Obligations)
     (including an assumption of its Pro Rata Share of the Risk Participation
     Liability) without any premium or penalty of any kind whatsoever; provided
                                                                       --------
     further, however, that any such assumption of the Commitment of such
     -------  -------
     Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any of the
     Lender Groups' or Borrowers' rights or remedies against any such Defaulting
     Lender arising out of or in relation to such failure to fund.

               (d) Making of Swing Loans.

                    (i) In the event Agent shall elect, with the consent of
     Swing Lender, as a Lender, to have the terms of this Section 2.2(d) apply
                                                          --------------
     to a requested Borrowing as described in Section 2.2(b), Swing Lender as a
                                              --------------
     Lender shall make such Advance in the amount of such Borrowing (any such
     Advance made solely by Swing Lender as a Lender pursuant to this Section
                                                                      -------
     2.2(d) being referred to as a "Swing Loan" and such Advances being referred
     ------                         ----------
     to collectively as "Swing Loans") available to Borrowers on the Funding
                         -----------
     Date applicable thereto by transferring immediately available funds to
     Administrative Borrower's Designated Account. Each Swing Loan is an Advance
     hereunder and shall be subject to all the terms and conditions applicable
     to other Advances, except that all payments on any Swing Loan shall be
     payable to Swing Lender as a Lender solely for its own account (and for the
     account of the holder of any participation interest with respect to such
     Swing Loan). Subject to the provisions of Section 2.2(i), Agent shall not
                                               --------------
     request Swing Lender as a Lender to make, and Swing Lender as a Lender
     shall not make, any Swing Loan if Agent has actual knowledge that (i) one
     or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 will
                                                                 ---------
     not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing
     unless such condition has been waived, or (ii) the requested Borrowing
     would exceed the Availability on such Funding Date. Swing Lender as a
     Lender shall not otherwise be required to determine whether the applicable
     conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 have been satisfied on the
                                       ---------
     Funding Date applicable thereto prior to making, in its sole discretion,
     any Swing Loan.

                    (ii) The Swing Loans shall be secured by the Agent's Liens,
     shall constitute Advances and Obligations hereunder, and shall bear
     interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Advances that are Base
     Rate Loans.

               (e) Agent Advances.

                    (i) Agent hereby is authorized by Borrowers and the Lenders,
     from time to time in Agent's sole discretion, (1) after the occurrence and
     during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, or (2) at any
     time that any of the other applicable conditions precedent set forth in
     Section 3 have not been satisfied, to make
     ---------

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

     Advances to Borrowers on behalf of the Lenders that Agent, in its Permitted
     Discretion deems necessary or desirable (A) to preserve or protect the
     Collateral, or any portion thereof, (B) to enhance the likelihood of
     repayment of the Obligations (other than the Bank Product Obligations), or
     (C) to pay any other amount chargeable to Borrowers pursuant to the terms
     of this Agreement, including Lender Group Expenses and the costs, fees, and
     expenses described in Section 10 (any of the Advances described in this
                           ----------
     Section 2.2(e) shall be referred to as "Agent Advances"). Each Agent
     --------------                          --------------
     Advance is an Advance hereunder and shall be subject to all the terms and
     conditions applicable to other Advances, except that no such Agent Advance
     shall be eligible for the LIBOR Option and all payments thereon shall be
     payable to Agent solely for its own account (and for the account of the
     holder of any participation interest with respect to such Agent Advance).

                    (ii) The Agent Advances shall be repayable on demand and
     secured by the Agent's Liens granted to Agent under the Loan Documents,
     shall constitute Advances and Obligations hereunder, and shall bear
     interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Advances that are Base
     Rate Loans.

               (f) Settlement. It is agreed that each Lender's funded portion of
the Advances is intended by the Lenders to equal, at all times, such Lender's
Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Advances. Such agreement notwithstanding,
Agent, Swing Lender, and the other Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be
for the benefit of or enforceable by Borrowers) that in order to facilitate the
administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, settlement among
them as to the Advances, the Swing Loans, and the Agent Advances shall take
place on a periodic basis in accordance with the following provisions:

                    (i) Agent shall request settlement ("Settlement") with the
                                                         ----------
     Lenders on a weekly basis, or on a more frequent basis if so determined by
     Agent, (1) on behalf of Swing Lender, with respect to each outstanding
     Swing Loan, (2) for itself, with respect to each Agent Advance, and (3)
     with respect to Collections received, as to each by notifying the Lenders
     by telecopy, telephone, or other similar form of transmission, of such
     requested Settlement, no later than 2:00 p.m. (California time) on the
     Business Day immediately prior to the date of such requested Settlement
     (the date of such requested Settlement being the "Settlement Date"). Such
                                                       ---------------
     notice of a Settlement Date shall include a summary statement of the amount
     of outstanding Advances, Swing Loans, and Agent Advances for the period
     since the prior Settlement Date. Subject to the terms and conditions
     contained herein (including Section 2.2(c)(iii)): (y) if a Lender's balance
                                 -------------------
     of the Advances, Swing Loans, and Agent Advances exceeds such Lender's Pro
     Rata Share of the Advances, Swing Loans, and Agent Advances as of a
     Settlement Date, then Agent shall, by no later than 12:00 p.m. (California
     time) on the Settlement Date, transfer in immediately available funds to
     the account of such Lender as such Lender may designate, an amount such
     that each such Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have as of the
     Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Advances, Swing Loans, and Agent
     Advances, and (z) if a Lender's balance of the Advances, Swing Loans, and
     Agent Advances is less than such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Advances,
     Swing Loans, and Agent Advances as of a Settlement Date, such Lender shall
     no later than 12:00 p.m. (California time) on the Settlement Date transfer
     in immediately available funds to the Agent's Account, an amount such that
     each such Lender shall, upon transfer of such amount, have as of the

                                      -32-

<PAGE>

     Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Advances, Swing Loans, and Agent
     Advances. Such amounts made available to Agent under clause (z) of the
     immediately preceding sentence shall be applied against the amounts of the
     applicable Swing Loan or Agent Advance and, together with the portion of
     such Swing Loan or Agent Advance representing Swing Lender's Pro Rata Share
     thereof, shall constitute Advances of such Lenders. If any such amount is
     not made available to Agent by any Lender on the Settlement Date applicable
     thereto to the extent required by the terms hereof, Agent shall be entitled
     to recover for its account such amount on demand from such Lender together
     with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate.

                    (ii) In determining whether a Lender's balance of the
     Advances, Swing Loans, and Agent Advances is less than, equal to, or
     greater than such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Advances, Swing Loans, and
     Agent Advances as of a Settlement Date, Agent shall, as part of the
     relevant Settlement, apply to such balance the portion of payments actually
     received in good funds by Agent with respect to principal, interest, fees
     payable by Borrowers and allocable to the Lenders hereunder, and proceeds
     of Collateral. To the extent that a net amount is owed to any such Lender
     after such application, such net amount shall be distributed by Agent to
     that Lender as part of such next Settlement.

                    (iii) Between Settlement Dates, Agent, to the extent no
     Agent Advances or Swing Loans are outstanding, may pay over to Swing Lender
     any payments received by Agent, that in accordance with the terms of this
     Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Advances, for
     application to Swing Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Advances. If, as of any
     Settlement Date, Collections received since the then immediately preceding
     Settlement Date have been applied to Swing Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
     Advances other than to Swing Loans, as provided for in the previous
     sentence, Swing Lender shall pay to Agent for the accounts of the Lenders,
     and Agent shall pay to the Lenders, to be applied to the outstanding
     Advances of such Lenders, an amount such that each Lender shall, upon
     receipt of such amount, have, as of such Settlement Date, its Pro Rata
     Share of the Advances. During the period between Settlement Dates, Swing
     Lender with respect to Swing Loans, Agent with respect to Agent Advances,
     and each Lender (subject to the effect of letter agreements between Agent
     and individual Lenders) with respect to the Advances other than Swing Loans
     and Agent Advances, shall be entitled to interest at the applicable rate or
     rates payable under this Agreement on the daily amount of funds employed by
     Swing Lender, Agent, or the Lenders, as applicable.

               (g) Notation. Agent shall record on its books the principal
amount of the Advances owing to each Lender, including the Swing Loans owing to
Swing Lender, and Agent Advances owing to Agent, and the interests therein of
each Lender, from time to time. In addition, each Lender is authorized, at such
Lender's option, to note the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of
principal of such Lender's Advances in its books and records, including computer
records, such books and records constituting conclusive evidence, absent
manifest error, of the accuracy of the information contained therein.

               (h) Lenders' Failure to Perform. All Advances (other than Swing
Loans and Agent Advances) shall be made by the Lenders contemporaneously and in
accordance

                                      -33-

<PAGE>

with their Pro Rata Shares. It is understood that (i) no Lender shall be
responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to
make any Advance (or other extension of credit) hereunder, nor shall any
Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by
any other Lender to perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) no failure by
any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder shall excuse any other Lender
from its obligations hereunder.

               (i) Optional Overadvances. Any contrary provision of this
Agreement notwithstanding, the Lenders hereby authorize Agent or Swing Lender,
as applicable, and Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, may, but is not
obligated to, knowingly and intentionally, continue to make Advances (including
Swing Loans) to Borrowers notwithstanding that an Overadvance exists or thereby
would be created, so long as (i) after giving effect to such Advances (including
a Swing Loan), the Revolver Usage does not exceed the Borrowing Base by more
than $5,000,000, (ii) after giving effect to such Advances (including a Swing
Loan) the outstanding Revolver Usage (except for and excluding amounts charged
to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) does not
exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount, and (iii) at the time of the making of any
such Advance (including a Swing Loan), Agent does not believe, in good faith,
that the Overadvance created by such Advance will be outstanding for more than
90 days. The foregoing provisions are for the exclusive benefit of Agent, Swing
Lender, and the Lenders and are not intended to benefit Borrowers in any way.
The Advances and Swing Loans, as applicable, that are made pursuant to this
Section 2.2(i) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as any other
--------------
Advance or Swing Loan, as applicable, except that they shall not be eligible for
the LIBOR Option and the rate of interest applicable thereto shall be the rate
applicable to Advances that are Base Rate Loans under Section 2.5(c) hereof
                                                      --------------
without regard to the presence or absence of a Default or Event of Default.

                    (i) In the event Agent obtains actual knowledge that the
     Revolver Usage exceeds the amounts permitted by the preceding paragraph,
     regardless of the amount of, or reason for, such excess, Agent shall notify
     Lenders as soon as practicable (and prior to making any (or any additional)
     intentional Overadvances (except for and excluding amounts charged to the
     Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) unless Agent
     determines that prior notice would result in imminent harm to the
     Collateral or its value), and the Lenders thereupon shall, together with
     Agent, jointly determine the terms of arrangements that shall be
     implemented with Borrowers and intended to reduce, within a reasonable
     time, the outstanding principal amount of the Advances to Borrowers to an
     amount permitted by the preceding paragraph. In the event Agent or any
     Lender disagrees over the terms of reduction or repayment of any
     Overadvance, the terms of reduction or repayment thereof shall be
     implemented according to the determination of the Required Lenders.

                    (ii) Each Lender shall be obligated to settle with Agent as
     provided in Section 2.2(f) for the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share
                 --------------
     of any unintentional Overadvances by Agent reported to such Lender, any
     intentional Overadvances made as permitted under this Section 2.2(i), and
                                                           --------------
     any Overadvances resulting from the charging to the Loan Account of
     interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses.

          2.3 Payments.
              --------

               (a) Payments by Borrowers.

                    (i) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
     payments by Borrowers shall be made to Agent's Account for the account of
     the Lender Group and shall be made in immediately available funds, no later
     than 11:00 a.m. (California time) on the date specified herein. Any payment
     received by Agent later than 11:00 a.m. (California time), shall be deemed
     to have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable
     interest or fee shall continue to accrue until such following Business Day.

                    (ii) Unless Agent receives notice from Administrative
     Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that
     Borrowers will not make such payment in full as and when required, Agent
     may assume that Borrowers have made (or will make) such payment in full to
     Agent on such date in immediately available funds and Agent may (but shall
     not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each
     Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.
     If and to the extent Borrowers do not make such payment in full to Agent on
     the date when due, each Lender severally shall repay to Agent on demand
     such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon at
     the Defaulting Lender Rate for each day from the date such amount is
     distributed to such Lender until the date repaid.

               (b) Apportionment and Application.

                    (i) Except as otherwise provided with respect to Defaulting
     Lenders and except as otherwise provided in the Loan Documents (including
     letter agreements between Agent and individual Lenders), aggregate
     principal and interest payments shall be apportioned ratably among the
     Lenders (according to the unpaid principal balance of the Obligations to
     which such payments relate held by each Lender) and payments of fees and
     expenses (other than fees or expenses that are for Agent's separate
     account, after giving effect to any letter agreements between Agent and
     individual Lenders) shall be apportioned ratably among the Lenders having a
     Pro Rata Share of the type of Commitment or Obligation to which a
     particular fee relates. All payments shall be remitted to Agent and all
     such payments (other than payments received while no Default or Event of
     Default has occurred and is continuing and which relate to the payment of
     principal or interest of specific Obligations or which relate to the
     payment of specific fees), and all proceeds of Accounts or other Collateral
     received by Agent, shall be applied as follows:

                         A. first, to pay any Lender Group Expenses then due to
                            -----
               Agent under the Loan Documents, until paid in full,

                         B. second, to pay any Lender Group Expenses then due to
                            ------
               the Lenders under the Loan Documents, on a ratable basis, until
               paid in full,

                                      -35-

<PAGE>

                         C. third, to pay any fees then due to Agent (for its
                            -----
               separate accounts, after giving effect to any letter agreements
               between Agent and the individual Lenders) under the Loan
               Documents until paid in full,

                         D. fourth, to pay any fees then due to any or all of
                            ------
               the Lenders (after giving effect to any letter agreements between
               Agent and individual Lenders) under the Loan Documents, on a
               ratable basis, until paid in full,

                         E. fifth, to pay interest due in respect of all Agent
                            -----
               Advances, until paid in full,

                         F. sixth, ratably to pay interest due in respect of the
                            -----
               Advances (other than Agent Advances) and the Swing Loans until
               paid in full,

                         G. seventh, to pay the principal of all Agent Advances
                            -------
               until paid in full,

                         H. eighth, to pay the principal of all Swing Loans
                            ------
               until paid in full,

               and is continuing, and at Agent's election (which election Agent
               agrees will not be made if an Overadvance would be created
               thereby), to pay amounts then due and owing by Administrative
               Borrower or its Subsidiaries in respect of Bank Products, until
               paid in full,

               paid in full,

               continuing, ratably (i) to pay the principal of all Advances
               until paid in full, and (ii) to Agent, to be held by Agent, for
               the benefit of Wells Fargo or its Affiliates, as applicable, as

               Products Reserve established prior to the occurrence of, and not
               in contemplation of, the subject Event of Default until
               Administrative Borrower's and its Subsidiaries' obligations in
               respect of the then extant Bank Products have been paid in full
               or the cash collateral amount has been exhausted,

                            ----------
               Bank Product Obligations) until paid in full, and

                         N. fourteenth, to Borrowers (to be wired to the
                            ----------
               Designated Account) or such other Person entitled thereto under
               applicable law.

                    (ii) Agent promptly shall distribute to each Lender,
     pursuant to the applicable wire instructions received from each Lender in
     writing, such funds as it may be entitled to receive, subject to a
     Settlement delay as provided in Section 2.2.
                                     -----------

                    (iii) In each instance, so long as no Event of Default has
     occurred and is continuing, Section 2.3(b) shall not be deemed to apply to
                                 --------------
     any payment by Borrowers specified by Borrowers to be for the payment of
     specific Obligations then due and payable (or prepayable) under any
     provision of this Agreement.

                    (iv) For purposes of the foregoing, "paid in full" means
     payment of all amounts owing under the Loan Documents according to the
     terms thereof, including loan fees, service fees, professional fees,
     interest (and specifically including interest accrued after the
     commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding), default interest, interest on
     interest, and expense reimbursements, whether or not the same would be or
     is allowed or disallowed in whole or in part in any Insolvency Proceeding.

                    (v) In the event of a direct conflict between the priority
     provisions of this Section 2.3 and other provisions contained in any other
                        -----------
     Loan Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such priority
     provisions in such documents shall be read together and construed, to the
     fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other. In the event of
     any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid,
     the terms and provisions of this Section 2.3 shall control and govern.
                                      -----------

          2.4 Overadvances. If, at any time or for any reason, the amount of
              ------------
Obligations (other than Bank Product Obligations) owed by Borrowers to the
Lender Group pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.11 is greater than either the Dollar
                         ---------------------
or percentage limitations set forth in Sections 2.1 or 2.11, (an "Overadvance"),
                                       --------------------       -----------
Borrowers immediately shall pay to Agent, in cash, the amount of such excess,
which amount shall be used by Agent to reduce the Obligations in accordance with
the priorities set forth in Section 2.3(b). In addition, Borrowers hereby
                            --------------
promise to pay the Obligations (including principal, interest, fees, costs, and
expenses) in Dollars in full to the Lender Group as and when due and payable
under the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

          2.5 Interest Rates and Letter of Credit Fee: Rates, Payments, and
              -------------------------------------------------------------
Calculations.
------------

               (a) Interest Rates. Except as provided in clause (c) below, all
Obligations (except for undrawn Letters of Credit and except for Bank Product
Obligations) that have been charged to the Loan Account pursuant to the terms
hereof shall bear interest on the Daily Balance thereof as follows (i) if the
relevant Obligation is an Advance that is a LIBOR

                                      -37-

<PAGE>

Rate Loan, at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR Rate plus the LIBOR Rate
Margin and (ii) otherwise, at a per annum rate equal to the Base Rate plus the
Base Rate Margin.

          The foregoing notwithstanding, at no time shall any portion of the
Obligations (other than Bank Product Obligations) bear interest on the Daily
Balance thereof at a per annum rate less than 4.75%. To the extent that interest
accrued hereunder at the rate set forth herein would be less than the foregoing
minimum daily rate, the interest rate chargeable hereunder for such day
automatically shall be deemed increased to the minimum rate.

               (b) Letter of Credit Fee. Borrowers shall pay Agent (for the
ratable benefit of the Lenders, subject to any letter agreement between Agent
and individual Lenders), a Letter of Credit fee (in addition to the charges,
commissions, fees, and costs set forth in Section 2.11(e)) which shall accrue at
                                          ---------------
a rate equal to 2% per annum times the Daily Balance of the undrawn amount of
all outstanding Letters of Credit.

               (c) Default Rate. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation
of an Event of Default (and at the election of Agent or the Required Lenders),

                    (i) all Obligations (except for undrawn Letters of Credit
     and except for Bank Product Obligations) that have been charged to the Loan
     Account pursuant to the terms hereof shall bear interest on the Daily
     Balance thereof at a per annum rate equal to 3 percentage points above the
     per annum rate otherwise applicable hereunder, and

                    (ii) the Letter of Credit fee provided for above shall be
     increased to 3 percentage points above the per annum rate otherwise
     applicable hereunder.

               (d) Payment. Interest, Letter of Credit fees, and all other fees
payable hereunder shall be due and payable, in arrears, on the first day of each
month at any time that Obligations or Commitments are outstanding. Borrowers
hereby authorize Agent, from time to time, without prior notice to Borrowers, to
charge such interest and fees, all Lender Group Expenses (as and when incurred),
the charges, commissions, fees, and costs provided for in Section 2.11(e) (as
                                                          ---------------
and when accrued or incurred), the fees and costs provided for in Section 2.10
                                                                  ------------
(as and when accrued or incurred), and all other payments as and when due and
payable under any Loan Document (including any amounts due and payable to Wells
Fargo or its Affiliates in respect of Bank Products up to the amount of the then
extant Bank Products Reserve) to Borrowers' Loan Account, which amounts
thereafter shall constitute Advances hereunder and shall accrue interest at the
rate then applicable to Advances hereunder. Any interest not paid when due shall
be compounded by being charged to Borrowers' Loan Account and shall thereafter
constitute Advances hereunder and shall accrue interest at the rate then
applicable to Advances that are Base Rate Loans hereunder.

               (e) Computation. All interest and fees chargeable under the Loan
Documents shall be computed on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number
of days elapsed. In the event the Base Rate is changed from time to time
hereafter, the rates of interest

                                      -38-

<PAGE>

hereunder based upon the Base Rate automatically and immediately shall be
increased or decreased by an amount equal to such change in the Base Rate.

               (f) Intent to Limit Charges to Maximum Lawful Rate. In no event
shall the interest rate or rates payable under this Agreement, plus any other
amounts paid in connection herewith, exceed the highest rate permissible under
any law that a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination,
deem applicable. Borrowers and the Lender Group, in executing and delivering
this Agreement, intend legally to agree upon the rate or rates of interest and
manner of payment stated within it; provided, however, that, anything contained
                                    --------  -------
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if said rate or rates of interest or
manner of payment exceeds the maximum allowable under applicable law, then, ipso
facto, as of the date of this Agreement, Borrowers are and shall be liable only
for the payment of such maximum as allowed by law, and payment received from
Borrowers in excess of such legal maximum, whenever received, shall be applied
to reduce the principal balance of the Obligations to the extent of such excess.

          2.6 Cash Management.
              ---------------

               (a) On or before the time required by Section 3.2(c), Borrowers
shall (i) establish and maintain cash management services of a type and on terms
reasonably satisfactory to Agent at one or more of the banks set forth on
Schedule 2.6(a) (each a "Cash Management Bank"), and shall request in writing
---------------          --------------------
and otherwise take such reasonable steps to ensure that all of its Account
Debtors forward payment of the amounts owed by them directly to such Cash
Management Bank, and (ii) deposit or cause to be deposited promptly, and in any
event no later than the first Business Day after the date of receipt thereof,
all Collections (including, without limitation, (A) those sent directly by
Account Debtors to a Cash Management Bank, (B) the proceeds of any sale or other
disposition of the assets or Stock of VHC, Scientific Exchange, Promotech,
Imedex or the Foreign Subsidiaries, (C) the proceeds of any disposition of the
equity of RxCentric.com, Inc., and (D) funds released from that certain deposit
account described in clause (n) of the definition of Permitted Liens) into a
bank account in Agent's name (a "Cash Management Account") at one of the Cash
Management Banks.

               (b) Each Cash Management Bank shall establish and maintain Cash
Management Agreements with Agent and Borrowers, in form and substance acceptable
to Agent. Each such Cash Management Agreement shall provide, among other things,
that (i) all items of payment deposited in such Cash Management Account and
proceeds thereof are held by such Cash Management Bank agent or
bailee-in-possession for Agent, (ii) the Cash Management Bank has no rights of
setoff or recoupment or any other claim against the applicable Cash Management
Account, other than for payment of its service fees and other charges directly
related to the administration of such Cash Management Account and for returned
checks or other items of payment, and (iii) it will remit all proceeds received
therein to the Agent's Account at all times after the Agent has provided a
notice (a "Triggering Event Notice") to the applicable Cash Management Bank. The
           -----------------------
Agent may provide a Triggering Event Notice to the applicable Cash Management
Bank if either (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing hereunder,
or (2) Borrowers' Excess Availability plus Unrestricted Cash is less than
$25,000,000 in the aggregate. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Cash Management Agreements, from and after the receipt by a Cash
Management Bank of a Triggering Event

                                      -39-

<PAGE>

Notice, all amounts received in the applicable Cash Management Account, shall be
wired each Business Day into the Agent's Account.

               (c) So long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Administrative Borrower may amend Schedule 2.6(a) to add or replace
                                              ---------------
a Cash Management Account Bank or Cash Management Account; provided, however,
                                                           --------  -------
that (i) such prospective Cash Management Bank shall be reasonably satisfactory
to Agent and Agent shall have consented in writing in advance to the opening of
such Cash Management Account with the prospective Cash Management Bank, and (ii)
prior to the time of the opening of such Cash Management Account, Borrowers and
such prospective Cash Management Bank shall have executed and delivered to Agent
a Cash Management Agreement. Borrowers shall close any of their Cash Management
Accounts (and establish replacement cash management accounts in accordance with
the foregoing sentence) promptly and in any event within 30 days of notice from
Agent that the creditworthiness of any Cash Management Bank is no longer
acceptable in Agent's reasonable judgment, or as promptly as practicable and in
any event within 60 days of notice from Agent that the operating performance,
funds transfer, or availability procedures or performance of the Cash Management
Bank with respect to Cash Management Accounts or Agent's liability under any
Cash Management Agreement with such Cash Management Bank is no longer acceptable
in Agent's reasonable judgment.

               (d) The Cash Management Accounts shall be cash collateral
accounts, with all cash, checks and similar items of payment in such accounts
securing payment of the Obligations, and in which Borrowers are hereby deemed to
have granted a Lien to Agent.

          2.7 Crediting Payments; Float Charge. The receipt of any payment item
              --------------------------------
by Agent (whether from transfers to Agent by the Cash Management Banks pursuant
to the Cash Management Agreements or otherwise) shall not be considered a
payment on account unless such payment item is a wire transfer of immediately
available federal funds made to the Agent's Account or unless and until such
payment item is honored when presented for payment. Should any payment item not
be honored when presented for payment, then Borrowers shall be deemed not to
have made such payment and interest shall be calculated accordingly. Anything to
the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, any payment item shall be deemed
received by Agent only if it is received into the Agent's Account on a Business
Day on or before 11:00 a.m. (California time). If any payment item is received
into the Agent's Account on a non-Business Day or after 11:00 a.m. (California
time) on a Business Day, it shall be deemed to have been received by Agent as of
the opening of business on the immediately following Business Day. From and
after the Closing Date, Agent shall be entitled to charge Borrowers for 1
Business Day of 'clearance' or 'float' at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans
under Section 2.5 on all Collections that are received by Borrowers (regardless
      -----------
of whether forwarded by the Cash Management Banks to Agent). This
across-the-board 1 Business Day clearance or float charge on all Collections is
acknowledged by the parties to constitute an integral aspect of the pricing of
the financing of Borrowers and shall apply irrespective of whether or not there
are any outstanding monetary Obligations; the effect of such clearance or float
charge being the equivalent of charging 1 Business Day of interest on such
Collections. The parties acknowledge and agree that the economic benefit of the
foregoing provisions of this Section 2.7 shall be for the exclusive benefit of
                             -----------
Agent.

                                      -40-

          2.8 Designated Account. Agent is authorized to make the Advances, and
              ------------------
Issuing Lender is authorized to issue the Letters of Credit, under this
Agreement based upon telephonic or other instructions received from anyone
purporting to be an Authorized Person, or without instructions if pursuant to
Section 2.5(d). Administrative Borrower agrees to establish and maintain the
--------------
Designated Account with the Designated Account Bank for the purpose of receiving
the proceeds of the Advances requested by Borrowers and made by Agent or the
Lenders hereunder. Unless otherwise agreed by Agent and Administrative Borrower,
any Advance, Agent Advance, or Swing Loan requested by Borrowers and made by
Agent or the Lenders hereunder shall be made to the Designated Account.

          2.9 Maintenance of Loan Account; Statements of Obligations. Agent
              ------------------------------------------------------
shall maintain an account on its books in the name of Borrowers (the "Loan
                                                                      ----
Account") on which Borrowers will be charged with all Advances (including Agent
-------
Advances and Swing Loans) made by Agent, Swing Lender, or the Lenders to
Borrowers or for Borrowers' account, the Letters of Credit issued by Issuing
Lender for Borrowers' account, and with all other payment Obligations hereunder
or under the other Loan Documents (except for Bank Product Obligations),
including, accrued interest, fees and expenses, and Lender Group Expenses. In
accordance with Section 2.7, the Loan Account will be credited with all payments
                -----------
received by Agent from Borrowers or for Borrowers' account, including all
amounts received in the Agent's Account from any Cash Management Bank. Agent
shall render statements regarding the Loan Account to Administrative Borrower,
including principal, interest, fees, and including an itemization of all charges
and expenses constituting Lender Group Expenses owing, and such statements shall
be conclusively presumed to be correct and accurate absent manifest error and
constitute an account stated between Borrowers and the Lender Group unless,
within 30 days after receipt thereof by Administrative Borrower, Administrative
Borrower shall deliver to Agent written objection thereto describing the error
or errors contained in any such statements.

          2.10 Fees. Borrowers shall pay to Agent the following fees and
               ----
charges, which fees and charges shall be non-refundable when paid (irrespective
of whether this Agreement is terminated thereafter) and shall be apportioned
among the Lenders in accordance with the terms of letter agreements between
Agent and individual Lenders:

               (a) Unused Line Fee. On the first day of each month during the
term of this Agreement, an unused line fee in the amount equal to 0.375% per
annum times the result of (1) prior to the date that Agent approves the initial

the Billed Subline, less (b) the sum of (i) the average Daily Balance of
Advances made under the Billed Subline that were outstanding during the
immediately preceding month, plus (ii) the average Daily Balance of the Letter
of Credit Usage during the immediately preceding month, and (2) from and after
the date that there are one or more Lenders, in addition to Foothill, that have
aggregate commitments of $20,000,000 or more under this Agreement, (a) the
Maximum Revolver Amount, less (b) the sum of (c) the average Daily Balance of
Advances that were outstanding during the immediately preceding month, plus (d)
the average Daily Balance of the Letter of Credit Usage during the immediately
preceding month,

               (b) Fee Letter Fees. As and when due and payable under the terms
of the Fee Letter, Borrowers shall pay to Agent the fees set forth in the Fee
Letter, and

                                      -41-

<PAGE>

               (c) Audit, Appraisal, and Valuation Charges. For the separate
account of Agent, audit, appraisal, and valuation fees and charges as follows,

implemented, a one time charge of $3,000 plus out-of-pocket expenses for
expenses for the establishment of electronic collateral reporting systems, and
(iii) the actual charges paid or incurred by Agent if it elects to employ the
services of one or more third Persons to perform financial audits of Borrowers,
to appraise the Collateral, or any portion thereof, or to assess a Borrower's
business valuation; provided, that so long as no Event of Default has occurred
                    --------
and is continuing, Borrowers shall only be obligated to pay for fees and charges
incurred for financial audits performed no more frequently than four (4) times
per calendar year.

          2.11 Letters of Credit.
               -----------------

               (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Issuing Lender agrees to issue letters of credit for the account of Borrowers
(each, an "L/C") or to purchase participations or execute indemnities or
           ---
reimbursement obligations (each such undertaking, an "L/C Undertaking") with
                                                      ---------------
respect to letters of credit issued by an Underlying Issuer (as of the Closing
Date, the prospective Underlying Issuer is to be Wells Fargo) for the account of
Borrowers. To request the issuance of an L/C or an L/C Undertaking (or the
amendment, renewal, or extension of an outstanding L/C or L/C Undertaking),
Administrative Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by
electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the
Issuing Lender) to the Issuing Lender and Agent (reasonably in advance of the
requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension) a notice
requesting the issuance of an L/C or L/C Undertaking, or identifying the L/C or
L/C Undertaking to be amended, renewed, or extended, the date of issuance,
amendment, renewal, or extension, the date on which such L/C or L/C Undertaking
is to expire, the amount of such L/C or L/C Undertaking, the name and address of
the beneficiary thereof (or of the Underlying Letter of Credit, as applicable),
and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew, or
extend such L/C or L/C Undertaking. If requested by the Issuing Lender,
Borrowers also shall be an applicant under the application with respect to any
Underlying Letter of Credit that is to be the subject of an L/C Undertaking. The
Issuing Lender shall have no obligation to issue an L/C if any of the following
would result after giving effect to the requested L/C:

                    (i) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Borrowing
     Base less the amount of outstanding Advances, or

                    (ii) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed $5,000,000, or

                    (iii) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Maximum
     Revolver Amount less the then extant amount of outstanding Advances, or

                    (iv) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Billed
     Subline less the then extant amount of outstanding Advances made under the
     Billed Subline, or

                                      -42-

<PAGE>

                    (v) the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the difference
     between (A) EBITDA for the most recent twelve month period times 2 and (B)
     the then extant amount of outstanding Advances.

          Borrowers and the Lender Group acknowledge and agree that certain
Underlying Letters of Credit may be issued to support letters of credit that
already are outstanding as of the Closing Date. Each Letter of Credit (and
corresponding Underlying Letter of Credit) shall be in form and substance
acceptable to the applicable Borrower and the Issuing Lender (in the exercise of
its Permitted Discretion), including the requirement that the amounts payable
thereunder must be payable in Dollars. If Issuing Lender is obligated to advance
funds under an L/C, Borrowers immediately shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement
to Issuing Lender by paying to Agent an amount equal to such L/C Disbursement
not later than 11:00 a.m., California time, on the date that such L/C
Disbursement is made, if Administrative Borrower shall have received written or
telephonic notice of such L/C Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., California time,
on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by Administrative
Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 11:00 a.m.,
California time, on (i) the Business Day that Administrative Borrower receives
such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., California time, on
the date of receipt, and, in the absence of such reimbursement, the L/C
Disbursement immediately and automatically shall be deemed to be an Advance
hereunder and, thereafter, shall bear interest at the rate then applicable to
Advances that are Base Rate Loans under Section 2.5. To the extent an L/C
                                        -----------
Disbursement is deemed to be an Advance hereunder, Borrowers' obligation to
reimburse such L/C Disbursement shall be discharged and replaced by the
resulting Advance. Subject to the applicable standards of liability set forth in
this Agreement, any reimbursement payments made by a Borrower with respect to a
Letter of Credit Disbursement (including by way of an Advance) shall be without
prejudice to, and shall not constitute a waiver of, any right any Borrower may
have or might acquire as a result of any payment by the Issuing Bank or the
Underlying Issuer under or with respect to a Letter of Credit, the reimbursement
thereof by such Borrower or any action taken or omitted to be taken by such
Issuing Bank or Underlying Issuer under or in connection with a Letter of
Credit. Promptly following receipt by Agent of any payment from Borrowers
pursuant to this paragraph, Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing
Lender or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to Section
                                                                     -------
2.11(c) to reimburse the Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders and the Issuing
-------
Lender as their interest may appear.

               (b) Promptly following receipt of a notice of L/C Disbursement
pursuant to Section 2.11(a), each Lender agrees to fund its Pro Rata Share of
            ---------------
any Advance deemed made pursuant to the foregoing subsection on the same terms
and conditions as if Borrowers had requested such Advance and Agent shall
promptly pay to Issuing Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders.
By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit
increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the
Issuing Lender or the Lenders, the Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have
granted to each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, a
participation in each Letter of Credit, in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share
of the Risk Participation Liability of such Letter of Credit, and each such
Lender agrees to pay to Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of any payments made by the Issuing Lender under such
Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each
Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to Agent, for the
account of the Issuing Lender,

                                      -43-

<PAGE>

such Lender's Pro Rata Share of each L/C Disbursement made by the Issuing Lender
and not reimbursed by Borrowers on the date due as provided in clause (a) of
this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to
Borrowers for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its
obligation to deliver to Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, an amount
equal to its respective Pro Rata Share pursuant to this Section 2.11(b) shall be
                                                        ---------------
absolute and unconditional and such remittance shall be made notwithstanding the
occurrence or continuation of an Event of Default or Default or the failure to
satisfy any condition set forth in Section 3 hereof. If any such Lender fails to
                                   ---------
make available to Agent the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any
payments made by the Issuing Lender in respect of such Letter of Credit as
provided in this Section, Agent (for the account of the Issuing Lender) shall be
entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with
interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate until paid in full.

               (c) Each Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify, save, defend, and
hold the Lender Group harmless from any loss, cost, expense, or liability, and
reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Lender Group arising out of or in
connection with any L/C; provided, however, that no Borrower shall be obligated
                         --------  -------
hereunder to indemnify for any loss, cost, expense, or liability that is caused
by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender or any other
member of the Lender Group. Each Borrower agrees to be bound by the Underlying
Issuer's regulations and interpretations of any Underlying Letter of Credit or
by Issuing Lender's interpretations of any L/C issued by Issuing Lender to or
for such Borrower's account, even though this interpretation may be different
from such Borrower's own, and each Borrower understands and agrees that the
Lender Group shall not be liable for any error, negligence, or mistake, whether
of omission or commission, in following Borrowers' instructions or those
contained in the Letter of Credit or any modifications, amendments, or
supplements thereto. Each Borrower understands that the L/C Undertakings may
require Issuing Lender to indemnify the Underlying Issuer for certain costs or
liabilities arising out of claims by Borrowers against such Underlying Issuer.
Each Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify, save, defend, and hold the Lender
Group harmless with respect to any loss, cost, expense (including reasonable
attorneys fees), or liability incurred by the Lender Group under any L/C
Undertaking as a result of the Lender Group's indemnification of any Underlying
Issuer; provided, however, that no Borrower shall be obligated hereunder to
        --------  -------
indemnify for any loss, cost, expense, or liability that is caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender or any other member of
the Lender Group or the Underlying Issuer.

               (d) Each Borrower hereby authorizes and directs any Underlying
Issuer to deliver to the Issuing Lender all instruments, documents, and other
writings and property received by such Underlying Issuer pursuant to such
Underlying Letter of Credit and to accept and rely upon the Issuing Lender's
instructions with respect to all matters arising in connection with such
Underlying Letter of Credit and the related application.

               (e) Any and all charges, commissions, fees, and costs incurred by
the Issuing Lender relating to Underlying Letters of Credit shall be Lender
Group Expenses for purposes of this Agreement and immediately shall be
reimbursable by Borrowers to Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender; it
being acknowledged and agreed by each Borrower that, as of the Closing Date, the
issuance charge imposed by the prospective Underlying Issuer is .825% per annum
times the face amount of each Underlying Letter of Credit, that such issuance
charge

                                      -44-

<PAGE>

may be changed from time to time, and that the Underlying Issuer also imposes a
schedule of charges for amendments, extensions, drawings, and renewals.

               (f) If by reason of (i) any change in any applicable law, treaty,
rule, or regulation or any change in the interpretation or application thereof
by any Governmental Authority, or (ii) compliance by the Underlying Issuer or
the Lender Group with any direction, request, or requirement (irrespective of
whether having the force of law) of any Governmental Authority or monetary
authority including, Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Board as from time to
time in effect (and any successor thereto):

                    (i) any reserve, deposit, or similar requirement is or shall
     be imposed or modified in respect of any Letter of Credit issued hereunder,
     or

                    (ii) there shall be imposed on the Underlying Issuer or the
     Lender Group any other condition regarding any Underlying Letter of Credit
     or any Letter of Credit issued pursuant hereto;

and the result of the foregoing is to increase, directly or indirectly, the cost
to the Lender Group of issuing, making, guaranteeing, or maintaining any Letter
of Credit or to reduce the amount receivable in respect thereof by the Lender
Group, then, and in any such case, Agent may, at any time within a reasonable
period after the additional cost is incurred or the amount received is reduced,
notify Administrative Borrower, and Borrowers shall pay on demand such amounts
as Agent may specify to be necessary to compensate the Lender Group for such
additional cost or reduced receipt, together with interest on such amount from
the day after such demand until payment in full thereof at the rate then
applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder. The determination by Agent of any
amount due pursuant to this Section, as set forth in a certificate setting forth
the calculation thereof in reasonable detail, shall, in the absence of manifest
or demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all of the parties
hereto.

          2.12 LIBOR Option.
               ------------

               (a) Interest and Interest Payment Dates. In lieu of having
interest charged at the rate based upon the Base Rate, Borrowers shall have the
option (the "LIBOR Option") to have interest on all or a portion of the Advances
             ------------
be charged at a rate of interest based upon the LIBOR Rate. Interest on LIBOR
Rate Loans shall be payable on the earliest of (i) the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default in
consequence of which the Required Lenders or Agent on behalf thereof elect to
accelerate the maturity of all or any portion of the Obligations, or (iii)
termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof. On the last day of
each applicable Interest Period, unless Administrative Borrower properly has
exercised the LIBOR Option with respect thereto, the interest rate applicable to
such LIBOR Rate Loan automatically shall convert to the rate of interest then
applicable to Base Rate Loans of the same type hereunder. At any time that an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrowers no longer shall have
the option to request that Advances bear interest at the LIBOR Rate and Agent
shall have the right to convert the interest rate on all outstanding LIBOR Rate
Loans to the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder

                                      -45-

<PAGE>

               (b) LIBOR Election.

                    (i) Administrative Borrower may, at any time and from time
     to time, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
     elect to exercise the LIBOR Option by notifying Agent prior to 11:00 a.m.
     (California time) at least 3 Business Days prior to the commencement of the
     proposed Interest Period (the "LIBOR Deadline"). Notice of Administrative
                                    --------------
     Borrower's election of the LIBOR Option for a permitted portion of the
     Advances and an Interest Period pursuant to this Section shall be made by
     delivery to Agent of a LIBOR Notice received by Agent before the LIBOR
     Deadline, or by telephonic notice received by Agent before the LIBOR
     Deadline (to be confirmed by delivery to Agent of a LIBOR Notice received
     by Agent prior to 5:00 p.m. (California time) on the same day. Promptly
     upon its receipt of each such LIBOR Notice, Agent shall provide a copy
     thereof to each of the Lenders.

                    (ii) Each LIBOR Notice shall be irrevocable and binding on
     Borrowers. In connection with each LIBOR Rate Loan, each Borrower shall
     indemnify, defend, and hold Agent and the Lenders harmless against any
     loss, cost, or expense incurred by Agent or any Lender as a result of (a)
     the payment of any principal of any LIBOR Rate Loan other than on the last
     day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an
     Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loan other than on
     the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or (c) the failure
     to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any LIBOR Rate Loan on the date
     specified in any LIBOR Notice delivered pursuant hereto (such losses,
     costs, and expenses, collectively, "Funding Losses"). Funding Losses shall,
                                         --------------
     with respect to Agent or any Lender, be deemed to equal the amount
     determined by Agent or such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the
     amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such
     LIBOR Rate Loan had such event not occurred, at the LIBOR Rate that would
     have been applicable thereto, for the period from the date of such event to
     the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case
     of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have
     been the Interest Period therefor), minus (ii) the amount of interest that
     would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate
     which Agent or such Lender would be offered were it to be offered, at the
     commencement of such period, Dollar deposits of a comparable amount and
     period in the London interbank market. A certificate of Agent or a Lender
     delivered to Administrative Borrower setting forth any amount or amounts
     that Agent or such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section
     shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                    (iii) Borrowers shall have not more than 5 LIBOR Rate Loans
     in effect at any given time. Borrowers only may exercise the LIBOR Option
     for LIBOR Rate Loans of at least $1,000,000 and integral multiples of
     $500,000 in excess thereof.

               (c) Prepayments. Borrowers may prepay LIBOR Rate Loans at any
time, without premium or penalty except as otherwise provided in this Section
                                                                      -------
2.12 and Section 3.6; provided, however, that in the event that LIBOR Rate Loans
----     -----------  --------  -------
are prepaid on any date that is not the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, including as a result of any automatic prepayment through
the required application by Agent of proceeds of Collections in accordance with
Section 2.3(b) or for any other reason, including early termination of the term

Agreement or acceleration of all or any portion of the Obligations pursuant to
the terms hereof, each Borrower shall indemnify, defend, and hold Agent and the
Lenders and their Participants harmless against any and all Funding Losses in
accordance with clause (b) above.

               (d) Special Provisions Applicable to LIBOR Rate.

                    (i) The LIBOR Rate may be adjusted by Agent with respect to
     any Lender on a prospective basis to take into account any additional or
     increased costs to such Lender of maintaining or obtaining any eurodollar
     deposits or increased costs due to changes in applicable law occurring
     subsequent to the commencement of the then applicable Interest Period,
     including changes in tax laws (except changes of general applicability in
     corporate income tax laws) and changes in the reserve requirements imposed
     by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor),
     excluding the Reserve Percentage, which additional or increased costs would
     increase the cost of funding loans bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate. In
     any such event, the affected Lender shall give Administrative Borrower and
     Agent notice of such a determination and adjustment and Agent promptly
     shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and, upon its receipt of the
     notice from the affected Lender, Administrative Borrower may, by notice to
     such affected Lender (y) require such Lender to furnish to Administrative
     Borrower a statement setting forth the basis for adjusting such LIBOR Rate
     and the method for determining the amount of such adjustment, or (z) repay
     the LIBOR Rate Loans with respect to which such adjustment is made
     (together with any amounts due under clause (b)(ii) above).

                    (ii) In the event that any change in market conditions or
     any law, regulation, treaty, or directive, or any change therein or in the
     interpretation of application thereof, shall at any time after the date
     hereof, in the reasonable opinion of any Lender, make it unlawful or
     impractical for such Lender to fund or maintain LIBOR Advances or to
     continue such funding or maintaining, or to determine or charge interest
     rates at the LIBOR Rate, such Lender shall give notice of such changed
     circumstances to Agent and Administrative Borrower and Agent promptly shall
     transmit the notice to each other Lender and (y) in the case of any LIBOR
     Rate Loans of such Lender that are outstanding, the date specified in such
     Lender's notice shall be deemed to be the last day of the Interest Period
     of such LIBOR Rate Loans, and interest upon the LIBOR Rate Loans of such
     Lender thereafter shall accrue interest at the rate then applicable to Base
     Rate Loans, and (z) Borrowers shall not be entitled to elect the LIBOR
     Option until such Lender determines that it would no longer be unlawful or
     impractical to do so.

               (e) No Requirement of Matched Funding. Anything to the contrary
contained herein notwithstanding, neither Agent, nor any Lender, nor any of
their Participants, is required actually to acquire eurodollar deposits to fund
or otherwise match fund any Obligation as to which interest accrues at the LIBOR
Rate. The provisions of this Section shall apply as if each Lender or its
Participants had match funded any Obligation as to which interest is accruing at
the LIBOR Rate by acquiring eurodollar deposits for each Interest Period in the
amount of the LIBOR Rate Loans.

          2.13 Capital Requirements. If, after the date hereof, any Lender
               --------------------
determines that (i) the adoption of or change in any law, rule, regulation or
guideline regarding capital requirements for banks or bank holding companies, or
any change in the interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental
Authority charged with the administration thereof, or (ii) compliance by such
Lender or its parent bank holding company with any guideline, request or
directive of any such entity regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having
the force of law), the effect of reducing the return on such Lender's or such
holding company's capital as a consequence of such Lender's Commitments
hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such holding company could
have achieved but for such adoption, change, or compliance (taking into
consideration such Lender's or such holding company's then existing policies
with respect to capital adequacy and assuming the full utilization of such
entity's capital) by any amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then such
Lender may notify Administrative Borrower and Agent thereof. Following receipt
of such notice, Borrowers agree to pay such Lender on demand the amount of such
reduction of return of capital as and when such reduction is determined, payable
within 90 days after presentation by such Lender of a statement in the amount
and setting forth in reasonable detail such Lender's calculation thereof and the
assumptions upon which such calculation was based (which statement shall be
deemed true and correct absent manifest error). In determining such amount, such
Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

          2.14 Joint and Several Liability of Borrowers.
               ----------------------------------------

               (a) Each of Borrowers is accepting joint and several liability
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in consideration of the financial
accommodations to be provided by the Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement,
for the mutual benefit, directly and indirectly, of each of Borrowers and in
consideration of the undertakings of the other Borrowers to accept joint and
several liability for the Obligations.

               (b) Each of Borrowers, jointly and severally, hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor,
joint and several liability with the other Borrowers, with respect to the
payment and performance of all of the Obligations (including, without
limitation, any Obligations arising under this Section 2.14), it being the
                                               ------------
intention of the parties hereto that all the Obligations shall be the joint and
several obligations of each Person composing Borrowers without preferences or
distinction among them.

               (c) If and to the extent that any of Borrowers shall fail to make
any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as and when due or to perform
any of the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such
event the other Persons composing Borrowers will make such payment with respect
to, or perform, such Obligation.

               (d) The Obligations of each Person composing Borrowers under the
provisions of this Section 2.14 constitute the absolute and unconditional, full
                   ------------
recourse Obligations of each Person composing Borrowers enforceable against each
such Borrower to the full extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of
the validity, regularity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other
circumstances whatsoever.

<PAGE>

               (e) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
each Person composing Borrowers hereby waives notice of acceptance of its joint
and several liability, notice of any Advances or Letters of Credit issued under
or pursuant to this Agreement, notice of the occurrence of any Default, Event of
Default, or of any demand for any payment under this Agreement, notice of any
action at any time taken or omitted by Agent or Lenders under or in respect of
any of the Obligations, any requirement of diligence or to mitigate damages and,
generally, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all demands, notices and
other formalities of every kind in connection with this Agreement (except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement). Each Person composing Borrowers hereby
assents to, and waives notice of, any extension or postponement of the time for
the payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any payment of any of
the Obligations, the acceptance of any partial payment thereon, any waiver,
consent or other action or acquiescence by Agent or Lenders at any time or times
in respect of any default by any Person composing Borrowers in the performance
or satisfaction of any term, covenant, condition or provision of this Agreement,
any and all other indulgences whatsoever by Agent or Lenders in respect of any
of the Obligations, and the taking, addition, substitution or release, in whole
or in part, at any time or times, of any security for any of the Obligations or
the addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, of any Person
composing Borrowers. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
Borrowers assents to any other action or delay in acting or failure to act on
the part of any Agent or Lender with respect to the failure by any Person
composing Borrowers to comply with any of its respective Obligations, including,
without limitation, any failure strictly or diligently to assert any right or to
pursue any remedy or to comply fully with applicable laws or regulations
thereunder, which might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.14 afford
                                                        ------------
grounds for terminating, discharging or relieving any Person composing
Borrowers, in whole or in part, from any of its Obligations under this Section
                                                                       -------
2.14, it being the intention of each Person composing Borrowers that, so long as
----
any of the Obligations hereunder remain unsatisfied, the Obligations of such
Person composing Borrowers under this Section 2.14 shall not be discharged
                                      ------------
except by performance and then only to the extent of such performance. The
Obligations of each Person composing Borrowers under this Section 2.14 shall not
                                                          ------------
be diminished or rendered unenforceable by any winding up, reorganization,
arrangement, liquidation, reconstruction or similar proceeding with respect to
any Person composing Borrowers or any Agent or Lender. The joint and several
liability of the Persons composing Borrowers hereunder shall continue in full
force and effect notwithstanding any absorption, merger, amalgamation or any
other change whatsoever in the name, constitution or place of formation of any
of the Persons composing Borrowers or any Agent or Lender.

               (f) Each Person composing Borrowers represents and warrants to
Agent and Lenders that such Borrower is currently informed of the financial
condition of Borrowers and of all other circumstances which a diligent inquiry
would reveal and which bear upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations. Each
Person composing Borrowers further represents and warrants to Agent and Lenders
that such Borrower has read and understands the terms and conditions of the Loan
Documents. Each Person composing Borrowers hereby covenants that such Borrower
will continue to keep informed of Borrowers' financial condition, the financial
condition of other guarantors, if any, and of all other circumstances which bear
upon the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance of the Obligations.

               (g) The provisions of this Section 2.14 are made for the benefit
                                          ------------
of the Agent, the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, and may
be enforced by it or

                                      -49-

<PAGE>

them from time to time against any or all of the Persons composing Borrowers as
often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of any
such Agent, Lender, successor or assign first to marshal any of its or their
claims or to exercise any of its or their rights against any of the other
Persons composing Borrowers or to exhaust any remedies available to it or them
against any of the other Persons composing Borrowers or to resort to any other
source or means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations hereunder or to
elect any other remedy. The provisions of this Section 2.14 shall remain in
                                               ------------
effect until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full or otherwise
fully satisfied. If at any time, any payment, or any part thereof, made in
respect of any of the Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or
returned by any Agent or Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of any of the Persons composing Borrowers, or otherwise, the
provisions of this Section 2.14 will forthwith be reinstated in effect, as
                   ------------
though such payment had not been made.

               (h) Each of the Persons composing Borrowers hereby agrees that it
will not enforce any of its rights of contribution or subrogation against the
other Persons composing Borrowers with respect to any liability incurred by it
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, any payments made by it to
the Agent or the Lenders with respect to any of the Obligations or any
collateral security therefor until such time as all of the Obligations have been
paid in full in cash. Any claim which any Borrower may have against any other
Borrower with respect to any payments to any Agent or Lender hereunder or under
any other Loan Documents are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in
right of payment, without limitation as to any increases in the Obligations
arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full in cash of the
Obligations and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership,
liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding under the laws of any
jurisdiction relating to any Borrower, its debts or its assets, whether
voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in full in cash
before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities
or other property, shall be made to any other Borrower therefor.

               (i) Each of the Persons composing Borrowers hereby agrees that,
after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Default or Event of
Default, the payment of any amounts due with respect to the indebtedness owing
by any Borrower to any other Borrower is hereby subordinated to the prior
payment in full in cash of the Obligations. Each Borrower hereby agrees that
after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Default or Event of
Default, such Borrower will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect
any indebtedness of any other Borrower owing to such Borrower until the
Obligations shall have been paid in full in cash. If, notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, such Borrower shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts
in respect of such indebtedness, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and
received by such Borrower as trustee for the Agent, and the Agent shall deliver
any such amounts to the Administrative Agent for application to the Obligations
in accordance with Section 2.3(b).

<PAGE>

Required Availability after giving effect to the Initial Advance and the
extensions of credit to be made on such date.

          3.3 Conditions Precedent to all Extensions of Credit. The obligation
              ------------------------------------------------
of the Lender Group (or any member thereof) to make all Advances (or to extend
any other credit hereunder) shall be subject to the following conditions
precedent:

               (a) the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the date of such extension of credit, as though made on
and as of such date (except to the extent that such representations and
warranties relate solely to an earlier date);

               (b) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing on the date of such extension of credit, nor shall either result from
the making thereof;

               (c) no injunction, writ, restraining order, or other order of any
nature prohibiting, directly or indirectly, the extending of such credit shall
have been issued and remain in force by any Governmental Authority against any
Borrower, Agent, any Lender, or any of their Affiliates;

               (d) no Material Adverse Change shall have occurred; and

               (e) if pursuant to Section 7.19(a)(i) or 7.19(a)(ii) EBITDA and

U.S. EBIT have not been required to be tested for the immediately preceding
month or quarter, as applicable, EBITDA and U.S. EBIT shall be in compliance
with the minimum amounts set forth in such Sections for the immediately
preceding month or quarter, as applicable.

          3.4 Term. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and
              ----
delivery hereof by Borrowers, Agent, and the Lenders and shall continue in full
force and effect for a term ending on March 31, 2005 (the "Maturity Date"). The
                                                           -------------
foregoing notwithstanding, the Lender Group, upon the election of the Required
Lenders, shall have the right to terminate its obligations under this Agreement
immediately and without notice upon the occurrence and during the continuation
of an Event of Default.

          3.5 Effect of Termination. On the date of termination of this
              ---------------------
Agreement, all Obligations (other than contingent reimbursement obligations of
Borrowers with respect to any outstanding L/C or Underlying Letters of Credit,
provided that the Borrowers have provided cash collateral to be held by Agent
for the benefit of the Lenders in an amount equal to 105% of the then extant
Letter of Credit Usage, and other than Bank Products Obligations, provided that
the Borrowers have provided cash collateral to be held by Agent for the benefit
of Wells Fargo or its Affiliates with respect to such Bank Products Obligations)
immediately shall become due and payable without notice or demand. No
termination of this Agreement, however, shall relieve or discharge Borrowers of
their duties, Obligations, or covenants hereunder and the Agent's Liens in the
Collateral shall remain in effect until all Obligations have been fully and
finally discharged and the Lender Group's obligations to provide additional
credit hereunder have been terminated. When this Agreement has been terminated
and all of the Obligations have been fully and finally discharged and the Lender
Group's obligations to provide additional credit under the Loan

                                      -55-

<PAGE>

Documents have been terminated irrevocably, Agent will, at Borrowers' sole
expense, execute and deliver any UCC termination statements, lien releases,
mortgage releases, re-assignments of trademarks, discharges of security
interests, and other similar discharge or release documents (and, if applicable,
in recordable form) as are reasonably necessary to release, as of record, the
Agent's Liens and all notices of security interests and liens previously filed
by Agent with respect to the Obligations.

          3.6 Early Termination by Borrowers. Borrowers have the option, at any
              ------------------------------
time upon 90 days prior written notice by Administrative Borrower to Agent, to
terminate this Agreement by paying to Agent, for the benefit of the Lender
Group, in cash, the Obligations (including (a) either (i) providing cash
collateral to be held by Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in an amount equal
to 105% of the then extant Letter of Credit Usage, or (ii) causing the original
Letters of Credit to be returned to the Issuing Lender, and (b) providing cash
collateral to be held by Agent for the benefit of Wells Fargo or its Affiliates
with respect to the then extant Bank Products Obligations), in full, together
with the Applicable Prepayment Premium (to be allocated based upon letter
agreements between Agent and individual Lenders). If Administrative Borrower has
sent a notice of termination pursuant to the provisions of this Section, then
the Commitments shall terminate and Borrowers shall be obligated to repay the
Obligations (including (a) either (i) providing cash collateral to be held by
Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in an amount equal to 105% of the then
extant Letter of Credit Usage, or (ii) causing the original Letters of Credit to
be returned to the Issuing Lender, and (b) providing cash collateral to be held
by Agent for the benefit of Wells Fargo or its Affiliates with respect to the
then extant Bank Products Obligations), in full, together with the Applicable
Prepayment Premium, on the date set forth as the date of termination of this
Agreement in such notice. In the event of the termination of this Agreement and
repayment of the Obligations at any time prior to the Maturity Date, for any
other reason, including (a) termination upon the election of the Required
Lenders to terminate after the occurrence of an Event of Default, (b)
foreclosure and sale of Collateral, (c) sale of the Collateral in any Insolvency
Proceeding, or (iv) restructure, reorganization or compromise of the Obligations
by the confirmation of a plan of reorganization, or any other plan of
compromise, restructure, or arrangement in any Insolvency Proceeding, then, in
view of the impracticability and extreme difficulty of ascertaining the actual
amount of damages to the Lender Group or profits lost by the Lender Group as a
result of such early termination, and by mutual agreement of the parties as to a
reasonable estimation and calculation of the lost profits or damages of the
Lender Group, Borrowers shall pay the Applicable Prepayment Premium to Agent (to
be allocated based upon letter agreements between Agent and individual Lenders),
measured as of the date of such termination. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Borrowers shall not be obligated to pay any
Applicable Prepayment Premium if this Agreement is terminated as a direct result
of a refinancing by Wells Fargo or any of its Affiliates.

     4.   CREATION OF SECURITY INTEREST.

          4.1 Grant of Security Interest. Each Borrower hereby grants to Agent,
              --------------------------
for the benefit of the Lender Group, a continuing security interest in all of
its right, title, and interest in all currently existing and hereafter acquired
or arising Personal Property Collateral in order to secure prompt repayment of
any and all of the Obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Loan Documents and in order to secure prompt performance by Borrowers of

                                      -56-

<PAGE>

each of their covenants and duties under the Loan Documents. The Agent's Liens
in and to the Personal Property Collateral shall attach to all Personal Property
Collateral without further act on the part of Agent or Borrowers. Anything
contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary
notwithstanding, except for Permitted Dispositions, Borrowers have no authority,
express or implied, to dispose of any item or portion of the Collateral.

          4.2 Negotiable Collateral. In the event that any Collateral, including
              ---------------------
proceeds, is evidenced by or consists of Negotiable Collateral, and if and to
the extent that perfection or priority of Agent's security interest is dependent
on or enhanced by possession, the applicable Borrower, immediately upon the
request of Agent, shall endorse and deliver physical possession of such
Negotiable Collateral to Agent.

          4.3 Collection of Accounts, General Intangibles, and Negotiable
              -----------------------------------------------------------
Collateral. At any time after the occurrence and during the continuation of an
----------
Event of Default, Agent or Agent's designee may (a) notify Account Debtors of
Borrowers that the Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles have been
assigned to Agent or that Agent has a security interest therein, or (b) collect
the Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles directly and charge the
collection costs and expenses to the Loan Account. Each Borrower agrees that it
will hold in trust for the Lender Group, as the Lender Group's trustee, any
Collections that it receives and immediately will deliver said Collections to
Agent or a Cash Management Bank in their original form as received by the
applicable Borrower.

          4.4 Filing of Financing Statements; Commercial Tort Claims; Delivery
of Additional Documentation Required.

               (a) Each Borrower authorizes Agent to file any financing
statement required hereunder, and any continuation statement or amendment with
respect thereto, in any appropriate filing office without the signature of such
Borrower where permitted by applicable law. Each Borrower hereby ratifies the
filing of any financing statement, and any continuation statement or amendment
with respect thereto, filed without the signature of such Borrower prior to the
date hereof.

               (b) If any Borrower acquires any commercial tort claims after the
date hereof, such Borrower shall promptly (but in any event within 3 Business
Days after such acquisition) deliver to Agent a written description of such
commercial tort claim and shall deliver a written agreement, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent, pursuant to which such Borrower
shall pledge and collaterally assign all of its right, title and interest in and
to such commercial tort claim to Agent, for the benefit of the Lender Group, as
security for the Obligations (a "Commercial Tort Claim Assignment").
                                 --------------------------------

               (c) At any time upon the request of Agent, Borrowers shall
execute and deliver to Agent, and cause its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver
to Agent, any and all financing statements, original financing statements in
lieu of continuation statements, amendments to financing statements, fixture
filings, security agreements, pledges, assignments, Commercial Tort Claim
Assignments, endorsements of certificates of title, and all other documents
(collectively, the "Additional Documents") that Agent may request in its
                    --------------------
Permitted Discretion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent, to
perfect and continue

                                      -57-

<PAGE>

perfected or better perfect the Agent's Liens in the Collateral (whether now
owned or hereafter arising or acquired), to create and perfect Liens in favor of
Agent in any Real Property acquired after the Closing Date, and in order to
fully consummate all of the transactions contemplated hereby and under the other
Loan Documents. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Borrower
authorizes Agent to execute any such Additional Documents in the applicable
Borrower's name and authorize Agent to file such executed Additional Documents
in any appropriate filing office. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
law, each Borrower authorizes the filing of any such Additional Documents
without the signature of such Borrower in any appropriate filing office. In
addition, on such periodic basis as Agent shall reasonably require, Borrowers
shall (i) provide Agent with a report of all new patentable, copyrightable, or
trademarkable materials acquired or generated by Borrowers during the prior
period, (ii) cause all patents, copyrights, and trademarks acquired or generated
by Borrowers that are not already the subject of a registration with the
appropriate filing office (or an application therefor diligently prosecuted) to
be registered with such appropriate filing office in a manner sufficient to
impart constructive notice of Borrowers' ownership thereof, (iii) cause to be
prepared, executed, and delivered to Agent supplemental schedules to the
applicable Loan Documents to identify such patents, copyrights, and trademarks
as being subject to the security interests created thereunder, and (iv) comply
with all applicable provisions of the Patent Security Agreement, Copyright
Security Agreement and Trademark Security Agreement relating to the foregoing.

          4.5 Power of Attorney. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably makes,
              -----------------
constitutes, and appoints Agent (and any of Agent's officers, employees, or
agents designated by Agent) as such Borrower's true and lawful attorney, with
power to (a) if such Borrower refuses to, or fails timely to execute and deliver
any of the documents described in Section 4.4, sign the name of such Borrower on
                                  -----------
any of the documents described in Section 4.4, (b) at any time that an Event of
                                  -----------
Default has occurred and is continuing, sign such Borrower's name on any invoice
or bill of lading relating to the Collateral, drafts against Account Debtors, or
notices to Account Debtors, (c) send requests for verification of Accounts, (d)
endorse such Borrower's name on any Collection item that may come into the
Lender Group's possession, (e) at any time that an Event of Default has occurred

such policies of insurance, and (f) at any time that an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, settle and adjust disputes and claims respecting the
Accounts, chattel paper, or General Intangibles directly with Account Debtors,
for amounts and upon terms that Agent determines to be reasonable, and Agent may
cause to be executed and delivered any documents and releases that Agent
determines to be necessary. The appointment of Agent as each Borrower's
attorney, and each and every one of its rights and powers, being coupled with an
interest, is irrevocable until all of the Obligations have been fully and
finally repaid and performed and the Lender Group's obligations to extend credit
hereunder are terminated.

          4.6 Right to Inspect. Agent and each Lender (through any of their
              ----------------
respective officers, employees, or agents) shall have the right, from time to
time hereafter to inspect the Books and to check, test, and appraise the
Collateral in order to verify Borrowers' financial condition or the amount,
quality, value, condition of, or any other matter relating to, the Collateral.

<PAGE>

          4.7 Control Agreements. Each Borrower agrees that it will not transfer
              ------------------
assets out of any Securities Accounts other than as permitted under Section 7.18
                                                                    ------------
and, if to another securities intermediary, unless each of the applicable
Borrower, Agent, and the substitute securities intermediary have entered into a
Control Agreement. No arrangement contemplated hereby or by any Control
Agreement in respect of any Securities Accounts or other Investment Property
shall be modified by Borrowers without the prior written consent of Agent. Upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default,
Agent may notify any securities intermediary to liquidate the applicable
Securities Account or any related Investment Property maintained or held thereby
and remit the proceeds thereof to the Agent's Account.

Borrower, seeking to establish the invalidity or unenforceability thereof, or
any Borrower shall deny that any Borrower has any liability or obligation
purported to be created under any Loan Document.

     9.   THE LENDER GROUP'S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

          9.1 Rights and Remedies. Upon the occurrence, and during the
              -------------------
continuation, of an Event of Default, the Required Lenders (at their election
but without notice of their election and without demand) may authorize and
instruct Agent to do any one or more of the following on behalf of the Lender
Group (and Agent, acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, shall do
the same on behalf of the Lender Group), all of which are authorized by
Borrowers:

               (a) Declare all Obligations, whether evidenced by this Agreement,
by any of the other Loan Documents, or otherwise, immediately due and payable;

               (b) Cease advancing money or extending credit to or for the
benefit of Borrowers under this Agreement, under any of the Loan Documents, or
under any other agreement between Borrowers and the Lender Group;

               (c) Terminate this Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents
as to any future liability or obligation of the Lender Group, but without
affecting any of the Agent's Liens in the Collateral and without affecting the
Obligations;

               (d) Settle or adjust disputes and claims directly with Account
Debtors for amounts and upon terms which Agent considers advisable, and in such
cases, Agent will credit the Loan Account with only the net amounts received by
Agent in payment of such

                                      -81-

<PAGE>

disputed Accounts after deducting all Lender Group Expenses incurred or expended
in connection therewith;

               (e) Without notice to or demand upon any Borrower or any
Guarantor, make such payments and do such acts as Agent considers necessary or
reasonable to protect its security interests in the Collateral. Each Borrower
agrees to assemble the Personal Property Collateral if Agent so requires, and to
make the Personal Property Collateral available to Agent at a place that Agent
may designate which is reasonably convenient to both parties. Each Borrower
authorizes Agent to enter the premises where the Personal Property Collateral is
located, to take and maintain possession of the Personal Property Collateral, or
any part of it, and to pay, purchase, contest, or compromise any Lien that in
Agent's determination appears to conflict with the Agent's Liens and to pay all
expenses incurred in connection therewith and to charge Borrowers' Loan Account
therefor. With respect to any of Borrowers' owned or leased premises, each
Borrower hereby grants Agent a license to enter into possession of such premises
and to occupy the same, without charge, in order to exercise any of the Lender
Group's rights or remedies provided herein, at law, in equity, or otherwise;

               (f) Without notice to any Borrower (such notice being expressly
waived), and without constituting a retention of any collateral in satisfaction
of an obligation (within the meaning of the Code), set off and apply to the
Obligations any and all (i) balances and deposits of any Borrower held by the
Lender Group (including any amounts received in the Cash Management Accounts),
or (ii) Indebtedness at any time owing to or for the credit or the account of
any Borrower held by the Lender Group;

               (g) Hold, as cash collateral, any and all balances and deposits
of any Borrower held by the Lender Group, and any amounts received in the Cash
Management Accounts, to secure the full and final repayment of all of the
Obligations;

               (h) Ship, reclaim, recover, store, finish, maintain, repair,
prepare for sale, advertise for sale, and sell (in the manner provided for
herein) the Personal Property Collateral. Each Borrower hereby grants to Agent a
license or other right to use, without charge, such Borrower's labels, patents,
copyrights, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, service marks, and
advertising matter, or any property of a similar nature, as it pertains to the
Personal Property Collateral, in completing production of, advertising for sale,
and selling any Personal Property Collateral and such Borrower's rights under
all licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure to the Lender Group's
benefit;

               (i) Sell the Personal Property Collateral at either a public or
private sale, or both, by way of one or more contracts or transactions, for cash
or on terms, in such manner and at such places (including Borrowers' premises)
as Agent determines is commercially reasonable. It is not necessary that the
Personal Property Collateral be present at any such sale;

               (j) Agent shall give notice of the disposition of the Personal
Property Collateral as follows:

                    (i) Agent shall give Administrative Borrower (for the
     benefit of the applicable Borrower) a notice in writing of the time and
     place of public sale, or, if

                                      -82-

<PAGE>

     the sale is a private sale or some other disposition other than a public
     sale is to be made of the Personal Property Collateral, the time on or
     after which the private sale or other disposition is to be made; and

                    (ii) The notice shall be personally delivered or mailed,
     postage prepaid, to Administrative Borrower as provided in Section 12, at
                                                                ----------
     least 10 days before the earliest time of disposition set forth in the
     notice; no notice needs to be given prior to the disposition of any portion
     of the Personal Property Collateral that is perishable or threatens to
     decline speedily in value or that is of a type customarily sold on a
     recognized market;

               (k) Agent, on behalf of the Lender Group may credit bid and
purchase at any public sale;

               (l) Agent may seek the appointment of a receiver or keeper to
take possession of all or any portion of the Collateral or to operate same and,
to the maximum extent permitted by law, may seek the appointment of such a
receiver without the requirement of prior notice or a hearing;

               (m) The Lender Group shall have all other rights and remedies
available to it at law or in equity pursuant to any other Loan Documents; and

               (n) Any deficiency that exists after disposition of the Personal
Property Collateral as provided above will be paid immediately by Borrowers. Any
excess will be returned, without interest and subject to the rights of third
Persons, by Agent to Administrative Borrower (for the benefit of the applicable
Borrower).

          9.2 Remedies Cumulative. The rights and remedies of the Lender Group
              -------------------
under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and all other agreements shall
be cumulative. The Lender Group shall have all other rights and remedies not
inconsistent herewith as provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. No
exercise by the Lender Group of one right or remedy shall be deemed an election,
and no waiver by the Lender Group of any Event of Default shall be deemed a
continuing waiver. No delay by the Lender Group shall constitute a waiver,
election, or acquiescence by it.

     10.  TAXES AND EXPENSES.

          If any Borrower fails to pay any monies (whether taxes, assessments,
insurance premiums, or, in the case of leased properties or assets, rents or
other amounts payable under such leases) due to third Persons, or fails to make
any deposits or furnish any required proof of payment or deposit, all as
required under the terms of this Agreement, then, Agent, in its sole discretion
and without prior notice to any Borrower, may do any or all of the following:
(a) make payment of the same or any part thereof, (b) set up such reserves in
Borrowers' Loan Account as Agent deems necessary to protect the Lender Group
from the exposure created by such failure, or (c) in the case of the failure to
comply with Section 6.7 hereof, obtain and maintain insurance policies of the
            -----------
type described in Section 6.7 and take any action with respect to such policies
                  -----------
as Agent deems prudent. Any such amounts paid by Agent shall constitute Lender
Group Expenses and any such payments shall not constitute an agreement by the
Lender

                                      -83-

<PAGE>

Group to make similar payments in the future or a waiver by the Lender
Group of any Event of Default under this Agreement. Agent need not inquire as
to, or contest the validity of, any such expense, tax, or Lien and the receipt
of the usual official notice for the payment thereof shall be conclusive
evidence that the same was validly due and owing.

     11.  WAIVERS; INDEMNIFICATION.

          11.1 Demand; Protest; etc. Each Borrower waives demand, protest,
               ---------------------
notice of protest, notice of default or dishonor, notice of payment and
nonpayment, nonpayment at maturity, release, compromise, settlement, extension,
or renewal of documents, instruments, chattel paper, and guarantees at any time
held by the Lender Group on which any such Borrower may in any way be liable.

          11.2 The Lender Group's Liability for Collateral. Each Borrower hereby
               -------------------------------------------
agrees that: (a) so long as the Lender Group complies with its obligations, if
any, under the Code, Agent shall not in any way or manner be liable or
responsible for: (i) the safekeeping of the Collateral, (ii) any loss or damage
thereto occurring or arising in any manner or fashion from any cause, (iii) any
diminution in the value thereof, or (iv) any act or default of any carrier,
warehouseman, bailee, forwarding agency, or other Person, and (b) all risk of
loss, damage, or destruction of the Collateral shall be borne by Borrowers.

          11.3 Indemnification. Each Borrower shall pay, indemnify, defend, and
               ---------------
hold the Agent-Related Persons, the Lender-Related Persons with respect to each
Lender, each Participant, and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact (each, an "Indemnified Person")
                                                    ------------------
harmless (to the fullest extent permitted by law) from and against any and all
claims, demands, suits, actions, investigations, proceedings, and damages, and
all reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements and other costs and expenses
actually incurred in connection therewith (as and when they are incurred and
irrespective of whether suit is brought), at any time asserted against, imposed
upon, or incurred by any of them (a) in connection with or as a result of or
related to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance, or administration
of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and (b) with respect to any investigation,
litigation, or proceeding related to this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or
the use of the proceeds of the credit provided hereunder (irrespective of
whether any Indemnified Person is a party thereto), or any act, omission, event,
or circumstance in any manner related thereto (all the foregoing, collectively,
the "Indemnified Liabilities"). The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding,
     -----------------------
Borrowers shall have no obligation to any Indemnified Person under this Section
                                                                        -------
11.3 with respect to any Indemnified Liability that a court of competent
----
jurisdiction finally determines to have resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person. This provision shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the repayment of the Obligations. If any
Indemnified Person makes any payment to any other Indemnified Person with
respect to an Indemnified Liability as to which Borrowers were required to
indemnify the Indemnified Person receiving such payment, the Indemnified Person
making such payment is entitled to be indemnified and reimbursed by Borrowers
with respect thereto. WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE FOREGOING INDEMNITY SHALL APPLY TO
EACH INDEMNIFIED PERSON WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES WHICH IN WHOLE
OR IN PART

                                      -84-

<PAGE>

CAUSED BY OR ARISE OUT OF ANY NEGLIGENT ACT OR OMISSION OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED
PERSON OR OF ANY OTHER PERSON.

          14.1 Assignments and Participations.
               ------------------------------

               (a) Any Lender may, with the written consent of Agent (provided
that no written consent of Agent shall be required in connection with any
assignment and delegation by a Lender to an Eligible Transferee), assign and
delegate to one or more assignees (each an "Assignee") all, or any ratable part
                                            --------
of all, of the Obligations, the Commitments and the other rights and obligations
of such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, in a minimum amount
of $5,000,000; provided, however, that Borrowers and Agent may continue to deal
               --------  -------
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with the interest so assigned
to an Assignee until (i) written notice of such assignment, together with
payment instructions, addresses, and related information with respect to the
Assignee, have been given to Administrative Borrower and Agent by such Lender
and the Assignee, (ii) such Lender and its Assignee have delivered to
Administrative Borrower and Agent an Assignment and Acceptance in form and
substance satisfactory to Agent, and (iii) the assignor Lender or Assignee has
paid to Agent for Agent's separate account a processing fee in the amount of
$5,000. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the consent
of Agent shall not be required (and payment of any fees shall not be required)
if such assignment is in connection with any merger, consolidation, sale,
transfer, or other disposition of all or any substantial portion of the business
or loan portfolio of such Lender.

               (b) From and after the date that Agent notifies the assignor
Lender (with a copy to Administrative Borrower) that it has received an executed
Assignment and Acceptance and payment of the above-referenced processing fee,
(i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under the Loan Documents, and (ii) the assignor Lender shall, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents have been
assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights
(except with respect to Section 11.3 hereof) and be released from its
                        ------------
obligations under this Agreement (and in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, such Lender
shall cease to be a party hereto and thereto), and such assignment shall affect
a novation between Borrowers and the Assignee.

               (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
assigning Lender thereunder and the Assignee thereunder confirm to and agree
with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (1) other than as
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this
Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished
pursuant hereto, (2) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty
and assumes no responsibility

                                      -87-

<PAGE>

with respect to the financial condition of Borrowers or the performance or
observance by Borrowers of any of their obligations under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto, (3) such Assignee confirms that
it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance, (4) such Assignee will,
independently and without reliance upon Agent, such assigning Lender or any
other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement, (5) such Assignee appoints and
authorizes Agent to take such actions and to exercise such powers under this
Agreement as are delegated to Agent, by the terms hereof, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, and (6) such Assignee agrees that
it will perform all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are
required to be performed by it as a Lender.

               (d) Immediately upon each Assignee's making its processing fee
payment under the Assignment and Acceptance and receipt and acknowledgment by
Agent of such fully executed Assignment and Acceptance, this Agreement shall be
deemed to be amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect
the addition of the Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments
arising therefrom. The Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such
Commitments of the assigning Lender pro tanto.

               (e) Any Lender may at any time, with the written consent of
Agent, sell to one or more commercial banks, financial institutions, or other
Persons not Affiliates of such Lender (a "Participant") participating interests
                                          -----------
in its Obligations, the Commitment, and the other rights and interests of that
Lender (the "Originating Lender") hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
             ------------------
(provided that no written consent of Agent shall be required in connection with
any sale of any such participating interests by a Lender to an Eligible
Transferee); provided, however, that (i) the Originating Lender shall remain a
             --------  -------
"Lender" for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the
Participant receiving the participating interest in the Obligations, the

for the performance of such obligations, (iii) Borrowers, Agent, and the Lenders
shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Originating Lender in
connection with the Originating Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (iv) no Lender shall transfer or grant
any participating interest under which the Participant has the right to approve
any amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or

respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to
the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing

may enforce such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under
applicable law.

          14.2 Successors. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of
               ----------
the respective successors and assigns of each of the parties; provided, however,

that Borrowers may not assign this Agreement or any rights or duties hereunder
without the Lenders' prior written consent and any prohibited assignment shall
be absolutely void ab initio. No consent to assignment by the Lenders shall
release any Borrower from its Obligations. A Lender may assign this Agreement

pursuant to Section 14.1 hereof and, except as expressly required pursuant to
            ------------
Section 14.1 hereof, no consent or approval by any Borrower is required in

     ----------------  -------
unless in writing and signed by Agent, Issuing Lender, or Swing Lender, affect
the rights or duties of Agent, Issuing Lender, or Swing Lender, as applicable,
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. The foregoing notwithstanding,
any amendment, modification, waiver, consent, termination, or release of, or
with respect to, any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that
relates only to the relationship of the Lender Group among themselves, and that
does not affect the rights or obligations of Borrowers, shall not require
consent by or the agreement of Borrowers.

          15.2 Replacement of Holdout Lender. If any action to be taken by the
               -----------------------------
Lender Group or Agent hereunder requires the unanimous consent, authorization,
or agreement of all Lenders, and a Lender ("Holdout Lender") fails to give its
consent, authorization, or agreement, then Agent, upon at least 5 Business Days
prior irrevocable notice to the Holdout Lender, may permanently replace the
Holdout Lender with one or more substitute Lenders (each, a "Replacement
Lender"), and the Holdout Lender shall have not right to refuse to be replaced
hereunder. Such notice to replace the Holdout Lender shall specify an effective
date for such replacement, which date shall not be later than 15 Business Days
after the date such notice is given.

                                      -90-

<PAGE>

          Prior to the effective date of such replacement, the Holdout Lender
and each Replacement Lender shall execute and deliver an Assignment and
Acceptance Agreement, subject only to the Holdout Lender being repaid its share
of the outstanding Obligations (including an assumption of its Pro Rata Share of
the Risk Participation Liability) without any premium or penalty of any kind
whatsoever. If the Holdout Lender shall refuse or fail to execute and deliver
any such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement prior to the effective date of such
replacement, the Holdout Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered
such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement. The replacement of any Holdout Lender
shall be made in accordance with the terms of Section 14.1. Until such time as
                                              -------------
the Replacement Lenders shall have acquired all of the Obligations, the
Commitments, and the other rights and obligations of the Holdout Lender
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Holdout Lender shall remain
obligated to make the Holdout Lender's Pro Rata Share of Advances and to
purchase a participation in each Letter of Credit, in an amount equal to its Pro
Rata Share of the Risk Participation Liability of such Letter of Credit.

          15.3 No Waivers; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by Agent or any
               -------------------------------
Lender to exercise any right, remedy, or option under this Agreement or, any
other Loan Document, or delay by Agent or any Lender in exercising the same,
will operate as a waiver thereof. No waiver by Agent or any Lender will be
effective unless it is in writing, and then only to the extent specifically
stated. No waiver by Agent or any Lender on any occasion shall affect or
diminish Agent's and each Lender's rights thereafter to require strict
performance by Borrowers of any provision of this Agreement. Agent's and each
Lender's rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents will be
cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy that Agent or any
Lender may have.

     16.  AGENT; THE LENDER GROUP.

          16.1 Appointment and Authorization of Agent. Each Lender hereby
               --------------------------------------
designates and appoints Foothill as its representative under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents and each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent to
take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each
other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are
expressly delegated to Agent by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Agent
agrees to act as such on the express conditions contained in this Section 16.
                                                                  ----------
The provisions of this Section 16 are solely for the benefit of Agent, and the
                       ----------
Lenders, and Borrowers shall have no rights as a third party beneficiary of any
of the provisions contained herein. Any provision to the contrary contained
elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document notwithstanding, Agent
shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth
herein, nor shall Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship
with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or otherwise exist against Agent; it being expressly understood and
agreed that the use of the word "Agent" is for convenience only, that Foothill
is merely the representative of the Lenders, and only has the contractual duties
set forth herein. Except as expressly otherwise provided in this Agreement,
Agent shall have and may use its sole discretion with respect to exercising or
refraining from exercising any discretionary rights or taking or refraining from
taking any actions that Agent expressly is entitled to take or assert under or
pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

                                      -91-

the Loan Documents that provides rights or powers to Agent, Lenders agree that

business practices, ledgers and records reflecting the status of the

remedies of the Lender Group with respect to Borrowers, the Obligations, the
Collateral, the Collections, or otherwise related to any of same as provided in

may deem necessary or appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its
functions and powers pursuant to the Loan Documents.

          16.2 Delegation of Duties. Agent may execute any of its duties under
               --------------------
this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties. Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects as
long as such selection was made without gross negligence or willful misconduct.

          16.3 Liability of Agent. None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (i)
               ------------------
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct),
or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recital,
statement, representation or warranty made by any Borrower or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate of any Borrower, or any officer or director thereof, contained in this
Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by Agent
under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of any Borrower or any
other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or
thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender
to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or to inspect the Books or properties of Borrowers or the books or
records or properties of any of Borrowers' Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

          16.4 Reliance by Agent. Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
               -----------------
fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Borrowers
or counsel to any Lender), independent accountants and other experts selected by

                                      -92-

<PAGE>

Agent. Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless Agent shall first receive
such advice or concurrence of the Lenders as it deems appropriate and until such
instructions are received, Agent shall act, or refrain from acting, as it deems
advisable. If Agent so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable
satisfaction by Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be
incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Agent
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or
consent of the Lenders and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.

          16.5 Notice of Default or Event of Default. Agent shall not be deemed
               -------------------------------------
to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of
Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest,
fees, and expenses required to be paid to Agent for the account of the Lenders,
except with respect to Events of Default of which Agent has actual knowledge,
unless Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or Administrative
Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of
Default, and stating that such notice is a "notice of default." Agent promptly
will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice or of any Event of
Default of which Agent has actual knowledge. If any Lender obtains actual
knowledge of any Event of Default, such Lender promptly shall notify the other
Lenders and Agent of such Event of Default. Each Lender shall be solely
responsible for giving any notices to its Participants, if any. Subject to
Section 16.4, Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event
------------
of Default as may be requested by the Required Lenders in accordance with
Section 9; provided, however, that unless and until Agent has received any such
---------  --------  -------
request, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain
from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it
shall deem advisable.

          16.6 Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that none of the
               ---------------
Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no
act by Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of Borrowers
and their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender. Each
Lender represents to Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of Borrowers and any other Person (other than the Lender Group)
party to a Loan Document, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into
this Agreement and to extend credit to Borrowers. Each Lender also represents
that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person
and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of Borrowers and any other Person (other than the Lender Group)
party to a Loan Document. Except for notices, reports, and other documents
expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by Agent, Agent shall
not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or
other information concerning the business, prospects, operations,

                                      -93-

<PAGE>

property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of Borrowers and any
other Person party to a Loan Document that may come into the possession of any
of the Agent-Related Persons.

          16.7 Costs and Expenses; Indemnification. Agent may incur and pay
               -----------------------------------
Lender Group Expenses to the extent Agent reasonably deems necessary or
appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its functions, powers, and
obligations pursuant to the Loan Documents, including court costs, reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses, costs of collection by outside collection agencies
and auctioneer fees and costs of security guards or insurance premiums paid to
maintain the Collateral, whether or not Borrowers are obligated to reimburse
Agent or Lenders for such expenses pursuant to the Loan Agreement or otherwise.
Agent is authorized and directed to deduct and retain sufficient amounts from
Collections received by Agent to reimburse Agent for such out-of-pocket costs
and expenses prior to the distribution of any amounts to Lenders. In the event
Agent is not reimbursed for such costs and expenses from Collections received by
Agent, each Lender hereby agrees that it is and shall be obligated to pay to or
reimburse Agent for the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof. Whether
or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall
indemnify upon demand the Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by
or on behalf of Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of Borrowers to do
so), according to their Pro Rata Shares, from and against any and all
Indemnified Liabilities; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for
                         --------  -------
the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified
Liabilities resulting solely from such Person's gross negligence or willful
misconduct nor shall any Lender be liable for the obligations of any Defaulting
Lender in failing to make an Advance or other extension of credit hereunder.
Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse Agent upon
demand for such Lender's ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by Agent in connection with the
preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment, or
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of,
or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement,
any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein,
to the extent that Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of
Borrowers. The undertaking in this Section shall survive the payment of all
Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of Agent.

               ----------------------------

financial advisory, underwriting, or other business with Borrowers and their
Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any other Person (other than the Lender Group)
party to any Loan Documents as though Foothill were not Agent hereunder, and, in
each case, without notice to or consent of the other members of the Lender
Group. The other members of the Lender Group acknowledge that, pursuant to such
activities, Foothill or its Affiliates may receive information regarding
Borrowers or their Affiliates and any other Person (other than the Lender Group)
party to any Loan Documents that is subject to confidentiality obligations in
favor of Borrowers or such other Person and that prohibit the disclosure of such
information to the Lenders, and the Lenders acknowledge that, in such
circumstances (and in the absence of a waiver of such confidentiality
obligations, which waiver Agent will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain),
Agent shall not be under any obligation to provide such

                                      -94-

<PAGE>

information to them. The terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include Foothill in its
individual capacity.

          16.9 Successor Agent. Agent may resign as Agent upon 45 days notice to
               ---------------
the Lenders. If Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall
appoint a successor Agent for the Lenders. If no successor Agent is appointed
prior to the effective date of the resignation of Agent, Agent may appoint,
after consulting with the Lenders, a successor Agent. If Agent has materially
breached or failed to perform any material provision of this Agreement or of
applicable law, the Required Lenders may agree in writing to remove and replace
Agent with a successor Agent from among the Lenders. In any such event, upon the
acceptance of its appointment as successor Agent hereunder, such successor Agent
shall succeed to all the rights, powers, and duties of the retiring Agent and
the term "Agent" shall mean such successor Agent and the retiring Agent's
appointment, powers, and duties as Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring
Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Section 16 shall
                                                               ----------
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Agent under this Agreement. If no successor Agent has accepted
appointment as Agent by the date which is 45 days following a retiring Agent's
notice of resignation, the retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless
thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of
Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Lenders appoint a successor
Agent as provided for above.

          16.10 Lender in Individual Capacity. Any Lender and its respective
                -----------------------------
Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept
deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of
banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with
Borrowers and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any other Person (other than
the Lender Group) party to any Loan Documents as though such Lender were not a
Lender hereunder without notice to or consent of the other members of the Lender
Group. The other members of the Lender Group acknowledge that, pursuant to such
activities, such Lender and its respective Affiliates may receive information
regarding Borrowers or their Affiliates and any other Person (other than the
Lender Group) party to any Loan Documents that is subject to confidentiality
obligations in favor of Borrowers or such other Person and that prohibit the
disclosure of such information to the Lenders, and the Lenders acknowledge that,
in such circumstances (and in the absence of a waiver of such confidentiality
obligations, which waiver such Lender will use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain), such Lender not shall be under any obligation to provide such
information to them. With respect to the Swing Loans and Agent Advances, Swing
Lender shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the sub-agent of the
Agent.

          16.11 Withholding Taxes.
                -----------------

               (a) If any Lender is a "foreign corporation, partnership or
trust" within the meaning of the IRC and such Lender claims exemption from, or a
reduction of, U.S. withholding tax under Sections 1441 or 1442 of the IRC, such
Lender agrees with and in favor of Agent and Borrowers, to deliver to Agent and
Administrative Borrower:

                    (i) if such Lender claims an exemption from withholding tax
     pursuant to its portfolio interest exception, (a) a statement of the
     Lender, signed under

                                      -95-

     881(c)(3)(A) of the IRC, (II) a 10% shareholder (within the meaning of
     Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the IRC), or (III) a controlled foreign corporation
     described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the IRC, and (B) a properly completed
     IRS Form W-8BEN, before the first payment of any interest under this
     Agreement and at any other time reasonably requested by Agent or
     Administrative Borrower;

                    (ii) if such Lender claims an exemption from, or a reduction
     of, withholding tax under a United States tax treaty, properly completed
     IRS Form W-8BEN before the first payment of any interest under this
     Agreement and at any other time reasonably requested by Agent or
     Administrative Borrower;

                    (iii) if such Lender claims that interest paid under this
     Agreement is exempt from United States withholding tax because it is
     effectively connected with a United States trade or business of such
     Lender, two properly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI
     before the first payment of any interest is due under this Agreement and at
     any other time reasonably requested by Agent or Administrative Borrower;

     IRC or other laws of the United States as a condition to exemption from, or
     reduction of, United States withholding tax.

Such Lender agrees promptly to notify Agent and Administrative Borrower of any
change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed
exemption or reduction.

               (b) If any Lender claims exemption from, or reduction of,
withholding tax under a United States tax treaty by providing IRS Form W-8BEN
and such Lender sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise
transfers all or part of the Obligations of Borrowers to such Lender, such
Lender agrees to notify Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no longer
the beneficial owner of Obligations of Borrowers to such Lender. To the extent
of such percentage amount, Agent will treat such Lender's IRS Form W-8BEN as no
longer valid.

               (c) If any Lender is entitled to a reduction in the applicable
withholding tax, Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an
amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking into account
such reduction. If the forms or other documentation required by subsection (a)
of this Section are not delivered to Agent, then Agent may withhold from any
interest payment to such Lender not providing such forms or other documentation
an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.

               (d) If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United
States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that Agent did not properly
withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the
appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such
Lender failed to notify Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered the
exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other
reason) such Lender shall indemnify and hold Agent harmless for all amounts

                                      -96-

<PAGE>

paid, directly or indirectly, by Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties
and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
payable to Agent under this Section, together with all costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses). The obligation of the Lenders under
this subsection shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation
or replacement of Agent.

               (e) All payments made by Borrowers hereunder or under any note or
other Loan Document will be made without setoff, counterclaim, or other defense,
except as required by applicable law other than for Taxes (as defined below).
All such payments will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or
withholding for, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees,
assessments or other charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any
jurisdiction (other than the United States) or by any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof or therein (other than of the United States) with
respect to such payments (but excluding, any tax imposed by any jurisdiction or
by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (i) measured
by or based on the net income or net profits of a Lender, or (ii) to the extent
that such tax results from a change in the circumstances of the Lender,
including a change in the residence, place of organization, or principal place
of business of the Lender, or a change in the branch or lending office of the
Lender participating in the transactions set forth herein) and all interest,
penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto (all such non-excluded
taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges being
referred to collectively as "Taxes"). If any Taxes are so levied or imposed,
                             -----
each Borrower agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes, and such additional
amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of all amounts due under this
Agreement or under any note, including any amount paid pursuant to this Section
                                                                        -------
16.11(e) after withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes, will not
--------
be less than the amount provided for herein; provided, however, that Borrowers
                                             --------  -------
shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to Agent or any
Lender (i) that is not organized under the laws of the United States, if such
Person fails to comply with the other requirements of this Section 16.11
                                                           -------------
establishing a complete exemption from or reduction of U.S. withholding tax, or
(ii) if the increase in such amount payable results from Agent's or such
Lender's own willful misconduct or gross negligence. Borrowers will furnish to
Agent as promptly as possible after the date the payment of any Taxes is due
pursuant to applicable law certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such
payment by Borrowers.

          16.12 Collateral Matters.
                ------------------

               (a) The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize Agent, at its option
and in its sole discretion, to release any Lien on any Collateral (i) upon the
termination of the Commitments and payment and satisfaction in full by Borrowers
of all Obligations, (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed of if a
release is required or desirable in connection therewith and if Administrative
Borrower certifies to Agent that the sale or disposition is permitted under
Section 7.4 of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (and Agent may rely
-----------
conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry), (iii)
constituting property in which no Borrower owned any interest at the time the
security interest was granted or at any time thereafter, or (iv) constituting
property leased to a Borrower under a lease that has expired or is terminated in
a transaction permitted under this Agreement. Except as provided above, Agent
will not execute and deliver a release of any Lien on any Collateral without the
prior written authorization of (y) if the release is of all or substantially all
of the Collateral, all of

                                      -97-

<PAGE>

the Lenders, or (z) otherwise, the Required Lenders. Upon request by Agent or
Administrative Borrower at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing Agent's
authority to release any such Liens on particular types or items of Collateral
pursuant to this Section 16.12; provided, however, that (1) Agent shall not be
                 -------------  --------  -------
required to execute any document necessary to evidence such release on terms
that, in Agent's opinion, would expose Agent to liability or create any
obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Lien without
recourse, representation, or warranty, and (2) such release shall not in any
manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than
those expressly being released) upon (or obligations of Borrowers in respect of)
all interests retained by Borrowers, including, the proceeds of any sale, all of
which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.

               (b) Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any of the
Lenders to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by Borrowers or is
cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Agent's
Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected,
protected, or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to
exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care,
disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights,
authorities and powers granted or available to Agent pursuant to any of the Loan
Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or
any act, omission, or event related thereto, subject to the terms and conditions
contained herein, Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its
sole discretion given Agent's own interest in the Collateral in its capacity as
one of the Lenders and that Agent shall have no other duty or liability
whatsoever to any Lender as to any of the foregoing, except as otherwise
provided herein.

          16.13 Restrictions on Actions by Lenders; Sharing of Payments.
                -------------------------------------------------------

               (a) Each of the Lenders agrees that it shall not, without the
express consent of Agent, and that it shall, to the extent it is lawfully
entitled to do so, upon the request of Agent, set off against the Obligations,
any amounts owing by such Lender to Borrowers or any deposit accounts of
Borrowers now or hereafter maintained with such Lender. Each of the Lenders
further agrees that it shall not, unless specifically requested to do so by
Agent, take or cause to be taken any action, including, the commencement of any
legal or equitable proceedings, to foreclose any Lien on, or otherwise enforce
any security interest in, any of the Collateral the purpose of which is, or
could be, to give such Lender any preference or priority against the other
Lenders with respect to the Collateral.

               (b) If, at any time or times any Lender shall receive (i) by
payment, foreclosure, setoff, or otherwise, any proceeds of Collateral or any
payments with respect to the Obligations arising under, or relating to, this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except for any such proceeds or payments
received by such Lender from Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or
(ii) payments from Agent in excess of such Lender's ratable portion of all such
distributions by Agent, such Lender promptly shall (1) turn the same over to
Agent, in kind, and with such endorsements as may be required to negotiate the
same to Agent, or in immediately available funds, as applicable, for the account
of all of the Lenders and for application to the Obligations in accordance with
the applicable provisions of this Agreement, or (2) purchase, without recourse
or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in the Obligations owed to
the other Lenders so that such excess payment received shall be applied ratably
as among the

                                      -98-

<PAGE>

Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares; provided, however, that if all
or part of such excess payment received by the purchasing party is thereafter
recovered from it, those purchases of participations shall be rescinded in whole
or in part, as applicable, and the applicable portion of the purchase price paid
therefor shall be returned to such purchasing party, but without interest except
to the extent that such purchasing party is required to pay interest in
connection with the recovery of the excess payment.

          16.14 Agency for Perfection. Agent hereby appoints each other Lender
                ---------------------
as its agent (and each Lender hereby accepts such appointment) for the purpose
of perfecting the Agent's Liens in assets which, in accordance with Article 9 of
the UCC can be perfected only by possession. Should any Lender obtain possession
of any such Collateral, such Lender shall notify Agent thereof, and, promptly
upon Agent's request therefor shall deliver such Collateral to Agent or in
accordance with Agent's instructions.

          16.15 Payments by Agent to the Lenders. All payments to be made by
                --------------------------------
Agent to the Lenders shall be made by bank wire transfer or internal transfer of
immediately available funds pursuant to such wire transfer instructions as each
party may designate for itself by written notice to Agent. Concurrently with
each such payment, Agent shall identify whether such payment (or any portion
thereof) represents principal, premium, or interest of the Obligations.

          16.16 Concerning the Collateral and Related Loan Documents. Each
                ----------------------------------------------------
member of the Lender Group authorizes and directs Agent to enter into this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents relating to the Collateral, for the
benefit of the Lender Group. Each member of the Lender Group agrees that any
action taken by Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents relating to the Collateral and the exercise by Agent of its
powers set forth therein or herein, together with such other powers that are
reasonably incidental thereto, shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.

          16.17 Field Audits and Examination Reports; Confidentiality;
                ------------------------------------------------------
Disclaimers by Lenders; Other Reports and Information. By becoming a party to
-----------------------------------------------------
this Agreement, each Lender:

               (a) is deemed to have requested that Agent furnish such Lender,
promptly after it becomes available, a copy of each field audit or examination
report (each a "Report" and collectively, "Reports") prepared by Agent, and
                ------                     -------
Agent shall so furnish each Lender with such Reports,

               (b) expressly agrees and acknowledges that Agent does not (i)
make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any Report, and (ii)
shall not be liable for any information contained in any Report,

               (c) expressly agrees and acknowledges that the Reports are not
comprehensive audits or examinations, that Agent or other party performing any
audit or examination will inspect only specific information regarding Borrowers
and will rely significantly upon the Books, as well as on representations of
Borrowers' personnel,

               (d) agrees to keep all Reports and other material, non-public
information regarding Borrowers and their Subsidiaries and their operations,
assets, and existing

                                      -99-

<PAGE>

and contemplated business plans in a confidential manner; it being understood
and agreed by Borrowers that in any event such Lender may make disclosures (a)
to counsel for and other advisors, accountants, and auditors to such Lender, (b)
reasonably required by any bona fide potential or actual Assignee or Participant
in connection with any contemplated or actual assignment or transfer by such
Lender of an interest herein or any participation interest in such Lender's
rights hereunder, (c) of information that has become public by disclosures made
by Persons other than such Lender, its Affiliates, assignees, transferees, or
Participants, or (d) as required or requested by any court, governmental or
administrative agency, pursuant to any subpoena or other legal process, or by
any law, statute, regulation, or court order; provided, however, that, unless
                                              --------  -------
prohibited by applicable law, statute, regulation, or court order, such Lender
shall notify Administrative Borrower of any request by any court, governmental
or administrative agency, or pursuant to any subpoena or other legal process for
disclosure of any such non-public material information concurrent with, or where
practicable, prior to the disclosure thereof, and

               (e) without limiting the generality of any other indemnification
provision contained in this Agreement, agrees: (i) to hold Agent and any such
other Lender preparing a Report harmless from any action the indemnifying Lender
may take or conclusion the indemnifying Lender may reach or draw from any Report
in connection with any loans or other credit accommodations that the
indemnifying Lender has made or may make to Borrowers, or the indemnifying
Lender's participation in, or the indemnifying Lender's purchase of, a loan or
loans of Borrowers; and (ii) to pay and protect, and indemnify, defend and hold
Agent, and any such other Lender preparing a Report harmless from and against,
the claims, actions, proceedings, damages, costs, expenses, and other amounts
(including, attorneys fees and costs) incurred by Agent and any such other
Lender preparing a Report as the direct or indirect result of any third parties
who might obtain all or part of any Report through the indemnifying Lender.

In addition to the foregoing: (x) any Lender may from time to time request of
Agent in writing that Agent provide to such Lender a copy of any report or
document provided by Borrowers to Agent that has not been contemporaneously
provided by Borrowers to such Lender, and, upon receipt of such request, Agent
shall provide a copy of same to such Lender, (y) to the extent that Agent is
entitled, under any provision of the Loan Documents, to request additional
reports or information from Borrowers, any Lender may, from time to time,
reasonably request Agent to exercise such right as specified in such Lender's
notice to Agent, whereupon Agent promptly shall request of Administrative
Borrower the additional reports or information reasonably specified by such
Lender, and, upon receipt thereof from Administrative Borrower, Agent promptly
shall provide a copy of same to such Lender, and (z) any time that Agent renders
to Administrative Borrower a statement regarding the Loan Account, Agent shall
send a copy of such statement to each Lender.

          16.18 Several Obligations; No Liability. Notwithstanding that certain
                ---------------------------------
of the Loan Documents now or hereafter may have been or will be executed only by
or in favor of Agent in its capacity as such, and not by or in favor of the
Lenders, any and all obligations on the part of Agent (if any) to make any
credit available hereunder shall constitute the several (and not joint)
obligations of the respective Lenders on a ratable basis, according to their
respective Commitments, to make an amount of such credit not to exceed, in
principal amount, at any one time outstanding, the amount of their respective
Commitments. Nothing contained herein shall

                                     -100-

<PAGE>

confer upon any Lender any interest in, or subject any Lender to any liability
for, or in respect of, the business, assets, profits, losses, or liabilities of
any other Lender. Each Lender shall be solely responsible for notifying its
Participants of any matters relating to the Loan Documents to the extent any
such notice may be required, and no Lender shall have any obligation, duty, or
liability to any Participant of any other Lender. Except as provided in Section
                                                                        -------
16.7, no member of the Lender Group shall have any liability for the acts or any
----
other member of the Lender Group. No Lender shall be responsible to any Borrower
or any other Person for any failure by any other Lender to fulfill its
obligations to make credit available hereunder, nor to advance for it or on its
behalf in connection with its Commitment, nor to take any other action on its
behalf hereunder or in connection with the financing contemplated herein.

     17.  GENERAL PROVISIONS.

          17.1 Effectiveness. This Agreement shall be binding and deemed
               -------------
effective when executed by Borrowers, Agent, and each Lender whose signature is
provided for on the signature pages hereof.

          17.2 Section Headings. Headings and numbers have been set forth herein
               ----------------
for convenience only. Unless the contrary is compelled by the context,
everything contained in each Section applies equally to this entire Agreement.

          17.3 Interpretation. Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or
               --------------
ambiguity herein shall be construed or resolved against the Lender Group or
Borrowers, whether under any rule of construction or otherwise. On the contrary,
this Agreement has been reviewed by all parties and shall be construed and
interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the words used so as to
accomplish fairly the purposes and intentions of all parties hereto.

          17.4 Severability of Provisions. Each provision of this Agreement
               --------------------------
shall be severable from every other provision of this Agreement for the purpose
of determining the legal enforceability of any specific provision.

          17.5 Amendments in Writing. This Agreement only can be amended by a
               ---------------------
writing in accordance with Section 15.1.
                           ------------

          17.6 Counterparts; Telefacsimile Execution. This Agreement may be
               -------------------------------------
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate
counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be
an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and
the same Agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by
telefacsimile shall be equally as effective as delivery of an original executed
counterpart of this Agreement. Any party delivering an executed counterpart of
this Agreement by telefacsimile also shall deliver an original executed
counterpart of this Agreement but the failure to deliver an original executed
counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and binding effect of
this Agreement. The foregoing shall apply to each other Loan Document mutatis
mutandis.

          17.7 Revival and Reinstatement of Obligations. If the incurrence or
               ----------------------------------------
payment of the Obligations by any Borrower or any Guarantor or the transfer to
the Lender Group of any property should for any reason subsequently be declared
to be void or voidable under any state or

                                     -101-

<PAGE>

federal law relating to creditors' rights, including provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code relating to fraudulent conveyances, preferences, or other
voidable or recoverable payments of money or transfers of property
(collectively, a "Voidable Transfer"), and if the Lender Group is required to
                  -----------------
repay or restore, in whole or in part, any such Voidable Transfer, or elects to
do so upon the reasonable advice of its counsel, then, as to any such Voidable
Transfer, or the amount thereof that the Lender Group is required or elects to
repay or restore, and as to all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys fees
of the Lender Group related thereto, the liability of Borrowers or Guarantors
automatically shall be revived, reinstated, and restored and shall exist as
though such Voidable Transfer had never been made.

          17.8 Integration. This Agreement, together with the other Loan
               -----------
Documents, reflects the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not be contradicted or qualified by
any other agreement, oral or written, before the date hereof.

          17.9 Parent as Agent for Borrowers. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably
               -----------------------------
appoints Ventiv Health, Inc. as the borrowing agent and attorney-in-fact for all
Borrowers (the "Administrative Borrower") which appointment shall remain in full
                -----------------------
force and effect unless and until Agent shall have received prior written notice
signed by each Borrower that such appointment has been revoked and that another
Borrower has been appointed Administrative Borrower. Each Borrower hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Borrower (i) to provide
Agent with all notices with respect to Advances and Letters of Credit obtained
for the benefit of any Borrower and all other notices and instructions under
this Agreement and (ii) to take such action as the Administrative Borrower deems
appropriate on its behalf to obtain Advances and Letters of Credit and to
exercise such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement. It is understood that the handling of the Loan
Account and Collateral of Borrowers in a combined fashion, as more fully set
forth herein, is done solely as an accommodation to Borrowers in order to
utilize the collective borrowing powers of Borrowers in the most efficient and
economical manner and at their request, and that Lender Group shall not incur
liability to any Borrower as a result hereof. Each Borrower expects to derive
benefit, directly or indirectly, from the handling of the Loan Account and the
Collateral in a combined fashion since the successful operation of each Borrower
is dependent on the continued successful performance of the integrated group. To
induce the Lender Group to do so, and in consideration thereof, each Borrower
hereby jointly and severally agrees to indemnify each member of the Lender Group
and hold each member of the Lender Group harmless against any and all liability,
expense, loss or claim of damage or injury, made against the Lender Group by any
Borrower or by any third party whosoever, arising from or incurred by reason of
(a) the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral of Borrowers as herein
provided, (b) the Lender Group's relying on any instructions of the
Administrative Borrower, or (c) any other action taken by the Lender Group
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, except that Borrowers will have no
liability to the relevant Agent-Related Person or Lender-Related Person under
this Section 17.9 with respect to any liability that has been finally determined
     ------------
by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted solely from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent-Related Person or Lender-Related
Person, as the case may be.
