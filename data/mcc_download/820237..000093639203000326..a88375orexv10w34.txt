       the variance. Also refer to the requirements of the Limitation of Funds
       and Limitation of Cost Clauses in the contract."

4)     ARTICLE C.1. STATEMENT OF WORK, PHASE I: Preclinical Studies/Test
       Refinement, paragraph 1., subparagraphs a. and b. are revised to read as
       follows:

       PHASE I: Preclinical Studies/Test Refinement

       I.      Refine a procedure for screening of organ donors for blood-borne
               viruses. The contractor must:

               "a.   Demonstrate that the organ donor assay detects minimal
                     amounts of viral nucleic acids (RNA and/or other viral
                     nucleic acids that appear at the same time or before the
                     earliest appearance of viral RNA circulating in plasma)
                     specific for HIV-1, HCV, HBV, and West Nile Virus (WNV). If
                     specimens other than blood are to be used, determine the
                     best tissue to use as a test material source.

               b.    Have and describe plans to develop an amplification and
                     detection system that will identify the presence of West
                     Nile Virus nucleic acid. Due to the urgent need to develop
                     this system, the testing method proposed will be in a
                     single assay format.

                     Have and describe plans to adapt the test methods to a
                     multiplexing format that will detect multiple blood-borne
                     viruses (two or more viruses) in the same test. The three
                     highest priority viruses to be detected are HIV-1, [HVC,
                     and HBV. The testing method(s) proposed must be able to
                     detect each of these viruses, in multiplexing format. If
                     additional viruses are included in the test system (e.g.,
                     HIV-2, etc.), they are also to be incorporated into a
                     multiplex format."
