<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement and Release (hereafter "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between Thomas G. Boren and PG&amp;E CORPORATION (hereafter, PG&amp;E) (collectively
referred to as "the parties") and sets forth the terms and conditions of Mr.&nbsp;Boren's separation from PG&amp;E CORPORATION and the PG&amp;E NATIONAL ENERGY GROUP,&nbsp;INC. (hereinafter, NEG). </FONT></P>

<DL compact>
<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>1.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Mr.&nbsp;Boren
shall voluntarily resign from his positions as President and Chief Executive Officer of NEG and as an officer and/or director of any and all subsidiary, parent and
affiliate companies of NEG, effective close of business November&nbsp;14, 2002. Mr.&nbsp;Boren shall voluntarily resign from his employment with NEG and any and all subsidiary, parent and
affiliate companies of NEG, effective close of business December&nbsp;1, 2002.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>2.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>In
lieu of any lump sum severance benefit to which Mr.&nbsp;Boren may be entitled pursuant to the PG&amp;E Corporation Officer Severance Policy, Mr.&nbsp;Boren has elected to purchase
additional age and additional service credit under his supplemental defined benefit executive retirement arrangement described in paragraph&nbsp;8 of his offer letter dated July&nbsp;21, 1999,
such that age and service under this arrangement and the comparable Southern Company arrangement equal age 55 and 41.655&nbsp;years, respectively.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>3.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>In
the event that employees in Mr.&nbsp;Boren's funding unit or subsidiary are eligible for a payment under the PG&amp;E's Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) for the year in
which the resignation occurs, NEG will make a payment of the STIP that Mr.&nbsp;Boren would have received, pro-rated to reflect the number of months from the beginning of the year to the
date of resignation. The STIP payment, if any, will be made at such time as STIP payments are made to employees in Mr.&nbsp;Boren's funding unit or subsidiary. The Chief Executive Officer of PG&amp;E
shall have the sole discretion to determine the amount of STIP payment, consistent with the program guidelines for the year in which the resignation occurs.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>4.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Any

<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>5.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Mr.&nbsp;Boren
has been provided a private annuity and tax restoration benefit that provide him in the aggregate a benefit equal to that accrued under Mr.&nbsp;Boren's supplemental
defined benefit executive retirement arrangement as of December&nbsp;31, 2001. Mr.&nbsp;Boren accrued additional age and service from December&nbsp;31, 2001 through December&nbsp;1, 2002 under
that arrangement. Consequently, from December&nbsp;1, 2002 through May&nbsp;31, 2004, so long as Mr.&nbsp;Boren is alive, he will be provided with a monthly amount equal to $51,152.83. Beginning
June&nbsp;1, 2004 and continuing as long as Mr.&nbsp;Boren is alive, he will be provided a reduced monthly amount of $38,247.50. The amounts in this paragraph&nbsp;5 will be modified consistent
with joint and survivor options which Mr.&nbsp;Boren will elect prior to the commencement of payments. Based on Mr.&nbsp;Boren's decision to elect a 100&nbsp;percent joint and survivor option,
the preceding amounts in this section will be adjusted to the following monthly amounts respectively: $48,216.92 and $36,498.92.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>6.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Mr.&nbsp;Boren
shall receive payments under the Senior Executive Retention Program equal to those he would have received pursuant to his February&nbsp;21, 2002 grant under the
Program had he remained employed through each payment date. Mr.&nbsp;Boren shall receive any such payments at the time other Program participants receive their payments.

the effective date of this Agreement as set forth in paragraph&nbsp;22 below, all unvested performance unit grants, stock option grants, and special incentive stock ownership
premiums provided to Mr.&nbsp;Boren under PG&amp;E Corporation's Performance Unit Plan, Stock Option Plan, and Executive Stock Ownership Program shall continue to vest, terminate, or be canceled as
