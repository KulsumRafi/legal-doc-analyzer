                    Description of OraSure Technologies, Inc.
                     2003 Self-Funding Annual Incentive Plan

On February 4, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to
implement the 2003 Self-Funding Annual Incentive Plan (the "Bonus Plan"). The
purpose of the Bonus Plan is to reward outstanding individual performance by
management with cash bonuses. All employees, except for sales employees (who are
covered by a separate commission plan) at the level of director and above, will
be eligible to participate in the Bonus Plan.

Pursuant to the Bonus Plan, cash bonuses may be paid out of a cash bonus pool to
be funded based on the Company's achievement of certain financial objectives
regarding revenues, net income, cash flow from operations and gross margin for
2003. If the Company achieves 100% of these financial targets, the bonus pool
would be funded in the amount of $900,000.

Payments from the bonus pool will depend on an employee's achievement of
individual performance objectives. Bonus payments will be based on the target
payouts set forth below, which are expressed as a percentage of base salary. No
individual participating in the Bonus Plan can receive a bonus greater than 150%
of his or her target amount, and the aggregate of all bonuses cannot exceed the
funded amount of the bonus pool.

</TABLE>

Performance criteria for individual employees will be derived from the Company's
2003 corporate objectives concerning financial performance, strategic planning,
research and development, business development, regulatory affairs and quality
control, manufacturing, engineering, information systems, sales and marketing,
human resources, investor relations matters and/or such other objectives chosen
by the Board or Compensation Committee in their sole discretion. Awards are
expected to reflect a weighted average measurement of an employee's achievement
of his or her individual performance objectives.

Employees must be employed by the Company as of December 31, 2003 and at the
time of the bonus award in order to participate in the Bonus Plan, and awards
will be adjusted on a pro rata basis to the extent any employee is employed for
only a portion of the year 2003. The Chief Executive Officer will recommend
individual awards for all participating employees (except for the Chief
Executive Officer) for approval by the Compensation Committee of the Board based
on an assessment of each individual's performance against his or her applicable
performance objectives. The Compensation Committee may approve or disapprove any
recommended bonus award in whole or in part in its sole discretion. The
Compensation Committee shall recommend for Board approval any bonus award for
the Chief Executive Officer based on an assessment of his performance against
his individual performance objectives. The Board may approve or disapprove any
recommended bonus award for the Chief Executive Officer in whole or in part in
its sole discretion.

The Compensation Committee and the Board shall have the right in their sole
discretion to reject any or all of the recommended bonus awards, even if the
bonus pool has been funded and any and all applicable performance criteria have
been satisfied, based on the business conditions of the Company at or
immediately after the end of 2003.
