4. Collection of Accounts.

         (a) Section 6.3(a) of the Loan Agreement shall be amended and restated
in its entirety to read as follows:

             "(a) Each Borrower shall establish and maintain, at its expense,
             blocked accounts or lockboxes and related blocked accounts (in
             either case, "Blocked Accounts"),


                                       7
<PAGE>


             as Administrative Agent may specify, with such banks as are
             reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent into which Borrowers
             shall promptly deposit and direct their respective account debtors
             to directly remit all payments on Accounts and all payments
             constituting proceeds of Inventory or other Collateral in the
             identical form in which such payments are made, whether by cash,
             check or other manner. The banks at which the Blocked Accounts are
             established shall enter into an agreement, in form and substance
             reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent, providing that all
             items received or deposited in the Blocked Accounts are the
             property of Administrative Agent, that the depository bank has no
             lien upon, or right to setoff against, the Blocked Accounts, the
             items received for deposit therein, or the funds from time to time
             on deposit therein and that with respect to the Blocked Accounts,
             the depository bank will wire, or otherwise transfer, in
             immediately available funds, on a daily basis, all funds received
             or deposited into such Blocked Accounts to such bank account of
             Administrative Agent as Administrative Agent may from time to time
             designate for such purpose ("Payment Account"); provided, however,
             that so long as the Excess Availability of Borrowers is equal to at
             least the greater of (i) fifteen percent (15%) of Borrowing Base or
             (ii) $15,000,000, and no Event of Default has occurred and is
             continuing, such funds will not be transferred to the Payment
             Account and the Borrower owning any such funds will be entitled to
             withdraw those funds from the Blocked Accounts for its own account.
             Each Borrower agrees that if the Excess Availability of Borrowers
             is less than the greater of (i) fifteen percent (15%) of Borrowing
             Base or (ii) $15,000,000, or an Event of Default has occurred and
             is continuing, then all payments made to such Blocked Accounts or
             other funds received and collected by Administrative Agent or any
             Lender, whether in respect of the Accounts, as proceeds of
             Inventory or other Collateral or otherwise shall be treated as
             payments to Administrative Agent and Lenders in respect of the
             Obligations and therefore shall constitute the property of
             Administrative Agent and Lenders to the extent of the then
             outstanding Obligations."

         (b) Section 6.3(c) of the Loan Agreement shall be amended and restated
in its entirety to read as follows:

             "(c) If the Excess Availability of Borrowers is less than the
             greater of (i) fifteen percent (15%) of Borrowing Base or (ii)
             $15,000,000, or if an Event of Default has occurred and is
             continuing (and without limiting Administrative Agent's and
             Lenders' other rights and remedies on account of such Event of
             Default), each Borrower and all of its directors, employees,
             agents, Subsidiaries and other Affiliates shall, acting as trustee
             for Administrative Agent and Lenders, receive, as the property of
             Administrative Agent and Lenders, any monies, checks, notes, drafts
             or any other payment relating to and/or proceeds of Collateral
             which come into their possession or under their control and
             immediately upon receipt thereof, shall deposit or cause the same
             to be deposited in the Blocked Accounts, or remit the same or cause
             the same to be remitted, in kind, to Administrative Agent and in no
             event shall the same be commingled with a Borrower's own funds.
             Each Borrower agrees to reimburse Administrative Agent and Lenders
             on demand for


                                       8
<PAGE>


             any amounts owed or paid to any bank at which a Blocked Account is
             established or any other bank or person involved in the transfer of
             funds to or from the Blocked Accounts arising out of Administrative
             Agent or any Lender's payments to or indemnification of such bank
             or person in connection with such Blocked Account or any amounts
             received therein or transferred therefrom in accordance with any
             Blocked Account Agreement. The obligation of Borrowers to reimburse
             Administrative Agent and Lenders for such amounts pursuant to this
             Section 6.3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement."

5. Collateral Reporting. Section 7.1(a)(i) of the Loan Agreement shall be
amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

                  "(i) (A) twice a month, as Administrative Agent may reasonably
                  request, a schedule of sales made, credits issued and cash
                  received for the immediately preceding period, and (B) once a
                  month, on or before the tenth (10th) Business Day of the month
                  (or more frequently as Administrative Agent may reasonably
                  request, but not to exceed twice a month), a schedule of
                  Inventory (separately showing Inventory covered by
                  non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase orders and "end of
                  life" Inventory, and the sales of such Inventory); provided
                  that the schedules referenced in clauses (A) and (B) above
                  will be provided on a weekly basis or more frequently as
                  Administrative Agent may request if either (1) an Event of
                  Default has occurred and is continuing, or (2) the Excess
                  Availability is less than the greater of (y) fifteen percent
                  (15%) of the Borrowing Base or (z) $15,000,000;"

6. Inventory Covenants. Clauses (d) and (e) of Section 7.3 of the Loan Agreement
shall be amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

             "(d) Borrowers shall, at their expense, on a semi-annual basis, (or
             upon an Event of Default or if Borrowers' Excess Availability is
             less than the greater of (i) fifteen percent (15%) of the Borrowing
             Base or (ii) $15,000,000, once every two months or at such other
             time or times as Administrative Agent may request) deliver or cause
             to be delivered to Administrative Agent full written reports or
             appraisals as to the Inventory in form, scope and methodology
             reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent and by an appraiser
             reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent, addressed to
             Administrative Agent and Lenders, and upon which Administrative
             Agent and Lenders are expressly permitted to rely, which appraisals
             shall employ the same methodology as in prior appraisals unless the
             appraiser justifies to Administrative Agent, in its sole
             discretion, the need to employ a different methodology; provided
             that Administrative Agent will make reasonable efforts to discuss
             any proposed change in methodology with Borrower Agent prior to its
             implementation, provided, further, that the failure to discuss such
             proposed change shall not invalidate such appraisal or limit the
             rights of Administrative Agent and Lenders to rely on such
             appraisal; (e) Borrowers shall, at their expense, on a semi-annual
             basis, (or upon an Event of Default or if Borrowers' Excess
             Availability is less than the greater of (i) fifteen percent (15%)
             of the Borrowing Base or (ii) $15,000,000, once every two months or
             at such


                                       9

             other time or times as Administrative Agent may request) deliver or
             cause to be delivered to Administrative Agent written desktop
             appraisals as to Inventory (by product code as determined by the
             appraiser) in form, scope and methodology acceptable to
             Administrative Agent and by an appraiser reasonably acceptable to
             Administrative Agent, addressed to Administrative Agent and
             Lenders, and upon which Administrative Agent and Lenders are
             expressly permitted to rely, which appraisals shall employ the same
             methodology as in prior appraisals unless the appraiser justifies
             to Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, the need to employ
             a different methodology; provided that Administrative Agent will
             make reasonable efforts to discuss any proposed change in
             methodology with Borrower Agent prior to its implementation;
             provided, further, that the failure to discuss such proposed change
             shall not invalidate such desktop appraisal or limit the rights of
             Administrative Agent and Lenders to rely on such desktop appraisal;
             provided, further, that the appraisals of Inventory as set forth
             herein and in clause (d) above shall be provided on an alternating
             basis, unless otherwise requested by Administrative Agent;"

             into Persons other than Borrowers in an amount not to exceed in the
             aggregate, at any one time, fifty percent (50%) of the net proceeds
             received from the sale of Capital Stock made pursuant to Section
             9.7(b)(iv) hereof, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and

                                       10
<PAGE>


                  "(a) This Agreement and the other Financing Agreements shall
                  become effective as of the date set forth on the first page
                  hereof and shall continue in full force and effect for a term
                  ending on the Final Maturity Date, unless sooner terminated
                  pursuant to the terms hereof. Upon the effective date of
                  termination of this Agreement and the Financing Agreements,
                  Borrowers and Guarantor shall pay to Administrative Agent, for
                  the ratable benefit of Lenders, in full, all outstanding and
                  unpaid Obligations and shall furnish cash collateral to
                  Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of Lenders (or
                  at Administrative Agent's option, a letter of credit issued to
                  Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders and at
                  Borrowers' expense, in form and substance satisfactory to
                  Administrative Agent, by an issuer acceptable to
                  Administrative Agent and payable to Administrative Agent as
                  beneficiary, for the ratable benefit of Lenders), in such
                  amounts as Administrative Agent determines in good faith are
                  reasonably necessary to secure Administrative Agent and
                  Lenders from loss, cost, damage or expense, including
                  reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses, in connection
                  with any contingent Obligations, including issued and
                  outstanding Letter of Credit Accommodations and checks or
                  other payments provisionally credited to the Obligations
                  and/or as to which Administrative Agent and Lenders have not
                  yet received final and indefeasible payment. Such payments in
                  respect of the Obligations and cash collateral shall be
                  remitted by wire transfer in Federal funds to such bank
                  account of Administrative Agent, as Administrative Agent may,
                  in its discretion, designate in writing to Borrower Agent for
                  such purpose. Interest shall be due until and including the
                  next Business Day, if the amounts so paid by Borrowers to the
                  bank account designated by Administrative Agent are received
                  in such bank account later than 10:30 a.m. California time."

the following:

    (a) Counterparts of this First Amendment, executed by each of the parties
    hereto;

representations and warranties to Lenders and Administrative Agent, which shall
