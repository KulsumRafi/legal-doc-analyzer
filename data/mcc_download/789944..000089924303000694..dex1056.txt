Agreement in which event Enprani shall reimburse Senetek for the reasonable
costs of inspection. Senetek shall not conduct such inspections more than once

inspection and the following quarter, Senetek may conduct such inspections as it

month missing. The Minimum Sales Requirement may be met with any combination of
Units (including line extensions and/or additional formulations) sold by Enprani
pursuant to this Agreement. In the event Enprani fails to meet the Minimum
Purchase Requirement, Senetek's sole remedy shall be termination of the
Exclusivity Right as per Section 7.2. below.

twelve (12) month forecast of its anticipated sales of Products under this

infringement prior to the date of Senetek's indemnification undertaking, Senetek
may at its sole election either (a) obtain such rights at its expense as are
necessary to avoid such infringement, or (b) substitute non-infringing
technology of substantially equivalent functionality or (c) terminate this
Agreement upon written notice to Enprani and in the case of this clause (c), if
Enprani elects by written notice to Senetek to re-sell to Senetek its inventory
of Products, payment to Enprani of an amount equal to Enprani's actual direct
production cost of any number of up to six months sales (measured according to
the preceding six months sales) of Units held in inventory by Enprani.

          8.3 Insurance. Enprani shall maintain at its expense commercial
insurance as the solely responsible party for product liability coverage in
accordance with the relevant laws of Korea. Within thirty (30) days after the
date of this Agreement, Enprani shall furnish to Senetek certificates evidencing
its insurance, Senetek's designation as an additional insured, and such notice
requirement. Senetek may elect to suspend its performance under this Agreement
until any insurance required to be maintained by Enprani is in place and such
certificates of coverage are provided, and may thereafter suspend its
performance if it reasonably believes such insurance is not in place until
Enprani provides Senetek reasonable assurance that such coverage is in place
without any gap in coverage during the Term and will be maintained as required
by this Agreement.

          As promptly as practicable, and in any event within 180 days of the
date hereof, Senetek shall obtain at its expense commercial insurance for patent
related defense and damages expenses in amounts reasonable in relation to the
projected volume of sales of the Products by Enprani and such policy shall name
Enprani as an additional insured. Within 180 days after the date of this
Agreement, Senetek shall furnish to Enprani certificates evidencing its
insurance, Enprani's designation as an additional insured, and such notice
requirement. Enprani may elect to suspend its performance under this Agreement
until any insurance required to be maintained by Senetek is in place and such
certificates of coverage are provided, and may thereafter suspend its
performance if it reasonably believes such insurance is not in place until
Senetek provides Enprani reasonable assurance that such coverage is in place
without any gap in coverage during the Term and will be maintained as required
by this Agreement.

          8.4 No Consequential Damages. Neither party shall be liable to the
other for consequential damages, lost profits, injury to reputation or similar
claims, except for (a) claims that include consequential damages paid to
entities that are not Affiliates of an indemnified party or (b) consequential
damages incurred by Senetek as a result of Enprani selling Product outside of
the Market; Provided that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to limit
in any way Enprani's obligation to pay the royalties and other amounts due to
Senetek under this Agreement. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL SENETEK OR ITS
AFFILIATES HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT IN EXCESS OF THE
HIGHEST AGGREGATE AMOUNT PAID AS ROYALTIES OVER THE COURSE OF ANY THREE
CONSECUTIVE CONTRACT YEARS. Each party acknowledges and agrees that, but for the
limitations of liability set forth in this Section, the other party would not
have entered into this Agreement upon the terms set forth herein and that such
limitations are a material part of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, in the case where damages are incurred by Enprani as a
result of negligence or defect in the Patent or any other Intellectual Property
provided by Senetek, Senetek shall only be fully liable and compensate Enprani
for all direct damages.

          8.5 Recalls. In the event any Product(s) must be recalled from
distribution by reason of failure to meet any requirements of law or otherwise
(except as provided below), Enprani shall have the sole responsibility to effect
the recall and shall bear all expenses in connection therewith. Senetek shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Enprani in
implementing any such recalls to the extent such cooperation is necessary to
effect the recall. Senetek shall be entitled to indemnification by Enprani for
the expense of such cooperation as set forth in Section 8.5. In the event recall
is solely the result of ingredients supplied by Senetek or its supply
subcontractors (other than Enprani or its supply subcontractors), Senetek shall
bear all such expenses.

          8.6 Survival of Obligations. Each party's obligations under this
Article VIII shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

          8.7 Limitation of Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, in no event shall any party be liable to the other party or
any third party for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages
under any causes of any action, even if such party has been advised of the
possibility of such damages; provided that the liability limitation contained in
this Section 8.7 shall not apply to the parties' obligation to indemnify each
other against third party Claims pursuant to Sections 8.1 and 8.2.

                                   ARTICLE IX

          9.2 Non-disclosure of Senetek Confidential Information. With respect

to any person or entity (except to its employees and agents who reasonably
require the same for the purpose hereof and who are bound to Enprani by the same

                                       10

obligations as to confidentiality), or (c) disclose Senetek Confidential
Information to any person or entity that competes with Senetek, unless such
disclosure is required by a governmental authority or by order of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

          9.3 Misuse of Enprani Confidential Information Prohibited. The parties
shall not misuse any information (including market and competitors' information)
obtained or acquired from each other during the Term of this Agreement, whether
they are indicated confidential or not.

          9.4 No Implied License. The furnishing of confidential information by
one party to the other shall not constitute any grant, option or license to the
other under any patent or other rights now or hereafter held by the furnishing
party.

          9.5 Survival. The provisions of this Article IX shall survive
termination of this Agreement and continue for a period five (5) years.

this Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of
Switzerland (without application of conflict of laws principles thereof).

          10.2 Assignment. The parties may not assign this Agreement or any

address as may be specified from time to time in a written notice to the other
party.

          10.6 Headings for Convenience. Section and article headings are
provided for convenience of the parties only and shall not be construed as a
part of this Agreement or a limitation on the scope of the particular sections
and articles to which they refer.

          10.7 Partial Invalidity. If any term or provision of this Agreement or
any application thereof shall be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this

          10.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which
together shall constitute a single instrument.

          10.9 No Joint Venture. It is not the intent of the parties hereto to
form any partnership or joint venture. Each party shall, in relation to its
obligations hereunder, act as an independent contractor, and nothing in this

for, bind or commit the other.

          10.10 Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration. Senetek and Enprani
agree to binding arbitration of any and all disputes or claims arising out of or
relating to this Agreement. Any arbitration shall be conducted in Switzerland,
unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. Each and any arbitration
shall be administered by a panel of three members under the auspices of the
International Chamber of Commerce in accordance with ICC's Rules on Conciliation
and Arbitration, as may be amended from time to time. All proceedings shall be
conducted in the English language. The decision or award of the panel shall be
final, binding and incontestable and may be used as a basis for judgment thereon
by any court of competent jurisdiction. Accordingly, there shall be no appeal to
any court or other authority from the decision of the arbitration panel, and the
parties shall not dispute nor question the validity of such decision or award
before any regulatory or other authority in any jurisdiction where enforcement
action is taken by the party in whose favor the decision or award is rendered,
except in the case of fraud.

          10.11 Exceptions to Binding Arbitration. Notwithstanding Section
10.10, (i) Senetek shall have the right to seek injunctive relief from any court
of competent jurisdiction in order to prevent immediate and irreparable injury,
loss, or damage, including, without limitation, in the event of termination of
this Agreement under Section 7.3 for the nonpayment of royalties, (ii) any and
all issues regarding the scope, construction, validity and enforceability of one
or more patents shall be determined in a court of competent jurisdiction under
the local patent laws of the jurisdictions having issued the patent or patents
in question, and (iii) ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS CONTEMPLATED UNDER THIS
SECTION 10.11 SHALL BE LITIGATED IN COURTS HAVING SITUS WITHIN SWITZERLAND. THE
PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT AND SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY COURTS LOCATED
WITHIN SWITZERLAND, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT
MAY HAVE BASED UPON LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION, IMPROPER VENUE OR FORUM NON
CONVENIENS.

          10.12 Attorney's Fees and Costs. In the event of any dispute

entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

          10.13. Force Majeure. The performance or observance by either party of
any obligations of such party under this Agreement may be suspended by it, in
whole or in part and without liability, to the extent (and only to the extent)
any of the following prevents such performance or observance: (a) Act of God,
war, riot, uprising, fire, explosion, accident, flood, sabotage, lockout or
injunction, (b) national defense requirement; (e) compliance with governmental
laws, regulations, rules, orders or actions; or (f) any other cause (whether
similar or dissimilar) beyond the reasonable control of such party; provided,
however, that the party so prevented from complying with its obligations (i) has
taken commercially reasonable steps to avoid the effects of such Force Majeure
event and (ii) shall immediately notify in writing the other party thereof and
