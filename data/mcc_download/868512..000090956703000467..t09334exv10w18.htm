(the &#147;<B>Participant</B>&#148;) as of November&nbsp;30,
2001, (the &#147;<B>Agreement Date</B>&#148;) and contemplates
the grant of a participation interest to the Hollinger
Participation Trust, for the benefit of the Note Holders (as

statements contained in the Offering Circular except as set out
in sections&nbsp;2.19 and 2.20 and subject to the qualifications
in respect to those sections set out below, on the basis of the
foregoing, no facts have come to our attention that cause us to
believe that the Offering Circular, as of its date and as of the
date of this opinion letter, (i)&nbsp;does not accurately
describe the Notes Transaction and (ii)&nbsp;contained or
contains an untrue statement of a material fact regarding the
Notes Transaction or omitted or omits to state a material fact
regarding the Notes Transaction required to be stated in the
Offering Circular or necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

<FONT size="2">2.19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
descriptions in the Offering Circular of contracts and other
documents are accurate in all material respects.

<FONT size="2">2.20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disclosure
contained in the Offering Circular under the heading
&#147;Certain Income Tax Considerations&#148; is a fair summary
in all material respects of the applicable United States and
Canadian federal income tax consequences of an investment in the
Offered Notes. The descriptions in the Offering Circular of
statutes (other than the disclosure contained under the heading
&#147;Certain Income Tax Considerations&#148;), is, to the
extent it discusses matters of law in the United States and
Canada, a fair summary of that law in all material respects.

<FONT size="2">The foregoing opinions are subject to the
following qualifications:
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
enforceability of each of the Agreements to which Hollinger or
the Trust is a party is subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, arrangement, winding-up, moratorium and other
similar laws of general application affecting the enforcement of
creditors&#146; rights generally.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
enforceability of each of the Agreements to which Hollinger or
the Trust is a party is subject to general equitable principles,
including the fact that the availability of equitable remedies,
such as injunctive relief and specific performance, is in the
discretion of a court.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opinion on
section&nbsp;2.9 insofar as it relates to the Transaction
Agreement is subject to the provisions of the <I>Bulk Sales Act
</I>(Ontario) which state that if the terms of that Act have not
been complied with, an action or proceeding may be brought or
taken by a creditor or by the trustee in bankruptcy of a vendor
to have the sale set aside or declared void, in which event the
purchaser may be personally liable to account to the creditors
of the vendor.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We express no
opinion as to the enforceability of any provision of any
Agreement which states that amendments or waivers of or with
respect to that Agreement that are not in writing will not be
effective.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions
contained in an Agreement which purport to sever from that
Agreement any provision which is prohibited or unenforceable
under applicable law without affecting the enforceability or
validity of the remainder of that Agreement may be enforced only
in the discretion of a court.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">3.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We express no
opinion as to the enforceability of any provision of an
Agreement which requires Hollinger or the Trust to pay, or to
indemnify another party for, the costs and expenses of that
other party in connection with judicial proceedings, since those
provisions may derogate from a court&#146;s discretion to
determine by whom and to what extent those costs should be paid.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">3.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
enforceability of the indemnity and contribution provisions
contained in the Purchase Agreement may be limited by applicable
law or principles of public policy.

<FONT size="2">3.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We express no
opinion as to the enforceability of paragraph&nbsp;(2) of the
second sentence of section&nbsp;11.1 of the Participation
Agreement, which may be characterized by a court as an
unenforceable penalty and not as a genuine pre-estimate of
damage.

<FONT size="2">3.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have relied
solely upon the certificate referred to in section&nbsp;1.5.7
