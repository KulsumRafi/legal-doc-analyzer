<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Tax and Insurance Escrows</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the terms and conditions of subsection&nbsp;2(d) below, Mortgagor shall pay to Mortgagee, in addition to the monthly payments under the Note and concurrently therewith in a single payment monthly until the Note is fully paid, a sum equal to annual real estate taxes, general and special assessments and premiums for insurance required hereunder (all as estimated by Mortgagee) less all sums previously paid therefor, divided by the number of full calendar months to elapse before the date which is one (1) month prior to the date when such taxes and assessments and insurance premiums will become due.

If the Premises or any other part of the Mortgaged Property is purchased by Mortgagee at foreclosure sale or is otherwise acquired by Mortgagee after an Event of Default, the remaining balance, if any, of the funds deposited with Mortgagee pursuant to subsection&nbsp;2(a) above shall continue to be applied, subject to the security interest hereunder, first to Mortgagee's unreimbursed costs and expenses in such purchase or acquisition, then to reduce the indebtedness secured by this Mortgage, and the balance, if any, shall be paid to Mortgagor, subject to the order of the court having jurisdiction in any such proceeding.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mortgagee hereby waives the requirement for deposit by Mortgagor of the sums described in subsection&nbsp;2(a) above, for so long as (i)&nbsp;there is no default beyond all applicable cure periods in the obligations of Mortgagor or any other person under this Mortgage or any of the  Loan Documents, and no event which, with the giving of notice, passage of time or both, would constitute such a default, and (ii) Mortgagor delivers to Mortgagee, no later than five (5) days prior to the last day for payment of such sums without penalty or interest, evidence satisfactory to Mortgagee in Mortgagee's sole and absolute discretion, that all sums described in subsection&nbsp;2(a) above have been paid in full or otherwise within five (5) business days of written request from Mortgagee evidences of timely payment.  Upon failure of either of the foregoing conditions, the waiver set forth in this subsection&nbsp;2(d) shall immediately and automatically become null and void, without notice from Mortgagee to Mortgagor.</P>

</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mortgagor shall deliver renewal certificates of all insurance required above, together with written evidence of full payment of the annual premiums therefor at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the existing insurance.  Any such insurance may be provided under so-called "blanket" policies, so long as the amounts and coverages thereunder will, in Mortgagee's sole judgment, provide protection equivalent to that provided under a single policy meeting the requirements hereinabove.  All policies of insurance shall be issued by a financially sound and generally recognized insurer lawfully doing business in New York and acceptable to Mortgagee having an A.M. Best Company rating of A-VIII or better.  If at any time, Mortgagee is not in receipt of written evidence that all insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Mortgagee shall have the right with reasonable notice to Mortgagor to take such action as Mortgagee deems necessary to protect its interest in the Mortgaged Property, including without limitation, the obtaining of such insurance coverage as Mortgagee in Mortgagee's sole discretion deems appropriate, and all expenses incurred by Mortgagee in connection with such action or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by Mortgagor to Mortgagee upon demand.</P>

Mortgagee may appear in any such proceedings and negotiations and Agency and Mortgagor shall promptly deliver to Mortgagee copies of all notices and pleadings in any such proceedings.  Agency and Mortgagor will in good faith, file and prosecute all claims necessary for any award or payment resulting from such damage or destruction.  All costs and expenses incurred by Mortgagee in exercising its rights under this section shall constitute indebtedness secured by this Mortgage.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Application of Insurance Proceeds</U>.  Upon occurrence of any loss or damage to all or any portion of the Mortgaged Property resulting from fire, vandalism, malicious mischief or any other casualty or physical harm (a "Casualty"), Mortgagee may elect subject to the provisions set forth below to collect, retain and apply as a Loan prepayment all proceeds (the "Proceeds") of any insurance policies collected or claimed as a result of such Casualty after deduction of all expenses of collection and settlement, including attorney's and adjusters' fees and charges.  Agency and Mortgagor hereby authorize Mortgagee, at Mortgagee's option, to collect, adjust and compromise any losses under any insurance with respect to the Mortgaged Property which is kept, or caused to be kept, by Agency and Mortgagor, and hereby irrevocably appoints Mortgagee as its attorney-in-fact, coupled with an interest, for such purposes.  Any Proceeds remaining after payment in full of the Loan and all other sums due Mortgagee hereunder shall be paid by Mortgagee to Mortgagor without any allowance for interest thereon.  All Proceeds applied in reduction of the indebtedness secured by this Mortgage shall be without imposition of any prepayment premium.  The foregoing notwithstanding, Mortgagor shall be entitled to settle and collect all Proceeds from any casualty of $250,000 or less provided that (i) there is no Event of Default under the Mortgage or the Loan Documents, (ii) Mortgagor uses such Proceeds for restoration in accordance with the Mortgagee's customary construction loan practices and requirements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event such Proceeds as applied above, would not fully discharge the Loan, then Mortgagor shall deposit with Mortgagee cash, letters of credit, surety bonds or equivalent assurances of the availability of funds with which to pay for the restoration or rebuilding of the Mortgaged Property.  Such letters of credit, surety bonds or equivalent assurances shall in all respects  be in form, substance, execution and sufficiency acceptable to Mortgagee.  Mortgagor shall promptly proceed with restoration of the Mortgaged Property resulting from any such Casualty.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Mortgagee shall receive and retain insurance proceeds, the lien of this Mortgage shall be reduced only by the amount thereof received and retained by Mortgagee and actually applied by Mortgagee in reduction of the Loan.  The provisions of subsection 4 of section 254 of the Real Property Law of New York covering the insurance of buildings against loss by fire shall not apply to this Mortgage.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, if there is no Event of Default and provided that Mortgagor provides evidence satisfactory to Mortgagee showing that Mortgagor and the Mortgaged Property will be financially viable following repair or replacement, the Mortgagor may repair or replace the Mortgaged Property with the replacement or repair to be conducted, and the proceeds of the insurance to be disbursed, in accordance with the Mortgagee's customary construction loan practices and requirements.</P>

Any Improvements or any of the Collateral which are demolished or destroyed in whole or in part shall be replaced promptly by similar Improvements and articles of personal property of comparable quality, condition and value as those demolished or destroyed, thereupon becoming part of the Mortgaged Property free from any other lien or security interest or encumbrance on or reservation of title to such property.  Mortgagor shall not permit, commit or suffer any waste, impairment or deterioration of the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof and shall keep and maintain (or cause to be kept and maintained) the same in good repair and condition.

Mortgagor will deliver to Mortgagee within ten (10) days after receipt thereof any additional permits or renewals, issued and approved or disapproved with respect to the Mortgaged Property.  Mortgagor hereby indemnifies Mortgagee and its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and partners and their respective heirs, successors and assigns (collectively, "Indemnified Parties") and agrees to defend and hold the Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, loss, cost, damage, liability or expense incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Parties arising from any failure of the Mortgaged Property to comply with Laws, or from any failure of Mortgagor to obtain, maintain or renew, or to have obtained, maintained or renewed, any permit or approval required with respect to the Mortgaged Property.  The foregoing indemnification and agreement shall survive the release of this Mortgage and the payment or other satisfaction of the indebtedness secured hereby.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon any default by the Mortgagor in satisfying its obligations under this paragraph 5 after thirty (30) days notice from Mortgagee, Mortgagee at its option may put the Mortgaged Property into reasonable condition and repair, and all sums paid by Mortgagee for such purpose purposes shall, together with interest thereon, be added to the amount secured hereunder and be payable on demand.  Mortgagor will not, without obtaining the prior written consent of the Mortgagee, initiate, join in or consent to any private restrictive covenant, zoning ordinance, or other public or private restrictions, limiting or defining the uses that may be made of the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Non-Waiver</U>.&nbsp; The failure of Mortgagee to insist upon strict performance of any term of this Mortgage shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any term of this Mortgage.&nbsp; Mortgagor shall not be relieved of Mortgagor's obligation to pay the Debt at the time and in the manner required by reason of (a) failure of Mortgagee to comply with any request of Mortgagor to take any action to foreclose this Mortgage or otherwise enforce any of the provisions hereof or of the Note, this Mortgage or any other  Loan Documents, (b) the release, regardless of consideration, of the whole or any part of the Mortgaged Property or any other security for the Debt, or (c) any agreement or stipulation between Mortgagee and any subsequent owner or owners of the Mortgaged Property or other person extending the time of payment or otherwise modifying or supplementing the Note, this Mortgage or any other Loan Documents, without first having obtained the consent of Mortgagor; and in the latter event, Mortgagor shall continue to be obligated to pay the Debt at the time and in the manner provided in the Note, this Mortgage or any other  Loan Documents, as so extended, modified and supplemented, unless expressly released and discharged by Mortgagee.&nbsp; Regardless of consideration, and without the necessity for any notice to or consent by the holder of any subordinate lien, encumbrance, right, title or interest in or to the Mortgaged Property, Mortgagee may release any person at any time liable for the payment of the Debt or any portion thereof or any part of the security held for the Debt and may extend the time of payment or otherwise modify the terms of any instrument evidencing the Debt and/or this Mortgage, including, without limitation, a modification of the interest rate payable on the principal balance on the Note without in any manner impairing or affecting this Mortgage or the lien thereof or the priority of this Mortgage, as so extended and modified, as security for the Debt over any such subordinate lien, encumbrance, right, title or interest.&nbsp; Mortgagee may resort for the payment of the Debt to any of the other  Loan Documents in such order and manner as Mortgagee, in its discretion, may elect.&nbsp; Mortgagor's obligations shall not be impaired or altered by the taking of any other or additional security for or guarantee of the Debt or any part thereof, or by the failure to hold, protect, or realize upon any other additional security or guarantee, or by the release of same.  Mortgagee may take action to recover the Debt, or any portion thereof, or to enforce any covenant hereof without prejudice to the right of Mortgagee thereafter to foreclose this Mortgage.&nbsp; Mortgagee shall not be limited exclusively to the rights and remedies herein stated but shall be entitled to every additional right and remedy now or hereafter afforded by law.&nbsp; The rights of Mortgagee under this Mortgage shall be separate, distinct and cumulative and none shall be given effect to the exclusion of the others.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Waiver</U>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Marshalling of Assets</U>.  Agency or Mortgagor hereby waive for themselves and, to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law, for any subsequent lienor, any right to apply for an order, decree, judgment, or ruling requiring or providing for a marshalling of assets which would require Mortgagee to proceed against certain of the Mortgaged Property before proceeding against any of the other Mortgaged Property.  Mortgagee shall have the right to proceed, in its sole discretion, against the Mortgaged Property in such order and in such portions as Mortgagee may determine, without regard to the adequacy of value or other liens on any such Mortgaged Property.  No such action shall in any way be considered as a waiver of any of the rights, benefits, liens or security interests created hereby or by any of the Loan Documents.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Subrogation</U>.  If the indebtedness hereby secured or any part thereof, including any amounts advanced by Mortgagee, are used directly or indirectly to pay off, discharge or satisfy, in whole or in part, any prior lien or encumbrance upon the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof, then Mortgagee shall be subrogated to such other liens or encumbrances and to any additional security held by the holder thereof and shall have the benefit of the priority of all of the same, whether or not any such lien, encumbrance or additional security is canceled of record upon such payment or advancement or otherwise, and in addition to the security afforded by this Mortgage and the other Loan Documents.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Sale or Transfer</U>.

If any of the foregoing shall occur without Mortgagee's prior written consent, then the same shall conclusively be deemed to increase the risk to Mortgagee and immediately constitute an Event of Default hereunder.  The foregoing notwithstanding, without the consent of the Mortgagee the interest of the Agency may be transferred to the Mortgagor.</P>

All such costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, and any other moneys advanced by Mortgagee to protect the Mortgaged Property shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law, bear interest from the date of payment thereof at the Default Rate until repaid by Mortgagor, and shall be repaid by Mortgagor to Mortgagee immediately upon demand.  Notwithstanding that the indebtedness secured hereby shall not have been declared due and payable upon any Event of Default, Mortgagor hereby agrees that if an Event of Default has occurred, pursuant to the terms hereof, Mortgagee shall be entitled to receive interest thereon at the Default Rate, to be computed from the due date through actual receipt and collection of the amount then in default.  The preceding sentence shall not be construed as an agreement or privilege to extend the time for performance of any obligation under the Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents, nor as a waiver of any other right or remedy accruing to Mortgagee by reason of any such default.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Non-Waiver</U>.

No such merger shall occur unless and until all persons at the time having such concurrent interests shall join in a written instrument effecting such merger, and such instrument shall be duly recorded.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agree that if Agency and Mortgagor's rights in the Collateral are voluntarily or involuntarily transferred, whether by sale, creation of a security interest, attachment, levy, garnishment or other judicial process, without the prior written consent of Mortgagee, such transfer shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agree that upon or after the occurrence of any Event of Default, Mortgagee shall have all rights and remedies contemplated hereunder, including, without limitation, the right to take possession of the Collateral, and for this purpose Mortgagee shall have the right to enter upon any Premises on which any or all of the Collateral is situated without being deemed guilty of trespass and without liability for damages thereby occasioned, and take possession of and operate the Collateral or remove it therefrom.  Mortgagee shall have the further right, as Mortgagee may determine, to repair, refurbish or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale, lease or other use or disposition, and to sell at public or private sale or otherwise dispose of, lease or utilize the Collateral and any part thereof in any manner authorized or permitted by law and to apply the proceeds thereof toward payment of any costs and expenses incurred by Mortgagee including, to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, and toward payment of the indebtedness secured hereby, in such order and manner as Mortgagee may determine.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authorizes Mortgagee to file without the Mortgagor's signature, in the jurisdiction where this agreement will be given effect, financing statements covering the Collateral and the proceeds of the Collateral.
