Person who controls any such agent or underwriter and each other Holder and any Person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages,
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses and reasonable costs of investigation) or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer, control person, agent, underwriter
or other Holder may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in
respect thereof)
arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement of any material fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any
amendments or supplements thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, in each case to the extent that such untrue statement or omission was made in such registration statement, preliminary or final prospectus, or amendments or supplements thereto, in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such Holder in connection with such registration, provided that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section&nbsp;3.8(b)
shall not apply to amounts paid in settlements effected without the consent of such Holder (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any such director, officer, Holder, underwriter or control person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such
Holder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
Person seeking indemnification under this Section&nbsp;3.8 will (i)&nbsp;give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification, but the failure to give such notice will not affect the right to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure
and (ii)&nbsp;unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified and indemnifying parties with respect to such claim, permit such
indemnifying party, and other indemnifying parties similarly situated, jointly to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the parties. In the event that the
indemnifying parties cannot mutually agree as to the selection of counsel, each indemnifying party may retain separate counsel to act on its behalf and at its expense. The indemnified party shall in
all events be entitled to participate in such defense at its expense through its own counsel. If such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to
any liability for any settlement made without its consent (but such consent will not be unreasonably withheld). No indemnifying party will consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation. An
indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by
such indemnifying party with respect to such claim. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
for any reason the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to any party or insufficient to hold it harmless as and to the extent contemplated by the preceding
paragraphs of this Section&nbsp;3.8, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage expense or liability
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the applicable indemnified party, as the case may be, on the other hand,
and also the relative fault of the indemnifying party and any applicable indemnified party, as the case may be, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. </FONT></P>
