      C.    The parties desire to amend the Loan Agreement as set forth herein.

      NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the parties agree  as
follows:

      1.    The  definition  of  "Avicola"  contained  in Article 1 of the Loan

      de C.V., a sociedad an{o'}nima de capital variable duly  organized  under
      the  laws of Mexico, formerly known as Avicola Pilgrim's Pride de Mexico,
      S.A. de C.V."


      2.    Section  7.5(ii)  of the Loan Agreement shall be amended to add the
words  "or  Avicola"  immediately  after  the  words  "Operating  Company"  and
immediately before the word "fails" contained therein.


      3.    Bank acknowledges  that  Avicola  has  or  shall become the primary
importer  or  distributor  in  Mexico of poultry products exported  by  the  US
Guarantor (as defined in the Loan  Agreement)  in  Mexico  and  waives  and any

defined  in  the  Loan  Agreement)  shall  execute and deliver to Bank, in form
satisfactory to Bank, a certain amendment to  the  original  Contrato de Prenda
signed by the Operating Company in favor of Bank on or about September 7, 2001,
whereby Avicola shall pledge to Bank a first priority security  interest in the
Accounts  (as  defined  in  the Loan Agreement) of Avicola. The Credit  Parties
shall  cooperate  with Bank in  ensuring  that  such  amendment  is  filed  for
registration with the applicable governmental authorities.

      5.    Except  as  expressly  provided  in  this  Amendment,  the  parties
acknowledge  that  the  Loan Agreement is in full force and effect and Borrower
acknowledges that there are  no  defenses  or  setoffs  to  any  of  Borrower's
obligations under the Loan Agreement as of the date hereof.

      6.    Borrower certifies that no default or Event of Default (as  defined
in the Loan Agreement) has occurred and is continuing.

      7.    Borrower   and  Guarantors  (as  defined  in  the  Loan  Agreement)
represent and warrant that  each  of  its authority documents (as identified in
Section 4.2 and 4.3 of the Loan Agreement) delivered to Bank in connection with
the Loan Agreement, are in full force and  effect  and  have not been modified,
repealed or amended since the date thereof, other than to  change  the  name of
Avicola  Pilgrim's  Pride de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. to Comercializadora de Carnes
de Mexico, S.A. de C.V.

      8.    If any provision  of  this  Amendment  shall  be  held  invalid  or
unenforceable,  such  invalidity  or  unenforceability  shall  affect only such
provision and shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable
any other provision of this Amendment, and this Amendment shall  be enforced as
if any such invalid or unenforceable provision were not contained herein.

      9.    Except  as  specifically  amended hereby, the Loan Agreement  shall
remain  unchanged  and  shall  be  in full force  and  effect,  enforceable  in
accordance with its terms.
