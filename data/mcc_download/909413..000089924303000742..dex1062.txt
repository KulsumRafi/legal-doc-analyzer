reasonable basis to believe is true and accurate when given or made.

use their reasonable best efforts to cause Belleli or HCC Mantova to obtain such
Additional Financing from HCC Mantova or third parties unaffiliated with SJMB or
the Non-Mantova Hanover Entities ("Unaffiliated Third Parties").

benefit of Belleli or HCC Mantova by SJMB or the Non-Mantova Hanover Entities,
without the prior joint written consent of SJMB and HCHC; provided, however,

Scheduled Cash, a Scheduled Bond, or a Scheduled Letter of Credit, respectively,
for purposes of this Article VI, except that the effective date of such
Scheduled Cash, Scheduled Bond, or Scheduled Letter of Credit for purposes of
Section 6.4 shall be the date that such cash, bond, or letter of credit is

applies ("Scheduled Issuer"), shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
Belleli to replace as soon as practicable such Scheduled Bonds or Letters of
Credit with bonds, letters of credit or other alternative financing issued or
provided by HCC Mantova or Unaffiliated Third Parties.

               (b)    Belleli, HCHC, and SJMB or the Non-Mantova Hanover
Entities that have advanced such Scheduled Cash, whichever applies ("Scheduled
Advancer"), shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause Belleli to repay as
soon as practicable such Scheduled Cash; provided, however, that such repayment
shall not require a capital call or cause a working capital shortfall for
Belleli.

               6.4.   Interest Payments on Scheduled Letters of Credit and
Scheduled Cash. Commencing on the Effective Date and continuing until such
obligations have been paid, satisfied, replaced, released or terminated, Belleli
will pay to each Scheduled Issuer or Scheduled Advancer an amount equal to (i)
four percent (4%) per annum on the outstanding face amount of the Scheduled
Letter of Credit issued by such Scheduled Issuer, and (ii) twelve percent (12%)
per annum on any Scheduled Cash or draw on Scheduled Bonds or Letters of Credit
provided by a Scheduled Advancer.

               6.5.   Invoices and Payment. Each Scheduled Issuer or Scheduled
Advancer will send Belleli quarterly invoices in arrears for amounts due to any
Scheduled Issuer or Scheduled Advancer by Belleli. Belleli will pay in cash to
any such Scheduled Issuer or Scheduled Advancer all amounts due to such
Scheduled Issuer or Scheduled Advancer based upon the payment terms in such
invoices; provided, however, that such Scheduled Issuers or Scheduled Advancers
will not provide for payment terms, the effect of which would require any
additional capital call or the payment of which would cause a working capital
shortfall for Belleli.

Proposing Party is providing the Other Party with an enterprise valuation for
all of the equity interests in Belleli and HCC Mantova (the "Triggering
Valuation"). The notice shall be in writing and will include the amount of the

notice from the Proposing Party to give the Proposing Party notice that it will
either sell its equity interest in Belleli and HCC Mantova to the Proposing
Party for the Enterprise Valuation Purchase Price or it will acquire the
Proposing Party's equity interest in Belleli and HCC Mantova for the Enterprise
Valuation Purchase Price. The purchasing party shall have 45 days from the date
of receipt of notice of the election by the Other Party to pay the Enterprise
Valuation Purchase Price and satisfy the other terms of sale set forth in this
paragraph. In the event that the purchasing party fails to pay the Enterprise
Valuation Purchase Price and satisfy the other terms of sale within the 45 day
period the purchasing party shall not be entitled to present another Triggering
Valuation as a Proposing Party under this Article IX for 18 months.

               (c)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 9.1:

                           (i)     Belleli shall provide to SJMB and HCHC within
                      sixty (60) days following the end of each quarter in the
                      calendar year (beginning on November 29, 2002), Belleli's
                      EBITDA, as determined by Arthur Andersen, for the period
                      commencing on January 1, 2002 and ending as of the date of
                      the quarter just completed ("Quarterly EBITDA Notice").

                           (ii)    In no event shall HCHC and HCLP present a
                      Triggering Valuation which, together with the amounts
                      payable to SJMB pursuant to clause (ii) of the last
                      sentence of Section 9.1(a), would result in an aggregate
                      payment to SJMB under this Section 9.1 that is less than
                      the HCHC Purchase Option Price calculated in accordance
                      with Section 5.2(b), except that for purposes of
                      calculating the amount described in Section 5.2(b)(iv) the
                      amount of Belleli's EBITDA shall be equal to the EBITDA
                      reported in the Quarterly EBITDA Notice which most
                      recently preceded notice of such Triggering Valuation.

                           (iii)   In no event shall SJMB present a Triggering
                      Valuation which, together with the amounts payable to HCHC
                      and its Affiliates pursuant to clause (ii) of the last
                      sentence of Section 9.1(a), would result in an aggregate
                      payment to HCHC under this Section 9.1 that is less than
                      the SJMB Purchase Option Price calculated in accordance
                      with Section 5.1(b), except that for purposes of
                      calculating the amount described in Section 5.1(b)(iv) the
                      amount of Belleli's EBITDA shall be equal to the EBITDA
                      reported in the Quarterly EBITDA Notice which most
                      recently preceded notice of such Triggering Valuation.

               9.2.   Enterprise Valuation Sale to Unaffiliated Third Party. In
the event that the Proposing Party gives notice to the Other Party of a
Triggering Valuation with the intent to conduct a sale of all of the equity
interests in or substantially all of the assets of Belleli and HCC Mantova to an
Unaffiliated Third Party, the Proposing Party shall so state in the notice to
the Other Party. If the Proposing Party elects to give such notice and the Other
Party elects to sell its interest to the Proposing Party as described in the
preceding paragraph, the Proposing Party shall have 150 days to pay the Other
Party the Enterprise Valuation Purchase Price and satisfy the other terms of
sale set forth in Section 9.1, provided, however, that the Enterprise

                                       18

<PAGE>

Valuation Purchase Price shall be adjusted higher by an amount equal to the
Selling Party's Percentage Ownership Interest in Belleli multiplied by the
difference between the Triggering Valuation of the Proposing Party and the price
actually paid by the Unaffiliated Third Party purchaser. This Enterprise
Valuation Purchase Price adjustment shall only be made if it increases the
Enterprise Valuation Purchase Price to be paid to the selling party.

               9.3.   Cooperation. The Proposing Party and the Other Party agree
to use their respective reasonable efforts to cooperate and assist in the sale
process regardless of whether the Other Party elects to purchase or sell and
regardless of whether the Proposing Party elects to conduct a sale to an
Unaffiliated Third Party as set forth in Section 9.2 hereof.

               9.4.   Representations and Warranties. Either HCHC and HCLP or
SJMB, if the selling party pursuant to Section 9.1, or each of them in the event
of a sale to an Unaffiliated Third Party pursuant to Section 9.2, shall make the
representations and warranties described in Section 5.1(e) (in the case of HCHC
and HCLP) or Section 5.2(e) (in the case of SJMB).
