holders of Common Stock, such percentage to be determined by dividing (a) the
number of shares of Class A Common outstanding on the record date for the
applicable Distribution, by (b) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding

Class A-2 Common equal to the Unreturned Original A-2 Cost on such shares of
Class A-2 Common, the holder of such Class A-2 Common shall no longer be
entitled to any portion of the Distributions, all rights as a holder of such
Class A-2 Common shall cease, such Class A-2 Common shall no longer be deemed to
be issued and outstanding and such Class A-2 Common shall then be disregarded

A-2 Common shall then be disregarded for purposes of determining the number of

                  Part 3. Pay-in-kind dividends on Class A-1 Common.

                  (A) General Obligation. When and as declared by the
Corporation's board of directors and to the extent permitted under the General
Corporation Law of Delaware, the Corporation shall pay in-kind dividends to each
holder of the Class A-1 Common as provided in this Part 3. Except as otherwise
provided herein, dividends on each share of the Class A-1 Common (a "Share")
shall accrue on a daily basis at the rate of 7.5 % per annum of the sum of the
then remaining Unreturned Original A-1 Cost thereof plus all accumulated and
unpaid dividends thereon, from and including the date of issuance of such Share
to and including the earlier of (i) November 30, 2003 or (ii) the date on which
such holder receives Distributions equal to the Unreturned Original A-1 Cost of
such Share. Such dividends shall accrue whether or not they have been declared
and whether or not there are profits, surplus or other funds of the Corporation
legally available for the payment of dividends and such dividends shall only be
payable pursuant to paragraph 3(C) below.

                  (B) Dividend Reference Dates. To the extent not paid on March
1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2001 (the
"Dividend Reference Dates"), all dividends which have accrued on each Share
outstanding during the three-month period (or other period in the case of the
initial Dividend Reference Date) ending upon each such Dividend Reference Date
shall be accumulated and shall remain accumulated dividends with respect to such
Share until paid.

                  (C) Payment of Stock Dividends. At any time after the holders
of a Share requests, all dividends accruing on such Share shall only be paid, in
lieu of cash, by the issuance, at the sole election of such holder, of either
(i) shares of Class A-2 Common (including fractional shares thereof) equal to
the amount of the dividend to be paid divided by $4,211 or (ii) shares of
Original Class A Common (including fractional shares thereof) equal to the
amount of the dividend to be paid divided by $5,896.75.

                  Part 4. Conversion.

                  (A) Conversion of Class D-2 Common.

                  (i) In connection with the occurrence (or the expected
occurrence as described in (iii) below) of any Conversion Event, each holder of
Class D-2 Common shall be entitled to convert into an equal number of shares of
Class D-1 Common any or all of the shares of such holder's Class D-2 Common
being (or expected to be) distributed, disposed of or sold in connection with
such Conversion Event.

                  (ii) Each holder of Class D-2 Common shall be entitled to
convert shares of Class D-2 Common in connection with any Conversion Event if
such holder reasonably believes that such Conversion Event shall be consummated,
and a written request for conversion from any holder of Class D-2 Common to the
Corporation stating such holder's reasonable belief that a Conversion Event
shall occur shall be conclusive and shall obligate the Corporation to effect
such conversion in a timely manner so as to enable each such holder to
participate in such Conversion Event. The Corporation shall not cancel the
shares of Class D-2 Common so converted before the tenth day following such
Conversion Event and shall reserve such shares



                                       7
<PAGE>

until such tenth day for reissuance in compliance with the next sentence. If any
shares of Class D-2 Common are converted into shares of Class D-1 Common in
connection with a Conversion Event and such shares of Class D-1 Common are not
actually distributed, disposed of or sold pursuant to such Conversion Event,
such shares of Class D-1 Common shall be promptly converted back into the same
number of shares of Class D-2 Common.

                  (B) Conversion Procedure for Class D-2 Common.

                  (i) Each conversion of shares of Class D-2 Common into shares
of Class D-1 Common will be effected by the surrender of the certificate or
certificates representing the shares to be converted at the principal executive
office of the Corporation (or such other office or agency of the Corporation as
the Corporation may designate by notice in writing to the holders of the Class
D-2 Common) at any time during normal business hours, together with a written
notice by the holder of the shares represented by such certificate or
certificates stating that such holder desires to convert such shares, or a
stated number of such shares, into shares of Class D-1 Common and that upon such
conversion such holder and its Affiliates will not directly or indirectly own,
control or have the power to vote a greater quantity of securities of any kind
issued by the Corporation than such holder and its Affiliates are permitted to
own, control or have the power to vote under any applicable law, regulation,
rule or other requirement of any governmental authority (and such statement will
obligate the Corporation to issue such shares of Class D-1 Common). Such
conversion will be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on
the date on which such certificate or certificates have been surrendered and
such written notice has been received, and at such time the rights of the holder
of the converted shares of Class D-2 Common as such holder will cease and the
person or persons in whose name or names the certificate or certificates for
shares of Class D-1 Common are to be issued upon such conversion will be deemed
to have become the holder or holders of record of the shares of Class D-1 Common
represented thereby.

                  (ii) Promptly after such surrender and the receipt of such
written notice, the Corporation will issue and deliver in accordance with the
surrendering holder's instructions (i) the certificate or certificates for the
shares of Class D-1 Common issuable upon such conversion and (ii) a certificate
representing any shares of Class D-2 Common which were represented by the
certificate or certificates delivered to the Corporation in connection with such
conversion but which were not converted.

                  (iii) The Corporation will at all times reserve and keep
available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class D-1 Common, solely
for the purpose of issue upon the conversion of the Class D-2 Common as provided
in this Part 4, such number of shares as shall be issuable upon the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of Class D-2 Common (assuming that all such
shares are held by persons entitled to convert such shares into shares of Class
D-1 Common).

                  (iv) The issuance of certificates for shares of Class D-1
Common upon conversion of shares of Class D-2 Common will be made without charge
to the holders of such shares for any issuance tax in respect thereof or other
cost incurred by the Corporation in connection with such conversion and
issuance. The Corporation will not close its books against



                                       8
<PAGE>

the transfer of its Common Stock in any manner which would interfere with the
timely conversion of the Class D-2 Common.

                  (C) Conversion of Class Q-2 Common.

                  (i) In connection with the occurrence (or the expected
occurrence as described in (iii) below) of any Conversion Event, each holder of
Class Q-2 Common shall be entitled to convert into an equal number of shares of
Class Q-1 Common any or all of the shares of such holder's Class Q-2 Common
being (or expected to be) distributed, disposed of or sold in connection with
such Conversion Event.

                  (ii) Each holder of Class Q-2 Common shall be entitled to
convert shares of Class Q-2 Common in connection with any Conversion Event if
such holder reasonably believes that such Conversion Event shall be consummated,
and a written request for conversion from any holder of Class Q-2 Common to the
Corporation stating such holder's reasonable belief that a Conversion Event
shall occur shall be conclusive and shall obligate the Corporation to effect
such conversion in a timely manner so as to enable each such holder to
participate in such Conversion Event. The Corporation shall not cancel the
shares of Class Q-2 Common so converted before the tenth day following such
Conversion Event and shall reserve such shares until such tenth day for
reissuance in compliance with the next sentence. If any shares of Class Q-2
Common are converted into shares of Class Q-1 Common in connection with a
Conversion Event and such shares of Class Q-1 Common are not actually
distributed, disposed of or sold pursuant to such Conversion Event, such shares
of Class Q-1 Common shall be promptly converted back into the same number of
shares of Class Q-2 Common.

                  (D) Conversion Procedure for Class Q-2 Common.

                  (i) Each conversion of shares of Class Q-2 Common into shares
of Class Q-1 Common will be effected by the surrender of the certificate or
certificates representing the shares to be converted at the principal executive
office of the Corporation (or such other office or agency of the Corporation as
the Corporation may designate by notice in writing to the holders of the Class
Q-2 Common) at any time during normal business hours, together with a written
notice by the holder of the shares represented by such certificate or
certificates stating that such holder desires to convert such shares, or a
stated number of such shares, into shares of Class Q-1 Common and that upon such
conversion such holder and its Affiliates will not directly or indirectly own,
control or have the power to vote a greater quantity of securities of any kind
issued by the Corporation than such holder and its Affiliates are permitted to
own, control or have the power to vote under any applicable law, regulation,
rule or other requirement of any governmental authority (and such statement will
obligate the Corporation to issue such shares of Class Q-1 Common). Such
conversion will be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on
the date on which such certificate or certificates have been surrendered and
such written notice has been received, and at such time the rights of the holder
of the converted shares of Class Q-2 Common as such holder will cease and the
person or persons in whose name or names the certificate or certificates for
shares of Class Q-1 Common are to be issued upon such conversion will be deemed
to have become the holder or holders of record of the shares of Class Q-1 Common
represented thereby.

                  (ii) Promptly after such surrender and the receipt of such
written notice, the Corporation will issue and deliver in accordance with the
surrendering holder's instructions (i) the certificate or certificates for the
shares of Class Q-1 Common issuable upon such conversion and (ii) a certificate
representing any shares of Class Q-2 Common which were represented by the
certificate or certificates delivered to the Corporation in connection with such
conversion but which were not converted.

                  (iii) The Corporation will at all times reserve and keep
available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class Q-1 Common, solely
for the purpose of issue upon the conversion of the Class Q-2 Common as provided
in this Part 4, such number of shares as shall be issuable upon the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of Class Q-2 Common (assuming that all such
shares are held by persons entitled to convert such shares into shares of Class
Q-1 Common).

                  (iv) The issuance of certificates for shares of Class Q-1
Common upon conversion of shares of Class Q-2 Common will be made without charge
to the holders of such shares for any issuance tax in respect thereof or other
cost incurred by the Corporation in connection with such conversion and
issuance. The Corporation will not close its books against the transfer of its
Common Stock in any manner which would interfere with the timely conversion of
the Class Q-2 Common.

ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the Corporation's directors, (d)
any sale of securities of the Corporation to a person or group of persons
(within the meaning of the 1934 Act) if, after such sale, such person or group

voting securities of the Corporation, and (e) a merger, consolidation or similar
transaction involving the Corporation if, after such transaction, a person or

transaction has been approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors or a

facility as may be in effect at such time, at any time after December 15, 2009,
any holder of Class P Stock may request that the Corporation make a cash

distribution in respect of their shares of Class P Common in an amount equal to
the Unreturned Original P Cost thereof (plus all Unpaid Class P Yield thereon)

P Yield thereon) within 20 days after receipt of the initial request.

                  (B) Change in Ownership.

                  (i) If a Change in Ownership has occurred or the Corporation
obtains knowledge that a Change in Ownership is proposed to occur, the
Corporation shall give prompt written notice of such Change in Ownership (but
not less than 25 days prior to consummation of such Change in Ownership)
describing in reasonable detail the material terms and date of consummation
thereof to each holder of Class P Common, and the Corporation shall give each
holder of Class P Common prompt written notice of any material change in the
terms or timing of such transaction. Each holder of the Class P Common then
outstanding may require the Corporation to make a cash distribution in respect
of all or any portion of the Class P Common owned by such holder in an amount
per share equal to the Unreturned Original P Cost thereof (plus all Unpaid Class
P Yield thereon) by giving written notice to the Corporation of such election
prior to the later of (a) 21 days after receipt of the Corporation's notice and

                  (iii) The term "Change in Ownership" means any sale, transfer

                  (C) Fundamental Change.

                  (i) If a Fundamental Change is proposed to occur, the
Corporation shall give written notice of such Fundamental Change describing in
reasonable detail the material terms and date of consummation thereof to each
holder of Class P Common not more than 45 days nor less than 20 days prior to

of all or any portion of the Class P Common owned by such holder or holders in

Unpaid Class P Yield thereon) by giving written notice to the Corporation of
such election prior to the later of (a) ten days prior to the consummation of
the Fundamental Change or (b) ten days after receipt of notice from the
Corporation.

                  (ii) Subject to the terms of Part 2 of this Section 1 and to
the terms of the Corporation's senior credit facility as may be in effect at
such time and the Corporation's Senior Subordinated Note Indenture dated May 28,
1999, upon receipt of such election(s), the Corporation shall be obligated to
make such cash distribution in respect of the aggregate number of shares
specified therein upon the consummation of such Fundamental Change. If any
proposed Fundamental Change does not occur, all requests for such cash
distribution in connection therewith shall be automatically rescinded.

                  (iii) The term "Fundamental Change" means (a) any sale or
transfer of more than 50% of the assets of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis (measured either by (a) book value in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied or (b) fair market
value determined in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Corporation's
Board of Directors, whichever results in a greater percentage determination) in
any transaction or series of transactions and (b) any merger or consolidation to
which the Corporation is a party, except for a merger in which the Corporation
is the surviving corporation, the terms of the Class P Common are not changed
and the Class P Common is not exchanged for cash, securities or other property,
and after giving effect to such merger, the holders of the Corporation's
outstanding capital stock possessing a majority of the voting power (under
ordinary circumstances) to elect a majority of the Corporation's Board of
Directors immediately prior to the merger shall continue to own the
Corporation's outstanding capital stock possessing the voting power (under
ordinary circumstances) to elect a majority of the Corporation's Board of
Directors.

                  (D) Priority of Distribution Payments. For each share of Class
P Common which is to receive a cash distribution pursuant to this Part 5, the
Corporation shall be obligated on the Payment Date to pay to the holder thereof
an amount in cash immediately available funds equal to the Unreturned Original P
Cost thereof (plus all Unpaid Class P Yield thereon). If the funds of the
Corporation available for such distribution on any Payment Date are insufficient
to make such distribution in full on such date, those funds which are available
shall be used to make such distribution to such holders, pro rata among the
holders of such shares, and such payment shall first be applied as a payment of
Class P Yield until all Unpaid Class P Yield is paid and then applied as a
return of Original P Cost. At any time thereafter when additional funds of the
Corporation are available for distribution, such funds shall immediately be used
to make the



                                       12
<PAGE>

balance of such distribution which the Corporation has become obligated to make
on any Payment Date but which it has not been made.

                  (E) Restrictions on Repurchases of Common Stock. So long as
the holders of shares of Class P Common have not received Distributions in
respect of their Class P Common at least equal to the Unreturned Original P Cost
thereof (plus all Unpaid Class P Yield thereon), the Corporation shall not
redeem, repurchase, or otherwise acquire any of the Common Stock (other than
Class Q-1 Common) without prior written consent of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding Class P Common (disregarding, for purposes of determining a
majority, any Class P Common held by any holder of the Common Stock proposed to
be redeemed, repurchased or acquired), except for repurchases of Class A Common
issued to employees of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries.

                  Part 6. Stock Splits and Stock Dividends.

                  The Corporation shall not in any manner subdivide (by stock
split, stock dividend or otherwise), or combine (by stock split, stock dividend
or otherwise) the outstanding Common Stock of one class unless the outstanding
Common Stock of the other classes shall be proportionately subdivided or
combined. All such subdivisions and combinations shall be payable only in the
same class of Common Stock to each holder of each class of Common Stock. In no
event shall a stock split or stock dividend be designated as a payment of Yield,
a payment of Class D/E Yield, a payment of Class P Yield, a return of Original
Cost, a return of Original D/E Cost, a return of Original P Cost, a return of
Original A-1 Cost or a return of Original A-2 Cost.

                  Part 7. Registration of Transfer.

                  The Corporation shall keep at its principal office (or such
other place as the Corporation reasonably designates) a register for the
registration of shares of Common Stock. Upon the surrender of any certificate
representing shares of any class of Common Stock at such place, the Corporation
shall, at the request of the registered holder of such certificate, execute and
deliver a new certificate or certificates in exchange therefor representing in
the aggregate the number of shares of such class represented by the surrendered
certificate, and the Corporation forthwith shall cancel such surrendered
certificate. Each such new certificate will be registered in such name and will
represent such number of shares of such class as is requested by the holder of
the surrendered certificate and shall be substantially identical in form to the
surrendered certificate. The issuance of new certificates shall be made without
charge to the holders of the surrendered certificates for any issuance tax in
respect thereof or other cost incurred by the Corporation in connection with
such issuance.

                  Part 8. Replacement.

                  Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Corporation (an affidavit of the registered holder will be satisfactory) of the
ownership and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any certificate
evidencing one or more shares of any class of Common Stock, and in the case of
any such lose, theft or destruction, upon receipt of indemnity reasonably
satisfactory to the Corporation (provided that if the holder is a financial
institution or other



                                       13
<PAGE>

institutional investor its own agreement will be satisfactory), or, in the case
of any such mutilation upon surrender of such certificate, the Corporation shall
(at its expense) execute and deliver in lieu of such certificate a new
certificate of like kind representing the number of shares of such class
represented by such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate and dated
the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate.

                  Part 9. Notices.

                  All notices referred to herein shall be in writing, shall be
delivered personally, sent by telecopy or mailed by first class mail, postage
prepaid, and shall be deemed to have been given when so delivered, sent or
mailed to the Corporation at its principal executive offices and to any
stockholder at such holder's address as it appears in the stock records of the
Corporation (unless otherwise specified in a written notice to the Corporation
by such holder).

                  Part 10. Amendment and Waiver.

                  No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Section I
shall be effective without the prior written consent of the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding shares of the Class A Common, Class B Common,
Class C Common, Class D Common, Class E Common, Class P Common and Class Q
