                      ------------------------------------------------

     follows:

               (i) At the close of business on each Cycle Billing Date for any
          Cycle of which any Accounts are included in the Trust, the amount of
          Finance Charge Receivables of all Accounts in such Cycle shall be
          equal to (A) the amount of Finance Charges charged to all Accounts in
          such Cycle on such date, plus (B) the Carry-Over Finance Charge Amount
                                   ----
          for such Cycle.

                                       22

<PAGE>

               (ii) For each Monthly Period, the amount of Collections allocated
          to Finance Charge Receivables for all Accounts in such Cycle shall be
          an amount equal to the amount of Finance Charges actually assessed on
          all Accounts, in accordance with the Charge Account Guidelines, on the
          Cycle Billing Date for such Cycle in the immediately preceding Monthly
          Period.

               (iii) If, at the close of business on the last Business Day of
          any Monthly Period, the amount of Collections allocated to Finance
          Charge Receivables for all Accounts in such Cycle during such Monthly
          Period is less than the amount of Finance Charge Receivables for all
          Accounts in such Cycle on the Cycle Billing Date for such Cycle next
          preceding such Monthly Period, then such deficit shall be the
          "Carry-Over Finance Charge Amount" for such Cycle and shall be added
          to the amount of Finance Charges assessed on such Billing Cycle Date
          pursuant to clause (i)(B) above. The Carry-Over Finance Charge Amount
                      -------------
          with respect to any Accounts shall be zero as of the Cycle Billing
          Date next preceding (A) the Closing Date, in the case of Accounts
          which are not Additional Accounts and (B) the applicable Addition
          Date, in the case of Additional Accounts.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer may adopt a different
     method of determining the amount of Finance Charge Receivables which in the
     good faith judgment of the Servicer is designed to more accurately reflect
     the portions of Receivables and Collections constituting Finance Charge
     Receivables.

          In connection with such transfer, Seller agrees to record and file, at

               ----------
     confidential and proprietary, and is hereby incorporated into and made a
     part of this Agreement.

          The parties intend that, in the event this Agreement shall not be
     effective to transfer, assign and set over to the Trustee the Trust Assets,
     Seller shall be deemed hereunder to have granted to the Trustee a first
     perfected security interest in all of the property described in the first
     paragraph of this Section 2.1, and that this Agreement shall constitute a
                       -----------
     security agreement under applicable law.

          Seller and Servicer acknowledge that all instruments (including
     certificates of deposit) and bank accounts the security interest in which
     has been transferred to the Trust hereby and which are maintained with
     Servicer or of which Servicer has possession, shall be so maintained and
     held by Servicer on behalf and for the benefit of the Trust, in accordance
     with the terms of this Agreement.

          Additionally, for purposes of perfecting the Trustee's security
     interest in bank accounts pledged to Seller, which security interest Seller
     has transferred to the Trustee hereunder, this Agreement constitutes and
     shall be deemed (i) notice to Seller and Servicer by the Trustee of the
     Trustee's security interest in such bank accounts, and (ii) Seller and
     Servicer's acknowledgment of and consent to the Trustee's notice and the
     Trustee's security interest in such bank accounts.

     of the Closing Date for such Series:

               (i) This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
          obligation of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with
          its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by Debtor
          Relief Laws and except as such enforceability may be limited by
          general principles of equity (whether considered in a suit at law or
          in equity).

               (ii) The representations and warranties set out in Schedule 2 are
                                                                  ----------
          true and correct. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
          this Agreement constitutes either (A) a valid transfer to the Trust of
          all right, title and interest of Seller in, to and under the property
          described in the first paragraph of Section 2.1, and such property
                                              -----------
          will be held by the Trust free and clear of any Lien of any Person
          claiming through or under Seller or its Affiliates, except for (x)
          Liens permitted under subsection 2.5(b), (y) the Seller Interest and
                                -----------------
          (z) Seller's right to receive interest accruing on, and investment
          earnings in respect of, the Finance Charge Accounts, the Principal
          Accounts and any other Investor Accounts as provided in this Agreement
          and any Supplement or (B) a grant of a security interest (as defined
          in the UCC as in effect in the applicable jurisdiction) in such
          property to the Trust, which is enforceable with respect to existing
          Receivables in the Accounts, all

                                       28

          Recoveries and other proceeds thereof, and Insurance Proceeds relating
          thereto upon execution and delivery of this Agreement, and which will
          be enforceable with respect to such Receivables hereafter arising in
          the Accounts, all monies due or to become due with respect thereto,
          the Collections, Recoveries and other proceeds thereof and Insurance
          Proceeds relating thereto, at the time such Receivables arise. If this
          Agreement constitutes the grant of a security interest to the Trust in
          such property, upon the filing of the financing statement described in
          Section 2.1 and in the case of the Receivables hereafter arising in
          -----------
          the Accounts and proceeds thereof and Insurance Proceeds relating to
          such Receivables, as the same arise, the Trust shall have a first
          priority perfected security interest in such property, except for
          Liens permitted under subsection 2.5(b). Neither Seller nor any Person
                                -----------------
          claiming through or under Seller shall have any claim to or interest
          in the Principal Accounts, the Finance Charge Accounts or the
          Distribution Accounts or any other Investor Accounts, except for
          Seller's right to receive interest accruing on, and investment
          earnings in respect of, the Finance Charge Accounts, Principal
          Accounts and any other Investor Accounts as provided in this Agreement
          and any Supplement, Seller's right to receive payments from the
          Finance Charge Accounts and Principal Accounts in accordance with the
          provisions of Article IV, and, if this Agreement constitutes the grant
                        ----------
          of a security interest in such property, except for the interest of
          Seller in such property as a debtor for purposes of the UCC as in
          effect in the applicable jurisdiction.

          (b) Eligibility of Receivables. Seller hereby represents and warrants
              --------------------------
     as of each date the representations are made or deemed made in Section
                                                                    -------
     4.1(l) of the Receivables Purchase Agreement (other than the first sentence
     ------
     thereof) that such representations are true and correct. Seller hereby

     Receivable then existing has been transferred to the Trust free and clear
     of any Lien of any Person (other than Liens permitted under subsection
                                                                 ----------
     2.5(b), the Seller Interest and Seller's right to receive interest accruing
     ------
     on, and investment earnings in respect of, the Finance Charge Accounts, the
     Principal Accounts, the Excess Funding Account and any other Investor
     Accounts as provided in this Agreement and any Supplement) and in
     compliance, in all material respects, with all Requirements of Law
     applicable to Seller and (iii) with respect to each Receivable then
     existing, all consents, licenses, approvals or authorizations of or
     registrations or declarations with any Governmental Authority required to
     be obtained, effected or given by Seller in connection with the transfer of
     such Receivable to the Trust have been duly obtained, effected or given and
     are in full force and effect. On each day on which any new Receivable is
     transferred by Seller to the Trust, Seller shall be deemed to represent and
     warrant to the Trust that (i) each Receivable transferred on such day is an
     Eligible Receivable, (ii) each Receivable

                                       29

                                                              -----------------
     the Seller Interest and Seller's right to receive interest accruing on, and
     investment earnings in respect of, the Finance Charge Accounts, the
     Principal Accounts and the other Investor Accounts, as provided in this
     Agreement and any Supplement) and in compliance, in all material respects,
     with all Requirements of Law applicable to Seller, (iii) with respect to
     each such Receivable, all consents, licenses, approvals or authorizations
     of or registrations or declarations with any Governmental Authority
     required to be obtained, effected or given by Seller or FCNB in connection
     with the transfer of such Receivable to the Trust have been duly obtained,

     representations and warranties set forth in subsection 2.4(a) are true and
                                                 -----------------
     correct with respect to each Receivable transferred on such day as if made
     on such day.

          (c) Notice of Breach. The representations and warranties set forth in
              ----------------
     this Section 2.4 shall survive the transfer of the respective Receivables
          -----------
     to the Trust and termination of the rights and obligations of the Servicer
     pursuant to Section 10.1. Upon discovery by Seller, the Servicer or the

     Trustee of a breach of any of the foregoing representations and warranties,
     the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the
     others and any Enhancement Provider.

          (d) Transfer of Ineligible Receivables. In the event of a breach of
              ----------------------------------
     any representation and warranty set forth in subsection 2.4(b), upon the
                                                  -----------------
     expiration of 30 days (or with the prior written consent of a Responsible
     Officer of the Trustee, such longer period, not to exceed 60 days,
     specified in such consent) of the earlier to occur of the discovery of such
     breach by Seller or receipt by Seller of written notice of such breach
     given by the Trustee or Servicer, Seller shall accept a retransfer of each
     Principal Receivable to which such breach relates (an "Ineligible
                                                            ----------

     ----------                                                --------
     however, that no such retransfer shall be required to be made with respect
     -------
     to such Ineligible Receivable if, on any day within such 30-day period (or
     such longer period as may be specified in the consent) the representations
     and warranties in subsection 2.4(b) of this Agreement with respect to such
                       -----------------
     Ineligible Receivable shall then be true and correct in all material
     respects with respect to such Ineligible Receivable as if such Ineligible
     Receivable had been transferred to the Seller or the Trust on such day.
     Notwithstanding anything contained in this subsection 2.4(d) to the
                                                -----------------
     contrary, in the event of breach of any representation and warranty set
     forth in subsection 2.4(b), with respect to (x) each Receivable existing as
              -----------------
     of the Closing Date or an Addition Date, as applicable, and (y) each new
     Receivable thereafter arising, having been conveyed to the Seller or the
     Trust free and clear of any Lien of any Person claiming through or under
     Seller and its Affiliates and in compliance in all material respects, with
     all Requirements of Law applicable to FCNB or Seller, immediately upon the
     earliest to occur of the discovery of such breach by Seller or receipt by
     Seller of written notice of such breach given by the Trustee or the
     Servicer, Seller shall

                                       30

<PAGE>

     repurchase and the Trustee shall convey, without recourse, representation
     or warranty, all of the Trustee's right, title and interest in each
     Ineligible Receivable, and the Servicer shall promptly notify Moody's of
     such event. Seller shall accept a retransfer of each such Ineligible
     Receivable and there shall be deducted from the aggregate amount of
     Principal Receivables used to calculate the Seller Amount the face amount
     of each such Ineligible Receivable. On and after the date of such
     retransfer, each Ineligible Receivable so retransferred shall not be
     included in the calculation of the Investor Percentage, the Seller
     Percentage or the Seller Amount. In the event that the exclusion of an
     Ineligible Receivable from the calculation of the Seller Amount would cause
     the Seller Amount to be less than the Minimum Seller Amount, Seller shall
     make a deposit in the Collection Account in immediately available funds in
     an amount equal to the Shortfall Amount to the extent the Seller has
     received such funds from FCNB under the Receivables Purchase Agreement,
     and, if Seller has not received such funds, to the extent Seller has funds
     available for such purpose after amounts payable to Securityholders (as
     defined in the Receivables Purchase Agreement) have been paid in full. The
     amounts so deposited are to be treated for all purposes hereof as
     Collections on such Ineligible Receivables. Such deposit shall be
     considered a prepayment in full of the Ineligible Receivable and shall be
     applied in accordance with Article IV. Upon each retransfer to Seller of
                                ----------
     such Ineligible Receivable, the Trust shall automatically and without
     further action be deemed to transfer, assign and set-over to Seller,
     without recourse, representation or warranty, all the right, title and
     interest of the Trust in, to and under such Ineligible Receivable, all
     monies due or to become due with respect thereto, all proceeds thereof and
     Insurance Proceeds relating thereto. The Trustee shall execute such
     documents and instruments of transfer and take such other actions as shall
     reasonably be requested by Seller to effect the transfer of such Ineligible
     Receivable pursuant to this subsection. The obligation of Seller to accept
     retransfer of any Ineligible Receivable shall constitute the sole remedy
     respecting any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in
     subsection 2.4(b) with respect to such Receivable available to
     -----------------
     Certificateholders or the Trustee on behalf of Certificateholders. Each
     party hereto agrees that the failure by the Seller to make the deposit in
     accordance with this Section 2.4(d) shall not give rise to any claim
                          --------------
     against the Seller.

          (e) Retransfer of Trust Portfolio. In the event of a breach of any of
              -----------------------------
     the representations and warranties set forth in subsection 2.4(a), either
                                                     -----------------
     the Trustee, or the Holders of Investor Certificates evidencing Undivided
     Interests aggregating not less than 25% of the Investor Amount of any
     Series, by notice then given in writing to Seller (and to the Trustee and
     the Servicer, if given by the Investor Certificateholders), may direct
     Seller to accept retransfer of all of the Principal Receivables following
     the period of 45 days after such notice, or within such longer period as
     may be specified in such notice, and Seller shall be obligated to accept
     retransfer of such Receivables on a Distribution Date first occurring after
     such applicable period on the terms and conditions set forth below;
     provided, however,
     --------  -------

                                       31

<PAGE>

     that no such retransfer shall be required to be made if, at any time during
     such applicable period the representations and warranties contained in
     subsection 2.4(a) shall then be true and correct in all material respects.
     -----------------
     Seller shall deposit on the Transfer Date (in next day funds) for the
     related Distribution Date an amount equal to the deposit amount provided in
     the next sentence for such Receivables in the Distribution Account for
     distribution to the Investor Certificateholders pursuant to Section 12.3 to
                                                                 ------------
     the extent the Seller has received such funds from FCNB under the
     Receivables Purchase Agreement, and, if Seller has not received such funds,
     to the extent Seller has funds available for such purpose after amounts
     payable to Securityholders (as defined in the Receivables Purchase
     Agreement) have been paid in full. The deposit amount for such retransfer
     will be equal to (i) the Aggregate Investor Amount at the end of the day on
     the last day of the Monthly Period preceding the Distribution Date on which
     the retransfer is scheduled to be made, less the amount, if any,
     transferred to the Distribution Account on such Transfer Date for
     application to principal payments in respect of Investor Certificates, plus
     (ii) an amount equal to all interest accrued but unpaid on the Investor
     Certificates at the Certificate Rate through such last day, less the amount
     transferred to the Distribution Account from the Finance Charge Account on
     such Transfer Date in respect of Certificate Interest. Payment of the
     deposit amount and all other amounts in the Distribution Account in respect
     of the preceding Monthly Period shall be considered a prepayment in full of
     the Receivables represented by the Investor Certificates. On the
     Distribution Date following the Transfer Date on which such amount has been
     deposited in full into the Distribution Account, the Receivables and all
     monies due or to become due with respect thereto and all proceeds of the
     Receivables and Insurance Proceeds relating thereto shall be transferred to
     Seller, and the Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments of
     transfer, in each case without recourse, representation or warranty, as
     shall be reasonably requested by Seller to vest in Seller, or its designee
     or assignee, all right, title and interest of the Trust in, to and under
     the Receivables, all monies due or to become due with respect thereto
     (including all Finance Charge Receivables) and all proceeds thereof and
     Insurance Proceeds relating thereto. If the Trustee or the Investor
     Certificateholders give a notice directing Seller to accept a retransfer as
     provided above, the obligation of Seller to accept a retransfer of the
     Receivables pursuant to this subsection 2.4(e) shall constitute the sole
                                  -----------------
     remedy respecting a breach of the representations and warranties contained
     in subsection 2.4(a) available to the Investor Certificateholders or the
        -----------------
     Trustee on behalf of the Investor Certificateholders. Each party hereto
     agrees that the failure by the Seller to make the deposit in accordance
     with this Section 2.4(e) shall not give rise to any claim against the
               --------------
     Seller.

          (f) Seller will not add additional RPA Seller parties to the
     Receivables Purchase Agreement, and not become a party to a new receivables
     purchase agreement, without first satisfying the Rating Agency Condition.

                                       32

          (g) Seller will be adequately capitalized to engage in the
     transactions contemplated by its Certificate of Incorporation.

          Section 2.5 Covenants of Seller. Seller hereby covenants that:
                      -------------------

          (a) Receivables to be Accounts. Seller will take no action to cause
              --------------------------
     any Receivable to be characterized as anything other than an "account" (as
     defined in the UCC as in effect in the applicable jurisdiction). Each
     Receivable shall be payable pursuant to a contract which does not create a
     Lien on any goods purchased thereunder.

          (b) Security Interests. Except for the transfers hereunder, Seller
              ------------------
     will not sell, pledge, assign or transfer to any other Person, or grant,
     create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any Receivable,
     whether now existing or hereafter transferred to the Trust, or any interest
     therein; Seller will immediately notify the Trustee of the existence of any
     Lien on any Receivable; and Seller shall defend the right, title and
     interest of the Trust in, to and under the Receivables, whether now
     existing or hereafter transferred to the Trust, against all claims of third
     parties; provided, however, that nothing in this subsection 2.5(b) shall
              --------  -------                       -----------------
     prevent or be deemed to prohibit Seller from suffering to exist upon any of
     the Receivables any Liens for state, municipal or other local taxes if such
     taxes shall not at the time be due and payable or if Seller shall currently
     be contesting the validity thereof in good faith by appropriate proceedings
     and shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect
     thereto; provided further, however, that nothing in this subsection 2.5(b)
              ----------------  -------                       -----------------
     shall prevent or be deemed to prohibit Seller from granting a participation
     interest in the Seller Interest or the Undivided Interest in the Trust
     evidenced thereby.

          (c) Account Allocations.
              -------------------

               (i) In the event that Seller is unable for any reason to transfer
          Receivables to the Trust in accordance with the provisions of this
          Agreement (including, without limitation, by reason of the occurrence
          of an Insolvency Event) then, in any such event, (A) Seller agrees to
          instruct the Servicer to allocate and pay to the Trust, after the date
          of such inability, payments received in respect of the Accounts giving
          rise to such Receivables first to the total amount of Principal
          Receivables from such Accounts transferred to the Trust; and (B)
          Seller agrees to have such amounts applied as Collections in
          accordance with Article IV. If such event shall occur, it shall be
                          ----------
          deemed a Pay Out Event immediately upon the occurrence thereof. The
          parties hereto agree that Finance Charge Receivables, whenever
          created, with respect to Principal Receivables which have been
          transferred to the Trust shall continue to be a part of the Trust
          notwithstanding any cessation of the transfer of additional Principal
          Receivables to the Trust and Collections with respect thereto shall
          continue to be allocated and paid in accordance with Article IV.
                                                               ----------

<PAGE>

               (ii) In the event that pursuant to subsection 2.4(d), Seller
                                                  -----------------
          accepts a retransfer of an Ineligible Receivable as a result of a
          breach of the representations and warranties in subsection 2.4(b)
                                                          -----------------
          relating to such Receivable, then, in any such event, Seller agrees to
          instruct the Servicer to allocate payments received in respect of the
          Account giving rise to such Receivable first to the total amount of
          Principal Receivables of the appropriate Obligor retained in the Trust
          and thereafter to the total amount owing by such Obligor on any
          Ineligible Receivable retransferred to Seller.

          (d) Delivery of Collections. Seller agrees to pay to the Servicer (if
              -----------------------
     the Servicer is not then FCNB) promptly (but in no event later than two
     Business Days after receipt) all Collections received by Seller in respect
     of the Receivables.

          (e) [Reserved.]
               --------

          (f) Finance Charges and Other Fees. Seller agrees that, except as
              ------------------------------
     otherwise required by any Requirement of Law or as is deemed by FCNB to be
     advisable for its MasterCard and VISA program based on a good faith
     assessment by FCNB of the various factors impacting the use of its
     MasterCard and VISA cards, FCNB shall not reduce at any time (x) the
     Finance Charges assessed in respect of any Accounts, or (y) any other fees
     charged on any of the Accounts, if as a result of such reduction, FCNB's
     reasonable expectation of the Portfolio Yield in respect of any Series as
     of such date would be less than the current Base Rate applicable to such
     Series.

          (g) Cardholder Agreements and Cardholder Guidelines. FCNB agrees to
              -----------------------------------------------
     comply with and perform its obligations under the Cardholder Agreements
     relating to the Accounts and the Cardholder Guidelines and all applicable
     regulations of MasterCard and VISA, except insofar as any failure so to
     comply or conform would not materially and adversely affect the rights of
     the Trust or the Certificateholders hereunder or under the Certificates or
     any Supplement. In that regard, except as aforesaid, and so long as such
     changes are made applicable to the entire portfolio of MasterCard and VISA
     accounts owned and serviced by the Servicer which have characteristics the
     same as, or substantially similar to, the Accounts which are subject hereto
     (if any), FCNB shall be free to change the terms and provisions of such
     Cardholder Agreements or the Cardholder Guidelines in any respect.

          (h) Compliance with Law. Seller hereby agrees to comply in all

     the Discount Option Date (i) unless such designation in the reasonable
     belief of the Seller would cause a Pay Out Event with respect to any Series
     to occur, or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
     constitute a Pay Out Event with respect to any Series or (ii) unless the

          (f) Failure of Institution to Qualify. If an institution at which the
              ---------------------------------
     Collection Account, any Collection Subaccount, the Excess Funding Account
     or any Investor Account is established ceases to be a Qualified
     Institution, the Servicer or the Trustee (as the case may be) shall notify
     the Rating Agencies and within 15 days establish a replacement account at a
     Qualified Institution and transfer any monies, documents, instruments,
     securities, securities entitlements, certificates of deposit and other
     property to such replacement account. From the date such new account is

                      ---------------------------

              -----------
     Collection Account as promptly as possible after the Date of Processing of
     such Collections, but in no event later than the second Business Day

                                        --------  -------
     Revolving Period for all outstanding Series, the Servicer may at its option
     deposit on a daily basis as aforesaid only those Collections attributable
     to Finance Charge Receivables and allocable to the Investor Certificates,
     and retain all other Collections until the next Collections Deposit Day, at
     which time such other Collections, netted as provided in subsection 4.3(c),
                                                              -----------------
     shall be deposited in the Collection Account.

          The Servicer shall allocate such amounts to each Series of Investor
     Certificates and to the Seller Interest in accordance with this Article IV
                                                                     ----------
     and shall withdraw the required amounts from the Collection Account or pay
     such amounts to the Seller Interest or to the other persons entitled
     thereto pursuant to this Agreement, in each case as modified by any
     Supplement. The Servicer shall make such deposits or payments on the date
     indicated therein, if applicable, by wire transfer in next day funds.

          (b) Commingling Conditions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
              ----------------------

     Servicer hereunder and no Servicer Default has occurred and is continuing
     and either (i) the Servicer provides to the Trustee a letter of credit or
     other arrangement covering risk of collection of the Servicer and the
     Servicer shall have satisfied the Rating Agency Condition with respect to
     such arrangement or (ii) the Servicer (unless the Rating Agency Condition
     has been satisfied with respect to making monthly deposits) shall have and
     maintain a certificate of deposit or short-term deposit rating of P-1 by
     Moody's and of at least A-1 by Standard & Poor's and deposit insurance as
     required by law and by the FDIC, the Servicer need not deposit

     the close of  business  on the day any  Collections  are  deposited  in the
     Collection  Account  as  provided  in this  Article  IV,  but may make such
                                                 -----------
     deposits,  payments and  withdrawals  on the  Transfer  Date in the Monthly
     Period following the Monthly Period in which such amounts were collected in
     an  amount  equal  to  the  net  amount  of  such  deposits,  payments  and
     withdrawals  which  would  have  been made but for the  provisions  of this
     paragraph.

          (c) Net Payments. So long as First Consumers National Bank is the
              ------------
     Servicer and First Consumers National Bank, as Servicer, is making deposits
     to the Collection Account in accordance with subsection 4.3(a), First
                                                  -----------------
     Consumers National Bank, acting as Servicer and as agent for the holder of
     the Seller Interest, may make a net payment to the Collection Account on
     the Collections Deposit Day in the amount of all Collections received by
     the Servicer since the previous Collections Deposit Date, minus all amounts
     payable to First Consumers National Bank or with respect to the Seller
     Interest on or before the next succeeding Transfer Date in accordance with
     this Article IV and, in such event, the Servicer will, on the Collections
          ----------
     Deposit Date, retain, or pay to the holder of the Seller Interest, as the
     case may be, all amounts payable to First Consumers National Bank or the
     holder of the Seller Interest as aforesaid in lieu of the payments required
     to be made under this Article IV.
                           ----------

          (d) Investor Net Recoveries. On each Determination Date, the Servicer
              -----------------------
     shall calculate the Investor Net Recoveries, if any, for the Monthly Period
     next preceding such Determination Date. On or before the Transfer Date next
     following such Determination Date, the Servicer shall deposit the amount of
     Investor Net Recoveries, if any, in the Collection Account.

          (e) Adjustments for Miscellaneous Credits. The Servicer shall be
              -------------------------------------
     obligated to reduce on a monthly basis the aggregate amount of Principal
     Receivables used to calculate the Seller Amount as provided in this
     subsection 4.3(c) (a "Credit Adjustment") with respect to any Principal
     -----------------     -----------------
     Receivable (i) which was created in respect of merchandise refused or
     returned by the Obligor thereunder, (ii) which is reduced by the Servicer
     by any rebate, refund, chargeback or adjustment, (iii) as to which the
     Obligor thereunder has asserted a counterclaim or defense and either (A)
     the Servicer has agreed such counterclaim or defense is valid or (B) a
     final nonappealable judgment or decree has been entered in favor of such
     Obligor in respect of such counterclaim or defense by a court or arbitral
     body having jurisdiction thereof, or (iv) which the Servicer has determined
     was created through a fraudulent or counterfeit charge, but only if and to
     the extent such fraudulent or counterfeit charges are not included as
     charge-offs under the Cardholder Guidelines.

          In the event that the exclusion of the amount of a Credit Adjustment
     from the calculation of the Seller Amount would cause the Seller Amount to
     be less than zero,

                                       53

<PAGE>

     Seller shall make a deposit, no later than the Business Day following the
     Date of Processing of such Credit Adjustment, in the Excess Funding Account
     in immediately available funds, in an amount equal to the amount by which
     such Credit Adjustment exceeded the Seller Amount on such Date of
     Processing to the extent the Seller has received such funds from FCNB under
     the Receivables Purchase Agreement, and, if Seller has not received such
     funds, to the extent Seller has funds available for such purpose after
     amounts payable to Securityholders (as defined in the Receivables Purchase
     Agreement) have been paid in full. Each party hereto agrees that the
     failure by the Seller to make the deposit in accordance with this Section
                                                                       -------
     4.3(e) shall not give rise to any claim against the Seller.
     ------

          (f) Allocations for the Seller Interest. Throughout the existence of
              -----------------------------------
     the Trust, unless otherwise stated in any Supplement, the Servicer shall
     allocate to the Seller Interest an amount equal to the product of (i) the
     Seller Percentage and (ii) the aggregate amount of such Principal
     Collections and Finance Charge Collections, respectively, in respect of
     each Monthly Period. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
     contrary, unless otherwise stated in any Supplement, the Servicer need not
     deposit this amount or any other amounts so allocated to the Seller
     Interest pursuant to any Supplement into the Collection Account and shall
     pay, or be deemed to pay, such amounts as collected to the holder of the
     Seller Interest, except, if the Seller Amount is less than zero, then
     Principal Collections which are allocated to the Seller Interest shall be
     deposited in the Excess Funding Account until the Seller Amount is equal to
     zero.

          (g) Shared Principal Collections; Excess Funding Account. On each
              ----------------------------------------------------
     Business Day, Principal Collections allocable to the Seller Interest and
     Shared Principal Collections payable to the holder of the Seller Interest
     in an aggregate amount equal to the Shortfall Amount shall be deposited in
     the Excess Funding Account. Thereafter, amounts in the Excess Funding
     Account shall be treated as Shared Principal Collections to the extent
     that, after giving effect to the application and distribution of such
     amount as Shared Principal Collections, the Aggregate Principal Balance
     would equal or exceed the Minimum Aggregate Principal Balance. Shared
     Principal Collections shall be allocated to outstanding Principal Sharing
     Series pro rata based on the Principal Shortfall, if any, for each such
            --- ----
     Principal Sharing Series, and the Servicer shall (except as provided above)
     pay any remaining Shared Principal Collections on each Business Day to the
     holder of the Seller Interest.

          (h) Investment of Amounts in Excess Funding Account. Amounts on
              -----------------------------------------------
     deposit in the Excess Funding Account on any Business Day will be invested,
     at the direction of the Seller, by the Servicer or the Trustee on behalf of
     the Seller in Permitted Investments maturing on the next Business Day.
     Earnings from such investments received shall be paid to the Seller or, if
     the Seller Amount as

                                       54

<PAGE>

     determined on such Business Day does not exceed the Minimum Seller Amount,
     such earnings shall be deposited in the Excess Funding Account.

          (i) Allocation of Deposit Obligations. If the Seller or the Servicer
              ---------------------------------
     shall fail to make any Deposit Obligation, the amount thereof shall first
     be allocated to reduce the Seller Amount until the Seller Amount equals the
     Minimum Seller Amount. Any remaining shortfall shall be allocated to each
     Series ratably based upon a fraction the numerator of which is the Investor
     Percentage used by such Series to allocate Default Amounts and the
     denominator of which is the sum of all such numerators of all Series
     outstanding (such allocated amount, the "Series Share" of such shortfall).
                                              ------------
     The Series Share of each series that specifies a Minimum Seller Percentage
     greater than zero shall be allocated to reduce the Minimum Seller Amount,
     and any Collections otherwise allocable to the Seller Amount or balance on
     deposit in the Excess Funding Account shall be available on a ratable basis
     to such Series to cover any shortfalls arising from such failure; provided
                                                                       --------
     to the extent the Seller Amount falls below zero, any portion of the Series
     Share of any such Series that is not covered as described above shall be
     allocated to such Series. The Series Share of each Series that specifies a
     Minimum Seller Percentage of zero shall be allocated to such Series.

     direction, notice, consent or waiver, only Investor Certificates which a
     Responsible Officer in the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee knows to
     be so owned shall be so disregarded. Investor Certificates so owned which

     Agent for a particular Series, if the Trustee determines in its sole
     discretion that the Paying Agent shall have failed to perform its
     obligations under this Agreement in any material respect. The Paying Agent,

     initially be the Trustee. The Trustee shall be permitted to resign as

     Trustee shall no longer be the Paying Agent, the Trustee shall appoint a
     successor. Each Paying Agent must be acceptable to Seller and the Servicer.

     has been made, within five Business Days after the receipt of such
     application. Such list shall be as of a date no more than 45 days prior to
     the date of receipt of such Applicants' request. Every Certificateholder,
     by receiving and holding a Certificate, agrees with the Trustee that
     neither the Trustee, the Transfer Agent and Registrar, nor any of their
     respective agents shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of
     any such information as to the names and addresses of the
     Certificateholders hereunder, regardless of the source from which such
     information was obtained.

     of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication
     on behalf of the Trustee by an authenticating agent and a certificate of

     agent. Each authenticating agent must be acceptable to Seller and the
     Servicer.

     notice of resignation to the Trustee and to Seller. The Trustee may at any
     time terminate the agency of an authenticating agent by giving notice of
     termination to such authenticating agent and to Seller. Upon receiving such
     a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time
     an authenticating agent shall cease to be acceptable to the Trustee or
     Seller or the Servicer, the Trustee promptly may appoint a successor
     authenticating agent. Any successor authenticating agent upon acceptance of
     its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers
     and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally
     named as an authenticating agent. No successor authenticating agent shall
     be appointed unless acceptable to the Trustee, Seller and the Servicer.

          (d) The Servicer agrees to pay each authenticating agent from time to
     time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section 6.8, and

     ------
     as Servicer under this Agreement and in and to the Receivables and the
     proceeds thereof (other than its rights and interest, if any, as holder of
     the Seller Interest under this Agreement). After receipt by the Servicer of
     such Termination Notice, and on the date that a Successor Servicer shall
     have been appointed by the Trustee pursuant to Section 10.2, all authority
                                                    ------------
     and power of the Servicer under this Agreement shall pass to and be vested

     otherwise, all documents and other instruments upon the failure of the
     Servicer to execute or deliver such documents or instruments, and to do and
     accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the
     purposes of such transfer of servicing rights. The Servicer agrees to
     cooperate with the Trustee and such Successor Servicer in effecting the
     termination of the responsibilities and rights of the Servicer to conduct
     servicing hereunder, including without limitation, the transfer to such
     Successor Servicer of all authority of the Servicer to service the
     Receivables provided for under this Agreement, including, without
     limitation, all authority over all Collections which shall on the date of
     transfer be held by the Servicer for deposit, or which have been deposited
     by the Servicer, in any Collection Account, Finance Charge Account or other
     Investor Account, or the Principal Account, or which shall thereafter be

     may reasonably request and shall promptly transfer to the Successor
     Servicer all other records, correspondence and documents necessary for the
     continued servicing of the Receivables in the manner and at such times as
     the Successor Servicer shall reasonably request. To the extent that

     The Servicer shall, on the date of any servicing transfer, transfer all of
     its rights and obligations, if any, in respect of any Enhancement to the
     Successor Servicer.

          Section 10.2 Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.
                       ----------------------------------------

          (a) On and after the receipt by the Servicer of a Termination Notice
     pursuant to Section 10.1, the Servicer shall continue to perform all
                 ------------
     servicing functions under this Agreement until the date specified in the
     Termination Notice or otherwise specified by the Trustee in writing or, if
     no such date is specified in such Termination Notice or otherwise specified
     by the Trustee, until a date mutually agreed upon by the Servicer and
     Trustee. The Trustee shall as promptly as possible after the giving of a
     Termination Notice appoint (with the consent of the Holders of Investor
     Certificates evidencing Undivided Interests aggregating greater than 50% of
     the Investor Amount of each Series) a successor servicer (the "Successor
                                                                    ---------
     Servicer"), and such Successor Servicer shall accept its appointment by a
     --------
     written assumption in a form acceptable to the Trustee. The Trustee may
     obtain bids from any potential successor servicer. If the Trustee is unable
     to obtain any bids from any potential successor servicer and the Servicer
     delivers an Officer's Certificate to the effect that it cannot in good
     faith cure the Servicer Default which gave rise to a transfer of servicing,
     then the Trustee shall offer Seller the right to accept retransfer of all
     the Receivables and Seller may accept retransfer of all the Receivables,
     provided, however, that if the long-term unsecured debt obligations of
     --------  -------
     Seller are not rated at the time of such purchase at least Baa-3 by Moody's
     and BBB- by Standard & Poor's, no such retransfer shall occur unless Seller
     shall deliver an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee
     that such retransfer would not constitute a fraudulent conveyance of
     Seller. The retransfer deposit amount for such a retransfer shall be equal
     to the higher of the sum of (i) the outstanding principal balance of the
     Investor Certificates, plus accrued interest thereon, at the Certificate
     Rate, through the date of retransfer and (ii) the average bid price quoted
     by two recognized dealers for a similar security rated in the highest
     rating category by Moody's and Standard & Poor's and having a remaining
     maturity substantially similar to the remaining maturity of the
     Certificates. In the event that a Successor Servicer has not been appointed
     and has not accepted its appointment at the time when the Servicer ceases
     to act as Servicer, the Trustee without further action shall automatically
     be appointed the Successor Servicer. Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee
     shall, if it is legally unable so to act, petition a court of competent
     jurisdiction to appoint any established financial institution having a net
     worth of not less than $100,000,000 and whose regular business includes the
     servicing of installment sales charge, credit and/or credit card account
     receivables as the Successor Servicer hereunder.

          (b) Upon its appointment, the Successor Servicer shall be the
     successor in all respects to the Servicer with respect to servicing
     functions under this Agreement and shall be subject to all the
     responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto placed on the
     Servicer by the terms and provisions hereof, and all references in this
     Agreement to the Servicer shall be deemed to refer to the Successor
     Servicer. Any Successor Servicer, by its acceptance of its appointment,
     will

                                       73

<PAGE>

     automatically agree to be bound by the terms and provisions of any
     Enhancement to the extent that such terms apply to the Servicer.

          (c) In connection with such appointment and assumption, the Trustee
     shall be entitled to such compensation, or may make such arrangements for
     the compensation of the Successor Servicer out of Collections, as it and
     such Successor Servicer shall agree; provided, however, that no such
                                          --------  -------
     compensation shall be in excess of the Monthly Servicing Fees permitted to
     the Servicer pursuant to Section 3.2. The holder of the Seller Interest
                              -----------
     agrees that if the Servicer is terminated hereunder, it will agree, at the
     request of the Trustee or any Successor Servicer, to deposit a portion of
     the Collections in respect of Finance Charge Receivables that it is
     entitled to receive pursuant to Article IV, to pay its share of the
                                     ----------
     compensation of the Successor Servicer. Notwithstanding anything to the
     contrary in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, any deposit
     by the Seller pursuant to this Section 10.2(c) shall only be made to the
                                    ---------------
     extent the Seller has funds available for such purpose after amounts
     payable to Securityholders (as defined in the Receivables Purchase
     Agreement) have been paid in full. Each party hereto agrees that the
     failure to make such deposit shall not give rise to any claim against the
     Seller.

          (d) All authority and power granted to the Successor Servicer under
     this Agreement shall automatically cease and terminate upon termination of
     the Trust pursuant to Section 12.1 and shall pass to and be vested in
                           ------------
     Seller and, without limitation, Seller is hereby authorized and empowered
     to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Successor Servicer, as
     attorney-in-fact or otherwise, all documents and other instruments, and to
     do and accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to
     effect the purposes of such transfer of servicing rights. The Successor
     Servicer agrees to cooperate with Seller in effecting the termination of
     the responsibilities and rights of the Successor Servicer to conduct
     servicing on the Receivables. The Successor Servicer shall transfer its
     electronic records relating to the Receivables to Seller in such electronic
     form as Seller may reasonably request and shall transfer all other records,
     correspondence and documents to Seller in the manner and at such times as
     Seller shall reasonably request. To the extent that compliance with this
     Section 10.2 shall require the Successor Servicer to disclose to Seller
     ------------
     information of any kind which the Successor Servicer deems to be
     confidential, Seller shall be required to enter into such customary
     licensing and confidentiality agreements as the Successor Servicer shall
     deem necessary to protect its interests.

          Section 10.3 Notification to Certificateholders. Upon the occurrence
                       ----------------------------------
     of any Servicer Default, the Servicer shall give prompt written notice
     thereof to the Trustee and the Trustee shall give notice to the Investor
     Certificateholders at their respective addresses appearing in the
     Certificate Register. Upon any termination or appointment of a Successor
     Servicer pursuant to this Article X, the Trustee shall give prompt written
                               ---------
     notice thereof to Investor Certificateholders at their respective

                                       74

     addresses appearing in the Certificate Register. A copy of any notice given
     pursuant to this Section 10.3 shall be delivered to each Rating Agency.

          Section 10.4 Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of Investor
                       -----------------------
     Certificates evidencing Undivided Interests aggregating greater than 50% of
     the Investor Amount of any Series affected thereby may, on behalf of all
     Holders of Certificates, waive any default by the Servicer or Seller in the
     performance of its obligations hereunder and its consequences, except a
     default in the failure to make any required deposits or payments in
     accordance with Article IV, provided, however, that no such waiver shall
                     ----------  --------  -------
     affect any rights of, or obligations to, any Enhancement Provider
     hereunder. Upon any such waiver of a past default, such default shall cease
     to exist, and any default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been
     remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend
     to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon
     except to the extent expressly so waived. Notice of any such waiver shall
     be given to each Rating Agency by the Servicer.

          Section 11.1 Duties of Trustee.
                       -----------------

          (a) The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of a Servicer Default and
     after the curing of all Servicer Defaults which may have occurred,
     undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically
     set forth in this Agreement. If a Servicer Default has occurred (which has
     not been cured or waived), the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights
     and powers vested in it by this Agreement, and use the same degree of care
     and skill in the exercise of such rights and powers, as a prudent person
     would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such
     person's own affairs.

          (b) The Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates,
     statements, opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments
     furnished to the Trustee which are specifically required to be furnished
     pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, shall examine them to
     determine whether they conform to the requirements of this Agreement. The
     Trustee shall give prompt written notice to the Certificateholders of any
     material lack of conformity of any such instrument to the applicable
     requirements of this Agreement discovered by the Trustee which would
     entitle a specified percentage of the Certificateholders to take any action
     pursuant to this Agreement.

                                       75

<PAGE>

          (c) Subject to subsection 11.1(a), no provision of this Agreement
                         ------------------
     shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own
     negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own misconduct;
     provided, however, that:
     --------  -------

               (i) the Trustee shall not be personally liable for an error of
          judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible
          Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee
          was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

               (ii) the Trustee shall not be personally liable with respect to
          any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith
          in accordance with the direction of the Holders of Investor
          Certificates evidencing Undivided Interests aggregating more than 50%
          of the Investor Amount of any Series relating to the time, method and
          place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
          Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee,
          under this Agreement; and

               (iii) the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any
          failure by the Servicer to comply with the obligations of the Servicer
          referred to in clauses (b), (c) and (d) of Section 10.1 unless a
                         -----------  ---     ---    ------------
          Responsible Officer of the Trustee obtains actual knowledge of such
          failure or the Trustee receives written notice of such failure from
          the Servicer or any Holders of Investor Certificates evidencing
          Undivided Interests aggregating not less than 10% of the Investor
          Amount of any Series.

          (d) The Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds
     or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its
     duties hereunder, or in exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there
     is reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of such funds or
     adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured
     to it, and none of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall in any
     event require the Trustee to perform, or be responsible for the manner of
     performance of, any of the obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement
     except during such time, if any, as the Trustee shall be the successor to,
     and be vested with the rights, duties, powers and privileges of, the
     Servicer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (e) Except for actions expressly authorized by this Agreement, the
     Trustee shall take no action reasonably likely to impair the interests of
     the Trust in any Receivable now existing or hereafter arising or to impair
     the value of any Receivable now existing or hereafter arising.

          (f) Except as provided in Section 2.6, the Trustee shall have no power
                                    -----------
     to vary the corpus of the Trust including, without limitation, the power to
     (i) accept any substitute obligation for a Receivable initially assigned to
     the Trust under Section 2.1

     or 2.6, (ii) add any other investment, obligation or security to the Trust
        ---
     or (iii) withdraw from the Trust any Receivables, except for a withdrawal
     permitted under subsection 2.4(d) or 2.4(e), Article IV, or Section 9.2 or
                     -----------------    ------  ----------     -----------
     12.1.
     ----

          (g) In the event that the Paying Agent or the Transfer Agent and
     Registrar shall fail to perform any obligation, duty or agreement in the
     manner or on the day required to be performed by the Paying Agent or the
     Transfer Agent and Registrar, as the case may be, under this Agreement, the
     Trustee shall be obligated promptly to perform such obligation, duty or
     agreement in the manner so required.

          (h) If Seller has agreed to transfer any of its credit card
     receivables (other than the Receivables) to another Person, upon the
     written request of Seller, the Trustee will enter into such intercreditor
     agreements with the transferee of such receivables as are customary and
     necessary separately to identify the rights of the Trust and such other
     Person in Seller's, as the case may be, credit card receivables; provided,
                                                                      --------

                       -------------------------------------------
     covenants and agrees to pay to the Trustee from time to time, and the

     not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a
     trustee of an express trust) for all services rendered by it in the
     execution of the Trust hereby created and in the exercise and performance
     of any of the powers and duties hereunder of the Trustee, and, subject to

     all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the
     Trustee in accordance with any of the provisions of this Agreement
     (including the reasonable fees and expenses of its agents and counsel)
     except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from its
     negligence or bad faith and except as provided in the following sentence.

     authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a
     combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 and subject to
     supervision or examination by Federal or state authority. If such
     corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to
     law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining
     authority, then for the purpose of this Section 11.6, the combined capital
                                             ------------
     and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital
     and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so
     published. In addition, no institution shall qualify as a Successor Trustee
     hereunder unless its long-term debt obligations are rated at least BBB- and
     Baa3 by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively. In case at any time
     the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of
     this Section 11.6, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and
          ------------
     with the effect specified in Section 11.7.

          (a) The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the

     appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy
     of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one
     copy to the successor trustee. If no successor trustee shall have been so
     appointed and have accepted within 30 days after the giving of

                                       79

<PAGE>

     such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of
     competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee.

          (b) If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in
     accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6 and shall fail to resign
                                       ------------
     after written request therefor by Seller, or if at any time the Trustee
     shall be legally unable to act, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or
     insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be
     appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the
     Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation,
     conservation or liquidation, then Seller may, but shall not be required to,
     remove the Trustee and promptly appoint a successor trustee by written
     instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered
     to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee.

          (c) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a
     successor trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 11.7

     shall not become effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor
     trustee as provided in Section 11.8 and any liability of the Trustee
                            ------------
     arising hereunder shall survive such appointment of a successor trustee.

                       -----------------

          (a) Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 11.7 shall
                                                             ------------
     execute, acknowledge and deliver to Seller and to its predecessor Trustee
     an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the
     resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee shall become effective
     and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance,
     shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and
     obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally
     named as Trustee herein. The predecessor Trustee shall deliver to the
     successor trustee all documents and statements held by it hereunder; and
     Seller and the predecessor Trustee shall execute and deliver such
     instruments and do such other things as may reasonably be required for
     fully and certainly vesting and confirming in the successor trustee all
     such rights, powers, duties and obligations.

          (b) No successor trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this
     Section 11.8 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee
     ------------
     shall be eligible under the provisions of Section 11.6.
                                               ------------

          (c) Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided

     in the Certificate Register, and also to each Rating Agency.

     consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or
     consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any Person
     succeeding to the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the

                        ---------------------------------------------

          (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, at any
     time, for the purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction
     in which any part of the Trust may at the time be located, the Trustee
     shall have the power and may execute and deliver all instruments to appoint
     one or more Persons to act as a co-trustee or co-trustees, or separate
     trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the Trust, and to vest
     in such Person or Persons, in such capacity and for the benefit of the
     Certificateholders, such title to the Trust, or any part thereof, and,
     subject to the other provisions of this Section 11.10, such powers, duties,
                                             -------------
     obligations, rights and trusts as the Trustee may consider necessary or
     desirable. No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be required to
     meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee under Section 11.6 and
                                                                ------------
     no notice to Certificateholders of the appointment of any co-trustee or
     separate trustee shall be required under Section 11.8.
                                              ------------

          (b) Every separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent
     permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the following provisions
     and conditions:

               (i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or
          imposed upon the Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and
          exercised or performed by the Trustee and such separate trustee or
          co-trustee jointly (it being understood that such separate trustee or
          co-trustee is not authorized to act separately without the Trustee
          joining in such act), except to the extent that under any laws of any
          jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed
          (whether as Trustee hereunder or as successor to the Servicer
          hereunder), the Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform
          such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and
          obligations (including the holding of title to the Trust or any
          portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and
          performed singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee, but solely at
          the direction of the Trustee;

               (ii) no trustee hereunder shall be liable by reason of any act or
          omission of any other trustee hereunder; and

                                       81

<PAGE>

               (iii) the Trustee may at any time accept the resignation of or
          remove any separate trustee or co-trustee.

          (c) Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee shall be
     deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and
     co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument
     appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement
     and the conditions of this Article XI. Each separate trustee and
                                ----------
     co-trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested
     with the estates or property specified in its instrument of appointment,
     either jointly with the Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein,
     subject to all the provisions of this Agreement, specifically including
     every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the
     liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee. Every such
     instrument shall be filed with the Trustee and a copy thereof given to the
     Servicer.

          (d) Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time constitute the
     Trustee its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the
     extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect to
     this Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or
     co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all
     of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and
     be exercised by the Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the
     appointment of a new or successor trustee.

          Section 11.11 Tax Returns. In the event the Trust shall be required to
                        -----------
     file tax returns, the Trustee, as soon as practicable after it is made
     aware of such requirement, shall prepare or cause to be prepared and is
     authorized hereunder to sign any tax returns required to be filed by the
     Trust and, to the extent possible, shall file such returns at least five
     days before such returns are due to be filed. The Servicer shall prepare or
     shall cause to be prepared all tax information required by law to be
     distributed to Certificateholders and shall deliver such information to the
     Trustee at least five days prior to the date it is required by law to be
     distributed to Certificateholders. The Servicer, upon request, will furnish
     the Trustee with all such information known to the Servicer as may be
     reasonably required in connection with the preparation of all tax returns
     of the Trust. In no event shall the Trustee or the Servicer be liable for
     any liabilities, costs or expenses of the Trust, the Investor
     Certificateholders or the Certificate Owners arising under any tax law,
     including without limitation Federal, state or local income or excise taxes
     or any other tax imposed on or measured by income (or any interest or
     penalty with respect thereto or arising from a failure to comply
     therewith). Nothing in this Section 11.11 shall be construed as
                                 -------------
     inconsistent with the characterization of the Investor Certificates as
     indebtedness of Seller for purposes of federal, state and local income or
     franchise taxes and any other tax imposed upon or measured by income, as
     expressed in Section 3.7.

     Certificates may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the
     possession of any of the Certificates or the production thereof in any
     proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the

     agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Certificateholders in
     respect of which such judgment has been obtained.

     Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the
     Trustee being advised by counsel determines that the action so directed may
     not lawfully be taken, or if the Trustee in good faith shall, by a
     Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, determine that
     the proceedings so directed would be illegal or involve it in personal
     liability or be unduly prejudicial to the rights of Certificateholders not
     parties to such direction; and provided further that nothing in this
                                    -------- -------

          (a) If so provided in any Supplement, Seller may, but shall not be
     obligated to, repurchase Investor Certificates of the related Series by
     depositing into the Distribution Account, on the Transfer Date preceding
     the Distribution Date specified in such Supplement, the amount so specified
     therein; provided, however, that if the long-term unsecured debt

     purchase shall not occur unless Seller shall deliver an Opinion of Counsel
     reasonably acceptable to the Trustee that such purchase of Investor
     Certificates would not constitute a fraudulent conveyance by Seller. On the
     Distribution Date following the Transfer Date on which such deposit is
     made, Seller shall be deemed, automatically and without requirement for any
     act on the part of Seller or of such Series any other Person, to have
     acquired all outstanding Certificates and to have retired the Certificates,
     thereby resulting in an increase in the Seller Amount.

          (b) The entire Investor Amount with respect to each Series shall be
     due and payable no later than the related Series Termination Date. If on
     the Determination Date in the month immediately preceding the month in
     which the Series Termination Date for any Series occurs (after giving
     effect to all transfers, withdrawals, deposits and drawings to occur on the
     next Transfer Date and the payment of principal on the Investor
     Certificates to be made on the related Distribution Date), the Investor
     Amount would be greater than zero, the Servicer shall sell, dispose of, or
     otherwise liquidate, in a commercially reasonable manner and on
     commercially reasonable terms (which shall include the solicitation of
     competitive bids from Persons who are not Affiliates of Seller), within 30
     days of such Determination Date, an amount of Receivables equal to (i)
     100%, plus the lesser of (A) the Seller Percentage or (B) the Minimum
     Seller Percentage for that Series, multiplied by (ii) the Investor Amount
     determined as of the date of such sale, disposition or liquidation;
     provided, however, that the Servicer shall give Seller at least 10 days
     --------  -------
     advance written notice of such sale, disposition or other liquidation.
     Seller shall have the option, exercisable at any time after the Servicer
     has obtained an offer from any Person that is not an Affiliate of Seller
     and prior to the consummation of such sale, disposition or liquidation by
     giving notice of the exercise thereof to the Servicer, to purchase such
     Receivables for cash (payable in immediately payable funds on the Series
     Termination Date) for the lesser of (i) 100% of the amount of such
     Receivables, or (ii) the highest price offered therefor pursuant to such
     proposed sale, disposition or other liquidation. The proceeds received upon
     the sale, disposition or other liquidation of such Receivables in an amount
     up to (i) the Investor Amount on the Series Termination Date, plus (ii)

     Certificates in final payment thereof pursuant to the terms of Section
                                                                    -------

     proceeds which are allocable to Finance Charge Receivables and the amount
     of such proceeds which are allocable to Principal Receivables. In the event
     that the proceeds received upon the sale, disposition or other liquidation
     of such Receivables is less than the result of (i) the

     unpaid interest thereon, minus (iii) amounts on deposit on such date in the
                              -----
     related Series Accounts, the Servicer will make a withdrawal or drawing or
     take other action permitted by any applicable Enhancement, and shall
     deposit all amounts thereby obtained in the Distribution Account on the
     Final Trust Termination Date, and the amount so withdrawn shall be
     distributed to the Holders of Certificates in final payment thereof
     pursuant to the terms of Section 12.3; provided, that if the Servicer fails
                              ------------  --------
     to make such withdrawal or drawing or take such other action, then the
     Trustee may make such withdrawal and deposit such amounts into the
     Distribution Account.

          (c) The amount deposited pursuant to subsections 12.2(a) and 12.2(b)
                                               -------------------     -------

     Date upon which the Investor Certificateholders may surrender their
     Certificates for payment of the final distribution and cancellation, shall
     be given (subject to at least two days' prior notice from the Servicer to
     the Trustee) by the Trustee to Investor Certificateholders mailed (unless
     otherwise specified in a Supplement) not later than the fifth day of the

     payment of the Investor Certificates will be made upon presentation and
     surrender of Investor Certificates at the office or offices therein
     designated, (b) the amount of any such final payment and (c) that the
     Record Date otherwise applicable to such Distribution Date is not
     applicable, payments being made only upon presentation and surrender of the
     Investor Certificates at the office or offices therein specified. The
     Servicer's notice to the Trustee in accordance with the preceding sentence
     shall be accompanied by an Officer's Certificate setting forth the
     information specified in Section 3.5 covering the period during the then
                              -----------
     current calendar year through the date of such notice. The Trustee shall
     give such notice to the Transfer Agent and Registrar and the Paying Agent
     at the time such notice is given to Investor Certificateholders.

     Trust pursuant to Section 12.1 (and notwithstanding such termination),

     shall continue to be held in trust for the benefit of the
     Certificateholders and the Paying Agent or the Trustee shall pay such funds
     to the appropriate Certificateholders upon surrender of their Certificates.
     In the event that all of the Investor Certificateholders shall not
     surrender their Certificates for cancellation within six months after the
     date specified in the above-mentioned written notice, the Trustee shall
     give a second written notice to the remaining Investor Certificateholders
     to surrender their Certificates for

     cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect thereto. If
     within one year after the second notice all the Investor Certificates shall
     not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Trustee may take
     appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to
     contact the remaining Investor Certificateholders concerning surrender of
     their Certificates, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the funds in
     the Distribution Account held for the benefit of such Investor
     Certificateholders.

     of Counsel to the effect that such amendment (A) would permit the Trust or
     a relevant portion thereof to be treated as a FASIT, (B) would not cause
     the Trust to be classified as an association (or publicly traded
     partnership) taxable as a corporation for Federal income tax purposes, and

     Certificateholders under this Section 13.1 to approve the particular form
                                   ------------
     of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall
     approve the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents and of

     Certificateholders shall be subject to such reasonable requirements as the
     Trustee may prescribe.

     and the Collections, Recoveries and other proceeds (as defined in the UCC
     as in effect in the applicable jurisdiction) thereof, and Insurance
     Proceeds relating to such Receivables, upon such creation, the Trust shall

                                                 Pooling and Servicing Agreement

             PROVISIONS TO BE INCLUDED IN OPINION OF COUNSEL TO BE
              DELIVERED PURSUANT TO SUBSECTION 2.6(c)(vii) OF THE
              AMENDED AND RESTATED POOLING AND SERVICING AGREEMENT
              ----------------------------------------------------

          The opinions set forth below may be subject to certain qualifications,
     assumptions, limitations and exceptions taken or made in the opinion of
     FCNB's counsel with respect to similar matters delivered on the Initial
     Closing Date.

          1. The Transfer Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
     delivered by the Seller and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
     agreement of Seller, enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its
     terms.

          2. If the Transfer Agreement constitutes a valid transfer and
     assignment of the Receivables and all rights to security for such
     Receivables and the proceeds thereof (including without limitation rights
     to bank accounts or certificates of deposit pledged as collateral) in the
     Additional Accounts (the "Collateral"), Financing Statements having been
                               ----------
     filed in the offices of the Secretaries of State of the States of Delaware
     and Oregon, and in Washington, D.C., the Trustee has acquired (based upon
     certificates of Seller to the effect that (a) Seller acquired the
     Collateral pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, (b) Seller has
     not transferred any interest in the Collateral other than to the Trustee or
     caused any lien to be imposed upon the Receivables, and (c) Seller will
     acquire pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement all Collateral
     subsequently created in the Additional Accounts) free and clear of any Lien
     or interest of any Person except for (x) Liens permitted under subsection
     2.5(b) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (y) the interest of the
     Holder of the Seller Interest, and (z) Seller's right to receive interest
     accruing on, and investment earnings in respect of, the Collection
     Subaccounts and the Collection Sub-subaccounts as provided in the Amended
     and Restated Pooling and Servicing Agreement (the "Pooling and Servicing
     Agreement")) all right, title and interest of Seller in the Trust Assets
     free and clear of any Lien or interest of any Person, except for (x) Liens
     permitted under subsection 2.5(b) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
     (y) the interest of the Holder of the Seller Interest, and (z) Seller's
     right to receive interest accruing on, and investment earnings in respect
     of, the Collection Subaccounts and the Collection Sub-subaccounts as
     provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

          3. If the Transfer Agreement does not constitute a valid transfer and
     assignment of the Collateral, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as
     amended by the Transfer Agreement creates a valid security interest in
     favor of the Trustee for

                                      B-1

<PAGE>

     the benefit of the Investor Certificateholders in such Collateral. The
     Financing Statements having been filed in the Offices of the Secretaries of
     State of the States of Delaware and Oregon, and in Washington, D.C., the
     Trust, for the benefit of the Investor Certificateholders has a first
     priority perfected security interest in the Collateral now existing and
     hereafter created. Such perfection and priority of the Trustee for the
     benefit of the Investor Certificateholders in such Receivables, and the
     proceeds thereof, would not be affected by an increase or decrease in the
     relative interests in the Receivables of the Holder of the Seller Interest
     and of the Investor Certificateholders. Such perfection and priority would
     be enforceable against Seller notwithstanding the insolvency of Seller,
     except that such counsel need express no opinion as to the effect of
     Section 9-315 of the UCC as in effect in the applicable jurisdiction with
     respect to Proceeds held by Seller upon its insolvency.

          4. No filings or other action, other than the filing of the financing
     statement(s) referred to in such opinion (the "Financing Statements") with
     respect to the Trust's security interest in such Collateral and the
     proceeds thereof, in the Offices of the Secretaries of State of the States
     of Delaware and Oregon, and in Washington, D.C., are necessary to perfect
     or continue the perfected status of the security or other interest of the
     Trust in the Collateral designated by the Transfer Agreement, and the
     proceeds thereof, against third parties, except that appropriate
     continuation statements with respect to the Financing Statements be filed
     at five-year intervals to continue the perfection of such security
     interest.

          5. In the course of such counsel's representation of Seller in
     connection with this matter, and without independent investigation, such
     counsel has not become aware of (a) any type of right, lien or interest of
     any government or agency or instrumentality thereof or any lien arising by
     operation of law which might be asserted against the Collateral designated
     by the Transfer Agreement or the proceeds thereof in particular
     circumstances other than a tax lien or a lien arising under ERISA, (b) any
     such right, lien or interest which has been so asserted, or (c) any lien
     arising by operation of law or any attachment or execution lien which has
     been asserted against the Collateral designated by the Transfer Agreement
     or the proceeds thereof.

          6. The transfer of the Collateral to the Trust would not constitute a
     fraudulent conveyance of Seller; provided, that this opinion numbered 6
     need not be delivered if the short-term unsecured debt obligations of FCNB
     are rated at the time of such transfer at least P-3 by Moody's.

          7. Based on certificates of Seller to the effect of the following, to
     the best of the knowledge of counsel, (a) Seller acquired the Collateral
     pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, (b) Seller has not
     transferred any interest in the Collateral other than to the Trustee or
     caused any lien to be imposed upon the Collateral, and (c) Seller will
     acquire pursuant to the Receivables Purchase

                                      B-2

<PAGE>

     Agreement all Collateral subsequently created in the Additional Accounts
     free and clear of any Lien or interest of any Person except for (x) Liens
     permitted under subsection 2.5(b) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
     (y) the interest of the Holder of the Seller Interest, and (z) Seller's
     right to receive interest accruing on, and investment earnings in respect
     of, the Collection Subaccounts and the Collection Sub-subaccounts as
     provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

                            PROVISIONS TO BE INCLUDED
                          IN ANNUAL OPINION OF COUNSEL
                          ----------------------------

          The opinions set forth below, which are to be delivered pursuant to
     subsection 13.2(d) of the Amended and Restated Pooling and Servicing
     Agreement ("Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), may be subject to certain
     qualifications, assumptions, limitations, and exceptions taken or made in
     the opinion of counsel to FCNB with respect to similar matters delivered on
     the Initial Closing Date.

          1. If the Pooling and Servicing Agreement constitutes a valid transfer
     and assignment of the Trust Assets, the Financing Statements having been
     filed in the offices of the Secretaries of State of the States of Delaware
     and Oregon, and in Washington, D.C., the Trustee has acquired (based upon
     certificates of Seller to the effect that (a) Seller acquired the
     Receivables and all rights to security for such Receivables and the
     proceeds thereof (including without limitation rights to bank accounts or
     certificates of deposit pledged as collateral) (the "Collateral") pursuant
                                                          ----------
     to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, (b) Seller has not transferred any
     interest in the Collateral other than to the Trustee or caused any lien to
     be imposed upon the Collateral, and (c) Seller will acquire pursuant to the
     Receivables Purchase Agreement all Collateral subsequently created in the
     Additional Accounts free and clear of any Lien or interest of any Person
     except for (x) Liens permitted under subsection 2.5(b) of the Pooling and
     Servicing Agreement, (y) the interest of the Holder of the Seller Interest,
     and (z) Seller's right to receive interest accruing on, and investment
     earnings in respect of, the Collection Subaccounts and the Collection
     Sub-subaccounts as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) all
     right, title and interest of Seller in the Trust Assets free and clear of
     any Lien or interest of any Person, except for (x) Liens permitted under
     subsection 2.5(b) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (y) the interest
     of the Holder of the Seller Interest, and (z) Seller's right to receive
     interest accruing on, and investment earnings in respect of, the Collection
     Subaccounts and the Collection Sub-subaccounts as provided in the Pooling
     and Servicing Agreement.

          2. If the Pooling and Servicing Agreement does not constitute a valid
     transfer and assignment of all right, title, and interest in the Trust
     Assets, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement creates a valid security
     interest in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Investor
     Certificateholders in the Trust Assets. The Financing Statements having
     been filed in the offices of the Secretaries of State of the States of
     Delaware and Oregon, and in Washington, D.C., the Trust, for the benefit of
     the Investor Certificateholders has a first priority perfected security
     interest in that

                                      G-1

<PAGE>

     portion of the Trust Assets that consists of the Collateral now existing
     and hereafter created (other than Collateral in Additional Accounts), and
     all monies due or to become due with respect thereto, including the
     proceeds thereof. Such perfection and priority of the Trustee for the
     benefit of the Investor Certificateholders in such Collateral, and the
     proceeds thereof, would not be affected by an increase or decrease in the
     relative interests in the Collateral of the Holder of the Seller Interest
     and of the Investor Certificateholders. Such perfection and priority would
     be enforceable against Seller notwithstanding the insolvency of Seller
     except that such counsel need express no opinion as to the effect of
     Section 9-315 of the UCC as in effect in the applicable jurisdiction with
     respect to proceeds held by Seller upon its insolvency.

          3. No filings or other action, other than the filing of the financing
     statement(s) referred to in such opinion (the "Financing Statements") with
     respect to the Trust's interest in the Collateral and the proceeds thereof
     in the Offices of the Secretaries of State of the States of Delaware and
     Oregon, and in Washington, D.C., are necessary to perfect or continue the
     perfected status of the interest of the Trust in the Collateral and the
     proceeds thereof against third parties, except that appropriate
     continuation statements with respect to the Financing Statement(s) must be
     filed at five-year intervals.

          4. In the course of such counsel's representation of Seller in
     connection with this matter, and without independent investigation, such
     counsel has not become aware of (a) any type of right, lien, or interest of
     any government or agency or instrumentality thereof or any lien arising by
     operation of law which might be asserted against the Collateral or the
     proceeds arising under ERISA, (b) any such right, lien or interest which
     has been so asserted or (c) any lien arising by operation of law or any
     attachment or execution lien which had been asserted against the Collateral
     or the proceeds thereof.

                   PERFECTION REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                   -----------------------------------------

          In addition to the representations, warranties and covenants contained
     in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, Seller hereby represents, warrants
     and covenants to the Trust as follows:

          (1) The Pooling and Servicing Agreement creates either (A) a valid
     transfer to the Trust of all right, title and interest of Seller in, to and
     under (i) the Receivables conveyed to the Seller pursuant to the
     Receivables Purchase Agreement and (ii) all rights to security for such
     Receivables (including without limitation rights to bank accounts or
     certificates of deposit pledged as collateral) (the "Obligor Collateral"
                                                          ------------------
     and, together with the Receivables, the "Collateral") , and the Collateral
                                              ----------
     will be held by the Trust free and clear of any Lien, except for (w) the
     interests of the Trustee, the Certificateholders and the Enhancement
     Providers, (x) Liens permitted pursuant to paragraph 3 below, or (y) the
     interests of the Seller as holder of the Seller Interest or (B) a valid and
     continuing security interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in the
     Collateral in favor of the Trust, which security interest is prior to all
     other Liens, and is enforceable as such against creditors of and purchasers
     from the Seller (other than Liens permitted pursuant to paragraph 3 below).

          (2) The Receivables constitute "accounts" within the meaning of the
     applicable UCC. The Obligor Collateral constitutes security interests on
     personal property securing certain of those accounts, and the creation and
     perfection of a security interest in such security interests is governed by
     Sections 9-203(g) and 9- 308(e), respectively, of the applicable UCC.

          (3) Immediately prior to the conveyance of, or the grant of the
     security interest in, the Collateral pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing
     Agreement, Seller owns and has good and marketable title to the Collateral,
     and a valid, perfected security interest in the collateral for the
     Receivables in any secured Accounts, in each case, free and clear of any
     Lien, claim or encumbrance of any Person; provided that nothing in this
     paragraph 3 shall prevent or be deemed to prohibit Seller from suffering to
     exist upon any of the Collateral any Liens for any taxes if such taxes
     shall not at the time be due and payable or if FCNB or Seller, as
     applicable, shall currently be contesting the validity thereof in good
     faith by appropriate proceedings and shall have set aside on its books
     adequate reserves with respect thereto.

          (4) Seller has caused, or will have caused within 10 days, the filing
     of all appropriate financing statements in the proper filing office in the
     appropriate

     jurisdictions under applicable law in order to perfect the security
     interest in the Collateral granted to the Trust under the Pooling and
     Servicing Agreement.

          (5) Other than the security interest granted to the Trust pursuant to
     the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, Seller has not pledged, assigned,
     sold, granted a security interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the
     Collateral. Seller has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of any
     financing statements against Seller that include a description of
     collateral covering the Collateral.

          (6) Seller is not aware of any judgment, ERISA or tax lien filings
     against Seller.

          (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Pooling and Servicing
     Agreement, the representations and warranties set forth in this Schedule 2
                                                                     ----------
     shall be continuing, and remain in full force and effect, until such time
     as all Certificates have been finally and fully paid and shall survive the
     transfer of the Trust Assets to the Trust under the Pooling and Servicing
     Agreement and the termination of the rights and obligations of the Servicer
     pursuant to Article X thereof. The parties to the Pooling and Servicing
                 ---------
     Agreement shall not, without satisfying the Rating Agency Condition, waive
     a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in this Schedule 2. In
                                                                  ----------
     order to evidence the interests of Seller and the Trust under the Pooling
     and Servicing Agreement, Seller and Servicer shall take such action, or
     execute and deliver such instruments (other than filing financing
     statements) as may be necessary or advisable (including, without
     limitation, such actions as are requested by Indenture Trustee) to maintain
     and perfect, as a first priority interest, Seller's or the Trust's security
     interest in the Collateral. The Servicer shall, from time to time and
     within the time limits established by law, prepare and present to the
     Trustee for the Trustee's authorization and approval all financing
     statements, amendments, continuations or initial financing statements in
     lieu of a continuation statement, or other filings necessary to continue,
     maintain and perfect as a first-priority interest. The Trustee's approval
     of such filings shall authorize the Servicer to file such financing
     statements under the UCC without the signature of Seller or Trustee where
     allowed by applicable law. Notwithstanding anything else in the Pooling and
     Servicing Agreement to the contrary, the Servicer shall not have any
     authority to file a termination, partial termination, release, partial
     release, or any amendment that deletes the name of a debtor or excludes
     collateral of any such financing statements, without the prior written
     consent of the Trustee. The Trustee may require, prior to authorizing or
     filing any such termination, partial termination, release, partial release
     or amendment, that Servicer provide an Opinion of Counsel that such filings
     are authorized under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
