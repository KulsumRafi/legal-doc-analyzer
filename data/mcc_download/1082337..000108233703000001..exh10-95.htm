<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M9"></A>A.&#9;Pursuant to that certain Multi-
Tenant Industrial Gross Lease dated November 25, 1998, as amended by the
Amendment No. 1 to Multi-Tenant Industrial Gross Lease dated November 25, 1998
(the &quot;<B>Master Lease</B>&quot;), Glenborough Properties, L.P., successor

the first floor of the Building located at 5875 Arnold Road, Dublin, CA, 94568
(the &quot;<B>Building</B>&quot;).<B> </B>The Master Lease provides, among other
things, that all or any portion of the Master Lease Premises may not be
subleased without the prior written consent of the Master Landlord, which
consent shall be in form satisfactory to Landlord, Sublandlord, and Subtenant
(&quot;<B>Landlord's Consent</B>&quot;). <B> </B>A copy of the Master Lease is
attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference.  Any
capitalized terms used in this Sublease but not defined herein shall have the
meanings attributed to them in the Master Lease.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M10"></A>B.&#9;Subtenant wishes to sublease from

2002 or sooner if agreed to by Sublandlord and Subtenant, as stated in a
memorandum of Sublease Commencement signed by both Sublandlord and Subtenant.
The Subleased Premises are particularly identified and described on the floor

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M11"></A>C.&#9;In addition, Subtenant also
wishes to lease from Sublandlord, and Sublandlord wishes to lease to Subtenant,
certain equipment and other items (the &quot;<B>Equipment</B>&quot;) presently
located in the Subleased Premises.  The Equipment and the terms and conditions
are more particularly described in Exhibit C, which is attached hereto and
incorporated herein by reference.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M12"></A>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged by the parties, Sublandlord and
Subtenant, hereby agree as follows:</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M13"></A>1.&#9;<U>Sublease of Subleased
Premises</U>.  Subject to Sublandlord first obtaining the Landlord's Consent to
this Sublease, Sublandlord hereby subleases to Subtenant and Subtenant hereby
subleases from Sublandlord for the Sublease Term (as defined in Section 2
hereof), at the rental, and upon all of the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Subleased Premises.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M14"></A>2.&#9;<U>
                                                Sublease Term</U>.  The term of
this Sublease (&quot;<B>Sublease Term</B>&quot;) shall commence on December 14,
2002 or such earlier date as stated in a memorandum of Sublease Commencement
signed by both Sublandlord and Subtenant (the &quot;<B>Commencement
Date</B>&quot;) and expire, unless sooner terminated as provided herein, on
March 24, 2004 (the &quot;<B>Expiration Date</B>&quot;); provided, however, that
the Expiration Date shall be extended to March 30, 2004 if Subtenant gives
Sublandlord notice of the exercise of its option to purchase the Equipment, as
set forth in Exhibit C, on or before February 1, 2004.
<A NAME="_DV_M15"></A></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;<U>Subrental</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M16"></A>&#9;(a)&#9;<U>Rent Payments for

obligation to pay the Rent and any other sums Subtenant is obligated to pay
shall commence on April 1, 2003 and shall continue on a monthly basis under the

set-off or deduction except as expressly set forth herein, in advance on the
first day of each calendar month (the &quot;<B>Due Date</B>&quot;) beginning
on<B> </B>April 1, 2003.  If any Due Date shall fall due on a Saturday, Sunday
or legal holiday, the Rent payment shall be made on the next business day.  Rent
under this Sublease is a fixed amount, and is not subject to adjustment under
Sections 5,6 or 7 of the Master Lease. In the event Sublandlord is entitled to
rent abatement under the Master Lease (or otherwise) due to a casualty event or
failure to provide the Master Premises with services (each, an &quot;Abatement
Event&quot;), then, to the extent such Abatement Event impacts the Subleased
Premises, Subtenant shall be entitled to a proportionate Rent abatement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M17"></A>&#9;(b)&#9;<U>Prorations</U>.  If the
termination or expiration of this Sublease occurs on a day other than the last
day of a calendar month, the Rent for such fractional month shall be prorated on
a per diem basis.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M18"></A>&#9;(c)&#9;<U>Payment</U> Rent and all
other sums due and owing pursuant to the terms of this Sublease shall be payable
in lawful money of the United States, by regular bank check of Subtenant, to
Sublandlord at the address stated in Section 14 herein or to such other persons
or at such other places as Sublandlord may designate in writing. Section 3 of
the Master Lease shall not apply to Subtenant.</P>

responsible for the payment of all utility costs, janitorial service, refuse

Lease shall not apply to Subtenant.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M22"></A>&#9;&#9;5.&#9;<U>Use and
Occupancy</U>.  The Subleased Premises shall, notwithstanding any contrary
provision of the Master Lease, be used and occupied only for general office and
executive purposes by Subtenant, Subtenant's employees and visitors and for no
other use or purpose.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.&#9;<U>
                          Security Deposit</U>.  On or before the Commencement
Date, Subtenant shall deposit the sum of  Twenty-One Thousand, Six Hundred
Forty-Three and 75/100 Dollars ($21,643.75), <B>(&quot;Deposit&quot;) </B>as
security for performance of Tenant's obligations under this lease.  In the event
Subtenant fully complies with all terms and conditions of this Sublease, the
Deposit shall be refunded to Subtenant, without interest unless otherwise
required by law, upon expiration of this Sublease.  Sublandlord may, but is not
obligated to, apply a portion of the Deposit to cure any default hereunder and
Subtenant shall pay on demand the amount necessary to restore the Deposit in
full within ten (10) business days after notice by Sublandlord.  If Subtenant
has not defaulted under the terms of this Sublease as of the commencement of the
last month of the Sublease Term, the Sublandlord shall apply the Deposit to the
last month's Rent.  If Subtenant has ever defaulted under the terms of this
Sublease, whether or not said default was cured, Sublandlord shall have the
right to withhold the Deposit until the Subtenant has vacated the Sublease
Premises in accordance with this Sublease. The Security Deposit provisions of
Section 3.3 of the Master Lease shall not apply to Subtenant.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M23"></A>7.&#9;<U>Master Lease and Sublease
Terms</U>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M24"></A>&#9;&#9;7.1&#9;<U>Subject to Master
Lease</U>.  The terms, conditions and respective obligations of Sublandlord and
Subtenant to each other under this Sublease shall be the terms and conditions of
the Master Lease, as it pertains to the Subleased Premises except for those
provisions of the Master Lease which are contradicted by this Sublease, in which
event the terms of this Sublease shall control over the Master Lease, so long as
this Sublease is in effect.  Therefore, for the purposes of this Sublease:
(a)&nbsp;wherever in the Master Lease the word <B>&quot;Landlord&quot;</B> is
used it shall be deemed to mean the Sublandlord herein; (b)&nbsp;wherever in the
Master Lease the word <B>"Tenant"</B> is used it shall be deemed to mean the
Subtenant herein; (c) wherever in the Master Lease the word
<B>&quot;Term&quot;</B> is used it shall be deemed to mean the Sublease Term
herein; and (d) wherever in the Master Lease the word
<B>&quot;Premises&quot;</B> is used it shall be deemed to mean the Subleased
Premises herein, in each case as the same pertains to the Subleased Premises.
Any non-liability, release, indemnity or hold harmless provision in the Master
Lease for the benefit of Landlord or Tenant that is incorporated herein by
reference, shall be deemed to inure to the benefit of Sublandlord and Subtenant,
as appropriate, and any other person intended to be benefited by said provision,
for the purpose of incorporation by reference in this Sublease.  Any right of
Landlord under the Master Lease of access or inspection and any right of
Landlord under the Master Lease to do work in the Master Lease Premises or in
the Building and any right of Landlord under the Master Lease in respect of
rules and regulations, which are incorporated herein by reference, shall be
deemed to inure to the benefit of Sublandlord and Subtenant, as appropriate, and
any other person intended to be benefited by said provision, for the purpose of
incorporation by reference in this Sublease.  For the purposes of incorporation
herein, the terms of the Master Lease are subject to the following additional
clarifications and modifications:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M25"></A>(i)&#9;In all provisions of the Master
Lease (under the terms thereof and without regard to modifications thereof for
purposes of incorporation into this Sublease) requiring the approval or consent
of Landlord, Subtenant shall be required to obtain the approval or consent of
both Sublandlord and Landlord.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M26"></A>(ii)&#9;In all provisions of the Master
Lease requiring Tenant to submit, exhibit to, supply or provide Landlord with
evidence, certificates, or any other matter or thing, Subtenant shall be
required to submit, exhibit to, supply or provide, as the case may be, the same
to both Landlord and Sublandlord.  In any such instance, Sublandlord shall
reasonably determine if such evidence, certificate or other matter or thing
shall be satisfactory.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M27"></A>(iii)&#9;Sublandlord shall have no
obligation to restore or rebuild any portion of the Subleased Premises after any
casualty, destruction, or taking by eminent domain.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M28"></A>(iv)&#9;In all provisions of the Master
Lease requiring Tenant to designate Landlord as an additional or named insured
on its insurance policy, Subtenant shall be required to so designate Landlord
and Sublandlord on its insurance policy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;(v)&#9;The Option to Extend in Section 19 of
the Master Lease shall not apply to this Sublease.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;(vi)&#9;Sublandlord and Subtenant expressly
acknowledge and agree that the Satellite License Agreement of in Section 21 of
the Master Lease shall apply to this Sublease.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M29"></A>&#9;&#9;7.2&#9;<U>Compliance with
Master Lease</U>.  During the Sublease Term, Subtenant agrees to perform and
comply with, for the benefit of Sublandlord and Landlord, the obligations of
Sublandlord, as <B><U>&quot;Tenant,&quot;</B></U> under the Master Lease, as
they pertain to the Subleased Premises, to the extent such obligations are
incorporated herein, except where Sublandlord has expressly retained such
obligations.  Subtenant agrees that it will occupy the Subleased Premises in
accordance with the terms of the Master Lease as incorporated herein and will
not suffer to be done or omit to do any act which may result in a violation of
or a default under any of the terms and conditions of the Master Lease. Provided
that Subtenant is not in default under this Sublease, Sublandlord agrees that it
will comply with the terms of the Master Lease and will not suffer to be done or
omit to do any act which may result in a violation of or a default under any of
the terms and conditions of the Master Lease. Subtenant further covenants and
agrees to indemnify Sublandlord against and hold Sublandlord harmless from any
claim, demand, action, proceeding, suit, liability, loss, judgment, expense
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) and damages of any kind or nature
whatsoever arising out of, by reason of, or resulting from, Subtenant's failure
to perform or observe any of the terms and conditions of the Master Lease or
this Sublease.  Sublandlord will indemnify Subtenant for its breach of
obligations under the Master Lease not caused by Subtenant; or, if Subtenant was
not the sole cause of the breach but contributed thereto, Sublandlord's
indemnification shall only apply to that portion of the breach which was not a
result of Subtenant's contribution.  Any other provision in this Sublease to the
contrary notwithstanding, Subtenant shall pay to Sublandlord as Rent hereunder
any and all sums which Sublandlord may be required to pay the Landlord arising
out of a request by Subtenant for additional Building services from Landlord,
and which Landlord bills to Sublandlord (e.g., charges associated with non-
scheduled common area maintenance).  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M32"></A></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M33"></A>7.3&#9;<U>Services</U>.  Subtenant
agrees that Sublandlord shall not be required to perform any of the covenants,
agreements and/or obligations of Landlord under the Master Lease and, insofar as
any of the covenants, agreements and obligations of Sublandlord hereunder are
required to be performed under the Master Lease by Landlord thereunder, and
Subtenant acknowledges and agrees that Subtenant will look solely to Landlord
for such performance.  Sublandlord shall not be responsible for any failure or
interruption, for any reason whatsoever, of the services or facilities that may
be appurtenant to or supplied at the Building by Landlord or otherwise,
including, without limitation, heat, air conditioning, ventilation, life-safety,
water, electricity, elevator service and cleaning service, if any; and no
failure to furnish, or interruption of, any such services or facilities shall
give rise to any (i) abatement, diminution or reduction of Subtenant's
obligations under this Sublease (except to the extent set forth herein), or (ii)
liability on the part of Sublandlord.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Sublandlord shall promptly take such action as may reasonably be indicated,
under the circumstances, to secure such performance upon Subtenant's request to
Sublandlord to do so and shall thereafter diligently prosecute such performance
on the part of Landlord.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M34"></A>8.&#9;<U>Termination of Master
Lease</U>.    If for any reason the Term of the Master Lease shall terminate
prior to the Expiration Date, this Sublease shall thereupon be terminated, and
unless such termination of the Master Lease is due to a breach or Default by
Sublandlord hereunder or thereunder, Sublandlord shall not be liable to
Subtenant by reason thereof.  Sublandlord shall have no obligation hereunder to
exercise any option contained in the Master Lease.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M35"></A>9.&#9;<U>Consents</U>.  In any instance
when Sublandlord's consent or approval is required under this Sublease,
Sublandlord's refusal to consent to or approve any matter or thing shall be
deemed reasonable if, among other matters, such consent or approval is required
from Landlord under the provisions of the Master Lease as incorporated herein,
but such consent has not been obtained from Landlord.  Sublandlord shall not
unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent to or approval of a matter
if such consent or approval is required under the provisions of the Master Lease
or this Sublease.  If Subtenant shall seek the approval by or consent of
Sublandlord and Sublandlord shall fail or refuse to give such consent or
approval, Subtenant shall not be entitled to any damages for any withholding or
delay of such approval or consent by Sublandlord, it being agreed that
Subtenant's sole remedy in connection with an alleged wrongful refusal or
failure to approve or consent shall be an action for injunction or specific
performance.  The effectiveness of this Sublease is expressly conditioned upon
the parties' receipt, in writing, of Landlord's Consent thereto, in accordance
with Paragraph 16 of the Master Lease.  <A NAME="_DV_C5"><U>Sublandlord shall
have no liability in the event Landlord refuses to consent to this Sublease.<B>
<A NAME="_DV_M36"></A></A></B></U>Sublandlord and Subtenant shall reasonably and
mutually cooperate to attempt to obtain Landlord's written consent after they
execute this Sublease and deliver it to Landlord for Landlord's review and
consent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M37"></A>10.&#9;<U>Attorney's Fees</U>.  If
Sublandlord or Subtenant brings an action or proceeding to enforce the terms
hereof or to declare rights hereunder, the prevailing party who recovers
substantially all of the damages, equitable relief or other remedy sought in any
such action or proceeding, shall be entitled to its reasonable attorney's fees
and costs to be paid by the non-prevailing party, as determined by the court or
arbitrator in accordance with applicable law.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M38"></A>11.&#9;<U>Acceptance of Subleased
Premises</U>.  Subtenant represents to Sublandlord that Subtenant has been given
the opportunity to inspect the Subleased Premises prior to the Effective Date
and has found the same to be satisfactory for all purposes hereunder (subject,
however, to the terms hereof); provided that Sublandlord shall deliver the
Subleased Premises to Subtenant in substantially the same condition as of the
Effective Date, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and the Subleased Premises
shall be delivered to Subtenant in broom clean condition with all of
Sublandlord's furniture, fixtures and equipment not leased herein removed, the
Leased Equipment assembled and in place.  Sublandlord shall clean all carpets
prior to the Commencement Date (&quot;Sublandlord's Work&quot;).  Except for
removal of Sublandlord's furniture, fixtures and equipment not leased herein,
the requirement of broom clean condition, and the cleaning of all carpets,
Subtenant accepts the Subleased Premises in their &quot;As Is&quot;, &quot;Where
Is&quot; condition as of the Commencement Date, subject to any laws, ordinances,
orders, rules, and/or regulations or statutes (state, Federal, municipal, and
other agencies and bodies having jurisdiction over the Subleased Premises),
hereinafter referred to as &quot;Legal Requirements&quot;.  Sublandlord
represents that it has no knowledge of any current violation(s) of the Legal
Requirements or any faults, including but not limited to both latent and patent
defects, and warrants that if prior to the Effective Date, Sublandlord does
acquire any knowledge of any such violation(s) the Sublandlord shall inform the
Subtenant of such violation(s).  Sublandlord shall have no obligation to
furnish, render or supply any work, labor, or services not otherwise described
herein.  In making and executing this Sublease, Subtenant has relied solely on
such investigations, examinations and inspections as Subtenant has chosen to
make or has made and has not relied on any representation or warranty concerning
the Subleased Premises or the Building, except as expressly set forth in this
Sublease and as set forth in the following sentence.  Sublandlord warrants and
represents to Subtenant that as of the Effective Date (i) the Master Lease is
unmodified and in full force and effect, (ii)&nbsp;no event has occurred or is
occurring that would result in Sublandlord's Default under the Master Lease,
(iii) Sublandlord is not in Default under the Master Lease, and (iv) to
Sublandlord's knowledge, the Landlord is not in Default under the Master Lease.
In the event Landlord and Sublandlord amend the Master Lease after the Effective
Date but prior to the Commencement Date, Sublandlord shall immediately provide
Subtenant with notice of such amendment, and Subtenant shall have the right to
terminate this Sublease at any time prior to the Commencement Data; provided,
however, that any amendment of the Master Lease occurring after the Effective
Date shall be subject ot the terms of this Sublease. The foregoing warranties
and representations shall survive any termination or expiration of this
Sublease.  Except for the warranties and representations set forth above and in
this Sublease, Subtenant hereby waives all warranties, express or implied,
regarding the Subleased Premises, including, but not limited to, any warranties
of title, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M39"></A>12.&#9;<U>Alterations</U>.  Subtenant
acknowledges that Subtenant is not authorized to make or do any alterations or
improvements in or to the Subleased Premises without first obtaining the written
approval of Sublandlord in each instance and of Landlord when Landlord's
approval is required under the Master Lease.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M40"></A>13.&#9;<U>Condition of Premises</U>.
Upon termination of this Sublease, Subtenant shall deliver the Subleased
Premises to Sublandlord in the same condition as the Subleased Premises were on
the Commencement Date, reasonable wear and tear, damage from fire and other
casualty and approved alterations when Landlord and Sublandlord specifically
waive restoration, excepted.  Not later than twenty (20) days prior to the
termination of this Sublease, Sublandlord and Subtenant shall jointly inspect
the Subleased Premises at a mutually agreeable time to determine the condition
of the Subleased Premises.  If such mutual inspection discloses the existence of
damage to the Subleased Premises that occurred during the Sublease Term that is
not reasonable wear and tear, and that is not due to fire or other casualty and
therefore not subject to the provisions of Paragraph 13 of the Master Lease, as
incorporated herein, then Subtenant shall promptly repair such damage at
Subtenant's expense.  If Subtenant is unable to complete repairs prior to the
termination of this Sublease, Sublandlord may cause such repairs to be completed
and Subtenant shall, upon Sublandlord's demand, immediately reimburse
Sublandlord the amount of such reasonable excess cost.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M41"></A>14.&#9;<U>Notices</U>.  Any notice by
either party to the other required, permitted or provided for herein shall be
valid only if in writing and shall be deemed to be duly given only if (a)
delivered personally, or (b) sent by means of Federal Express, UPS Next Day Air
or other reputable express mail delivery service guaranteeing next day delivery,
or (c) sent by United States Certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, addressed, as the case may be, to the following addresses:</P>

first full month following the date on which the Premises are Substantially
Complete (as hereinafter defined) except that if Substantial Completion occurs
on the first day of a month, that date shall be the Commencement Date, and the
Lease shall continue in full force and effect for the period of time specified
as the Term or until this Lease is terminated as otherwise provided herein.  The
Premises shall be deemed to be "Substantially Complete" on the earliest of the
date on which:  (1) Landlord files or causes to be filed with the City in which
the Premises are located (if required) and delivers to Tenant an architect's
notice of substantial completion, or similar written notice that the Premises
are substantially complete, (2)&nbsp;Tenant commences business operations in the
Premises, or (3) a certificate of occupancy is issued for the Premises.
Landlord shall arrange for the construction of certain Tenant Improvements (as
defined in the Work Letter), if any, in accordance with and subject to the terms
of the Work Letter attached hereto as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;"B"</U>.  Tenant shall,
upon demand after delivery of the Premises to Tenant, execute and deliver to
Landlord a Commencement Date Memorandum in the form attached hereto as
<U>Exhibit&nbsp;"C"</U> acknowledging (i) the Commencement Date, (ii) the final
square footage of the Premises, and (iii) Tenant's acceptance of the Premises.
If the Premises are not Substantially Complete on the Estimated Commencement
Date, this Lease shall remain in effect, Landlord shall not be subject to any
liability, and the Commencement Date shall be delayed until the date the
Premises are Substantially Complete.  Tenant has determined that the Premises
are acceptable for Tenant's use and Tenant acknowledges that, except as set
forth in the Work Letter, neither Landlord nor any broker or agent has made any
representations or warranties in connection with the physical condition of the
Premises or their fitness for Tenant's use upon which Tenant has relied directly
or indirectly for any purpose.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord has
not delivered the Premises to Tenant with Substantial Completion of the Tenant
Improvements by the date which is six (6) months after Tenant's approval of the
Construction Drawings pursuant to Section 1 of the Work Letter, subject to any
delays caused by Force Majeure and Tenant Delays, then Tenant shall have the
right to terminate this Lease upon thirty (30) days' notice to Landlord;
provided, however, that if upon such 30-day notice Landlord can substantially
complete the Tenant Improvements within ten (10) days of such notice, Landlord
shall notify Tenant of Landlord's ability to so complete the Tenant Improvement
work and Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease.</A></LI></P>

possession of the Premises during the period of time, if any, from the date on
which Landlord tenders possession of the Premises to Tenant in a Substantially
Completed condition (the "Possession Date") to the Commencement Date, shall be
subject to all the provisions of this Lease and shall not advance the expiration
date.  Rent shall be paid for such period at the rate stated in the Basic Lease
Information, prorated on the basis of a thirty (30) day month, and shall be due
and payable to Landlord on or before the Commencement Date.  Tenant shall

Landlord, at Landlord's Address for Payment of Rent designated in the Basic
Lease Information, or at such other address as Landlord may from time to time
designate in writing to Tenant for the payment of Rent, the Base Rent, without
notice, demand, offset or deduction, in advance, on the first day of each
calendar month.  If the Term commences (or ends) on a date other than the first
(or last) day of a month, Base Rent shall be prorated on a per diem basis with
respect to the portion of the first month and/or last month within the Term.
All sums other than Base Rent which Tenant is obligated to pay under this Lease
shall be deemed to be additional rent due hereunder, whether or not such sums
are designated "additional rent."  The term "Rent" means the Base Rent and all
additional rent payable hereunder.</A></LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><A NAME="_Toc30577708"><U>Late Charge and Interest</U>.
The late payment of any Rent will cause Landlord to incur additional costs,
including administration and collection costs and processing and accounting
expenses and increased debt service ("Delinquency Costs").  If Landlord has not
received any installment of Rent within five (5) days after such amount is due,
Tenant shall pay a late charge of ten percent (10%) of the delinquent amount,
which is agreed to represent a reasonable estimate of the Delinquency Costs
incurred by Landlord; provided, however, that Landlord shall provide Tenant
notice of such delinquent amount one (1) time in any twelve (12) month period
and Tenant shall have five (5) days after receipt of such notice to pay such
delinquent amount before Landlord shall charge Tenant any such late charge.  In
addition, all such delinquent amounts shall bear interest from the date such
amount was due until paid in full at a rate per annum ("Applicable Interest
Rate") equal to the lesser of (a) the maximum interest rate permitted by law or
(b) five percent (5%) above the rate publicly announced by Bank of America, N.A.
(or if Bank of America, N.A. ceases to exist, the largest bank then
headquartered in the State of California ("Bank") as its "Reference Rate."  If
the use of the announced Reference Rate is discontinued by the Bank, then the
term Reference Rate shall mean the announced rate charged by the Bank which is,
from time to time, substituted for the Reference Rate.  Landlord and Tenant
recognize that the damage which Landlord shall suffer as a result of Tenant's
failure to pay such amounts is difficult to ascertain and said late charge and
interest are the best estimate of the damage which Landlord shall suffer in the
event of late payment.  If a late charge becomes payable for any three (3)
installments of Rent within any twelve (12) month period, then the Rent shall
automatically become due and payable quarterly in advance.</A> </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><A NAME="_Toc30577709"><U>Security Deposit</U>.  Upon the
execution of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the Security Deposit.  The
Security Deposit shall secure the full and faithful performance of each
provision of this Lease to be performed by Tenant.  Landlord shall not be
required to pay interest on the Security Deposit or to keep the Security Deposit
separate from Landlord's own funds.  If Tenant fails to perform fully and timely
all or any of Tenant's covenants and obligations hereunder, Landlord may, but
without obligation, apply all or any portion of the Security Deposit toward
fulfillment of Tenant's unperformed covenants and/or obligations.  If Landlord
does so apply any portion of the Security Deposit, Tenant shall immediately pay
Landlord sufficient cash to restore the Security Deposit to the amount of the
then current Base Rent per month.  Upon any increase in Base Rent, Landlord may
require the Security Deposit to be increased by the amount of the increase in
Base Rent per month.  After Tenant vacates the Premises, upon the expiration or
sooner termination of this Lease, if Tenant is not then in default, Landlord
shall return to Tenant any unapplied balance of the Security
Deposit.</A></LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><A NAME="_Toc30577710"><U>UTILITIES</U>.  Tenant shall
pay all charges for heat, water, gas, electricity, telephone and any other
utilities used on or provided to the Premises.  Landlord shall not be liable to
Tenant for interruption in or curtailment of any utility service, nor shall any
such interruption or curtailment constitute constructive eviction or grounds for
rental abatement.  In the event the Premises is not separately metered, Tenant
shall have the option, subject to Landlord's prior written consent and the terms
of this Lease, to cause the Premises to be separately metered at Tenant's cost
and expense.  If Tenant does not elect to cause the Premises to be separately
metered, Tenant shall pay a reasonable proration of utilities, as determined by
Landlord.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there is an interruption
or curtailment in any of the utilities which is specific to the Building and/or
Project (as opposed to an interruption or curtailment in any of the utilities
which extends beyond the  Building or Project) and is caused by an act or
omission of Landlord and lasts for more than five (5) consecutive business days
or Tenant is otherwise unable to access the Premises for more than  five (5)
consecutive business days, Tenant shall be entitled to an abatement of
Rent.</A></LI></P>

business days' prior written notice to Landlord, to inspect at Landlord's office
during normal business hours Landlord's books and records concerning the
Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes set forth in such statement;
provided, however, Tenant shall have no right to conduct such inspection, have
an audit performed by the Accountant as described below, or object to or
otherwise dispute the amount of the Operating Expenses and Property Taxes set
forth in any statement, unless Tenant does so within one (1) year immediately
following Landlord's delivery of the particular statement in question (the
"Review Period"); provided, further, that notwithstanding any such timely
objection, dispute, inspection and/or audit, and as a condition precedent to
Tenant's exercise of its right of objection, dispute, inspection and/or audit as
set forth in this Section 7.3, Tenant shall not be permitted to withhold payment
of, and Tenant shall timely pay to Landlord, the full amounts as required by the
provisions of this Article 7 in accordance with such statement provided,
however, such payment may be made under protest pending the outcome of any audit
which may be performed by the Accountant as described below.  If after such
inspection, Tenant still disputes the amount of the Operating Expenses and Real

the ninety (90) days thereafter, to cause an independent certified public
accountant firm, as selected by Tenant and approved by Landlord (the
"Accountant"), to commence and complete an audit of Landlord's books and records
to determine the proper amount of the Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes
incurred and amounts payable by Tenant for the particular year which is the
subject of such statement, which audit shall be final and binding upon Landlord
and Tenant.  If such audit reveals that Landlord has over-charged Tenant, then
Landlord shall credit against Tenant's rental obligations next falling due the
amount of such over-charge with interest at the Applicable Interest Rate.  If
the audit reveals that the Tenant was under-charged, then within thirty (30)
days after the results of such audit are made available to Tenant, Tenant shall
reimburse to Landlord the amount of such under-charge with interest at the
Applicable Interest Rate.  Tenant agrees to pay the costs of such audit unless
the Accountant determines that Landlord's original statement which was the
subject of such audit was in error to Tenant's disadvantage by more than five
percent (5%) of the Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes.  The payment by
Tenant of any amounts pursuant to this Article 7 shall not preclude Tenant from
questioning the correctness of any statement provided by Landlord at any time
during the Review Period, but the failure of Tenant to object in writing
thereto, conduct and complete its inspection and request that Landlord have the
Accountant conduct the audit as described above prior to the expiration of the
Review Period shall be conclusively deemed Tenant's approval of the statement in
question and the amount of Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes shown
thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant disputes a line-item amount
on any such statement, Tenant may request a copy of the supporting documents be
sent to Tenant without exercising all of Tenant's audit rights as described

prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided,
however, Tenant agrees it shall be reasonable for Landlord to disapprove of a
requested Transfer , if the sublessee or assignee does not have a tangible net
worth (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied) equal to or greater than Twenty-Five Million Dollars
($25,000,000) as shown in the financial information provided to Landlord.
Except as provided in Section 16.2 below, the merger of Tenant with any other
entity or the transfer of any controlling or managing ownership or beneficial
interest in Tenant, or the assignment of a substantial portion of the assets of
Tenant, whether or not located at the Premises, shall constitute an assignment
hereunder.  If Tenant desires to Transfer  any or all of the Premises, Tenant
shall give Landlord written notice thereof with copies of all related documents
and agreements associated with the Transfer , including without limitation, the
financial statements of any proposed assignee or subtenant, twenty (20) days
prior to the anticipated effective date of the Transfer .  Tenant shall pay
Landlord's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in the review of such
documentation plus an administrative fee of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) for
each proposed transfer.  Landlord shall have a period of ten (10) business days
following receipt of such notice and all related documents and agreements to
notify Tenant in writing of Landlord's approval or disapproval of the proposed
Transfer .  If Landlord fails to notify Tenant in writing of such election,
Landlord shall be deemed to have disapproved such Transfer .  This Lease may not
be assigned by operation of law.  Any purported Transfer  contrary to the
provisions hereof shall be void and shall constitute an Event of Default
hereunder.  If Tenant receives rent or other consideration for any such transfer
in excess of the Rent, or in case of the sublease of a portion of the Premises,
in excess of such Rent that is fairly allocable to such portion, after
appropriate adjustments to assure that all other payments required hereunder are
appropriately taken into account, Tenant shall pay Landlord fifty percent (50%)
of the difference between each such payment of rent or other consideration and
the Rent required hereunder.  Landlord may, without waiving any rights or
remedies, collect rent from the assignee, subtenant or occupant and apply the
net amount collected to the Rent herein reserved and apportion any excess rent
so collected in accordance with the terms of the preceding sentence.  Such
acceptance of Rent shall in no event be deemed to imply that Landlord is
approving a subtenant or assignee which Landlord has not approved in writing
pursuant to the requirements of this Section 16.  Tenant shall continue to be
liable as a principal and not as a guarantor or surety to the same extent as
though no Transfer  had been made.  Landlord may consent to subsequent Transfer
of this Lease or amendments or modifications to the Lease by assignees of Tenant
without notifying Tenant or any successor of Tenant and without obtaining their
consent.  No permitted Transfer shall be effective until there has been
delivered to Landlord a counterpart of the transfer instrument in which the

EXTEND</U>.</A></LI></P>
<OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><A NAME="_Toc30577776"><U>Option Right</U>.  Landlord
hereby grants Tenant one (1) option to extend the initial Term of the Lease for
the entire Premises for a period of five (5) years (the "Option Term"), which
option shall be exercisable only by written Exercise Notice (as defined below)
delivered by Tenant to Landlord as provided below, provided that, as of the date
of delivery of such Exercise Notice, Tenant is not in a state of uncured
monetary or other default following the expiration of the applicable cure
periods under the Lease.  Upon the proper exercise of such option to extend, and
provided that, as of the end of the initial Term, Tenant is not in default, as
described above, under the Lease, the initial Term shall be extended for the
Option Term.  The rights contained in this Section 19 shall be personal to the
original Tenant executing the Lease and any Tenant Affiliate and may only be
exercised by the original Tenant or Tenant Affiliate, as the case may be, (not
any other assignee, sublessee or other transferee of Tenant's interest in the
Lease) if the original Tenant or Tenant Affiliate, as the case may be, occupies
the entire Premises as of the date of the Exercise Notice.</A></LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><A NAME="_Toc30577777"><U>Option Rent</U>.  The annual
basic rent payable by Tenant during the Option Term (the "Option Rent") shall be
equal to the "Fair Market Rent" which for purposes hereof means the annual basic
rent, taking into account whether the then current market is using leases based
on a base year, an expense stop, or a triple net, at which tenants, as of the
commencement of the Option Term, are leasing non-sublease space comparable in
size, location and quality to the Premises for a comparable term, which
comparable space is located in the Building and in comparable first-class office
"flex" buildings with prudent ownership (with management practices comparable
with institutional ownership), in the Dublin, California area, taking into
consideration all concessions and inducements generally being granted at such
time.  All other terms and conditions of the Lease shall apply throughout the
Option Term; however, any obligation of Landlord to construct Tenant
Improvements or provide an allowance shall not apply during the Option Term,
except to the extent such provisions are included in the definition of Fair
Market Rent, and Tenant shall, in no event, have the option to extend the
initial Term of the Lease beyond the Option Term described in Section 19.1
above.</A></LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><A NAME="_Toc30577778"><U>Exercise of Options</U>.  The
option contained in this Section 19 shall be exercised by Tenant, if at all, on
or before the date (the "Exercise Date") which is at least six (6) months prior
to the expiration of the initial Term, as the case may be, by delivering written
notice ("Exercise Notice") thereof to Landlord.  Tenant may notify Landlord
earlier than the Exercise Date of its intent to exercise its option and Landlord
will work with Tenant to establish the Fair Market Rent at that time.  After the
Exercise Date, the parties shall follow the procedure and the Fair Market Rent
shall be determined as set forth in Section 19.4 below.  Tenant's failure to
deliver the Exercise Notice on or before the Exercise Date shall be deemed to
constitute Tenant's waiver of its extension right hereunder.</A></LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><A NAME="_Toc30577779"><U>Determination of Option
Rent</U>.  In the event Tenant timely and appropriately objects in writing to
the Fair Market Rent initially determined by Landlord, Landlord and Tenant shall
attempt to agree upon the Fair Market Rent, using their best good-faith efforts.
If Landlord and Tenant fail to reach agreement within ten (10) business days
following Tenant's objection to the Fair Market Rent (the "Outside Agreement
Date"), then each party shall submit to the other party a separate written
determination of the Fair Market Rent within fifteen (15) business days after
the Outside Agreement Date, and such determinations shall be submitted to
arbitration in accordance with Sections 19.4.1 through 19.4.7 below.  Failure of
Tenant or Landlord to submit a written determination of the Fair Market Rent
within such fifteen (15) business day period shall conclusively be deemed to be
the non-determining party's approval of the Fair Market Rent submitted within
such ten (10) business day period by the other party.</A></LI></P>

independent real estate broker who shall have no ongoing business relationship
with Tenant or Landlord and who shall have been active over the five (5) year
period ending on the date of such appointment in the leasing of first-class
office buildings in the Dublin, California area.  The determination of the
arbitrators shall be limited solely to the issue of whether Landlord's or
Tenant's submitted Fair Market Rent is the closest to the actual Fair Market
Rent as determined by the arbitrators, taking into account the requirements of
Section 19.2.  Each such arbitrator shall be appointed within thirty (30) days
after the Outside Agreement Date.</LI></P>

the initial two (2) arbitrators.</LI></P>

reach a decision as to whether Landlord's or Tenant's submitted Fair Market Rent
is the closest to the actual Fair Market Rent, and shall use the closest of
Landlord's or Tenant's submitted Fair Market Rent as the Fair Market Rent for
purposes of calculating the Option Rent, and shall notify Landlord and Tenant
thereof.</LI></P>

the three (3) arbitrators shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant.</LI></P>

shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant.</LI></P>

arbitrators fail to agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator within the time
period provided in Section 19.2 above, then the parties shall mutually select
the third arbitrator.  If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree upon the third
arbitrator within ten (10) days, then either party may, upon at least five (5)
days' prior written notice to the other party, request the Presiding Judge of
the Alameda County Superior Court, acting in his private and nonjudicial
capacity, to appoint the third arbitrator.  Following the appointment of the
third arbitrator, the panel of arbitrators shall within thirty (30) days
thereafter reach a decision as to whether Landlord's or Tenant's submitted Fair
Market Rent shall be used and shall notify Landlord and Tenant thereof.</LI></P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">SECOND AMENDMENT TO LEASE</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Second Amendment to Lease ("Agreement") is made and
entered into as of August 7, 2002, by and between Glenborough Properties, L.P.,
a California limited partnership, ("Landlord") and Allstate Insurance Company,
an Illinois corporation ("Tenant").</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">r e c i t a l s </U>:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Agreement is made with reference to the following facts
and objectives:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A.&#9;By Multi-Tenant Industrial Gross Lease (Base Year) by
and between Creekside South Trust, a Maryland business trust, and Tenant dated
as of November 25, 1998, and by Amendment No. I to Multi-Tenant Industrial Gross
Lease by and between Creekside South Trust and Tenant dated as of November 25,
1998, (together, the "Lease") Tenant leased the Premises depicted in
Exhibit&nbsp;"A" to the Lease and described in the Basic Lease Information of
the Lease as approximately 17,315 rentable square feet in the eastern end of the
Building located at 5875 Arnold Road, Dublin, California 94568-3167 in the
Project formerly referred to as Creekside Business Center but now known as
Creekside Business Park.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">B.&#9;Landlord has succeeded to the interests of Creekside
South Trust in the Lease and in the Premises.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C.&#9;Landlord and Tenant desire to provide for an option to
terminate the Lease early by Landlord, and to otherwise modify and amend the
Lease, on and subject to the terms, covenants, and conditions set forth
below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOW, THEREFORE, Landlord and Tenant hereby agree as
follows:</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">a g r e e m e n t </U>:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Tenant has advised Landlord that it intends to relocate
to other premises in the fourth quarter of 2002, and is in the process of
advertising the Premises for sublease. Landlord would also like to actively
market the Premises, so that Landlord can attempt to obtain a longer lease term
or a direct lease, and Tenant has agreed that Landlord may do so, provided that
each party may market the space on a non-exclusive basis. Landlord and Tenant
shall keep each other apprised of their marketing efforts and of any potential
interest in the Premises, but shall not be required to release confidential
information to each other.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>In the event that Landlord locates a potential new tenant
for the Premises or otherwise desires to recapture the Premises, Tenant agrees
that Landlord shall have an option to terminate the Lease early, on thirty (30)
days written notice given in the manner set forth in Section&nbsp;18.6. of the
Lease. Such termination shall be effective on the later of the thirtieth (30th)
day after notice, or on the date Tenant has relocated to its new premises and
vacated the Premises. Landlord may not exercise this option to terminate early
if Tenant has given Landlord written notice that it has entered into a letter of
intent to sublease the Premises, or has actually subleased the Premises.
Following Tenant's receipt of the notice of termination, the parties shall enter
into Landlord's standard form of early termination agreement, except that no
early termination fee shall be required of Tenant. This option to terminate
early shall revive upon expiration or termination of any sublease by Tenant, on
the same terms and conditions.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Landlord's Address for Notice as set forth in the Basic
Lease Information of the Lease shall be modified and amended, as of the
Effective Date, to delete the former addresses and to replace them with the
following:</LI></P></OL>

provided below, upon the expiration of the Sublease Term, Subtenant shall
deliver the Leased Equipment to Sublandlord in the same condition in which
Subtenant received it, subject to normal wear and tear and casualty loss.
Subtenant has the option to purchase the Leased Equipment for the sum of Ten
Thousand and NO/100 Dollars ($10,000.00).  If Subtenant elects to exercise its

shall maintain and provide Sublandlord evidence of adequate property damage
insurance and standard fire and extended coverage insurance to cover the full
replacement cost of the Equipment, naming Sublandlord and Landlord as additional
insured parties.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M106"></A>C.&#9;<U>Indemnification</U>.
Subtenant shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Sublandlord from all claims,
actions, liabilities, damages, expenses and judgments (including but not limited
to reasonable attorneys' fees, reasonable investigative and discovery costs and
all other sums) on account of Subtenant's breach of this Sublease and/or any
injury to persons, loss of life or damage to property occurring during delivery
to or from, on, in, and about the location where the Leased Equipment is located
or with respect to any claims relating to use of the Leased Equipment by
Subtenant or its agents.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M107"></A>D.&#9;<U>Location and Use of the
Leased Equipment</U>.  At all times during the Sublease Term, the Leased
Equipment shall remain located at/in the Subleased Premises and shall be used
for business and/or commercial purposes and not primarily for personal or
household purposes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M108"></A>E.&#9;<U>Condition of the Leased
Equipment</U>.  Subtenant acknowledges and agrees that Subtenant has been given
the opportunity to inspect the Leased Equipment prior to the execution and
delivery of this Sublease and has found the same satisfactory for all purposes
hereunder.  Subtenant accepts the Leased Equipment in their &quot;As Is, Where
Is&quot; condition, without warranties, either express or implied  (including,
but not limited to any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose), and with all faults (including, but not limited to, both latent and
patent defects).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M109"></A>F.&#9;<U>Risk of Loss</U>.  Subtenant
shall keep the Leased Equipment and Subtenant's interest in this Sublease free
and clear of all liens and encumbrances of any type whatsoever, and hereby
indemnifies and holds Sublandlord harmless from any loss caused thereby.
Subject to the terms of the Master Lease and Sublease, Subtenant shall bear the
entire risk of loss, theft, damage or destruction of the Leased Equipment, and
no loss, theft, damage or destruction shall relieve Subtenant of any obligation
hereunder, including payment of Rent.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M110"></A>G.&#9;<U>Sublandlord's Inspection and
Recovery of Possession of the Leased Equipment</U>.  In the event that it shall
be necessary for Sublandlord or its designee to enter any location where the
Leased Equipment is kept to inspect the Leased Equipment or to recover
possession of the Leased Equipment upon the expiration or earlier termination of
this Sublease and the Master Lease, Subtenant agrees to take all reasonable
steps so that Sublandlord or such designee may do so during Subtenant's normal
business hours after Sublandlord gives Subtenant five (5) days prior written
notice.  Sublandlord further agrees that Sublandlord shall be liable to
Subtenant for any damage arising out of such entry and performance or
repossession, except for damages caused by Subtenant's negligence or willful
misconduct and except Sublandlord shall only be liable for damages ariaing out
of such entry caused by Sublandlord's negligence and willful misconduct if such
entry be as a result of Subtenant's default of this Sublease<A
NAME="_DV_C13">.<U>  Nothing in this Paragraph G shall govern any of
Sublandlord's rights to recover any of the Leased Equipment following a Default
hereunder.</A></P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M112"></A>H.&#9;<U>Default</U>.  Subtenant
will be in Default under this Sublease if (a) Subtenant shall fail to pay any
rent hereunder within thirty (30) days after the date when such rent is due; (b)
Subtenant shall fail to perform any other term or condition of this Sublease for
a period of thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Sublandlord
(provided, however, if such failure shall reasonably require more than 30 days
to cure, such period shall be extended as may be reasonably necessary to effect
a cure); (c) Subtenant removes any of the Equipment from the location without
Sublandlord's prior written consent which may be withheld for any reason or no
reason; (d) Subtenant sells, transfers, encumbers, subleases or parts with
possession of any Equipment; or (e) Subtenant makes a voluntary assignment for
the benefit of creditors or files or has filed against it a voluntary or
involuntary petition or proceeding under any bankruptcy or similar laws.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_DV_M113"></A>I.&#9;<U>Remedies</U>.  Upon the
happening of any event of Default, Sublandlord shall have the right to do any of
the following to the greatest extent permitted by law:  (a) take immediate
possession of the Equipment; (b) terminate this Sublease in accordance with the
Master Lease; (c) continue this Sublease in full force and effect to the end of
the Sublease Term, notwithstanding the occurrence of such Default, and enforce,
by all proper and legal means, Sublandlord's rights herein, including the
monthly collection of Rent and other amounts due, including without limitation,
late payment fees and interest to the extent permitted under the Master Lease on
the amounts due under this Sublease; or (d) exercise all of the rights and
remedies with respect to Subtenant that would be available to Sublandlord under
the Master Lease with respect to the corresponding Default thereunder.  The
foregoing remedies shall be nonexclusive and in addition to any provided by law.
Sublandlord shall have no obligation to exercise any such remedy, and the
exercise of any thereof shall not release Subtenant from its obligations
hereunder.  In addition, all of Sublandlord's remedies shall be cumulative, and
action on one shall not be deemed to constitute an election or waiver of any
other right to which Sublandlord may be entitled.</P>
