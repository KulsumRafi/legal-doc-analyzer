          &#147;Plan&#148;) is to promote the best interests of Graco Inc. (the
          &#147;Company&#148;) and its shareholders by providing employees of the Company
          and its subsidiaries the opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the
          Company and thus develop a strong incentive to put forth their best efforts and
          support changes to further the growth in earnings and market appreciation of the
          Company. The Company intends that the Plan will thereby facilitate securing,
          retaining and motivating employees of high caliber. </FONT></P>

<B>11.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of Common Shares to Satisfy Tax Obligation.</B> In order to assist an
          optionee or grantee in paying all federal, state and local taxes to be withheld
          or collected upon exercise of an option, the Committee in its sole discretion
          and subject to such rules as it may adopt, may permit the optionee or grantee to

          awards and the stock option award documents evidencing the awards, and the
          establishment of values and performance targets) need not be uniform and may be
          made by it selectively among persons who receive, or are eligible to receive,
          awards under the Plan whether or not such persons are similarly situated. </FONT></P>

<B>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolution, Liquidation, Merger.</B> In the event of (a) the proposed
          dissolution or liquidation of the Company, (b) a proposed sale of substantially
          all of the assets of the Company, or (c) a proposed merger, consolidation of the
          Company with or into any other entity, regardless of whether the Company is the
          surviving corporation, or a proposed statutory share exchange with any other
          entity (the actual effective date of the dissolution, liquidation, sale, merger,
          consolidation or exchange being herein called an &#147;Event&#148;), the
          Committee may, but shall not be obligated to, either (i) if the Event is a
          merger, consolidation or statutory share exchange, make appropriate provision
          for the protection of outstanding options granted under this Plan by the
          substitution, in lieu of such options, of options to purchase appropriate voting
          common stock (the &#147;Survivor&#146;s Stock&#148;) of the corporation
          surviving any such merger or consolidation or, if appropriate, the parent
          corporation of the Company or such surviving corporation, or, alternatively, by
          the delivery of a number of shares of the Survivor&#146;s Stock which has a Fair
          Market Value as of the effective date of such merger, consolidation or statutory
          share exchange equal to the product of (x) the excess of (A) the Event Proceeds
          per Share (as hereinafter defined) covered by the option as of such effective
          date over (B) the exercise price per Share of the Shares subject to such option,
          times (y) the number of Shares covered by such option, or (ii) declare, at least
          twenty days prior to the Event, and provide written notice to each optionee of
          the declaration, that each outstanding option, whether or not then exercisable,
          shall be canceled at the time of, or immediately prior to the occurrence of, the
          Event (unless it shall have been exercised prior to the occurrence of the
          Event). In connection with any declaration pursuant to clause (ii) of the
          preceding sentence, the Committee may, but shall not be obligated to, cause
          payment to be made, within twenty days after the Event, in exchange for each
          cancelled option to each holder of an option that is cancelled, of cash equal to
          the amount (if any), for each Share covered by the canceled option, by which the
          Event Proceeds per Share (as hereinafter defined) exceeds the exercise price per
          Share covered by such option. At the time of any declaration pursuant to clause
          (ii) of the first sentence of this paragraph 14, each option that has not
          previously expired or been cancelled pursuant to any stock option award document
          issued shall immediately become exercisable in full and each holder of an option
          shall have the right, during the period preceding the time of cancellation of
          the option, to exercise his or her option as to all or any part of the Shares
          covered thereby. In the event of a declaration pursuant to clause (ii) of the
          first sentence of this paragraph 14, each outstanding option granted pursuant to
          this Plan that shall not have been exercised prior to the Event shall be
          canceled at the time of, or immediately prior to, the Event, as provided in the
          declaration, and this Plan shall terminate at the time of such cancellation,
          subject to the payment obligations of the Company provided in this Paragraph 14.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, no person holding an option shall be entitled to
          the payment provided in this paragraph 14 if such option shall have expired or
          been cancelled pursuant to any stock option award document issued to this Plan.
          For purposes of this paragraph 14, &#147;Event Proceeds per Share&#148; shall
          mean the cash plus the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the
          Committee, of the non-cash consideration to be received per Share by the
          shareholders of the Company upon the occurrence of the Event. </FONT></P>

15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjustments in Shares. </B>In the event of any reorganization, merger,
          consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation, reclassification, stock dividend,
          stock split, combination of shares, rights offering, or extraordinary dividend
          or divestiture (including a spin-off), or any other change in the corporate
          structure or shares of the Company, the Committee (or if the Company does not
          survive any such transaction, a comparable committee of the Board of Directors
          of the surviving corporation) may, without the consent of any holder of an
          option, make such adjustment as it determines in its discretion to be
          appropriate as to the number and kind of securities subject to and reserved
          under this Plan and, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights of
          participants in this Plan, the number and kind of securities issuable upon
          exercise of outstanding options and the exercise price thereof.</FONT></P>
