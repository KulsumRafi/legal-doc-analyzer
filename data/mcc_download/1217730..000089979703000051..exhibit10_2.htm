<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><u>Purposes of Plan</u>. </b>The purposes of this Greater Buffalo
Savings Bank 2002 Stock Option Plan (the &quot;Plan&quot;) are to provide for stock
options (&quot;Options&quot;) as incentives for key employees, titled assistants, officers
and/or directors of Greater Buffalo Savings Bank (the &quot;Company&quot;) and its
Subsidiary Corporations, as hereinafter defined and in certain instances to
compensate founding directors for their efforts in founding the Company or
directors for attending meetings of the Company's Board of Directors or
committees of the Company's Board of Directors, through acquisition or increased
ownership of the Company's common stock, par value $5.00 per share (&quot;Common
Stock&quot;), and where appropriate to encourage such individuals to put forth
maximum efforts for the success of the Company's business. It is intended that
Options granted to employees under the Plan will constitute incentive stock
options (&quot;ISOs&quot;) within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the &quot;Code&quot;). It is also intended that Options granted to
non-employee officers and directors pursuant to this Plan shall be non-qualified
options (&quot;NQSOs&quot;) for purposes of the Code. The Plan shall be subject to the
provisions of the New York Banking Law, including Section 140-a thereof, the
regulations of the New York Banking Board, including Part 26 thereof, and all
other applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<p><dir>Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein to the contrary, Options
awarded to individuals who served as founding directors of the Company for
services rendered and risk incurred in incorporating the Company shall vest and
become exercisable immediately upon receipt. Additionally, Options awarded to
any directors of the Company in lieu of compensation for attending meetings of
the Company's Board of Directors or committees of the Company's Board of
Directors shall vest and become exercisable immediately upon receipt.</p>
<p>In the event of the death, Retirement or Disability of an Optionee while
employed by the Company or a Subsidiary Corporation, or the termination of the
Optionee's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary Corporation without
Cause, as defined below, or the resignation, removal, or failure of an Optionee
who is a director of the Company to be re-elected to the Board of Directors of
the Company, all unexpired Options held by such Optionee shall be deemed 100%
vested and exercisable as of the date of such death, Retirement or Disability or
termination of employment or expiration of service as a director of the Company.
If an Optionee's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary Corporation is
terminated for Cause, all unexercised Options will be forfeited and will expire
on the date of the Optionee's termination for Cause, unless otherwise determined
by the Option Committee in its discretion. For purposes of this Section 6(c) the
term &quot;Cause&quot; shall mean any of the following: (i) the Optionee's conviction of
any felony offense involving monies or other property, or any crime of moral
turpitude, or the commission of fraud or embezzlement; (ii) the Optionee's
breach of any of his or her fiduciary duties to the Company which breach
materially adversely affects the business of the Company; (iii) the Optionee's
willful and continued neglect or failure, after written demand, to discharge his
or her duties or failure to obey a specific written direction from the Board of
Directors or Chief Executive Officer of the Company; or (iv) the Optionee's
violation of any non-competition or confidentiality agreement with the Company.</p>
<font FACE="(normal text)">
<p>(d)&nbsp; </font><u>Exercise of Options and Payment</u>.&nbsp; An Optionee, or transferee
pursuant to Section 6(f) hereof, may exercise an Option as to any or all shares
of Common Stock as to which the Option has become exercisable; provided,
however, an Option may not be exercised for fewer than one hundred (100) shares
of Common Stock, or the number of shares of Common Stock remaining as to which
such Option is then exercisable, whichever is smaller. The Option shall be
exercised by delivering to the Company written notice of such exercise setting
forth the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased and the name in which
such shares shall be registered, together with a certified check, bank draft or
money order, in the full amount of the purchase price therefor, in each case
payable to the order of the Company in United States dollars; provided, however,
that such purchase price may in the alternative, to the extent permitted by law,
be paid by assigning and delivering to the Company shares of Common Stock having
in the aggregate on the date of exercise a Fair Market Value equal to such
purchase price; and provided further that at the election of the Option
Committee, to the extent permitted by law, such purchase price may consist of
other property, tangible or intangible, or labor or services actually received
by or performed for the Company or for its benefit, or a combination thereof. In
the absence of fraud in the transaction, the judgment of the Board of Directors
as to the value of the consideration received upon the exercise of an Option
shall be conclusive.</p>
<p>If the Optionee so requests, shares of Common Stock purchased upon exercise
of an Option may be issued in the name of the Optionee or another person
provided that any such shares will be subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 6(k) hereof.</p>
<p>Page 4</p>
<p>The shares of Common Stock issued to an Optionee upon the exercise of an
Option may be restricted from further transfer for any period which may be
required under applicable securities laws, in which case the stock certificates
therefor shall contain a reference to such restriction.</p>
<font FACE="(normal text)">
<p>(e)&nbsp; </font><u>No Right to Continued Employment</u>.&nbsp; Nothing in this Plan or
in any Option granted pursuant to the Plan shall confer or be deemed to confer
on any individual any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any
Subsidiary Corporation or be deemed to restrict in any way the right of the
Company or a Subsidiary Corporation to terminate his or her employment at any
time. </p>
<font FACE="(normal text)">
<p>(f)&nbsp; </font><u>Nontransferability of Options</u>.&nbsp; During the lifetime of an Optionee, Options held by such Optionee shall be exercisable only by such
Optionee or, in the event of an Optionee's Disability, by his guardian or legal
representative. No Option shall be assignable or transferable by an Optionee
other than by will or applicable laws of descent and distribution.</p>
<font FACE="(normal text)">
<p>(g)&nbsp; </font><u>Adjustments for Change in Stock Subject to Plan and Other
Events</u>.</p>

<p><dir>(1)&nbsp; </font>In the event of a reorganization, recapitalization, stock split,
stock dividend, combination of shares, merger, consolidation, rights offering,
or any other change in the corporate structure or shares of Common Stock of the
Company, the number of shares of Common Stock available for Options, the number
of such shares covered by outstanding Options, and/or the Option Price per share
shall be proportionately adjusted by the Board of Directors, subject to the
approval of the Superintendent, if required, to reflect any increase or decrease
in the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock; provided,
however, that any fractional shares resulting from such adjustment shall be
eliminated by rounding down to the nearest whole number of shares. The Board of
Director's determinations of adjustments shall be final, binding and conclusive,
subject to the approval of the Superintendent, if required.</p>
<font FACE="(normal text)">
<p>(2)&nbsp; </font>In connection with (i) any sale or transfer by the Company of all
or substantially all its assets, or (ii) any acquisition, directly or indirectly
(including by way of tender or exchange offer, merger or consolidation), of all
or a majority of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company by any
person or any group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(1) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934), other than the Company or a Subsidiary Corporation, all
outstanding Options under the Plan shall become fully vested and exercisable in
full, on and after (i) 15 days prior to the effective date of such sale,
transfer or acquisition or (ii) the date of commencement of such tender or
exchange offer, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall any Option be exercisable at or after the date of termination otherwise
applicable to the exercise period of such Option.</p>

<p>(3)&nbsp; </font>In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the
Company, or any consolidation or merger in which the Company is the surviving
corporation and in which there is a reclassification or change of the shares of
Common Stock (other than a change in par value), all outstanding Options under
the Plan shall become fully vested and exercisable upon the Company's adoption
of the plan or agreement related to such event. The Option Committee may provide
that the holder of each Option then exercisable shall have the right to exercise
such Option (at its then Option Price) solely for the kind and amount of shares
of stock and other securities, property, cash or any combination thereof that
such Optionee would receive upon such dissolution, liquidation, or corporate
consolidation or merger if the Optionee were already the holder of the number of
shares of Common  </p>
<p>Page 5</p>
<p>Stock for which such Option is exercisable; or the Option
Committee may provide in the alternative, that each Option granted under the
Plan shall terminate as of a date to be fixed by the Board of Directors,
provided, however, that not less than thirty (30) days written notice of the
date so fixed shall be given to each Optionee, who shall have the right, during
the period of thirty (30) days preceding such termination, to exercise each
Option as to all or any part of the shares of Common Stock subject thereto.</p>

Directors or the Option Committee shall determine that the registration, listing
or qualification of the shares of Common Stock subject thereto, upon any
securities exchange or under any federal or state law, or the consent or
approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a
condition of, or in connection with, the granting of such Option or the purchase
of shares of Common Stock thereunder, no such Option may be exercised unless and
until such registration, listing, qualification, consent or approval has been
effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Option
Committee or Board of Directors. The Company may require that any person
exercising an Option make such representations and agreements and furnish such
information as the Company deems appropriate to assure compliance with the
foregoing or any other applicable legal requirement.</p>

adjustment shall be made for dividends (ordinary or extraordinary, whether in
cash, securities or other property) or distributions or other rights for which
the record date is prior to the date such stock certificate is issued, except as
provided in Section 6(g) hereof.</p>

shall be evidenced by a written option agreement (&quot;Option Agreement&quot;) between
the Company and the Optionee, which agreement shall, subject to the terms and
conditions contained in the Plan, state: the number of shares of Common Stock to
which the Option relates, the Option Price, and that the terms and conditions of
this Plan shall be incorporated therein by reference. Each Option Agreement
shall contain such other provisions, including, without limitation, the
imposition of restrictions upon the exercise of an Option, as the Option
Committee shall deem advisable. Each Option Agreement also will specify whether
the Option is an ISO or NQSO. However, if any portion of an Option does not meet
the requirements to qualify as an ISO, that portion will be an NQSO.</p>
