<p style="text-indent: 60"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This Settlement
Agreement and Full and Final Release of Claims (&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) is made and entered into between Henry S. Bishop
(&ldquo;Mr. Bishop&rdquo;) and First Georgia Bank, a commercial bank chartered by the State of Georgia (&ldquo;the
Bank&rdquo;).</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 60"><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>SEVERANCE</u>.</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; Mr. Bishop and the Bank have agreed to end their employment
relationship pursuant to that certain Change in Control Agreement dated November 18, 2002 (&ldquo;Change in Control
Agreement&rdquo;) attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;A,&rdquo; effective at the
time that the acquisition of the Bank by United Community Banks, Inc. is
consummated.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Bishop and the Bank recognize that Mr.
Bishop would have received significant retirement and other benefits from the Bank and that the sale of the Bank to United
Community Banks, Inc. will prevent these benefits from being realized.&nbsp; Mr. Bishop acknowledges that the release in Paragraph
4 below releases the Bank from any obligation that it may have to provide retirement benefits and any other benefits to Mr. Bishop,
with the exception of the Severance Benefits in the Change in Control Agreement, and that the consideration in Paragraph 2 is
designed, in part, to compensate Mr. Bishop for the loss of those benefits that will not be realized as the result of the sale of
the Bank.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 60"><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>CONSIDERATION</u>.</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; In consideration for, and as a material inducement to enter
into this Agreement, the Bank will provide Mr. Bishop with the following:</font></p>

Dollars ($700,000.00), gross, as soon as administratively feasible after the date the Agreement becomes final and binding pursuant
to Paragraph Fifteen (15) below.&nbsp;</font></td>

    <td width="546"><font face="Times New Roman">Mr. Bishop acknowledges and agrees that the payment described in Paragraph 2 (a) is in addition to
the payments promised to Mr. Bishop in the Change in Control Agreement and the Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and
Confidentiality Agreement (which provides that Mr. Bishop has an obligation not to compete with United Community Banks, Inc. for a
three-year period).</font></td>

<b><u>FULL AND FINAL RELEASE</u>.</b>&nbsp; In consideration of the payments being provided to him, Mr. Bishop, for himself, his
attorneys, heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, fully, finally and forever releases and discharges the Bank,
all subsidiary and/or affiliated companies, as well as its and their successors (including, but not limited to, United Community
Banks, Inc.), assigns, officers, owners, directors, agents, representatives, attorneys, and employees (all of whom are referred to
herein as &ldquo;the Bank&rdquo;), of and from all claims, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, damages, losses, and
expenses, of any and every nature whatsoever, as a result of actions or omissions occurring through the Effective Date of this
Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically included in this waiver and release are, among other things, any and all claims of alleged
employment discrimination, either as a result of the separation of Mr. Bishop&rsquo;s employment or otherwise, including, but not
limited to any and all claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, the Equal
Pay Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &sect;1981, Executive Order 11246;</font></p>

alleged wrongful discharge, negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress, breach of contract, fraud, or any other
unlawful behavior, the existence of which is specifically denied by the Bank.&nbsp; Nothing in this Agreement and Release, however,
is intended to waive Mr. Bishop&rsquo;s entitlement to vested benefits under any pension or 401(k) plan or other benefit plan
provided by the Bank.</font></p>

acknowledges that in his position with the Bank, he may have obtained confidential business and proprietary information regarding
the Bank and otherwise.&nbsp; He agrees that he will not make any such information known to any member of the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition, Mr. Bishop represents that he has returned to the Bank all confidential and proprietary information and all Bank
property, as well as all copies or excerpts thereof and any other property, files or documents obtained as a result of his
employment with the Bank, except those items the Bank specifically agrees in writing to permit Mr. Bishop to retain.&nbsp; This
paragraph is not intended, however, to preclude Mr. Bishop from testifying truthfully in any court of law or before an
administrative agency, although Mr. Bishop agrees that he will testify as to the Bank matters only if served with a lawfully
executed subpoena.&nbsp; Nothing in this Agreement, including Paragraph Thirteen (13), is intended to modify the Change in
Control Agreement.</font></p>

members of the public that are in any way disparaging or negative towards the Bank, the Bank&rsquo;s products or services, or
Bank&rsquo;s representatives (including the Board) or employees.</font></p>

discrimination.</font></p>

matter of intent that this Agreement terminates all aspects of the relationship between them for all time.&nbsp; Mr. Bishop
therefore acknowledges that he does not and will not seek reinstatement, future employment, or return to active employee status
with the Bank or any subsidiary or affiliated companies.&nbsp; Mr. Bishop further acknowledges that neither the Bank nor any
subsidiary or affiliated company shall be under any obligation whatsoever to consider him for reinstatement, employment,
re-employment, consulting or other similar status at any time.&nbsp; The parties acknowledge that Mr. Bishop will continue to serve
