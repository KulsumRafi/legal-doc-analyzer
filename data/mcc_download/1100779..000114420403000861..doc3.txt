York 11747 ("Lender"), the lesser of: (a) the principal sum of One Hundred
Thousand ($100,000) Dollars; or (b) the unpaid principal amount of the advances
made by Borrower to Lender as evidenced by Schedule A attached hereto, with
interest at the Interest Rate (as hereinafter defined) on the unpaid principal
amount from the date hereof until the said principal amount has been paid in
full, whether at the Maturity Date (as hereinafter defined) or otherwise, all as
more fully set forth herein.

         Lender shall endorse on the Schedules to this Note, appropriate
notations to evidence the date, amount, and maturity of each loan made by Lender
and the date and amount of each payment of principal made by Borrower with
respect thereto; provided, that the failure of Lender to make any such notation
or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of Borrower, hereunder under the
Borrower's Note. The Lender is hereby irrevocably authorized by Borrower so to
endorse the Borrower's Note and to attach to and make a part of the Borrower's
Note a continuation of any such schedule, when required. The amount and time of
any advances to the Borrower shall be in the sole discretion of the Lender.

         The "Interest Rate" shall be eight (8%) percent per annum until the
principal amount of this Note, together with all unpaid accrued interest,
thereon, shall have been paid in full; provided, however, that in no event shall
the Interest Rate exceed the maximum rate or amount permitted by applicable law.
Accrued interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365 day year for the actual
number of days elapsed during the period for which computed and shall be paid by
Borrower to Lender monthly on the 15th day of each calendar month. Each payment
of principal and interest shall first be applied to accrued interest due
hereunder and the balance, if any, to the principal hereof.

         The "Maturity Date" shall be the date that is the earlier of (i) June
25, 2003, or (ii) the date that the entire principal amount and interest on this
Note shall become due and payable by reason of acceleration due to the
occurrence of an Event of Default (as hereinafter defined) or otherwise.

         Each of the following specified events hereby constitutes and is herein
referred to individually as an "Event of Default":

         (a) Borrower's failure to make or cause to be made any payments to
Lender under this Note or under any other note or agreement now existing or
hereafter to be entered into between the undersigned and Lender when the same
are due; or

<PAGE>

         (b) Default in the due and timely observance or performance of the
covenants, conditions or agreements of Borrower contained in this Note or the
Agreement; or

         (c) If any financial statement or representation or warranty made by
Borrower in the Agreement or in connection with this transaction or in any
document in connection with the instruments, documents and assignments to be
executed by Borrower hereunder or pursuant hereto shall be untrue in any
material respect on the date made; or

         (d) If any warrant of attachment, execution of other writ shall be
issued or levied upon the proceeds or amounts payable hereunder and such
attachment, execution or other writ shall remain undischarged and unstayed for a
period in excess of sixty (60) days; or

         (e) If Borrower should become insolvent; or should be unable to pay its
debts as they mature; or should make an assignment for the benefit of creditors
or to an agent authorized to liquidate any substantial amount of its properties
or assets; or should file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or seeking
reorganization or to effect a plan or other arrangement with creditors; or

allegations of an involuntary petition filed pursuant to any legislation or
governmental regulation relating to bankruptcy or organization; or should join
in any petition for an adjudication or for a reorganization or other
arrangement; or should become or be adjudicated a bankrupt; or should apply for
a consent to the appointment of or consent that an order be made appointing any
receiver or trustee for itself or for any of its properties, assets or business;
or if an order should be entered pursuant to any legislation or governmental
rule relating to bankruptcy or reorganization; or if a receiver or a trustee
should be appointed otherwise than upon its own application or consent for all
or a substantial part of its properties, assets or business and any such
receiver or trustee so appointed is not discharged within sixty (60) days after
the date of such appointment; or

         (f) If final judgment or judgments for the payment of money aggregating
in excess of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) not covered by insurance shall be
entered or affirmed by a court against Borrower from which no further appeal may
be taken, and Borrower shall not discharge the same or provide for its discharge
in accordance with its or their terms or procure a stay of execution thereof
within thirty (30) days from the date of entry thereof.

the Agreement, the entire principal sum and accrued interest shall, upon written
notice by Lender to Borrower, thereupon become due and payable at the option of
the Lender. Failure to exercise this option shall not constitute a waiver of the
right to exercise the same in the event of any subsequent default. Borrower
hereby waives presentment for payment, demand, protest, notice of protest,
notice of dishonor and all other notices in connection with this Note, except
Borrower does not waive notice as to any prejudgment attachment or the notice of

principal of this Note shall include interest to the date of prepayment on the
principal amount being prepaid.

with and adjudicated exclusively in the state courts of New York sitting in New
York County or Nassau County or the federal courts sitting in the Eastern
District of New York, and hereby expressly and irrevocably submits the person to
the jurisdiction of such courts in any suit, action or proceeding arising,
directly or indirectly, out of or relating to this Note or in any action to
enforce this Note. So far as is permitted under the applicable law, this consent
to personal jurisdiction shall be self-operative and no further instrument or
action, other than service of process in one of the manners specified herein or
as otherwise permitted by law, shall be necessary in order to confer
jurisdiction upon the person of the Borrower in any such court.

         Borrower irrevocably waives, by way of motion, as a defense or
otherwise (i) any objection which it may have or may hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a
court as is mentioned in the previous paragraph; (ii) any claim that any such
suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum; or (iii) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts; provided that if service of process is
effected upon Borrower in one of the manners specified in this paragraph or as
otherwise permitted by law, Borrower agrees that final judgment from which
Borrower has not or may not appeal or further appeal in any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in such court of competent jurisdiction shall be conclusive
and binding upon Borrower and, may so far as is permitted under the applicable
law, be enforced in the courts of any state or any federal court and in any
other courts to the jurisdiction of which Borrower is subject, by a suit upon
such judgment and that Borrower will not assert any defense, counterclaim, or
set off in any such suit upon such judgment.

         Borrower promises to pay all costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorney's fees, incurred in the collection and enforcement of this Note.
Borrower hereby consents to renewals and extensions of time at or after the
Maturity Date hereof, without notice.

         This Note is being delivered and is intended to be performed in the
State of New York and is governed by the laws of the State of New York excluding
any laws relating to the conflict or choice of laws.

         If any term or provision of this Note or the application thereof to any
persons or circumstance shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the
