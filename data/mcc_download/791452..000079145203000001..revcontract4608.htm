<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</B><P ALIGN="CENTER">First American Title Company</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Escrow General Provisions</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The parties understand and acknowledge:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.&#9;Deposit of Funds &amp; Disbursements</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All funds shall be deposited in general escrow accounts in a federally insured financial institution including those affiliated with Escrow Holder ("depositories"). All disbursements shall be made by Escrow Holder's check or by wire transfer unless otherwise instructed in writing.  The Good Funds Law requires that Escrow Holder have confirmation of receipt of funds prior to disbursement.  Escrow Holder may receive certain financial benefits from the depository institutions as a result of maintaining the general escrow accounts and its on-going banking relationship with that institution and such benefits will belong solely to Escrow Holder. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&#9;Disclosure of Possible Benefits to Escrow Holder</P>
</B><P>As a result of Escrow Holder maintaining its general escrow accounts with the depositories, Escrow Holder may receive certain financial benefits such as an array of bank services, accommodations, loans, or other business transactions from the depositories ("collateral benefits").  All collateral benefits shall accrue to the sole benefit of Escrow Holder and Escrow Holder shall have no obligation to account to the parties to this escrow for the value of any such collateral benefits.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;Miscellaneous Fees</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Escrow Holder may incur certain additional costs on behalf of the parties for services performed by third party providers.  The fees charged by Escrow Holder for such services may include a mark up over the direct cost of such services to reflect administrative and overhead charges of Escrow Holder for coordinating such services.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.&#9;Prorations &amp; Adjustments</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The term "close of escrow" means the date on which documents are recorded. All prorations and/or adjustments shall be made to the close of escrow based on a 30-day month, unless otherwise instructed in writing.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&#9;Recordation of Documents</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Escrow Holder is authorized to record documents delivered through this escrow which are necessary or proper for the issuance of the requested title insurance policy(ies).  Buyer will provide a completed Preliminary Change of Ownership Report form ("PCOR"). If Buyer fails to provide the PCOR, Escrow Holder shall close escrow and charge Buyer any additional fee incurred for recording the documents without the PCOR. Escrow Holder is released from any liability in connection with same.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.&#9;Personal Property Taxes</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No examination, UCC search, insurance as to personal property and/or the payment of personal property taxes is required unless otherwise instructed in writing.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.&#9;Supplemental Real Property Taxes</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supplemental taxes may be assessed as a result of a change in ownership or completion of construction. Adjustments due either party based on a supplemental tax bill will be made by the parties outside of escrow and Escrow Holder is released of any liability in connection with same.  </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.&#9;Cancellation of Escrow</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any party desiring to cancel this escrow shall deliver written notice of cancellation to Escrow Holder. Within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, Escrow Holder shall send by regular mail to the address on the escrow instructions, one copy of said notice to the other party(ies). Unless written objection to cancellation is delivered to Escrow Holder by a party within 10 days after date of mailing, Escrow Holder is authorized, at its option, to comply with the notice and terminate the escrow.  If a written objection is received by Escrow Holder, Escrow Holder is authorized, at its option, to hold all funds and documents in escrow (subject to the funds held fee) and to take no other action until otherwise directed by either the parties' mutual written instructions or a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction. If no action is taken on this escrow within 6 months after the closing date specified in the escrow instructions, Escrow Holder's obligations shall, at its option, terminate. Upon termination of this escrow, the parties shall pay all fees, charges and reimbursements due to Escrow Holder and all documents and remaining funds held in escrow shall be returned to the parties depositing same.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.&#9;Conflicting Instructions &amp; Disputes</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Escrow Holder becomes aware of any conflicting demands or claims concerning this escrow, Escrow Holder shall have the right to discontinue all further acts on Escrow Holder's part until the conflict is resolved to Escrow Holder's satisfaction. Escrow Holder has the right at its option to file an action in interpleader requiring the parties to litigate their claims/rights.  If such an action is filed, the parties jointly and severally agree (a) to pay Escrow Holder's cancellation charges, costs (including the funds held fees) and reasonable attorney's fees, and (b) that Escrow Holder is fully released and discharged from all further obligations under the escrow.  If an action is brought involving this escrow and/or Escrow Holder, the parties agree to indemnify and hold the Escrow Holder harmless against liabilities, damages and costs incurred by Escrow Holder (including reasonable attorney's fees and costs) except to the extent that such liabilities, damages and costs were caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Escrow Holder. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.&#9;Usury</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Escrow Holder is not to be concerned with usury as to any loans or encumbrances in this escrow and is hereby released of any responsibility and/or liability therefore.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.&#9;Amendments to Escrow Instructions</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any amendment to the escrow instructions must be in writing, executed by all parties and accepted by Escrow Holder.  Escrow Holder may, at its sole option, elect to accept and act upon oral instructions from the parties. If requested by Escrow Holder the parties agree to confirm said instructions in writing as soon as practicable. The escrow instructions as amended shall constitute the entire escrow agreement between the Escrow Holder and the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of the escrow and shall supersede all prior agreements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P>12.  Insurance Policies</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In all matters relating to insurance, Escrow Holder may assume that each policy is in force and that the necessary premium has been paid.  Escrow Holder is not responsible for obtaining fire, hazard or liability insurance, unless Escrow Holder has received specific written instructions to obtain such insurance prior to close of escrow from the parties or their respective lenders.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.  Copies of Documents; Authorization to Release</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Escrow Holder is authorized to rely upon copies of documents, which include facsimile, electronic, NCR or photocopies as if they were an originally executed document. If requested by Escrow Holder, the originals of such documents shall be delivered to Escrow Holder. Escrow Holder may withhold documents and/or funds due to the party until such originals are delivered.  Documents to be recorded <B>MUST</B> contain original signatures.  Escrow Holder may furnish copies of any and all documents to the lender(s), real estate broker(s), attorney(s) and/or accountant(s) involved in this transaction upon their request.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14.  Execution in Counterpart</B>   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The escrow instructions and any amendments may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which taken together shall constitute the same instruction.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">15.  Tax Reporting, Withholding &amp; Disclosure</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The parties are advised to seek independent advice concerning the tax consequences of this transaction, including but not limited to, their withholding, reporting and disclosure obligations.  Escrow Holder does not provide tax or legal advice and the parties agree to hold Escrow Holder harmless from any loss or damage that the parties may incur as a result of their failure to comply with federal and/or state tax laws. <B>WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS ARE THE EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES. ESCROW HOLDER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE TO PERFORM THESE OBLIGATIONS UNLESS ESCROW HOLDER AGREES IN WRITING.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Tax Reporting Requirements</P>
<P>A.    Taxpayer Identification Number Reporting</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Federal law requires Escrow Holder to report Seller's social security number and/or tax identification number, forwarding address, and the gross sales price to the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS").  Escrow cannot be closed nor any documents recorded until the information is provided and Seller certifies its accuracy to Escrow Holder.</P>
<B><P>B.    State &amp; Federal Withholding  &amp; Reporting </P>
</B><P>A buyer may be required to withhold and deliver to the Franchise Tax Board an amount equal to 3.33% of the sales price of a California real property interest by either: 1) a seller who is an individual with either a last known street address outside of California or when the seller's disbursement instructions direct the proceeds to be sent to a financial intermediary of the seller; OR 2) a corporate seller which has no permanent place of business in California.  The buyer may become subject to a penalty in an amount equal to the greater of 10% of the amount required to be withheld or $500. However, the buyer is not required to withhold any amount and will not be subject to penalty for failure to withhold if: a) the sales price of the California real property interest conveyed does not exceed $100,000; b) the seller executes a written certificate, under the penalty of perjury, certifying that the seller is a resident of California, or if a corporation, has a permanent place of business in California; OR c) the seller, who is an individual, executes a written certificate, under the penalty of perjury, that the California real property being conveyed is the seller's principal residence.  The California Franchise Tax Board may grant reduced withholding or waivers. To obtain additional information regarding California withholding, contact the Franchise Tax Board, Withhold at Source Unit, P. O. Box 651, Sacramento, CA 95812-0651 (916/845-4900).</P>
<P>Certain federal reporting and withholding requirements exist for real estate transactions where the seller (transferor) is a non-resident alien, a non-domestic corporation or partnership, a domestic corporation or partnership controlled by non-residents or non-resident corporations or partnerships. </P>
<B><P>C.    Taxpayer Identification Disclosure</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parties to a residential real estate transaction involving seller-provided financing are required to furnish, disclose, and include taxpayer identification numbers in their tax returns.   Escrow Holder is not obligated to transmit the taxpayer identification numbers to the IRS or to the parties.  Escrow Holder is authorized to release any party's taxpayer identification numbers to any other party upon receipt of a written request. The parties hereto waive all rights of confidentiality regarding their respective taxpayer identification numbers and agree to hold Escrow Holder harmless against any fees, costs, or judgments incurred and/or awarded because of the release of taxpayer identification numbers.</P>

<B><P>Broker Representations:</P>
</B>
<P>Buyer and Seller understand that Cornish &amp; Carey Commercial ("Listing Broker") has not made any investigation or determination regarding the value of the Property; the present or future use of the Property; any possible violations of any federal, state, county, or municipal ordinances, statutes, zoning; proposed acquisition of the Property by the federal, state, county or municipal governments; the accuracy of income and expense information; existence or content of any leases; the existence of physical defects in the Property, the size of the Property or the size of any improvements, and Buyer and Seller hereby release Listing Broker from any liability relating thereto and agree that such investigation and determination has been Buyer's sole responsibility and Listing Broker shall not be held responsible therefor.  Buyer is advised that any representation of square footage with respect to the Property and any improvements thereon are approximations only, which may be inaccurate. Buyer acknowledges that the Purchase Price is not based on the square footage of any improvements or lot size.</P>

<B><U><P>Disclosure Language</P>
</B></U>
<P>Various laws, regulations, and policies require us to disclose the following information:</P>

<P>1.&#9;<B><U>Alquist-Priolo Notification; Alquist-Priolo Special Earthquake Studies Zone Act</B></U>:  The Property described above is or may be situated in a &quot;Special Study Zone&quot; as designated under the Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act, Sections 2621-2630, inclusive, of the California Public Resources Code; and, as such, the construction or development on the Property of any structure for human occupancy may be subject to the findings of a geologic report prepared by a geologist registered in the State of California, unless such report is waived by the city or county under the terms of that act.  No representations on the subject are made by Seller or by Cornish &amp; Carey Commercial, or its agents or employees, and the Buyer should make his/her/its own inquiry or investigation.</P>

<P>2.&#9;<B><U>Notification re:  National Flood Insurance Program</B></U>:  The Property is or may be located in a Special Flood Hazard Area on United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (H.U.D.) &quot;Special Flood Zone Area Maps&quot;.  Federal law requires that as a condition of obtaining federally related financing on most properties located in &quot;flood zones&quot;, banks, savings and loan associations, and some insurance lenders require flood insurance be carried where the property, real or personal, is security for a loan.  This requirement is mandated by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973.  Cities or counties may have adopted building or zoning restrictions, or other measures which could affect the value of the property.  Lessee/Buyer should contact the city or county in which the property is located to determine any such restrictions.  The extent of coverage available in this area and the cost of this coverage may vary, and for further information, Lessee/Buyer should consult a lender or insurance carrier.</P>

<P>3.&#9;<B><U>Hazardous Wastes of Substances and Underground Storage Tanks</B></U>:  Comprehensive federal and state laws and regulations have been enacted in the past several years in an effort to control the use, storage, handling, clean-up, removal and disposal of hazardous wastes or substances. Some of these laws and regulations (such as, for example, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act [CERCLA]) provide for broad liability on the part of owners, tenants or other users of the property for clean-up costs and damages regardless of fault.  Other laws and regulations set standards for the handling of asbestos, and establish requirements for the use, modification, abandonment, and closure of underground storage tanks.</P>

<P>It is not practical or possible to list all such laws and regulations in this Notice. Therefore, Sellers and Buyers are urged to consult legal counsel to determine their respective rights and liabilities with respect to the issues described in this Notice, as well as all other aspects of the proposed transaction.  If hazardous wastes or substances have been, or are going to be used, stored, handled or disposed of on the Property, or if the Property has or may have underground storage tanks, it is essential that legal and technical advice be obtained to determine, among other things, the nature of permits and approvals which have been obtained or may be required; the estimated costs and expenses associated with the use, storage, handling, clean-up, disposal or removal of hazardous wastes or substances; and the nature and extent of contractual provisions necessary or desirable in this transaction.  Listing Broker recommends expert assistance and site investigation to determine past uses of the property, which may provide valuable information as to the likelihood of hazardous wastes or substances, or underground storage tanks, being on the Property.  </P>

<P>Seller agrees to disclose to Listing Broker and to Buyer any and all information which he/she/it has regarding present and future zoning and environmental matters affecting the Property and regarding the condition of the Property, including, but not limited to structural, mechanical and soils conditions, the presence and location of asbestos, PCB transformers, other toxic, hazardous or contaminated substances, and underground storage tanks, in, on, or about the Property.</P>

<P>Listing Broker has conducted no investigation regarding the subject matter hereof, except as may be contained in separate written document signed by Listing Broker.  Listing Broker makes no representations concerning the existence or nonexistence of hazardous wastes or substances, or underground storage tanks, in, on, or about the Property.  Buyer should contact a professional, such as a civil engineer, industrial hygienist or other persons with experience in these matters, to advise on these matters.</P>

<P>The term &quot;hazardous wastes or substances&quot; is used herein in its very broadest sense and includes, but is not limited to, petroleum based products, paints and solvents, lead, cyanide, DDT, printing inks, acids, pesticides, ammonium compounds, asbestos, PCB's and other chemical products.  Hazardous wastes or substances and underground storage tanks may be present on all types of real property.  This Notice is intended to apply to any transaction involving any type of real property, whether improved or unimproved.</P>

<P>4.&#9;<B><U>The Americans With Disabilities Act</B></U>:  Please be advised that an owner or tenant of real property may be subject to the Americans With Disabilities Act (the ADA).  The Act requires owners and tenants of &quot;public accommodations&quot; to remove barriers to access by disabled persons and provide auxiliary aids and services for hearing, vision or speech impaired persons.  You are advised to consult your attorney with respect to the application of this Act to the Property.  Cornish &amp; Carey Commercial cannot give you legal advice on this Act or its requirements.</P>

<P>5.&#9;<B><U>Listing Broker Disclosure</B></U>:  The parties hereby expressly acknowledges that Listing Broker has made no independent determination or investigation regarding, but not limited to, the following:  present or future use of the Property; environmental matters affecting the Property; the condition of the Property, including, but not limited to structural, mechanical and soils conditions, as well as issues surrounding hazardous wastes or substances as set out above; violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act or any other federal, state, county or municipal laws, ordinances, or statutes; measurements of land and/or buildings.  Lessee/Buyer agrees to make its own investigation and determination regarding such items.</P>

<P>6.&#9;<B><U>Listing Broker Representation (Dual Agency)</B></U>  </P>
<P>(DELETE IF N/A).  Seller and Buyer acknowledge that Listing Broker is the agent of both Seller and Buyer.  Seller and Buyer hereby consent to such dual representation and waive any possible conflict of interest arising out of such dual agency.  A dual agency is obligated to disclose to both parties all material facts or confidential information that could affect Seller's or Buyer's decision to enter into the transaction.  Listing Broker, however, will not disclose to Buyer the price that Seller is willing to accept, nor to Seller the price that Buyer is willing to pay, without the express permission of the other party.</P

<P>Receipt of a copy of this Notice and Agreement is hereby acknowledged.</P>
