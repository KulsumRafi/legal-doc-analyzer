                                      1996 STOCK PLAN FOR OUTSIDE DIRECTORS
</FONT></H1>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>
Purpose</u>.  The purpose of the Amended and Restated  RARE  Hospitality  International,  Inc.  1996
Stock Plan for Outside  Directors  (the  "Plan") is to advance the  interests of RARE  Hospitality  International,
Inc. (the  "Corporation")  by encouraging  ownership of the  Corporation's  no par value common stock (the "Common
Stock") by  non-employee  directors of the  Corporation,  thereby giving such directors an increased  incentive to
devote their efforts to the success of the Corporation.</FONT></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>
Administration</u>.  Grants  of stock  and  options  under  this  Plan are  automatic.  This Plan is
intended to be a "formula plan" as recognized by Rule  16b-3(c)(2)(ii)  promulgated under the Securities  Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and shall be interpreted accordingly.</FONT></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>
Eligibility</u>.  Except as provided  otherwise in this Section 3,  stock and options under the Plan
shall be granted in accordance  with Section 5 to each member of the  Corporation's  Board of Directors who is not
a current employee of the Corporation (an "Outside  Director");  provided that shares of the Corporation's  Common
Stock remain  available  for grant  hereunder in accordance  with Section 4. An Outside  Director to whom stock or
options are granted under the Plan shall be referred to hereinafter as a "Grantee."</FONT></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>
Shares  Subject to Plan</u>.  The shares  subject to the Plan shall be  authorized  but  unissued or
reacquired  shares of the Corporation's  Common Stock.  Subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of
Section 6 of the Plan,  the maximum  number of shares of Common  Stock for which  awards may be granted  under the
Plan shall be 150,000 and the initial  adoption of the Plan by the Board of  Directors  of the  Corporation  shall
constitute a reservation of 150,000  authorized but unissued,  or reacquired,  shares of Common Stock for issuance
under the Plan.  In the event that any  outstanding  option  granted  under the Plan for any reason  expires or is
terminated  prior to the end of the  period  during  which  awards may be  granted  under the Plan,  the shares of
Common Stock allocable to the  unexercised  portion of such option may again be subject in whole or in part to any
award of stock or options granted under the Plan.</FONT></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>
Terms and  Conditions  of Awards</u>.  Awards  granted  pursuant to the Plan shall be  evidenced  by
Stock Award Agreements in such form as shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:</FONT></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Grant</U>.  On the date of adoption of the Plan by the Board of  Directors,  each  Outside  Director
shall be granted an option to purchase 7,500 shares of the  Corporation's  Common Stock,  subject to adjustment as
provided  in the Plan,  and  subject to approval  of the Plan by the  Corporation's  shareholders  within one year
following the adoption of the Plan by the Board of  Directors.  If the  shareholders  of the  Corporation  fail to
approve the Plan  within such time,  the  initial  grant of options  shall be null and void and no further  awards
shall be granted under the Plan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>On the date that each
subsequent Outside Director is initially elected or appointed to the Board or,
in the case of a director who was employed by the Corporation on the date that
such director was initially elected or appointed to the Board and who remains a
director following the termination of his or her employment, the date that such
Outside Director&#146;s employment with the Corporation is terminated, such
director will receive an option to purchase (i) 3,750 shares of Common Stock if
such date is on or before June 30 of the year in question, or (ii) 1,875 shares
of Common Stock if such date is on or after July&#160;1 of the year in question,
subject to adjustment as provided in the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
In  addition,  each year,  beginning in 1997,  on the day  immediately  preceding  the earlier of (i) the
Corporation&#146;s  release of its financial results for the preceding fiscal year, or (ii) the  Corporation&#146;s  release
of an estimate of its  financial  results for the preceding  year,  made after the end of such year and before the
release of full  financial  results for such year,  each Outside  Director  who is serving in such  capacity as of
such date will receive an option to purchase  3,750 shares of Common Stock  (subject to  adjustment as provided in
the  Plan);  provided,  however,  that all or any  portion  of such  options  will be  granted  if and only if the
operating  earnings per share of the  Corporation&#146;s  Common Stock has increased in the preceding fiscal year (over
the next  preceding  fiscal year) by a  percentage  equal to or greater  than the  percentage  set by the Board of
Directors for the preceding  fiscal year as the percentage  increase in earnings per share at which management can
be granted any stock options for the Company&#146;s  performance  in the preceding  fiscal year,  and the percentage of
such options to be granted to the Board shall equal the percentage of options to be granted to  management,  based
upon the increase in operating  earnings,  up to one hundred percent (100%).  Each such day that annual awards are
to be granted under this  paragraph  under the Plan is referred to  hereinafter as a &#147;Grant Date.&#147; For purposes of
determining whether options will be granted under this paragraph,  when the Corporation&#146;s  fiscal year is 53 weeks
long,  the  operating  earnings  per share of the  Corporation&#146;s  Common Stock will be adjusted to compare to a 52
week fiscal year by dividing the operating  earnings  reported by the Corporation by 53 and multiplying the result
by 52. Such result will be used as the  &#147;operating  earnings per share&#147; for such year for purposes of  determining
whether  options will be granted under this  paragraph in both years in which the earnings of the 53 week year are
included in the comparison.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>If on any Grant Date,
shares of Common Stock are not available under this Plan to grant to Outside
Directors the full amount of a grant contemplated by the immediately preceding
paragraph, then each Outside Director shall receive an award (a &#147;Reduced
Grant&#148;) equal to the number of shares of Common Stock then available under
the Plan divided by the number of Outside Directors as of the applicable Grant
Date. Fractional shares shall be ignored and not granted. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>If a Reduced Grant has been
made and, thereafter, during the term of this Plan, additional shares of Common
Stock become available for grant (e.g., because of the forfeiture or lapse of an
option), then each person who was an Outside Director both on the Grant Date on
which the Reduced Grant was made and on the date additional shares of Common
Stock become available (a &#147;Continuing Outside Director&#148;) shall receive
an additional option to purchase shares of Common Stock. The number of newly
available shares shall be divided equally among the options granted to the
Continuing Outside Directors; provided, however, that the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock subject to a Continuing Outside Director&#146;s
additional option plus any prior Reduced Grant to the Continuing Outside
Director on the applicable Grant Date shall not exceed 3,750 shares (subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 6). If more than one Reduced Grant has been made,
available options shall be granted beginning with the earliest such Grant Date. </FONT></P>

         (b)      Option  Price.  The  option  price for each  option  granted  under  the Plan  shall be the Fair
Market Value (as defined  below) of the shares of Common  Stock  subject to the option on the date of grant of the
option.  For purposes of the Plan,  the "Fair Market  Value" of a share of Common Stock on a given date shall mean
the closing  price of a share of Common Stock traded on the Nasdaq  National  Market on such date,  as reported in
the  composite  transactions  quoted in The Wall  Street  Journal or, if no shares were traded on such day, on the
next preceding day on which shares were traded.

         (c)      Medium and Time of Payment.  The option  price shall be payable in full upon the  exercise of an
option in cash, by check,  in shares of Common  Stock,  or in any  combination  thereof.  To the extent  permitted
under  Regulation T of the Federal  Reserve  Board,  and subject to  applicable  securities  laws,  options may be
exercised  through a broker in a so-called  "cashless  exercise"  whereby the broker  sells the option  shares and
delivers  cash sales  proceeds  to the  Company  in payment of the  exercise  price.  However,  to avoid  possible
short-swing  profit  liability  under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the Grantee  should wait at least six (6)
months from the date of grant of the option before engaging in a "cashless" exercise.

         (d)      Term.  Each  option  granted  under the Plan  shall,  to the  extent not  previously  exercised,
terminate and expire on the date ten (10) years after the date of grant of the option,  unless earlier  terminated
as provided hereinafter in Section 5(g).

         (e)      Exercisability.  Each  option  granted  under  the Plan  shall,  unless  earlier  terminated  as
provided  hereinafter  in Section 5(g),  become  exercisable  on the date six (6) months and one day following the
date of grant.

         (f)      Method of Exercise.  All options  granted  under the Plan shall be  exercised by an  irrevocable
written notice  directed to the Secretary of the  Corporation at the  Corporation's  principal  place of business.
Except in the case of a  "cashless  exercise"  through a broker,  such  written  notice  shall be  accompanied  by
payment in full of the option  price for the shares  for which such  option is being  exercised.  In the case of a
"cashless  exercise,"  payment in full of the option price for the shares for which such option is being exercised
shall be paid in cash by the broker from the sale proceeds.  The  Corporation  shall make delivery of certificates
representing  the shares for which an option has been  exercised  within a  reasonable  period of time;  provided,
however,  that if any law,  regulation or agreement  requires the  Corporation  to take any action with respect to
the shares for which an option has been exercised before the issuance  thereof,  then the date of delivery of such
shares  shall be extended  for the period  necessary to take such  action.  Certificates  representing  shares for
which options are exercised under the Plan may bear such  restrictive  legends as may be necessary or desirable in
order to comply  with  applicable  federal  and state  securities  laws.  Nothing  contained  in the Plan shall be
construed to require the  Corporation  to register any shares of Common Stock  underlying  options  granted  under
this Plan.

         (g)      Effect of Termination of Directorship or Death.

         (i)  Termination  of  Directorship.  Upon  termination  of  any  Grantee's  membership  on the  Board  of
Directors of the Corporation  for any reason other than for cause or death,  the options held by the Grantee under
the Plan shall  terminate  ninety (90) days following the date of  termination of the Grantee's  membership on the
Board or, if earlier,  on the date of  expiration of the options as provided by  Section 5(d)  of the Plan. If the
Grantee exercises the options after  termination of the Grantee's  service on the Board of Directors,  the Grantee
may  exercise  the  options  only with  respect  to the  shares  that were  otherwise  exercisable  on the date of
termination  of the  Grantees'  service on the Board.  Such exercise  otherwise  shall be subject to the terms and
conditions  of the Plan.  If the  Grantee's  membership  on the Board of Directors is  terminated  for cause,  all
options granted to such Grantee shall expire upon such termination.

         (ii) Death.  In the event of the death of a Grantee,  the Grantee's  personal  representatives,  heirs or
legatees  (the  "Grantee's  Successors")  may exercise the options held by the Grantee on the date of death,  upon
proof  satisfactory  to the  Corporation  of their  authority.  The  Grantee's  Successors  must exercise any such
options  within one (1) year after the  Grantee's  death and in any event  prior to the date on which the  options
expire as  provided  by  Section  5(d) of the Plan.  Such  exercise  otherwise  shall be  subject to the terms and
conditions of the Plan.

         (h)      Nonassignability  of Option  Rights.  No  option  shall be  assignable  or  transferable  by the
Grantee  except by will, by the laws of descent and  distribution  or pursuant to a qualified  domestic  relations
order as defined in Title I of the Employee  Retirement  Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986.  During the lifetime of the Grantee, the option shall be exercisable only by the Grantee.

         (i)      Rights as  Shareholder.  Neither the Grantee nor the Grantee's  Successors  shall have rights as
a shareholder  of the  Corporation  with respect to shares of Common Stock  covered by the Grantee's  option until
the Grantee or the Grantee's Successors become the holder of record of such shares.

         (j)      No Options  after Ten  Years.  No options  shall be granted  except  within a period of ten (10)
years after the effective date of the Plan.

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>
Adjustments</u>.</FONT></p>

         (a)      If any change is made in the stock subject to the Plan,  or subject to any option  granted under
the Plan (through merger, consolidation,  reorganization,  recapitalization,  stock dividend, dividend in property
other  than cash,  stock  split,  liquidating  dividend,  combination  of shares,  exchange  of shares,  change in
corporate  structure or otherwise),  the Plan and  outstanding  options will be  automatically  and  appropriately
adjusted,  including  the  maximum  number of shares  subject  to the Plan and the  number of shares and price per
share of stock subject to outstanding options.

         (b)      In the event of: (i) a merger or  consolidation  in which the  Corporation  is not the surviving
corporation;  (ii) a reverse merger in which the  Corporation is the surviving  corporation  but the shares of the
Corporation's  common stock  outstanding  immediately  preceding  the merger are converted by virtue of the merger
into  other  property,  whether  in the form of  securities,  cash  other  otherwise;  or (iii) any other  capital
reorganization  in which  more than fifty  percent  (50%) of the shares of the  Corporation  entitled  to vote are
exchanged,  then  any  surviving  corporation  shall  assume  any  options  outstanding  under  the  Plan or shall
substitute  similar  options for those  outstanding  under the Plan.  If there is no  surviving  corporation,  all
outstanding options shall expire.

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>
Effective Date and Termination of Plan</u>.</FONT></p>

         <li>      Effective  Date.  The Plan shall  become  effective  upon  adoption  of the same by the Board of
Directors of the  Corporation  (February 26,  1996),  subject to approval of the Plan by the  shareholders  of the
Corporation within one year following the adoption of the Plan by the Board of Directors.

         <li>      Termination.  The Plan shall  terminate ten (10) years after its effective  date,  but the Board

impair any of the rights or  obligations  under any option  theretofore  granted under the Plan unless the Grantee

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>
No Obligation  to Exercise  Option</u>.  The granting of an option shall impose no  obligation  upon
the Grantee to exercise such option.</FONT></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>
Amendment</u>.  The Board of Directors of the  Corporation  by majority vote may amend the Plan from
time to time but may not,  without  shareholder  approval,  adopt any  amendment  that would  require  shareholder
approval in order for the Plan or  transactions  thereunder to qualify for the  exemptions  provided by Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange  Act, as the same may be amended from time to time ("Rule  16b-3"),  or under under  applicable
rules of any exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are traded,  or under any other  applicable law, rule or
regulation.  To the extent  required  by Rule  16b-3,  the  provisions  of the Plan  determining  (i) the  persons
eligible to receive  awards  under the Plan,  (ii) the  timing of awards,  (iii) the  number of shares  subject to
awards,  (iv) the  exercise price of options,  (v) the periods during which options are exercisable,  and (vi) the
dates on which  options  terminate,  may not be amended more than once every six months other than to comport with
changes  in the  Internal  Revenue  Code,  the  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act of 1974,  or the rules
thereunder.</FONT></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>It is expressly
contemplated that the Board may amend the Plan in any respect that the Board
deems necessary to cause the Plan to meet the requirements of Rule 16b-3 (or any
successor rule) and otherwise to comport with the provisions of the Exchange Act
and the applicable regulations thereunder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Any amendment to the Plan
shall not, without the written consent of the Grantee, affect such
Grantee&#146;s rights under any award theretofore granted to such Grantee. </FONT></P>
