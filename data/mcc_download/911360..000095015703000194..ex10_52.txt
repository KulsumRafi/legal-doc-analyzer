knowledge of or any duties or responsibilities in respect of any other
agreement or document. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing:

(a)     The Trustee shall not be liable for any loss of interest or earnings
        sustained as a result of investments made hereunder in accordance with
        the terms hereof, including any liquidation of any investment of the
        Trust Assets prior to its maturity effected in order to make a payment
        required by the terms of this Trust Agreement;

(b)     The Trustee shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon any
        written certification, instruction, notice, direction, request,
        waiver, consent, receipt or other document that the Trustee reasonably
        believes to be genuine and duly authorized, executed and delivered;

(c)     The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or for any
        act done or omitted by it, or for any mistake in fact or law, or for
        anything that it may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith;

        Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall be liable for its willful
        misconduct or gross negligence;

(d)     The Trustee may seek the advice of legal counsel selected with
        reasonable care (provided that the selection of such legal counsel
        shall require Settlor's prior written consent, such consent not to be

        the construction of any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement or
        its duties hereunder, and it shall incur no liability and shall be
        fully protected in respect of any action taken, omitted or suffered by

(e)     In the event that the Trustee shall in any instance, after seeking the
        advice of legal counsel pursuant to the immediately preceding clause,
        in good faith be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder, it
        shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action in that instance
        and its sole obligation, in addition to those of its duties hereunder
        as to which there is no such uncertainty, shall be to keep the
        property affected by such uncertainty safely held in trust until it
        shall be directed otherwise in writing by Settlor and Representative;
        provided, however, in the event that the Trustee has not received such

        it shall have the right to submit the issue to arbitration in
        accordance with Section 29 hereof; and

        hereunder and exercise any rights hereunder either directly or by or
        through agents or attorneys selected with reasonable care. Nothing in
        this Trust Agreement shall be deemed to impose upon the Trustee any

        any jurisdiction other than the Republic of Panama and the Trustee
        shall not be responsible for and shall not be under a duty to examine
        into or pass upon the validity, binding effect, execution or
        sufficiency of this Trust Agreement or of any agreement amendatory or

(g)     The Trustee shall issue, or shall cause a financial institution
        (including Banco General, S.A.) to issue, a letter or a bank guarantee
        confirming the availability of sufficient funds to settle the
        obligations derived from the OPA, as required by applicable securities
        legislation of the Republic of Panama.

12. Cooperation. Settlor and Representative shall provide to the Trustee all
instruments and documents within their respective powers to provide that are
necessary for the Trustee to perform its duties and responsibilities
hereunder.

13. Fees and Expenses; Indemnity.

(a)     Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13 to the contrary, the
        Trustee is authorized to deduct from earnings on the Trust Amount an
        acceptance fee of $10,000, and an annual fee of $25,000, both payable
        upon execution of this Trust Agreement. The annual fee will be payable
        thereafter on each anniversary of the execution of this Trust
        Agreement. The Trustee also shall be entitled to receive reasonable
        and customary out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
        performance of its duties hereunder. The fees, costs and expenses
        described in this Section 13(a) shall be referred to herein as "FEES".

(b)     The Trustee is authorized to, and may disburse to itself from the
        earnings on the Trust Amount, from time to time, the amount of any
        Fees due and payable to it hereunder. If for any reason such earnings
        are insufficient to cover such Fees, Settlor shall pay within the
        following thirty (30) days such amounts to make up such shortfall to
        Trustee upon the presentation of an itemized invoice. The Trustee
        shall notify Settlor and Representative of any disbursement from the
        Trust Assets to itself in respect of any Fees under any provision of
        this Trust Agreement and shall furnish to Settlor and Representative
        copies of all related invoices and other statements.

(c)     Prior to the consummation or termination of the OPA, Settlor shall be
        liable for and shall reimburse and indemnify Trustee (and any
        predecessor Trustee) and hold Trustee harmless from and against
        one-half (1/2) of any and all claims, losses, actions, liabilities,
        costs, damages or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
        expenses) arising from or in connection with Trustee's administration
        of, or performance of duties and obligations pursuant to, this Trust
        Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing,
        Settlor shall not be required to indemnify the Trustee for any such
        claims, losses, actions, liabilities, costs, damages or expenses
        caused by its own gross negligence or own willful misconduct. In
        addition, when the Trustee acts on any information, instructions or
        communications (including, but not limited to, communications with
        respect to the delivery of securities or the wire transfer of funds)
        sent by telephone, telex or facsimile, the Trustee, absent gross
        negligence or willful misconduct, shall not be responsible or liable
        in the event such communication is not an authorized or authentic
        communication or is not in the form Settlor sent or intended to send
        (whether due to fraud, distortion or otherwise). The Trustee shall
        have the right to offset an amount equal to one-


                                      7


<PAGE>


half (1/2) of any indemnifiable claims, losses, actions, liabilities, costs,
damages or expenses described above against the Trust Assets.

(d)     Settlor shall be liable for one hundred percent (100%) of all
        indemnifiable claims, losses, actions, liabilities, costs, damages or
        expenses described in Section 13(c) above that arise after
        consummation of the OPA (including payment of the Certified Amount to
        the Paying Agent) or termination of the OPA.

(e)     Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13 to the contrary, all of
        Settlor's compensation, reimbursement and indemnification obligations
        set forth in this Section 13 shall be payable by Settlor upon demand
        by the Trustee, and the failure of Settlor to fund such obligations
        shall give rise to an additional claim by the Trustee with respect to
        the earnings on the Trust Amount. The obligations of Settlor under
        this Section 13 shall survive any termination of this Trust Agreement
        and the resignation or removal of Trustee.

14. Resignation and Removal of the Trustee.

(a)     The Trustee may resign as such thirty (30) calendar days following the
        giving of written notice thereof to Settlor and Representative. In
        addition, the Trustee may be removed and replaced on a date designated
        in a written instrument signed by Settlor and Representative and
        delivered to the Trustee. In the case of either such resignation or
        removal, Settlor and the Representative jointly shall appoint a branch
        or affiliate located in the Republic of Panama of one of HSBC, BNP
        Paribas or Citibank, N.A. as the successor Trustee. Notwithstanding
        the foregoing, no such resignation or removal shall be effective until
        a successor Trustee has acknowledged its appointment as such as
        provided in Section 14(c). In either event, upon the effective date of
        such resignation or removal, the Trustee shall deliver the property
        comprising the Trust Assets (net of any Fees due to the Trustee) to
        such successor Trustee, together with such records maintained by the
        Trustee in connection with its duties hereunder and other information
        with respect to the Trust Assets as such successor may reasonably
        request.

(b)     If a successor Trustee shall not have acknowledged its appointment as
        such as provided in Section 14(c), in the case of a resignation, prior
        to the expiration of thirty (30) calendar days following the date of a
        notice of resignation or, in the case of a removal, on the date
        designated for the Trustee's removal, as the case may be, because
        Settlor and Representative are unable to agree on a successor Trustee,
        or for any other reason, the successor Trustee shall be appointed from
        the first of HSBC, BNP Paribas and Citibank, N.A. (in such order) to
        acknowledge its appointment as such, and such appointment shall be
        binding upon all of the parties to this Trust Agreement.

(c)     Upon written acknowledgment by a successor Trustee appointed in
        accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 14 of its
        agreement to serve as Trustee hereunder and the receipt of the
        property then comprising the Trust


                                      8

        Assets, the Trustee shall be fully released and relieved of all
        duties, responsibilities and obligations under this Trust Agreement,
        subject to the provision contained Section 11(c) and such successor
        Trustee shall for all purposes hereof be the Trustee.
