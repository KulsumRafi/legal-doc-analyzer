Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Covanta fails to execute and deliver a
counterpart of the Mutual Release of Claims to a Participant prior to the eighth
day after such Participant has executed and delivered such release to Covanta,
such Participant shall be granted an LTIP Award even if he has exercised his
right to revoke the release due to Covanta's failure to execute and deliver the
counterpart thereof. No other individual shall be eligible to participate in the
Plan or receive an LTIP Award.

         (b) Percentage Interests. On or prior to a Participant's Vesting Date,

attached hereto and may not exceed the maximum percentage interest set forth for

Interests of all Participants, as finally established by the Committee, must
equal 100% (less the minimum percentage interest, as set forth on Schedule A, of
any Participant who does not meet the vesting requirements of Section 7(a)).

5. LTIP Pool. As soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of each

6. Determination of Amount Payable In Satisfaction of Vested LTIP Awards. Each
Participant who has earned a vested right to receive payment in satisfaction of
his LTIP Award pursuant to Section 7(a) shall be entitled to receive a lump-sum
cash payment equal to (i) in the case of a Corporate Event, such Participant's
Percentage Interest Amount and (ii) in the case of an Alternative Transaction,
such Participant's Lump Sum Amount, in each such case, at the time and subject

7.  Vesting/Forfeiture of LTIP Awards; Payment of LTIP Awards.
    ---------------------------------------------------------

         (a) Vesting/Forfeiture. A Participant's right to receive payment in
satisfaction of his LTIP Award shall become vested only if the Participant's
employment with the Company Group is terminated during the Covered Period (or
pursuant to a notice of termination delivered during the Covered Period) (i) by
the Company Group Without Cause or (ii) by such Participant's resignation for
Mutual Benefit. In all other cases, a Participant's rights in respect of his
LTIP Award, including, without limitation, the right to receive any payment in
satisfaction of such award, shall be forfeited and shall terminate immediately,
for no consideration, upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Participant's
termination of employment during the Covered Period (or pursuant to a notice of
termination delivered during the Covered Period) for any reason other than by
the Company Without Cause or by such Participant's resignation for Mutual
Benefit and (ii) the expiration of the Covered Period.

         (b) Clawback. Notwithstanding Section 7(a), if (i) a Participant
resigns for the Mutual Benefit event described in clause (iv) of the definition
of such term in Section 2(z) and (ii) during the six month period immediately
following such Participant's Vesting Date, such Participant is reemployed by the
member of the Company Group that had previously employed such Participant in the
same position (determined based on such Participant's actual duties and
responsibilities) and at the same or a higher rate of annual compensation as his
position and annual rate of compensation in effect immediately prior to such
Participant's resignation, such Participant shall forfeit any and all rights in
respect of his LTIP Award, including, without limitation, the right to receive
any payment in satisfaction of such award. In the event that such Participant
has previously received a payment in satisfaction of such LTIP award, such
Participant shall promptly repay to Covanta the full amount of such payment (the
"Clawback Requirement").

         (c) Payment in Satisfaction of LTIP Awards. Covanta shall, or shall
cause the member of the Company Group that employs the Participant to, pay to
each Participant who has earned a vested right to his LTIP Award pursuant to
Section 7(a) (which right has not been forfeited by the Participant pursuant to
Section 7(b)) a lump sum cash payment in full settlement and cancellation of
such LTIP Award equal to such Participant's Percentage Interests Amount or Lump
Sum Amount, determined pursuant to Section 6. Such payment shall be made as soon
as reasonably practicable, but not more than 10 business days, following (i)
with respect to a Participant whose Vesting Date is prior to the Confirmation
Date, (x) the closing of the last transaction resulting in a Sale of the Energy
Business or (y) the closing of the KKR Investment, whichever is applicable, and
(ii) with respect to a Participant whose Vesting Date occurs on or after the
Confirmation Date, such Participant's Vesting Date.

8. Amendment and Termination. Covanta may, in its sole discretion, with
prospective or retroactive effect, amend the Plan at any time and for any
reason, with or without notice and without the consent of any Participant,
stockholder or other person, provided, however, that, without the consent of a
Participant, no such action shall adversely affect the right of such Participant
to receive or be eligible for payment in satisfaction of LTIP Awards granted
under the Plan. The Plan shall automatically terminate following the later of
(i) the expiration of the Covered Period and (ii) the cancellation or expiration
of all LTIP Awards pursuant to Section 7; provided that the clawback provisions
of Section 7(b) shall continue in effect until they are no longer operative.

9.  General Provisions.
    ------------------

         (a) No Special Employment Rights. Nothing contained in the Plan shall
confer upon any Participant any right with respect to the continuation of such
Participant's employment by the Company Group or interfere in any way with the
right of the Company Group at any time to terminate such employment or to
increase or decrease the base salary, other compensation or benefits of such
Participant or otherwise modify the terms or conditions of such Participant's
employment; provided that such actions may result in the vesting of a
Participant's rights in respect of his LTIP Award if they constitute a
termination Without Cause or provided the basis for a resignation for Mutual
Benefit.

         (b) No Assignment by Participants. Each Participant's rights hereunder
are personal and no Participant may assign or transfer any part of his or her

         (c) Certain Withholdings. The Company Group shall have the right to
deduct from amounts otherwise payable under the Plan any sums that federal,
state, local or foreign tax law requires to be withheld with respect to such
payment.

principles of conflicts of laws, and any applicable provisions of federal law.

the Plan shall be paid from the general assets of the Company Group.

         (f) Severability. If any term or provision of the Plan or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance is to any extent held invalid
or unenforceable, the remainder of the Plan or the application of such term or
provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held

Revoke the Release; Effective Date of the Release.

         (a) Participant understands, agrees and acknowledges that:

          1.   he or she has been advised and encouraged by Covanta to have the
               Release reviewed by legal counsel of Participant's own choosing
               and that he or she has been given ample time to do so prior to
               his or her signing the Release;

          2.   he or she has been provided at least twenty-one (21) days to
               consider the Release and to decide whether to agree to the terms
               contained herein;

               (7) day period following the date Participant signs the Release
               by giving written notice of such revocation to the Administrator
               at Covanta Energy, 40 Lane Road, Fairfield, NJ 07004 on or prior
               to the seventh day after the date Participant signs the Release
               and if Participant exercises his or her right to revoke the
               Release, he or she will forfeit his or her right to receive an
               LTIP Award, unless such revocation is due to Covanta's failure to
               execute and deliver to Participant a counterpart of the Release;

          4.   the LTIP Award will not be granted to Participant until at least
               eight (8) days after Participant signs the Release and will be
               granted only if Participant does not revoke the Release pursuant
               to 3 above, subject to the exception in 3 above; and

          5.   by signing the Release, Participant represents that he or she
               fully understands the terms and conditions of the Release and
               intends to be legally bound by them.
