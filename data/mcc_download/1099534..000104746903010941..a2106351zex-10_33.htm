<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This MASTER PURCHASE, SALE AND SERVICES AGREEMENT (together with the Schedules attached hereto from time to time, the "Agreement") is entered into as of this 31st
day of October, 2002 between EME HOMER CITY GENERATION L.P. ("Homer City"), a Pennsylvania limited partnership, and EDISON MISSION MARKETING&nbsp;&amp; TRADING,&nbsp;INC. ("EMMT"), a California
corporation. Each of Homer City and EMMT may be referred to herein as a "Party" and together shall be referred to as the "Parties". </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Homer City is engaged in the business of owning or leasing and operating an 1,884 MW coal- fired electric generating facility commonly known as the Homer City
Electric Generating Station located in Indiana County, Pennsylvania approximately 45 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (the "Facility"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
EMMT is engaged, among other things, in the business of marketing, trading, buying and selling Energy (as defined below), fossil fuels, emissions allowances and other
energy-related physical and financial commodities and products, and derivatives thereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Parties may enter into physical or financial transactions related to the purchase and sale of Energy, fossil fuels, emissions allowances and other energy-related physical
and financial products, and physical and financial derivatives thereof related to the Facility (the "Products"), and Homer City desires, under certain circumstances, to use EMMT's services to
facilitate transactions with third parties related to the purchase and sale of such Products (all transactions described in this paragraph are, collectively, the "Transactions"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Parties intend that all Transactions shall be based on Back-to-Back Transactions (as defined below) between EMMT and unrelated third parties (except
for Transactions in which EMMT acts as Homer City disclosed agent with third parties ("Disclosed Agent Transactions")), and that no Transactions hereunder shall result from or relate to EMMT's
proprietary trading portfolio. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Parties entered into an Energy Sales Agreement dated as of March&nbsp;18, 1999, and a NOx Allowance Sales Agreement dated as of March&nbsp;18, 1999, each of which shall
be superseded in its entirety by this Agreement as of the date hereof; provided that, such contracts shall survive in respect of transactions between the Parties that were effected prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Parties have entered into or expect to enter into a Power Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "PPSA") and an Emissions Trading Agreement (the "ETA") on or about the date
hereof. Transactions under those agreements shall be identified as being under such agreements, and not under this Agreement. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties covenant and
agree as follows: </FONT></P>

California corporation. Each of Homer City and EMMT may be referred to herein as a "Party" and together referred to as the "Parties"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Parties entered into a Master Purchase, Sale and Services Agreement dated as of October&nbsp;31, 2002 (the "Agreement"), which provided that Schedules might be added

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
for administrative convenience EMMT may from time to time hold legal title to Emissions Allowances for the benefit of Homer City in the Homer City Hedge Portolio, and the

therein is transferred back to Homer City or until legal title and/or beneficial interest therein is transferred pursuant to this Agreement or the Master Emissions Allowance Purchase and Sale
Agreement dated as of October&nbsp;31, 2002 between the Parties; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Homer

notify EMMT of any regulatory or third party actions that could reasonably affect such Emission Allowances or Emission Allowance requirements. </FONT></P>

of any financial transaction entered into under this Agreement, shall be established in a Back-to-Back Transaction between EMMT and an unrelated third party (except for
Disclosed Agent Transactions). Each Emission Allowance Transaction hereunder shall be designated by EMMT as a "hedge transaction" in EMMT's Energy Trading System or other applicable software at or
before the execution of its corresponding Back-to-Back Transaction (except for Disclosed Agent Transactions, which shall be designated at the time of such Transaction), and
shall be subsequently evidenced by a written notice (a "Transaction Notice") from EMMT that includes reasonable detail of such Transaction, including the Transaction Price, Transaction Quantity, and
Delivery Date. Such notice may be provided (i)&nbsp;in a monthly accounting journal entry; or (ii)&nbsp;in such other form as agreed by the Parties in writing. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Transactions

Parties acknowledge that Homer City may from time to time notify the EPA that it has transferred Emission Allowances to EMMT, and that these notices constitute a

further disposition, and Homer City retains the economic benefit to such Emission Allowances until such further disposition. </FONT></P>
