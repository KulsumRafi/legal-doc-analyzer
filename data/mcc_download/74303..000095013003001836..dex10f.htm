amount called for by such Section 4.6, except that such lump-sum amount will be calculated first, by calculating the sum equal to the annual benefit which would otherwise be payable to the Executive at age 65 under all Olin pension plans assuming
the Executive had terminated his or her employment with Olin on the date of the Change in Control; second, by multiplying such sum by 72%, which is the current percentage applicable in the calculation of benefits paid to employees retiring from
active service with Olin at age 55 under the early retirement provisions of the Olin Employees Pension Plan; third, by determining the then lump-sum actuarial value of the product resulting from the second step; and fourth, by deducting from such
lump-sum actuarial value the then lump-sum actuarial value of the Executive&#146;s accrued annual benefits under all other Olin pension plans. The actuarial value shall be determined as the amount needed to purchase a fixed annuity through
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (&#147;Metropolitan&#148;) or its successor immediately prior to the Change in Control. In the event such annuity is not available through Metropolitan, then Prudential Insurance Company or an insurance company

purpose of this paragraph 5(e) is to ensure that an Executive who is less than age 55 at the time of the Change in Control receives a lump-sum payment which when combined with the value of the Executive&#146;s pension benefits from all other Olin
pension plans preserves the 72% age 55, subsidized early retirement factor, rather than the actuarial reduction. Such lump-sum payment shall be discounted by the same interest rate used by the insurance company to determine the actuarial value to

means Olin as defined in the preamble to this Agreement and any successor to its business or assets which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this paragraph 7 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this
Agreement by operation of law or otherwise. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">(b)
