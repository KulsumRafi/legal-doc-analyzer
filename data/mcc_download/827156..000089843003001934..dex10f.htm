agree as follows:</font></p> <p><font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Investment</u>.&#160; Within 30 days from the Effective Date, PharmaBio shall remit to
Zila a cash payment of $500,000 (the &#147;<u>Investment</u>&#148;).&#160; </font></p> <p> <font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Royalty to
PharmaBio.</u>&#160; In return for the Investment, Zila agrees to pay to PharmaBio an amount equal to 5% of all net sales of the OraTest product (the &#147;Product&#148;) in the European Union and the United States (the &#147;<u>Royalty</u>&#148;).
When used herein, the term &#147;Product&#148; refers to OraTest and the underlying oral technology, as that brand name may change from time-to-time, for any and all indications, and regardless of whether the sales are generated directly by Zila or

Date; or (b) the aggregate total Royalty shall be capped at $1.25 million if Zila has made less than $1 million in payments to PharmaBio by the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date.&#160; Upon reaching the applicable Royalty cap, Zila&#146;s
obligation to pay any further Royalties to PharmaBio shall terminate.&#160; The Royalty shall be calculated on a quarterly basis ending on the last day of each of Zila&#146;s fiscal quarters, and shall be paid by Zila within 60 days from the end of
the applicable quarter.</font></p> <p> <font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Clinical Trial.</u>&#160; Zila agrees to enter into the GSA with
Quintiles.&#160; In the event Zila terminates the GSA within twelve (12) months following its execution, for reasons other than cause, or Quintiles terminates the GSA for cause, then PharmaBio shall have the right, but not </font></p>

face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Waiver.</u>&#160; The waiver by either Party of the breach of any covenant or provision in this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by either party.</font></p> <p><font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Severability.</u>&#160; In the event a

modified to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision(s) valid and enforceable; or (b) if such a modification is not possible, this Agreement will be interpreted as if such invalid or unenforceable provision(s) were not a part of this
