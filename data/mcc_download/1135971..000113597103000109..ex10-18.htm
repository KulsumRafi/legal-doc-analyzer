<FONT SIZE=3><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Potomac Electric Power Company Executive Performance Supplemental Retirement Plan (the "Pepco plan") was established, effective January 27, 1994 to provide supplemental retirement benefits to key executives of the Company, based on awards received by such executives under the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan.  The Plan was amended from time to time thereafter.  On March 28, 2002, further amendments were authorized to the Pepco plan to recognize the intent to consummate a transaction (the "Merger") by which Pepco and Conectiv would become wholly owned subsidiaries of Pepco Holdings, Inc. (the "Company or "Pepco Holdings") and, for the near term future, to maintain for the benefit of the executives of Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries, the level of benefits provided to such executives by their respective employers prior to the merger.  Such amendments include the authorization to name Pepco Holdings as the sponsor of the plan; to change the name of the Pepco plan to reflect the change in plan sponsorship; to amend the section of the plan relating to eligibility to participate; and to delete all references to Pepco's General Retirement Plan, and to replace all such references to Pepco's General Retirement Plan with "the principal defined benefit pension plan of Pepco Holdings or one of its subsidiaries in which the employee participates.  The Pepco plan, as amended, is restated herein and is now known as the Pepco Holdings, Inc. Executive Performance Supplemental Retirement Plan.<BR>

<BR>
<B>III.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><U>Retirement Benefits<BR>
<BR>
</B></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Section 3.1 defines the amount of retirement income which will be paid to a Participant under this Plan to supplement other pension benefits. The amount of retirement benefits payable from this Plan in the Applicable Form of Benefit shall be the difference, if any, between (i) the aggregate amount of the benefits to which such Participant would be entitled under the provisions of the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan, the provisions of the SERP and the provisions of the Supplemental Benefit Plan (expressed in the Applicable Form of Benefit) (a) had the amount of compensation used under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan to calculate benefits (expressed on an annual basis) been increased by the average of the three highest Awards made to such Participant (or such number of Awards actually made to such Participant if less than three) under the Applicable Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (without regard to any deferral of receipt of an Award elected by such Participant) within the five consecutive years immediately preceding the Participant's retirement under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan and (b)(1) had the amount of the benefits under such plans not been otherwise reduced due to the limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, (2) had any dollar limitation under the Internal Revenue Code on the amount of compensation that may be considered in determining benefits under such plans not been imposed, and (3) had the deferred compensation earned by such Participant which was excluded from the Participant's compensation base used in determining retirement benefits under such plans been included in such compensation base, and (ii) the amount of benefits, if any, to which such Participant is otherwise entitled under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan, the SERP and the Supplemental Benefit Plan. To the extent that a cost of living adjustment is made to benefits payable under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan, a comparable and proportional adjustment will be made to the benefits payable herein.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly benefit provided to a Participant under Section 3.1 shall commence as of the first day of the month on which such Participant begins receipt of retirement benefits under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan and shall continue for so long as benefits are payable to such Participant (or his surviving spouse) under such Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Death Benefits</U> - This Section 3.3 defines the amount of death benefits, if any, which will be paid to the surviving spouse of a Participant who dies while employed by the Company. In order to receive death benefits hereunder, a surviving spouse must have been legally married to the Participant for at least one (1) year prior to the Participant's death and the sum of the Participant's actual years of Benefit Service and constructive years of Benefit Service granted under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan must equal at least ten (10) years. The amount of death benefits payable from this Plan shall be the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of the death benefits to which such surviving spouse would have been entitled under the provisions of the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan, the SERP, the Supplemental Benefit Plan (expressed as a single life annuity) (a) had the amount of the Participant's compensation used under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan to calculate benefits (expressed on an annual basis) under such plans been increased by the average of the three highest Awards made to such Participant (or such number of Awards actually made to such Participant if less than three) under the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (without regard to any deferral of receipt of an Award elected by such Participant) within the five consecutive years immediately preceding the Participant's retirement under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan or death, as the case may be, and (b)(1) had the amount of the benefits under such plans not been otherwise reduced due to the limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, (2) had any dollar limitation under the Internal Revenue Code on the amount of compensation that may be considered in determining benefits under such plans not been imposed, and (3) had the deferred compensation earned by the Participant which was excluded from the Participant's compensation base used in determining retirement benefits under such plans been included in such compensation base, and (ii) the amount of the benefits, if any, to which the surviving spouse would otherwise be entitled under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan, the SERP, and the Supplemental Benefit Plan.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly death benefit provided to a surviving spouse under Section 3.3 shall commence as of the first day of the month on which such surviving spouse begins receipt of death benefits under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan and shall continue for so long as benefits are payable to such surviving spouse under either such Plan.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Loss of</U> <U>Benefits<BR>
<BR>
</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other section of this Plan, if a Participant is discharged by the Company because of misfeasance, malfeasance, dishonesty, fraud, misappropriation of funds, or commission of a felony, such Participant's rights to any benefit under this Plan shall be forfeited.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If during his employment with the Company or after the Participant has ceased to be employed by the Company, and after providing him an opportunity to be heard, following 30 days written notice, sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, the Committee finds that such Participant has used or is using trade secrets or other confidential, secret or proprietary information gained while in the employ of the Company in a manner which is, or is likely to be detrimental to the best interests of the Company, the Committee shall notify such Participant of such findings and stop all current and future distributions of his interest hereunder. If, within one year of the date or such notice, it is determined by the Committee upon proof submitted by such Participant that he has ceased to so use such information and the Company's loss from such Participant's past and future improper use of such information is likely to be insubstantial in proportion to the future loss of his benefit hereunder, the Committee may reinstate him; and, if payment of his retirement income has stopped, it shall be resumed. If he is not reinstated within one year of such notice, the Committee shall cancel his interest hereunder.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Facility of</U> <U>Payment</U> - If the Committee shall find that any person to whom a benefit is payable is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident, any payment due hereunder (unless a prior claim therefore shall have been made by a duly appointed guardian, committee, or other legal representative) may be paid to the spouse, a child, children, a parent, or a brother or sister, or to any person deemed by the Company to have incurred expense for such person otherwise entitled to payment. Any such payment shall be a complete discharge of all liability under the Plan therefore.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Payment of</U> <U>Benefits Upon Change in Control<BR>
<BR>
</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan except Section 3.5, if a Participant terminates employment before the later of (i) the date the employee attains age 59, or (ii) the date the employee first attains either his Early Retirement Date or his Normal Retirement Date under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan for any reason other than death following the occurrence of an event described in subsection (b) of this Section 3.7, the entitlements of such Participant under the Plan shall be paid to him in a lump sum within thirty (30) days of the date of his termination of employment. The amount of such lump sum payment shall be computed in two steps. Under the first step, a calculation will be made of the monthly annuity payments to which such Participant would otherwise have been entitled under the provisions of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of the Plan based upon the service performed by the Participant through the date of such termination of employment, plus any constructive years of Benefit Service granted under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Aggregate Service") under the assumptions that (i) the Participant was scheduled to commence receipt of benefits under this Plan as of the earliest date on which the Participant could receive benefits under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan that were not subject to any early retirement reduction factor described in Section 3.02(a) of the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan determined as if such Participant's years of Vesting Service under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan equaled his Aggregate Service and (ii) this Plan did not contain any minimum age requirement as to eligibility for receipt of benefits. Under the <U>second</U> step, such monthly annuity payments will be discounted to their present value as of the date of the Participant's termination of employment using the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's immediate payment interest rate in effect on the date of the Participant's termination of employment plus one-half of one percent (1/2%).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 3.7 shall apply in the event that (i) any "person" (as such term is used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or (ii) during any period of twenty-four (24) consecutive months (not including any period prior to the adoption of this Plan), individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new director (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in clause (i) or (iii) of this subsection (b)) whose election by the Board of Directors of the Company or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof; or (iii) the stockholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) at least 70% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company, or the stockholders of the Company approve an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all the Company's assets.<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Expenses of</U> <U>Administration</U> - All expenses shall be paid by the Company.<BR>

<BR>

The Company expressly reserves the right at any time, to dismiss, demote or reduce the compensation of any employee without incurring any liability for any claim against itself for any payment whatsoever.<BR>
