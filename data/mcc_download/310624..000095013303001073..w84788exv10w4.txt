      thirty (30) days after filing a request for reconsideration to submit
      additional written material in support of the claim, review pertinent

      notifies the Committee within ninety (90) days after the mailing or
      delivery to the claimant by the Committee of its determination that
      claimant intends to institute legal proceedings challenging the
      determination of the Committee and actually institutes such legal
      proceedings within one hundred eighty (180) days after such mailing or
