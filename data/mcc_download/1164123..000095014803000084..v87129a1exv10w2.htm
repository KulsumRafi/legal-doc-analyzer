be obligated for any finder&#146;s or broker&#146;s fee or commission in connection with
this transaction. The Investor agrees to indemnify and to hold harmless the
Corporation from any liability for any commission or compensation in the nature
of a finders&#146; or broker&#146;s fee (and any asserted liability) for which the
Investor or any of its officers, partners, employees, or representatives is

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>7.8 Amendments and Waivers</B>. Any term of this Agreement may be amended and
the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally
or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively), only
with the written consent of the Corporation and the Investor. Any amendment or
waiver effected in accordance with this Section shall be binding upon the
Investor, each future holder of the Purchased Shares, and the Corporation. No
delay or failure to require performance of any provision of this Agreement
shall constitute a waiver of that provision as to that or any other instance.
No waiver granted under this Agreement as to any one provision herein shall
constitute a subsequent waiver of such provision or of any other provision
herein, nor shall it constitute the waiver of any performance other than the
actual performance specifically waived.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>7.9 Severability. </B>If any provision of this Agreement is determined by any
court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such provision will be enforced to the maximum
extent possible given the intent of the parties hereto. If such clause or
provision cannot be so enforced, such provision shall be stricken from this
Agreement and the remainder of this Agreement shall be enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable clause or provision had (to the extent not
enforceable) never been contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
forgoing, if the value of this Agreement based upon the substantial benefit of
the bargain for any party is materially impaired, which determination as made
by the presiding court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction shall be
binding, then both parties agree to substitute such provision(s) through good
faith negotiations.
