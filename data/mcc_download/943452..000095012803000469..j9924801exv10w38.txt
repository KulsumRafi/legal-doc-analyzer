                            CONSENT AND AMENDMENTS

     1.01 Defined Terms; References. Terms not otherwise defined in this
Amendment shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Credit
Agreement. As used in this Amendment, "including" is not a term of limitation
and means "including without limitation." Each reference to "hereof,"

     1.02 Amendment of Credit Agreement.

     (a) Recitals. Clause (ii) of the fourth recital of the Credit Agreement is
hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

          "(ii) a 364-day convertible revolving credit facility in an amount not
          to exceed $100,000,000; and"

     (b) Definition of Convertible Revolving Credit Expiration Date. The
definition of "Convertible Revolving Credit Expiration Date" as set forth in
Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its
entirety as follows:

          "Convertible Revolving Credit Expiration Date shall mean, with respect
          to the Convertible Revolving Credit Commitments, November 11, 2003, as
          such date may be extended in accordance with the terms hereof, but in
          no event beyond the Revolving Credit Expiration Date."

     (c) Commitments. As of the date hereof, Schedule 1.1(B) to the Credit
Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety with Schedule 1.1(B)
hereto. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any provision of the
Credit Agreement to the contrary, the Convertible Revolving Credit Commitment of
each Bank for whom the "Amount of Commitment for Convertible Revolving Credit
Loans" is established on Schedule 1.1(B) to this Amendment at zero, "$0.00," or
the like is hereby terminated and each such Bank shall have no obligation
whatsoever to make any Convertible Revolving Credit Loan under the Credit
Agreement as modified hereby.

     (d) Additional Lenders Under the Convertible Revolving Credit Facility;
Amendment to Section 11.11. The following Clause (iv) shall be added to Section
11.11 of the Credit Agreement:

          "(iv) Additional lenders who are not Bank parties to this Agreement
          may join in this Agreement at any time for the purpose of providing
          additional Convertible Revolving Credit Commitments to Borrower;
          provided that the addition of such lenders shall be subject to the
          following: (1) no increase of the Convertible Revolving Credit
          Commitment of any Bank which at such time is a party hereto shall
          occur, (2) the maximum permitted amount of all Convertible Revolving
          Credit Commitments of all Banks (after giving effect to the additional
          Convertible Revolving Credit Commitments of such new lenders) shall
          not exceed $100,000,000, (3) the addition of any such lender shall be
          subject to (A) the consent of Borrower and Agent to the same extent as
          is required at Section 11.11(i) in connection with the making of
          assignments and participations and (B) the confidentiality provisions
          of Section 11.12.1 with respect to potential assignees and
          participants, and (4) each such additional lender shall become a Bank
          under this Agreement by executing and delivering to Agent and Borrower
          (with copies to be provided to each of the Banks) a joinder to this
          Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit 11.11. Agent shall
          distribute to the Banks an amended Schedule 1.1(B) reflecting the
          additional Convertible Revolving Credit Commitments of each additional
          lender whereupon such lender shall be a Bank hereunder entitled to and
          bound by the rights and obligations of a Bank hereunder."

     (e) Exhibit 11.11. As of the date hereof, Exhibit 11.11 to this Amendment
shall be Exhibit 11.11 to the Credit Agreement.

                                       2

     (f) Sales of Non-Equal Percentages Permitted. To permit sales by the Banks
under the Credit Agreement of all or a portion of one revolving credit facility
without selling all or an equal portion of the other revolving credit facility
thereunder, the proviso in Clause (3) of Section 11.11(i), which states
"provided that except as set forth in Section 3.4, such Bank sells an equal
percentage interest or participation in each of its Revolving Credit Commitment,
Convertible Revolving Credit Commitment, Revolving Credit Loans, and Convertible
Revolving Credit Loans," is hereby deleted and replaced with the following:
"provided that such Bank sells an equal percentage interest or participation in
its Revolving Credit Commitment or its Convertible Revolving Credit Commitment
and its Loans relating to such commitment,".

     1.03 Waiver of Notice. The parties hereto hereby waive the notice periods
required by Subsections 3.4.1(a) and (b) of the Credit Agreement.

     1.04 Indentures Paid; Deletion of Limitation on Guaranties and on Holdings
of Various Subsidiaries. The Loan Parties, jointly and severally, represent and
warrant to the Agent and each of the Banks that the Indentures have been paid in
full and that no principal amount is outstanding under the Indentures.
Accordingly, (i) each of the Guarantors hereby acknowledges and agrees: that the
limitation set forth at Section 16(d) of each Guaranty Agreement (and any
related limitation set forth in any of the Loan Documents on the obligations of
any Loan Party under each Guaranty Agreement) is of no further force or effect;
and, Section 16(d) of the Guaranty Agreement is hereby deleted; and (ii) Section
8.2.6(b) is hereby deleted.

     1.05 Renewal Fees. On or before the date hereof and as a condition to the
effectiveness of this Amendment, Borrower shall pay in immediately available
funds to each Bank an amount equal to 15 basis points (0.15%) of the amount of
such Bank's Convertible Revolving Credit Commitment set forth on Schedule 1.1(B)
hereto. Upon any additional lender referred to in Clause (d) of this Section
1.02 becoming a Bank, Borrower shall pay in immediately available funds to each
such Bank an amount equal to 15 basis points (0.15%) of the amount of such
Bank's Convertible Revolving Credit Commitment set forth on the then applicable
Schedule 1.1(B) to the Credit Agreement.

     1.06 Name Changes, Mergers. Each of the Loan Parties acknowledges,
represents, warrants, and covenants as follows:

          (a) As of August 15, 2002, MotivePower Canada Corporation changed its
          name to Wabtec Railway Electronics Corporation; for all purposes of

          references to Wabtec Railway Electronics Company;

          (b) Pursuant to a Certificate of Ownership and Merger of Borrower,
          effective as of December 31, 2001, Vapor Corporation merged with and
