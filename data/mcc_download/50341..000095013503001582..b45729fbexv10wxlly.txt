       (including without limitation payment to the Executive on account of the
       items described in paragraph (C) of such Section 6.1), representing the
       amounts and benefits to which the Executive would have been entitled
       under the Prior Agreement, as determined by the Auditor no later than 30
       days after the execution of this Agreement, plus interest from the
       Effective Date to the effective date of this Third Amendment (the
       "Initial Interest Term"), at an annual rate equal to the "prime" rate as
       in effect from time to time, compounded daily, and interest from the
       effective date of this Third Amendment to the date of payment of such

       prior month 1 Year Constant Maturity Treasury rate as determined each
       month by the Federal Reserve, compounded daily (subject to the limitation
       that the average interest rate used during the Initial Interest Term and

       three years following the Date of Termination the continuation of the
