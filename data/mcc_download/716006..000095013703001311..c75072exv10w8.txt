                               YELLOW CORPORATION

This Stock Option Agreement (the "Agreement"), made this ____ day of _____, ____
between Yellow Corporation (the "Company") and [name of executive] (the

1.    Grant; Number of Shares. The Grantee has been granted an Option covering
      _____ shares of common stock of the Company.

2.    Exercise Price. The price at which shares may be acquired on exercise of
      the Option is $____ per share.

3.    Term of Option. The term of the Option is from [date of grant], until the
      close of business at the executive offices of the Company on [tenth
      anniversary of date of grant].

4.    When Option Becomes Exercisable. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph
      5, [1/4 of] shares become exercisable on [first anniversary of date of
      grant], [1/4 of]shares on [second anniversary of date of grant], [1/4 of]
      shares on [third anniversary of date of grant], and the remaining ___
      shares on [fourth anniversary of date of grant]. Once shares become
      exercisable, they may be exercised in part or whole from that date through
      [tenth anniversary of date of grant].

5.    Acceleration of Exercisability. Notwithstanding the provisions of
      paragraph 4 of this agreement:

      a)    If the Grantee dies or becomes permanently and totally disabled
            while in the employ of the Company or a subsidiary and prior to the
            time the Option becomes exercisable, the option shall become
            immediately exercisable. For purposes of this paragraph and
            paragraph 6(c), a Grantee shall be considered permanently and
            totally disabled if he is unable to engage in any substantial
            gainful employment by reason of any medically determinable physical
            or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or
            which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period
            of not less than 12 months. The existence of such permanent and
            total disability shall be evidenced by such medical certification as
            the Secretary of the Company shall require and approved by the
            Company's Compensation Committee.

      b)    If the company is wholly or partially liquidated, or is a party to a
            merger, consolidation, or reorganization in which it is not the
            surviving entity, this option shall become immediately exercisable.

6.    Lapse of Rights Under Option.

      a)    Except as provided below, termination of the Grantee's employment
            with the Company or any subsidiary shall cause this option to lapse
            to the extent it was not exercised as of the date of termination.

      b)    If the termination is the result of the Grantee's retirement after
            having attained age 55 with at least 11 years of service with the
            Company and/or a subsidiary company or termination at age 65 or
            after, the Option shall not lapse by reason of termination until the
            first anniversary of retirement.

      c)    If the termination is the result of the Grantee's death or permanent
            and total disability, the Option shall not lapse as to any shares as
            to which it was exercisable at the date of termination until the
            first anniversary of the termination. Shares to which the Option
            becomes exercisable by virtue of paragraph 5 above shall be treated
            as shares as to which the Option is exercisable for purposes of this
            paragraph (c).

      d)    Nothing in paragraph 6 shall be construed to extend the term of the
            award.

7.    Authorized Leave. Authorized leaves of absence from the Company shall not
      constitute a termination of employment for purposes of this Option. For
      purposes of this Option, an authorized leave of absence shall be an
      absence while the Grantee is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona
      fide leave of absence so long as the Grantee's right to employment with
      the Company is guaranteed by statute, a contract, or Company policy.

8.    Method of Exercise. The rights presented by this Option shall be exercised
      by a written notice which shall state: (a) the election to exercise those
      rights; (b) the number of Shares in respect of which the Option is being
      exercised; (c) the person(s) in whose name the stock certificate(s)
      receivable on exercise of the Option are to be registered; and (d) the
      address and Social Security Number of each such person. The notice shall
      be signed by the person(s) entitled to exercise the Option and, if the
      Option is being exercised by a person or persons other than the Grantee,
      shall be accompanied by proof, satisfactory to the Company, of the right
      of such person(s) to exercise the Option. Payment of the purchase price of
      any Shares shall be either by 1) personal check, which must be delivered
      with the notice of exercise; or 2) surrender of Shares of Company stock,
      certificates for which Shares transferring ownership to the Company must
      accompany the notice (this option may be combined with the first option to
      allow payment in both stock and cash); or 3) cashless exercise pursuant to
      the Cashless Exercise Program offered by the Company. As a condition to
      the exercise of the Option, the Company may require the person(s)
      exercising the Option to make any representation, warranty or undertaking
      required by any applicable law or regulation. A notice of exercise is
      effective from and after it is received by the Secretary of the Company.

9.    Withholding. Grantee hereby authorizes the Company to withhold in
      accordance with applicable law for any compensation payable to him any
      taxes required to be withheld by federal, state or local law as a result
      of the exercise of this Option.

      payee" pursuant to QDRO.

      arising under the Plan is conclusive and binding.
