                                                                               3

Required Lenders under the Credit Agreement (as defined in the 2000A
Participation Agreement) agree that the reference in Section 30.1(c) of the
Lease (as defined in the 2000A Participation Agreement) to the "Initial Closing
Date" shall instead be deemed to be a reference to the Effective Date.

                3.   Effectiveness. The Waiver shall become effective (the
"Effective Date") upon fulfillment of the following conditions precedent: (a)
Holdings and HCC shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent duly executed
copies of this Waiver, (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received duly
executed copies of this Waiver from the Required Lenders under each of the
Senior Credit Agreement and the Synthetic Guarantees, (c) no Default or Event of

defined in the 2000A Participation Agreement) an Appraisal of the Equipment
subject to the Lease on the Effective Date demonstrating that the value of the
Equipment subject to the Lease is equal to or greater than the Termination Value
(as such terms are defined in the 2001A Participation Agreement).

                4.   Representations and Warranties. Holdings and HCC hereby
represent and warrant that the representations and warranties contained in each
of the Senior Credit Agreement, the Loan Documents and the Operative Agreements
(as defined in each of the Synthetic Guarantees) will be, after giving effect to
this Waiver, true and correct in all material respects, as if made on and as of
the date hereof (except those which expressly speak as of a certain date).

                5.   Continuing Effect of the Senior Credit Agreement,
Participation Agreements and Operative Agreements. This Waiver shall not
constitute an amendment or waiver of any other provision of the Senior Credit
Agreement, the Loan Documents or the Operative Agreements not expressly referred
to herein and shall not be construed as a waiver or consent to any further or
future action on the part of HCC, Holdings, the 2000B Lessor, the 2000A Lessor
or the 1999 Lessor that would require a waiver or consent of the Administrative
Agent and/or the 2000B Lenders, the 2000A Lenders or the 1999 Lenders. Except as
expressly amended hereby, the provisions of each of the Senior Credit Agreement,
the Loan Documents and the Operative Agreements are and shall remain in full
force and effect.

                6.   Counterparts. This Waiver may be executed in counterparts
and all of the said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute
one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this
Waiver by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart hereof.

                7.   GOVERNING LAW. THIS WAIVER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
