                                   Article 3
                   PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND COLLATERAL SECURITY

3.1   PRINCIPAL. The Corporation shall pay to the Debentureholder the
outstanding principal amount of the Debentures (unless such Debentures shall
have been converted in accordance with the provisions hereof) together with all
accrued and unpaid interest thereon on the Maturity Date on presentation and

or conversion shall be cancelled by the Corporation and no Debentures shall be

                                   Article 4
                                   CONVERSION

4.1   CONVERSION AT THE OPTION OF THE DEBENTUREHOLDERS. A Debentureholder may
elect at any time or from time to time, at the Debentureholder's option, during
the Conversion Period or in the circumstances set forth in section 7.3, to
convert a Debenture or any portion of the then outstanding principal and all
accrued and unpaid interest of a Debenture into fully paid and non-assessable
Shares at the Conversion Price (the "Conversion Right").

4.2   CONVERSION PROCEDURE. Upon the exercise of its Conversion Right, the
Debentureholder shall surrender the Debenture, together with the conversion form
attached thereto, duly executed (the "Conversion Notice"), to the Corporation at
its address set forth under section 8.1 or at such other place as the
Corporation may advise the Debentureholder in writing. Conversion shall be
deemed to have been effected on the date (the "Conversion Date") on which the
Conversion Notice is actually received by the Corporation. Within the next five
(5) Business Days, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to the
Debentureholder:

         (a)    a certificate or certificates representing the number of Common
                Shares (and/or other Shares, as the case may be) purchased upon
                exercise of the Conversion Right, rounded down to the nearest
                whole number, registered in the name of the Debentureholder or
                otherwise as directed in the Conversion Notice; and

         (b)    cash for any fractional shares in an amount equal to the product
                of (x) the Conversion Price per Share and (y) any fraction of a
                Share remaining after conversion pursuant to section 4.2((a);
                and

         (c)    in the event of any partial conversion of a Debenture, a new
                Debenture in identical form, the principal amount of which shall
                be equal to the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid
                interest owing under a Debenture which was not converted under
                this Article 4 hereof.

        The Debentureholder shall be deemed to have become a beneficial
shareholder and shareholder of record of Common Shares (and/or other Shares, as
the case may be) on the date that conversion is deemed to have been effected
pursuant to this Article 4.

4.3   RESERVATION AND ISSUANCE OF SHARES. The Corporation shall, prior to
issuance of any Shares hereunder, and from time to time as may be necessary
(and within the five [5] Business Days next following an adjustment pursuant to
this Article 4), reserve out of its authorized but unissued Shares a sufficient
number of Shares to permit the conversion of all Debentures into Shares. The
Corporation covenants that all securities, including any shares into which the
Shares may be converted, that may be issued upon exercise of the Conversion
Right

<PAGE>

                                    Page 11

will, upon issuance, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable and free from pre-emptive rights, adverse claims and all taxes,
liens and charges caused or created by the Corporation with respect to the
issuance thereof.

      The Corporation will use its best efforts to cause prompt compliance with
all applicable securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of Shares upon
conversion of the Debenture, if any.

4.4   CASH DISTRIBUTIONS. In case the Corporation shall pay or make a dividend
or other distribution on its Shares exclusively in cash subsequent to the date
hereof and prior to the Conversion Period, adequate provision shall be made so
that the Debentureholder shall have the right to receive upon conversion the
amount of cash it would have received had it exercised its Conversion Right
immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution.

4.5   ADJUSTMENT FOR CAPITAL REORGANIZATION. If at any time after the date
hereof and prior to the Conversion Date, there is (i) a payment of a stock
dividend or other distribution of securities of the Corporation to holders of
the Corporation's Shares (and/or other Common Shares, as the case may be), or
(ii) a subdivision, consolidation, split or other reclassification of the Shares
(and/or other Common Shares, as the case may be) at any time outstanding, or
(iii) a change of the Shares (and/or other Common Shares, as the case may be)
into other shares or into other securities, whether of the Corporation or of
another body corporate, or (iv) a consolidation, amalgamation or merger of the
Corporation with or into any other Person (other than a consolidation,
amalgamation or merger which does not result in any reclassification of the
outstanding Shares [and/or other Common Shares, as the case may be] or a change
of the Shares [and/or other Common Shares, as the case may be] into other
shares), or (v) a transfer of the undertaking or assets of the Corporation as an
entirety or substantially as an entirety to another Person in which the
Shareholders of the Corporation are entitled to receive shares, other securities
or other property, or (vi) any other capital reorganization, (any of such events
being called a "Capital Reorganization"), the Debentureholder who exercises the
Conversion Right after the effective date of such Capital Reorganization will be
entitled to receive, in lieu of the number of Shares (and/or other Common
Shares, as the case may be) to which the Debentureholder was previously entitled
upon such conversion, the aggregate number of shares, other securities or other
property which the Debentureholder would have been entitled to receive as a
result of such Capital Reorganization if the Conversion Right had been exercised
immediately prior to the Capital Reorganization.

      The Corporation will take all steps necessary to ensure that, on a Capital
Reorganization, the Debentureholder will, if it exercises its Conversion Right
hereto, receive the aggregate number of Shares, other securities or other
property to which it is entitled as a result of the Capital Reorganization.
Appropriate adjustments will be made in the application of the provisions set
forth in this Article 4 with respect to the rights of the Debentureholder under
a Debenture after such Capital Reorganization such that the provisions set forth
in this Article 4 (including adjustment of the Conversion Price then in effect
and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Debenture) shall be
applicable after that event as nearly equivalently as may be practicable.

4.6   ADJUSTMENT FOR DILUTING ISSUES. In the event that the Corporation shall
issue Additional Shares without consideration or for a consideration per share
less than the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the date of and
immediately prior to such issue (the "Effective Conversion Price"), then the
Effective Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a
price (calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying the Effective

<PAGE>

                                    Page 12


Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to such issue plus the number of Shares
which the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation for the total
number of Additional Shares so issued would purchase at the Effective Conversion
Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to such issue plus the number of such Additional Shares so
issued. For all purposes of this section 4.6, all Shares issuable upon the
exercise, conversion or exchange of outstanding Options or Convertible
Securities, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be outstanding and have been
issued at the lowest applicable exercise of conversion price of such options or
convertible securities. To the extent that any Options (or the conversion or
exercise right for any Convertible Securities) are not exercised prior to the
expiration thereof, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted appropriately.

      In determining whether any Additional Shares are issued for less than the
Effective Conversion Price, and in determining the aggregate offering
consideration received for such Additional Shares, there shall be taken into
account the fair market value of any consideration received by the Corporation
for such Additional Shares (the fair market value of any such non-cash
consideration to be determined in good faith by the board of directors of the
Corporation).

      The maximum cumulative reduction of the Conversion Price pursuant to this
section 4.6 shall be fifteen percent (15%).

4.7   NOTICE AS TO ADJUSTMENT. The Corporation shall from time to time, within
the ten (10) Business Days following the occurrence of any event which requires
an adjustment or readjustment as provided in sections 4.5 or 4.6, deliver a
notice in writing (an "Adjustment Notice") to the Debentureholders specifying
the nature of the event requiring the same, the amount of the adjustment or
readjustment and the new Conversion Price, and setting forth in reasonable
detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is
based.

      Within the fifteen (15) Business Days next following receipt of an
Adjustment Notice, a Debentureholder may notify the Corporation and the
Corporation's Auditors in writing that it disputes the contents of the
Adjustment Notice. In the event that the parties are unable to resolve such
dispute, the subject matter will be conclusively determined by a firm of
chartered accountants (other than the Corporation's Auditors) as may be selected
by a majority in interest of the Debentureholders and the Corporation. Such
chartered accountants will be given access to all necessary records of the
Corporation and will deliver a notice to the Corporation and the
Debentureholders setting forth their determination and the definitive adjustment
or readjustment.

                                   Article 5

            Subsidiaries is a party or to which the property of the Corporation
            or any of its Material Subsidiaries is subject that would result
            individually or in the aggregate in any Material Adverse Change in
            the operation, business or condition of the Corporation or any
            Material Subsidiary and, to the best of its knowledge, information
            and belief, no such proceedings have been threatened against or are
