     The Employment Agreement effective as of February 28, 2001, and amended by
the First Amendment to Employment Agreement dated January 18, 2002, by and
between SUSQUEHANNA BANCSHARES, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation organized as a

that such employee benefits are provided by insurance companies and other
vendors not affiliated with the Company, the obligation of the Company and the
