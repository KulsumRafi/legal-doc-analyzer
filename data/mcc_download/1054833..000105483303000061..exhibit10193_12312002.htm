<P align=center><FONT SIZE=2><b>GOOD FAITH COMPLIANCE AMENDMENT FOR THE</b></FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT SIZE=2><b>ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TAX RELIEF RECONCILIATION
ACT OF 2001 (EGTRRA)</b></FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT SIZE=2>This amendment of the Plan
is adopted to reflect certain provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA). This amendment is intended as good faith
compliance with the requirements of EGTRRA and is to be construed in accordance
with EGTRRA and guidance issued thereunder. Except as otherwise provided, this
amendment shall be effective as of the first day of the first Plan Year
beginning after December 31, 2001. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT SIZE=2>This amendment shall
supersede the provisions of the Plan to the extent those provisions are
inconsistent with the provisions of this amendment. </FONT></P>

<P align=left><FONT SIZE=2><b>Coventry Health Care, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan</b></FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT SIZE=2>The Plan named above gives
the Employer the right to amend it at any time. According to that right, the
Plan is amended as follows: </FONT></P>

<P align=left><FONT SIZE=2><b>INCREASE IN COMPENSATION LIMIT</b></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT SIZE=2>For Plan Years beginning on

into account for determining all benefits provided under the Plan for any
determination period shall not exceed $200,000, as adjusted for increases in the
cost-of-living in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). The cost-of-living
adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any determination period
beginning in such calendar year. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT SIZE=2>If Compensation for any
prior determination period is taken into account in determining a
Participant&#146;s contributions or benefits for the current Plan Year, the
Compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable
annual compensation limit in effect for that determination period. For this
purpose, in determining contributions or benefits in Plan Years beginning on or
after January 1, 2002, the annual Compensation limit in effect for determination
periods beginning before that date is $200,000. </FONT></P>

<P align=left><FONT SIZE=2><b>Effective date.</b>  This section shall apply to
distributions made after December 31, 2001.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT SIZE=2><b>Modification of definition of Eligible Retirement Plan.</b>
For purposes of the DIRECT ROLLOVER Section, an
Eligible Retirement Plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in Code
Section 403(b) and an eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) which is
maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees
to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan. The
definition of Eligible Retirement Plan shall also apply in the case of a
distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the
alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Code
Section 414(p). </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT SIZE=2><b>Modification of definition
of Eligible Rollover Distribution to exclude hardship distributions.</b> For
purposes of the DIRECT ROLLOVER Section, any amount that is distributed on
account of hardship shall not be an Eligible Rollover Distribution and the
Distributee may not elect to have any portion of such a distribution paid
directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT SIZE=2><b>Modification of definition
of Eligible Rollover Distribution to include after-tax employee contributions.</b>
For purposes of the DIRECT ROLLOVER Section, a portion of a distribution shall
not fail to be an Eligible Rollover Distribution merely because the portion
consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross
income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual
retirement account or individual retirement annuity described in Code Section
408(a) or (b), or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Code
Section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so
transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such
distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such
distribution which is not so includible. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><b>ROLLOVERS FROM OTHER PLANS</b></FONT></P>

Participant Rollover Contributions and/or direct rollovers of distributions made
