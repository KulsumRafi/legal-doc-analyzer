ACTUARIAL INFORMATION

     LUMP SUM DISTRIBUTIONS AND 415 ADJUSTMENTS

     For lump sum distributions paid after 1996, each lump sum distribution
under the Plan shall be calculated using an interest rate of six percent (6%)
and the 1971 Group Annuity Mortality Table (Male), set back one year (-1), or
the following interest rate and mortality table, whichever yields the larger
lump sum:

     (a) the annual rate of interest on thirty (30) year Treasury securities for
the third calendar month preceding the first day of the Plan Year which contains
the Participant's Annuity Starting Date; and

     (b) the mortality table prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury based
on the "prevailing commissioner's standard table" used to determine reserves for
group annuity contracts issued on the date as of which the present value of the
distribution is determined.

     The above-specified mortality table shall also be used for adjustments
under Section 3.8 of the Plan and the above-specified interest rate shall also
be used for purposes of adjusting the benefit on limitation under Code
ss.415(b)(2)(B)or (C) of any form of benefit subject to Code ss.417(e)(3).

     Effective for distributions with Annuity Starting Dates on or after
December 31, 2002 and notwithstanding any other Plan provision to the contrary,
the applicable mortality table used for purposes of adjusting any benefit or
limitation under Code ss.415(b)(2)(B), (C) or (D) (as provided in Section 3.8 of
the Plan) and for purposes of satisfying the requirements of Code ss.417(e) is
the mortality table prescribed in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 (or such other
mortality table published by the Internal Revenue Service using the latest
effective date permitted for that table).

     OPTIONAL FORMS OF BENEFIT

     For purposes of determining optional forms of benefits and for calculating
the Actuarial Equivalent benefit under Section 5.2, the 1971 Group Annuity
Mortality Table (Male), -1 at six percent (6%) interest rate shall be used.
