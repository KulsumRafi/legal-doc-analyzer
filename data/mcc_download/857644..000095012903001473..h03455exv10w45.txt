                                   ARTICLE IV

                       CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF BENEFITS

      4.1 PERIODIC PAYMENTS. Each time a cash distribution is paid to a Unit
owner during the Performance Period for which an Award was granted to a Grantee,
TEPPCO shall pay to the Grantee, if the Grantee is then an Employee, an amount
equal to the product of the number of Long Term Incentive Units granted under
the Award and the amount of the cash distribution paid per Unit by the
Partnership.

      4.2 TERMINAL VALUE PAYMENTS. Except as otherwise specified in an Award
Agreement pursuant to Section 4.3, as soon as administratively practicable after
the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall determine the amount of
Economic Value Added during the Performance Period. Then, unless the Grantee has
incurred a Separation From Service during the Performance Period due to his
resignation (other than as a result of his death, Disability or Retirement) or
due to the termination of his employment by TEPPCO for Cause, the Committee
shall determine the amount of a Grantee's Vested Interest in his Award granted
for the Performance Period. If the Grantee is an Employee on the last day of the
Performance Period, as soon as administratively practicable after the
Performance Period, subject to the following provisions of this Section 4.2,
TEPPCO shall pay the Grantee an amount equal to the product of (A), (B) and (C)
where (A) is Grantee's Vested Interest in his Award, (B) is the number of the
Grantee's Long Term Incentive Units granted under his Award, and (C) is the Fair
Market Value of a Unit. If the Grantee incurs a Separation From Service during
the Performance Period as a result of his death, Disability or Retirement, then
as soon as administratively practicable after the Performance Period, subject to
the following provisions of this Section 4.2, TEPPCO shall pay to the Grantee
(or in the event of the Grantee's death, his Spouse or estate, as applicable) an
amount equal to the product of the amount determined under the preceding
sentence and a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that have
elapsed during the Performance Period prior to the Grantee's Separation From
Service and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Performance
Period. Except as expressly provided otherwise in an Award Agreement, if TEPPCO
does not have sufficient funds to satisfy its obligations under an Award
immediately after the expiration of the applicable Performance Period, TEPPCO
shall pay to the Grantee amounts due under this Section 4.2 if, as and when
TEPPCO has sufficient funds to make payments under the Award. Except as
expressly provided otherwise in an Award Agreement, TEPPCO shall not be
obligated to borrow funds or use borrowed funds to satisfy its obligations under
this Section 4.2.

      4.3 CHANGE IN CONTROL. The Committee may specify in an Award Agreement the
effect of a Change in Control on an Award.

      4.4 FORM OF PAYMENT UNDER AN AWARD. All payments under Awards shall be in
the form of cash.

      4.5 NO INTEREST ON AWARD. No interest shall be credited with respect to
any Award or any payment under an Award.


                                     IV-1
<PAGE>

      4.6 PAYMENT(S) ON DEATH OF GRANTEE. Upon the death of a Grantee before he
has been paid his entire benefits under his Award, his benefits under his Award
shall be paid to the Grantee's Spouse if the Spouse survives the Grantee, or to
the Grantee's estate if the Grantee's Spouse does not survive the Grantee. Any
payment under this Section 4.6 shall be made at the same time the payment would
have been made to the Grantee if he had been alive.

      4.7 FORFEITURE FOR CAUSE. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the
Plan, if the Committee finds by a majority vote after full consideration of the
facts that a Grantee was discharged from the employ of TEPPCO or an Affiliate
for Cause, the Grantee shall forfeit all outstanding Awards. The decision of the
Committee as to the cause of the Grantee's discharge shall be final. No decision
of the Committee shall affect the finality of the discharge of the Grantee.

      4.8 ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO CHANGES IN THE PARTNERSHIP'S OR TEPPCO'S CAPITAL
STRUCTURE. If the Partnership shall effect a subdivision or consolidation of
Units or other capital readjustment, or other increase or reduction of the
number of Units outstanding, without receiving compensation for it in money,
services or property, then the number of Long Term Incentive Units subject to
outstanding Awards under the Plan shall be appropriately adjusted by the
Committee in such a manner as to entitle a Grantee to receive the equivalent
compensation he would have received under the Award had there been no event
requiring the adjustment.

      If while Awards remain outstanding under the Plan (a) the Partnership or
TEPPCO shall not be the surviving entity in any merger, consolidation or other
reorganization (or survives only as a subsidiary of an entity other than an
entity that was wholly-owned by the Partnership or TEPPCO immediately prior to
such merger, consolidation or other reorganization), (b) the Partnership or
TEPPCO sells, leases or exchanges or agrees to sell, lease or exchange all or
substantially all of its assets to any other person or entity (other than an
entity wholly-owned by the Partnership or TEPPCO), (c) the Partnership or TEPPCO
is to be dissolved, or (d) the Partnership or TEPPCO is a party to any other
corporate transaction (as defined under Section 424(a) of the Code and

                                   ARTICLE V

                                 ADMINISTRATION

      5.1 GENERAL. The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. All
questions of interpretation and application of the Plan and Awards shall be
subject to the determination of the Committee. A majority of the members of the
Committee shall constitute a quorum. All determinations of the Committee shall
be made by a majority of its members. Any decision or determination reduced to
writing and signed by a majority of the members shall be as effective as if it
had been made by a majority vote at a meeting properly called and held.

      5.2 POWERS OF COMMITTEE. The Committee shall have the exclusive
responsibility for the general administration of the Plan according to the terms
and provisions of the Plan and will have all the powers necessary to accomplish
those purposes, including but not by way of limitation the right, power and
authority:

                  (a) to make rules, regulations and administrative guidelines
for the administration of the Plan;

                  (b) to construe all terms, provisions, conditions and
limitations of the Plan;

                  (c) to correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile
any inconsistency that may appear in the Plan in the manner and to the extent it
deems expedient to carry the Plan into effect for the greatest benefit of all
parties at interest;

                  (d) to determine all controversies relating to the
administration of the Plan, including but not limited to:

                        (1) differences of opinion arising between TEPPCO and a
Grantee; and

                        (2) any question it deems advisable to determine in
order to promote the uniform administration of the Plan for the benefit of all
parties at interest;

                  (e) to determine the Employees who shall participate in the
Plan from time to time;

                  (f) to determine the number of Long Term Incentive Units to be
awarded to each Grantee; and

                  (g) to determine the terms and conditions, if any, not
inconsistent with the terms of the Plan that are to be placed upon the Award or
Awards given to a particular Grantee.

      5.3 COMMITTEE DISCRETION. The Committee in exercising any power or
authority granted under the Plan or in making any determination under the Plan
shall perform or refrain


                                      V-1
<PAGE>

from performing those acts in its sole discretion and judgment. Any decision
made by the Committee or any refraining to act or any act taken by the Committee
in good faith shall be final and binding on all parties. The Committee's
decisions shall never be subject to de novo review, but instead shall only be
overturned if found to be arbitrary or capricious by an arbitrator or a court of
law.

      5.4 DISQUALIFICATION OF COMMITTEE MEMBER. A member of the Committee shall
not vote or act on any Plan matter relating solely to himself.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                        AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF PLAN

      The Board may amend, terminate or suspend the Plan at any time, in its
sole and absolute discretion. However, no amendment or termination of the Plan
may, without the consent of a Grantee, reduce the Grantee's right to a payment
under the Plan that he is entitled to receive under the terms of the Plan in
effect prior to the amendment or termination.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                     FUNDING

      7.1 PAYMENTS UNDER THE PLAN ARE THE OBLIGATION OF TEPPCO. Benefits due
under the Plan will be paid by TEPPCO.

      7.2 GRANTEES MUST RELY SOLELY ON THE GENERAL CREDIT OF TEPPCO. The Plan is
only a general corporate commitment of TEPPCO and each Grantee must rely solely
upon the general credit of TEPPCO for the fulfillment of its obligations
hereunder. Under all circumstances the rights of the Grantee to any asset held
by TEPPCO will be no greater than the rights expressed in the Plan. Nothing
contained in the Plan or an Award will constitute a guarantee by TEPPCO that the
assets of TEPPCO will be sufficient to pay any benefits under the Plan or would
place the Grantee in a secured position ahead of general creditors of TEPPCO;
the Grantees are only unsecured creditors of TEPPCO with respect to their Plan
benefits and the Plan constitutes a mere promise by TEPPCO to make benefit
payments in the future. No specific assets of TEPPCO have been or will be set
aside, or will be pledged in any way for the performance of TEPPCO's obligations
under the Plan which would remove such assets from being subject to the general
creditors of TEPPCO.

      7.3 UNFUNDED ARRANGEMENT. It is intended that the Plan shall be unfunded
for tax purposes and for purposes of Title of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      8.1 NO EMPLOYMENT OBLIGATION. The granting of any Award shall not
constitute an employment contract, express or implied, nor impose upon TEPPCO or
any Affiliate any obligation to employ or continue to employ the Grantee. The
right of TEPPCO or any Affiliate to terminate the employment of any person shall
not be diminished or affected by reason of the fact that an Award has been
granted to him.

      8.2 TAX WITHHOLDING. TEPPCO shall be entitled to deduct from the Award or
other compensation payable to each Grantee any sums required by federal, state,
or local tax law to be withheld with respect to payments under an Award.

      8.3 INDEMNIFICATION OF THE COMMITTEE. TEPPCO shall indemnify each present
and future member of the Committee against, and each member of the Committee
shall be entitled without further act on his part to indemnity from TEPPCO for,
all expenses (including attorney's fees, the amount of judgments and the amount
of approved settlements made with a view to the curtailment of costs of
litigation, other than amounts paid to TEPPCO itself) reasonably incurred by him
in connection with or arising out of any action, suit, or proceeding in which he
may be involved by reason of his being or having been a member of the Committee,
whether or not he continues to be a member of the Committee at the time of
incurring the expenses -- including, without limitation, matters as to which he
shall be finally adjudged in any action, suit or proceeding to have been found
to have been negligent in the performance of his duty as a member of the
Committee. However, this indemnity shall not include any expenses incurred by
any member of the Committee in respect of matters as to which he shall be
finally adjudged in any action, suit or proceeding to have been guilty of gross
negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of his duty as a member of
the Committee. In addition, no right of indemnification under the Plan shall be
available to or enforceable by any member of the Committee unless, within 60
days after institution of any action, suit or proceeding, he shall have offered
TEPPCO, in writing, the opportunity to handle and defend same at its own
expense. This right of indemnification shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors or administrators of each member of the Committee and shall be in
addition to all other rights to which a member of the Committee may be entitled
as a matter of law, contract, or otherwise.

      8.4 GENDER AND NUMBER. If the context requires, words of one gender when
used in the Plan shall include the other and words used in the singular or
plural shall include the other.

      8.5 HEADINGS. Headings of Articles and Sections are included for
convenience of reference only and do not constitute part of the Plan and shall
not be used in construing the terms of the Plan.

      8.6 OTHER COMPENSATION PLANS. The adoption and maintenance of the Plan
shall not affect any other stock option, incentive or other compensation or
benefit plans in effect for TEPPCO or any Affiliate or preclude TEPPCO from
establishing any other forms of incentive or other compensation for employees of
TEPPCO or any Affiliate.


                                     VIII-1

      8.7 RIGHTS OF COMPANY AND AFFILIATES. The existence of Long Term Incentive
Units shall not affect in any way the right or power of TEPPCO or an Affiliate
to (a) make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations,
reorganizations or other changes in TEPPCO's or an Affiliate's structure or
business, (b) approve and consummate any merger or consolidation of TEPPCO or an
Affiliate with or into any entity, (c) issue any bonds, debentures or Company or
Affiliate interests of any nature whatsoever to any person, (d) approve and
consummate the dissolution or liquidation of TEPPCO or an Affiliate or any sale
or transfer of all or any part of TEPPCO's or an Affiliate's assets or business
or (e) approve and consummate any other act or proceeding whether of a similar
character or otherwise.

      8.8 NONALIENATION OF BENEFITS. No benefit provided under the Plan shall be
transferable by the Grantee except pursuant to a state domestic relations order.
No right or benefit under the Plan shall be subject to anticipation, alienation,
sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge. Any attempt to anticipate,
alienate, sell, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any right or benefit under
the Plan shall be void. No right or benefit under the Plan shall, in any manner,
be liable for or subject to any debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of the
person entitled to the right or benefit. If any Grantee becomes bankrupt or
attempts to anticipate, alienate, assign, pledge, sell, encumber or charge any
right or benefit under the Plan then the right or benefit shall, in the
discretion of the Committee, cease. In that event, TEPPCO and/or one or more
Affiliates may hold or apply the right or benefit or any part of the right or
benefit for the benefit of the Grantee, his or her spouse, children or other
dependents or any of them in the manner and in the proportion that the Committee
shall deem proper, in its sole discretion, but is not required to do so. The
restrictions in this Section 8.8 shall not apply to state domestic relations
orders.

      8.9 NO RIGHTS AS AN OWNER. No Grantee shall have any rights as a Unit
owner as a result of his Award. No Award will permit any Grantee to exercise any
managerial rights or powers with respect to TEPPCO, the Partnership or any
Affiliate.

      8.10 GOVERNING LAW. The validity, interpretation, construction and
enforceability of the Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas.
