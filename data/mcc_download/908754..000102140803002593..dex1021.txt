RE: LETTER AGREEMENT: FIRST AMENDMENT TO COMPENSATION AGREEMENT, EFFECTIVE DATE
    AUGUST 1, 2002

Dear Mr. Davis:

       Reference is made to the above-mentioned Compensation Agreement,
effective August 1, 2002 (the "Compensation Agreement"), between Murdock
Communications Corporation ("MCC") and Pirinate Consulting Group, L.L.C.
("Pirinate").

       We have discussed certain amendments to the Compensation Agreement
necessary to facilitate MCC's proposed merger transaction with Polar Molecular
Corporation. This letter agreement shall memorialize, constitute, and serve as
the First Amendment to the Compensation Agreement. The Parties to the
Compensation Agreement hereby agree to the following amendments to the
Compensation Agreement::

            1.    Section 4.B. of the Compensation Agreement is hereby amended
to read in its entirety as follows:

                  B.    Four Thousand (4,000) shares of MCC common stock per
month shall accrue for the benefit of Pirinate, and shall be earned and
transferred to Pirinate at the effective time of the proposed merger transaction
between MCC and Polar Molecular Corporation (the "Effective Time"), which stock
shall be registered, and freely tradable without restriction, at the Effective
Time; and

            2.    Section 4.C. of the Compensation Agreement is hereby deleted
in its entirety.

       All remaining provisions of the Compensation Agreement remain unchanged
and in full force and effect.
