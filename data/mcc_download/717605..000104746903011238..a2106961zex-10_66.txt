one or more instruments satisfactory in form to the Intercreditor Agent and

any of the Foreign Subsidiary Equity Secured Parties if such Act purports to be
taken by or on behalf of any of the Foreign Subsidiary Equity Secured Parties,
as applicable (including any cable, telegram, telecopy or telex). Nothing in
this Section 3.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to require
the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee to demonstrate that it has been
authorized by the Foreign Subsidiary Equity Secured Parties to take any action
which it purports to be taking, the

                                        5
<Page>

Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee being entitled to rely conclusively,
and being fully protected in so relying, on any Act of the Foreign Subsidiary
Equity Secured Parties. Further, the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee
shall be entitled to absolutely rely upon any judicial order or judgment, any
advice or statements of legal counsel, independent consultants and other experts
selected by it in good faith and without gross negligence or willful misconduct
or upon any certification, instruction, notice or other writing delivered to it
in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 3.3
or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to require the Intercreditor
Agent and Security Trustee to demonstrate that it has been authorized by same to
take any action which it purports to be taking, the Intercreditor Agent and
Security Trustee being entitled to rely conclusively, and being fully protected
in so relying, on such judicial order or judgment, or advice or statements of
such legal counsel, independent consultants or other experts selected by it in
good faith and without gross negligence or willful misconduct or upon any
certification, instruction, notice or other writing delivered to it in
compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.

     Section 3.4   EVENTS OF DEFAULT; DOCUMENTS AND COMMUNICATIONS.

          (a)      The Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee shall not be
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of
Default unless (i) the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee has received
notice from an Agent or a Obligor referring to this Agreement, describing such
Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of
Default", or (ii) the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee otherwise has
actual knowledge of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default.

          (b)      Each Agent will be bound by the notice provisions of
Section 13.04 of the Indenture. In addition, in the event of an enforcement
action, if the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee receives notice from an
Agent or a Obligor of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, the
Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee shall give prompt written notice
thereof to each of the other Agents and the Company (unless such notice is
delivered by the Company). If the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee
otherwise obtains actual knowledge of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of
Default in the event of an enforcement action, the Intercreditor Agent and
Security Trustee shall provide written notice thereof to each of the Agents. The
Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee shall also promptly forward to the
Joint Collateral Agent and each other Credit Facility Agent a copy of each
document, notice, certificate, instruction or other communication received by
the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee from any Obligor or any other party
hereto.

          (c)      Any Agent shall have the right to direct the Intercreditor
Agent and Security Trustee to commence foreclosure actions or otherwise exercise
remedies available to it with respect to the Foreign Subsidiary Equity
Collateral if an Event of Default shall have occurred and is then continuing
with respect to such Agent's Credit Document (such direction a "FORECLOSURE
DIRECTION"). With respect to the Note Obligations and the Parity Lien
Obligations this right may be exercised by either the Joint Collateral Agent,
the Trustee or any Parity Lien Representative. The Intercreditor Agent and
Security Trustee shall give each Agent and the Company prompt written notice of
the receipt of any Foreclosure Direction. The Intercreditor Agent and Security
Trustee will take such action with respect to the Foreign Subsidiary Equity
Collateral as directed by a vote of a majority of the holders (all voting as a
single class) of (i) the

                                        6
<Page>

principal amount of all Indebtedness constituting Credit Facility Obligations,
Notes and Parity Lien Debt outstanding (the "MAJORITY HOLDERS"). Such Majority
Holders may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
any right or remedy available to the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee,
or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Intercreditor Agent and
Security Trustee, or for the appointment of a receiver, or to direct the taking
or refraining from taking any action authorized by this Agreement or any Foreign
Security Document; provided that such direction shall not conflict with any
provision of law or this Agreement. The Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee
shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the
Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines
that the directed action is not permitted by the terms of this Agreement, the
Foreign Security Documents or the Credit Documents, may not lawfully be taken or
would involve it in personal liability, and the Intercreditor Agent and Security
Trustee shall not be required to take any such action unless any indemnity which
is required hereunder in respect of such action has been provided. The
Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee may rely on any such direction given to
it by the Majority Holders and shall be fully protected, and shall under no
circumstances (absent the gross negligence and willful misconduct of the
Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee ) be liable to any holder of any
Secured Obligations or any other Person for taking or refraining from taking
action in accordance therewith. Absent written instructions from the Majority
Holders (i) at a time when a direction or notice from any Agent contemplated by
this Section 3.4 shall be outstanding or (ii) in the case of an emergency in
order to protect any of the Foreign Subsidiary Equity Collateral, the
Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee may take, but shall have no obligation
to take, any and all such actions under the Foreign Security Documents or any of
them or otherwise as it shall deem to be in the best interests of the Foreign
Subsidiary Equity Secured Parties and shall give notice to each of the other
Agents of any such actions taken.

          (d)      Subject to Article 13 of the Indenture, any Agent may
independently foreclose on or otherwise exercise its rights and remedies with
respect to any Pledged Instrument and the Intercreditor Agent and Security
Trustee shall cooperate with any such foreclosure or exercise of remedies.

     Section 3.5   ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLATERAL. Each of the Foreign
Subsidiary Equity Secured Parties hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints
the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee and any officer or agent thereof,
with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with
full power and authority in its or his own name, from time to time in the
Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee's discretion, subject to Section 3.4(c)
hereof, so long as any direction or notice contemplated by Section 3.4(c) hereof
is in effect, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all
documents and instruments which may be necessary or desirable to carry out the
terms of this Agreement and the Foreign Security Documents and accomplish the
purposes hereof and thereof and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of the Foreign Subsidiary Equity Secured Parties hereby
acknowledges that the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee shall have all
powers and remedies set forth in the Foreign Security Documents, subject to
Section 3.4(c) hereof.

     Section 3.6   RESIGNATION OR REMOVAL OF INTERCREDITOR AGENT AND SECURITY
TRUSTEE. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Intercreditor
Agent and Security Trustee as provided below, (i) the Intercreditor Agent and
Security Trustee may resign at any

                                        7
<Page>

time by giving not less than thirty (30) days notice thereof to the Joint
Collateral Agent, the Company and each other Credit Facility Agent, (ii) if no
Indebtedness with respect to Credit Facility Obligations remains outstanding,
the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee may be removed at any time with or
without cause by the Joint Collateral Agent or (iii) the Intercreditor Agent and
Security Trustee may assign its role as such to any other financial institution
that becomes the Administrative Agent under the Existing Credit Facility;
provided, however, that such successor agent expressly agrees to be bound by the
provisions hereof in a writing delivered to the Joint Collateral Agent, the
Company and each other Credit Facility Agent. Upon any such resignation or
removal referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence, the Joint
Collateral Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor Intercreditor Agent
and Security Trustee, which Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee shall be
reasonably acceptable to any other Credit Facility Agents. If no successor
Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee shall have been so appointed by the
Joint Collateral Agent and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty
(30) days after the retiring Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee's giving
of notice of resignation or such removal of the retiring Intercreditor Agent and
Security Trustee as provided hereunder, then the retiring Intercreditor Agent
and Security Trustee may, on behalf of the Secured Parties, petition a court of
competent jurisdiction for a successor or it may appoint a successor
Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee, which shall be a bank or trust company
(a) acceptable to the other Agents, (b) having a combined capital and surplus of
at least $100,000,000 and (c) having offices in New York, New York. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee
hereunder by a successor Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee, (i) such
successor Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee, and the retiring
Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder, and (ii) the retiring Intercreditor Agent and Security
Trustee shall, at the expense of the Company, promptly transfer all Foreign
Subsidiary Equity Collateral and any Pledged Instrument within its possession or
control to the possession or control of the successor Intercreditor Agent and
Security Trustee and shall execute and deliver such notices, instructions and
assignments as may be necessary or desirable to transfer the rights of the
Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee in respect of the Foreign Subsidiary
Equity Collateral and any Pledged Instrument to the successor Intercreditor
Agent and Security Trustee. After any retiring Intercreditor Agent and Security
Trustee's resignation, removal or replacement hereunder as Intercreditor Agent
and Security Trustee, the provisions of this ARTICLE 3 shall continue in effect
for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was acting as Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the former Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee
shall, at the expense of the Company, take all steps necessary to assign the
Foreign Subsidiary Equity Collateral and any Pledged Instrument to the successor
Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee.

     Section 3.7   AUTHORIZATION; RELEASE OF LIENS; AMENDMENT.

          (a)      The Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee is hereby
authorized by each of the other parties hereto to execute, deliver and perform
each of the Foreign Security Documents.

          (b)      Without the prior written consent of, or direction from, the
Joint Collateral Agent and each Credit Facility Agent and any consent required
under Section 13.09 of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agent and Security
Trustee shall not (i) release any Foreign Subsidiary Equity Collateral or
otherwise terminate any Lien under any Foreign Security Document, provided,
however, that the Joint Collateral Agent and the Credit Facility Agent shall be
obligated to notify the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee to deliver to
the Company (or as otherwise directed by the Company) any Collateral (including,
without limitation, any Foreign Subsidiary Equity Collateral and any Pledged
Instrument) that is automatically released in accordance with the terms of the
Credit Documents, (ii) consent to any amendment, modification or supplement of
this Agreement or any Foreign Security Document (other than as necessary to
reflect the addition of any new Qualified Credit Facility or Parity Lien Debt
for which the related Credit Facility Agent or the relevant Parity Lien
Representative, respectively, shall have executed and delivered a Joinder
Agreement), (iii) consent to any Lien under any Foreign Security Document to
which the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee (in its capacity as such) is
a party securing obligations other than the Secured Obligations or consent to
any modification of, supplement to, or waiver under any of the Foreign Security
Documents to which the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee (in its capacity
as such) is a party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if directed by the Joint
Collateral Agent, the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee shall amend the
Foreign Security Documents and/or take such other action as may be necessary to
relinquish the security interest with respect to any Note Obligations or Parity
Lien Obligations specified by the Joint Collateral Agent as being no longer
secured by the Foreign Subsidiary Equity Collateral and (ii) if directed by any
Credit Facility Agent the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee shall amend
the Foreign Security Documents and/or take such other action as may be necessary
to relinquish the security interest with respect to any Credit Facility
Obligations represented by such Credit Facility Agent specified by such Credit
Facility Agent as being no longer secured by the Foreign Subsidiary Equity
Collateral. Except for any release authorized by both the Joint Collateral Agent
and each Credit Facility Agent, no such release shall affect the security
interest of any other Foreign Subsidiary Equity Secured Party. In giving any
such consent, the Joint Collateral Agent shall be subject to the terms of the
Collateral Agency Agreement and the Indenture and each Credit Facility Agent
shall be subject to the terms of the Credit Documents to which it is a party.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, whether or not so instructed by the Joint
Collateral Agent and each Credit Facility Agent, the Intercreditor Agent and
Security Trustee may release the security interest with respect to any Foreign
Subsidiary Equity Collateral and may provide any release, termination statement
or instrument of subordination required by order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or otherwise required by applicable law.

          (c)      For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this SECTION 3.7, or
elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Foreign Security Document shall
limit the obligations of the Obligors under any Foreign Security Document or any
Credit Document, including, without limitation, any obligation of any of the
Obligors to obtain any consent or approval of any of the Foreign Subsidiary
Equity Secured Parties obtained or required to be obtained by the Obligor prior
to any amendment or modification of, supplement to or waiver under any Foreign
Security Document or Credit Document.

          (d)      For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this SECTION 3.5 or
elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Foreign Security Document or Credit
Document shall limit the

                                        9
<Page>

operation of the collateral release provisions under any Credit Document,
pursuant to which the lien and security interest thereunder with respect to an
item of collateral (including, without limitation, the Foreign Subsidiary Equity
Collateral and any Pledged Instrument) shall be released without the consent of
any Foreign Subsidiary Equity Secured Party or the Intercreditor Agent and
Security Trustee to the extent and subject to the conditions, if any, specified
in any Credit Document.

     Section 3.8   LIMITATIONS ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF INTERCREDITOR AGENT AND
SECURITY TRUSTEE. The Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee shall not be
responsible in any manner whatsoever for the correctness of any recitals,
statements, representations or warranties contained herein or in any Foreign
Security Document, except for those made by it herein. The Intercreditor Agent
and Security Trustee makes no representation as to the value or condition of the
Foreign Subsidiary Equity Collateral or any part thereof, or any Pledged
Instrument, as to the title of the Company to the Foreign Subsidiary Equity
Collateral, as to the security afforded by this Agreement or any Foreign
Security Document or, as to the validity, execution, enforceability, legality or
sufficiency of this Agreement or any Foreign Security Document, and the
Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee shall incur no liability or
responsibility in respect of any such matters. The Intercreditor Agent and
Security Trustee shall not be responsible for insuring the Foreign Subsidiary
Equity Collateral or any Pledged Instrument except as provided in the
immediately following sentence when the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee
has possession of such Foreign Subsidiary Collateral. The Intercreditor Agent
and Security Trustee shall have no duty to the Company or to the Foreign
Subsidiary Equity Secured Parties as to any such Foreign Subsidiary Collateral
in its possession or control or in the possession or control of any agent or
nominee of the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee or any income thereon or
as to the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other rights
pertaining thereto, except the duty to accord such of the Foreign Subsidiary
Equity Collateral and any such Pledged Instruments as may be in its possession
substantially the same care as it accords its own assets and the duty to account
for monies received by it. The Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee shall
not be required to ascertain or inquire as to the performance by the Company of
any of the covenants or agreements contained herein or any of the Credit
Documents. Neither the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee nor any officer,
agent or representative thereof shall be personally liable for any action taken
or omitted to be taken by any such person in connection with this Agreement or
any Foreign Security Document except for such person's own gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Neither the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee nor any
officer, agent or representative thereof shall be personally liable for any
action taken by any such person in accordance with any notice given pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement. The Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee may
execute any of the powers granted under this Agreement or any of the Security
Documents and perform any duty hereunder or thereunder either directly or by or
through agents or attorneys-in-fact, and shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it in

out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorney's and other professionals'
fees and disbursements and compensation of agents) incurred by the

                                       10
<Page>

Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee, arising out of, in any way connected
with, or as a result of, the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any
Foreign Security Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or
thereby or the performance by the parties hereto or thereto of their respective
obligations hereunder or thereunder or in connection with the enforcement or
protection of the rights of the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee and/or
the Foreign Subsidiary Equity Secured Parties hereunder or under the Foreign
Security Documents, (ii) to indemnify and hold harmless the Intercreditor Agent
and Security Trustee and its directors, officers, employees and agents, on
demand, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee in its capacity as the
Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee or any of them in any way relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or any Foreign Security Document or any action
taken or omitted by them under this Agreement or any Foreign Security Document,
provided that the Company shall not be liable to the Intercreditor Agent and
Security Trustee or its directors, officers, employees and agents for any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee
or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents as determined by a final
non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction; and (iii) to
indemnify and hold harmless the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee, on
demand, from and against any and all liabilities which may be imposed on or
incurred by any of the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee (in its capacity
as Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee) for the net amount of taxes (after
taking into account any deduction, credit or other tax reduction or benefit
available by reason of the imposition of any such tax) imposed with respect to
the Foreign Subsidiary Equity Collateral or any Pledged Instrument in any
jurisdiction in which the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee would not
otherwise be subject to tax except by reason of its acting under this Agreement
or the Foreign Security Documents (directly or through agents); provided that
such indemnification for taxes (A) shall apply only in respect of taxes
attributable to the performance of the Intercreditor Agent and Security
Trustee's obligations hereunder imposed with respect to the Foreign Subsidiary
Equity Collateral or any Pledged Instrument and (B) shall in no event cover any
federal, state, local or other taxes imposed upon any of the Intercreditor Agent
and Security Trustee with respect to or measured by its gross or net income or
profits. A statement by the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee that is
submitted to the Company with respect to the amount of such expenses and
containing a reasonable description thereof and/or the amount of its
indemnification obligation shall be prima facie evidence of the amount thereof
owing to the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee.

     Section 3.10  INTERCREDITOR AGENT AND SECURITY TRUSTEE AS A FOREIGN
SUBSIDIARY EQUITY SECURED PARTY. In its individual capacity and in its capacity
as an Agent, Fleet Capital Corporation shall have the same obligations and the
same rights, powers and privileges as it would have had were it not also the
Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee.

     Section 3.11  EXPENSES AND INDEMNIFICATION BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY EQUITY
SECURED PARTIES. Each of the Foreign Subsidiary Equity Secured Parties agree (i)
to reimburse the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee, on demand, in the

officers, employees and agents, on demand, in the amount of its pro rata share,

to in Section 3.9, to the extent the same shall not have been reimbursed by the
Company or paid from the proceeds of Foreign Subsidiary Equity Collateral as
provided herein; provided that no Foreign Subsidiary Equity Secured Party shall
be liable to the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee for any portion of
such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Intercreditor Agent and Security Trustee or any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents as determined by a final non-appealable
order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
obligation of the Foreign Subsidiary Equity Secured Parties under this Section
3.11 shall be limited to the any collateral securing any Secured Obligations and
in no event will any Foreign Subsidiary Equity Secured Party be personally
liable for any amounts owing under this Section 3.11.
