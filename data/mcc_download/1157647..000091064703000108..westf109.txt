                                     OF
                          WESTFIELD FINANCIAL, INC.

            Compensation for any Plan Year include any compensation in
            excess of $170,000 (in Plan Years beginning before January 1,

            regulations prescribed under section 401(a)(17) of the Code. If
            there are less than twelve (12) months in the Plan Year, the
            limitations (as adjusted) shall be prorated by multiplying such
            limitation by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
            of months in the Plan Year and the denominator of which is
            twelve (12).

            in an Annual Addition of an amount exceeding:

            (i)   for Limitation Years beginning before January 1, 2002,
                  the lesser of (A) $30,000 (or such other amount as is
                  permissible under section 415(c)(1)(A) of the Code), or
                  (ii)(B) twenty-five percent (25%) of the Participant's
                  Total Compensation paid during such Limitation Year; and

            (ii)  for Limitation Years beginning after December 31, 2001,
                  the lesser of (A) $40,000 (or such other amount as is
                  permissible under section 415(c)(1)(A) of the Code), or
                  (B) one hundred percent (100%) of the Participant's Total
                  Compensation paid during such Limitation Year.

      defined contribution plan or simplified employee pension (other than
      this Plan) maintained by the Employer, as well as the Participant's
      allocable share, if any, of any forfeitures under such plans as well
      as all amounts allocated to an individual medical benefit account, as
      defined in section 415(l)(2) of the Code, which is part of a pension
      or annuity plan maintained by the Employer; plus

7.    Section 8.2 - Subparagraph 8.2(c)(i) of the Plan shall be amended,
      effective as of January 1, 2002, to include a new sentence at the end
      thereof which shall read in its entirety as follows:

      In Limitation Years beginning after December 31, 2001, catch-up
      elective deferrals under section 414(v) of the Code shall not be
      included as Annual Additions.

8.    Section 9.3 - Section 9.3 shall be amended, effective as of January
      1, 2002, to read in its entirety as follows:

                  Upon the termination of employment of a Participant or
            Former Participant for any reason other than death or
            Disability, that portion of the balance credited to his Account
            which is not vested at the date of such termination shall be
            forfeited upon the earliest of (a) full distribution of the
            vested portion of the Account or (b) the fifth anniversary
            following the date of re-employment. The proceeds of such
            forfeited amounts, reduced by any amounts required to be
            credited because of re-employment pursuant to section 9.4,
            shall be treated as Forfeitures and shall be disposed of as
            provided in section 9.5. If no portion of the balance credited
            to an Account of a Participant or Former Participant is vested
            as of the date of his termination of employment, a distribution
            of $0, representing full distribution of the Account, shall be
            deemed to have been made to the Participant or Former
            Participant on such date.

9.    Section 9.4 - Section 9.4 shall be amended, effective as of January
      1, 2002, to read in its entirety as follows:


<PAGE>  2


                  If an Employee forfeited any amount of the balance
            credited to his Account upon his termination of employment, and
            is re-employed by any Affiliated Employer prior to the
            occurrence of five consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service,
            then:

                        (i)   an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of
                  the Shares forfeited, determined as of the date of
                  forfeiture; and

                        (ii)  the amount credited to his General Investment
                  Account that was forfeited, determined as of the date of
                  forfeiture;

            shall be credited back to his Account; provided, however, that
            the Employee repays the amount distributed to him from his
            Account as a result of such termination no later than the fifth
            anniversary of his re-employment or the end of the fifth Plan
            Year to begin after such distribution, whichever is earlier.
            Such amounts to be re-credited shall be obtained from the
            proceeds of the forfeited amounts redeemed pursuant to section
            9.3 during the Plan Year in which the repayment is made, unless
            such proceeds are insufficient, in which case the Employee's
            Employer shall make an additional contribution in the amount of
            such deficiency. For purposes of this section 9.4, a
            Participant or Former Participant who received a distribution
            of $0, shall be deemed to have made repayment on the date of
            re-employment with an Employer.

10.   Section 12.2 - Subsection 12.2(b) of the Plan shall be amended,
      effective as of January 1, 2002, to read in its entirety as follows:

                  (b)   Dividends paid with respect to Shares allocated to
            a person's Share Investment Account shall be credited to such
            person's Share Investment Account. Cash dividends credited to a
            person's General Investment Account shall be, at the direction
            of the Committee, either: (i) held in such General Investment
            Account and invested in accordance with sections 10.2 and 11.3;
            (ii) distributed immediately to such person; (iii) distributed
            to such person within 90 days of the close of the Plan Year in
            which such dividends were paid; (iv) used to make payments of
            principal or interest on a Share Acquisition Loan; provided,
            however, that the Fair Market Value of Financed Shares released
            from the Loan Repayment Account as a result of such payment
            equals or exceeds the amount of the dividend; or (v) in
            calendar years beginning after December 31, 2001 either held as
            provided in section 12.2(b)(i) or distributed as provided in
            section 12.2(b)(ii), as each person shall elect for his own
            Account.

11.   Section 13.3 - Section 13.3(a) shall be amended, effective as of
      January 1, 2002, by adding a new sentence at the end thereof to read
      as follows:

            If an Account of a Participant or Former Participant does not
            contain any vested amounts as of the date of his termination of
            employment with all Affiliated Employers, a distribution of $0,
            representing full distribution of the Account, shall be deemed
            to have been made to the Participant or Former Participant on
            such date.

12.   Section 13.6 - Subsections 13.6(c)(iii) and (iv) of the Plan shall be
      amended, effective as of January 1, 2002, to read in their entirety
      as follows:

                  (iii) "Eligible Retirement Plan" means an individual
            retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Code, an
            individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of
            the Code, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the
            Code, or a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the
            Code, and (for distributions after December 31, 2001 only) an
            annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code or an
            eligible deferred compensation plan under section 457(b) of the
            Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a
            state, or an agency or instrumentality of a state or political
            subdivision thereof and which agrees to separately account for
            amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan, that accepts
            the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in
            the case of an eligible rollover distribution made before
            January 1, 2002 to a current or former spouse who is the
            alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order as
            defined in Code section 414(p) or to a surviving spouse, an
            eligible retirement plan is only an individual retirement
            account or individual retirement annuity.

                  (iv)  "Eligible Rollover Distribution" means any
            distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit
            of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover
            distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of
            a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less
            frequently than annually) made for the life (or life
            expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint
            life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's
            designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10)
            years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution
            is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; any
            distribution made after December 31, 1999 on account of
            hardship; and in the case of a distribution made before January
            1, 2002, the portion of any distribution that is not includible
            in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for
            net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer
            securities). A portion of a distribution that is includible in
            the gross income of the distributee that is treated as an
            eligible rollover distribution may only be transferred in a
            direct rollover to an eligible retirement plan that agrees to
            separately account for such portion of the distribution. This
            section 13.6 shall not apply to any eligible rollover
            distributions during a year that are reasonably expected (as
            determined by the Committee) to total less than $200. In no
            event shall any withdrawal during service that is made on
            account of hardship be considered an "eligible rollover
            distribution". This section 13.6 shall be interpreted to comply
            with the provisions of section 401(a)(31) of the Code.

13.   Section 17.2 - Section 17.2 of the Plan shall be amended, effective
      as of January 1, 2002, to read in its entirety as follows:

            Section 17.2  Definition of Top Heavy Plan.

            (a)   Subject to section 17.2(c), the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan
      if, as of a Determination Date: (i) it is not a member of a Required
      Aggregation Group, and (ii)(A) the sum of the Cumulative Accrued
      Benefits of all Key Employees exceeds 60% of (B) the sum of the
      Cumulative Accrued Benefits of all Employees (excluding former Key
      Employees), former Employees (excluding former Key Employees and
      other former Employees who have not performed any services for the
      Company or any Affiliated Employer during the immediately preceding 5
      Plan Years if the

      Determination Date is after December 31, 2001) and their
      Beneficiaries.

            (b)   Subject to section 17.2(c), the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan
      if, as of a Determination Date: (i) the Plan is a member of a
      Required Aggregation Group, and (ii)(A) the sum of the Cumulative
      Accrued Benefits of all Key Employees under all plans that are
      members of the Required Aggregation Group exceeds 60% of (B) the sum
      of the Cumulative Accrued Benefits of all Employees (excluding former
      Key Employees), former Employees (excluding former Key Employees and
      other former Employees who have not performed any services for the
      Company or any Affiliated Employer during the immediately preceding 5
      Plan Years if the Determination is before January 1, 2002 and one
      Plan Year if the Determination Date is after December 31, 2001), and
      their Beneficiaries under all plans that are members of the Required
      Aggregation Group.

            (c)   Notwithstanding sections 17.2(a) and 17.2(b), the Plan is
      not a Top Heavy Plan if, as of a Determination Date: (i) the Plan is
      a member of a Permissible Aggregation Group, and (ii)(A) the sum of
      the Cumulative Accrued Benefits of all Key Employees under all plans
      that are members of the Permissible Aggregation Group does not exceed
      60% of (B) the sum of the Cumulative Accrued Benefits of all
      Employees (excluding former Key Employees), former Employees
      (excluding former Key Employees and other former Employees who have
      not performed any services for the Company or any Affiliated Employer
      during the immediately preceding 5 Plan Years if the Determination
      Date is before January 1, 2002 and one Plan Year if the Determination
      Date is after December 31, 2001), and their Beneficiaries under all
      plans that are members of the Permissible Aggregation Group.

      Cumulative Accrued Benefits under the Plan (including, for Plan Years
      beginning after December 31, 2001, distributions under terminated
      plans that would have been included in the Required Aggregation Group
      if not terminated) during the 5-year period (for all distributions
      for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2002 and for in-service
      distributions for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2001) or 1-
      year period (for all distributions other than in-service
      distributions for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2001)
      ending on the Determination Date.

15.   Section 17.5 - Subsection 17.5(a)(iv) shall be amended, effective as
      of January 1, 2002, by adding the words "in plan years beginning
      before January 1, 2002" at the beginning thereof.

1.    Article I - Section 1.11 of the Plan shall be amended, effective as of

                  Section 1.11  Designated Beneficiary means a natural person
            designated by a Participant or Former Participant as a Beneficiary
            under section 13.2 and shall not include any Beneficiary designated
            by a person other than a Participant or Former Participant or any
            Beneficiary other than a natural person. If a natural person is the
            beneficiary of a trust which a Participant or Former Participant
            has named as his Beneficiary, such natural person shall be treated
            as a Designated Beneficiary if: (a) the trust is a valid trust
            under applicable state law (or would be a valid trust except for
            the fact that it does not have a corpus); (b) the trust is
            irrevocable or will, by its terms, become irrevocable upon the
            death of the Participant or Former Participant; (c) the
            beneficiaries of the trust who are beneficiaries with respect to
            the trust's interest as a Beneficiary are identifiable from the
