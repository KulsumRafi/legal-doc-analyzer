            favor of Seller,  which Share  Transfer and Pledge  Agreement  shall

            Seller and SL Industries jointly and severally represent and warrant
to the Purchaser,  DCX-Chol, Chol Enterprises and their respective Affiliates as
follows:

            3.1. Corporate Organization, Etc. Each of Seller, SL Industries, EME
and Paks is a corporation or partnership  duly organized,  validly existing and,
to the extent  applicable under the laws of the relevant  jurisdiction,  in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization

                                       10

<PAGE>



and has all requisite  corporate or  partnership  power and authority to conduct
its  business  as it is now being  conducted  and to own,  lease and operate its
property and assets.  Each of Seller and SL  Industries is qualified or licensed
to do  business  as a  foreign  corporation  and is in  good  standing  in  each
jurisdiction  in which  ownership  of property  or the  conduct of its  business
requires  such  qualification  or  license,  except  where the  failure to be so
qualified or licensed will not have a Material Adverse Effect. True and complete
copies of the organizational and governing documents of each of EME and Paks, as
presently in effect, have been heretofore delivered to the Purchaser.

            3.2.  Capitalization;  Affiliate  Transactions.  (a) Seller owns one
hundred  percent  (100%) of the Capital  Stock of EME and EME owns 96.67% of the
Voting Rights of Paks. The Purchased  Shares are subject to no  restrictions  on
transferability  or any other Liens other than  restrictions  imposed by (i) the
Securities  Act, (ii) applicable  state  securities  laws, and (iii)  applicable
German  securities  laws, none of which  restrictions  prohibit the transactions
contemplated in the Transaction Documents. Except for this Agreement, and except
as set  forth  in  Section  3.2(a)  of the  Disclosure  Schedule,  there  are no
outstanding  options or other rights to acquire,  directly or  indirectly,  from
Seller, SL Industries or any EME Entity, or any plans,  Contracts or commitments
providing  for the  issuance  of,  or the  granting  of  rights  by  Seller,  SL
Industries  and/or any EME Entity to acquire,  directly or  indirectly:  (i) any
interest in the capital,  profits,  losses, assets or liabilities of EME or Paks
or (ii) any securities  convertible into or exchangeable for any interest in the
capital,  profits,  losses,  assets  or  liabilities  of EME or Paks.  Except as
described  in  Schedule  3.2(a)  of  the  Disclosure  Schedule,   there  are  no
outstanding  agreements or understandings with respect to the voting, holding or
selling of any interest in the capital,  profits,  losses, assets or liabilities
or Capital Stock of EME or Paks.

            (b)  Except  as set  forth  in  Schedule  3.2(b)  of the  Disclosure
Schedule there are no and have not been any (i) advances or loans by Seller,  SL
Industries or any of their respective  Affiliates to or on behalf of or from EME
or Paks or (ii) other Contracts between EME or Paks and Seller, SL Industries or
any EME Entity (clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, "Affiliate Agreements"). All
Affiliate Agreements have been performed in accordance with their terms. None of
the Affiliate Agreements have resulted in or given rise to, nor will they result
in or give  rise,  any Taxes  that have not been paid in full or  accrued on the
Interim  Financial  Statements.  None of the Affiliate  Agreements shall survive
after the Closing.

            3.3. Capitalization and Ownership Structure of Seller, EME and Paks.

            (a)  Seller.  The  authorized  capital  of Seller  in the  aggregate
nominal amount of DM 50,000 consists  exclusively of two shares as follows:  one
share in the nominal  amount of DM 49,500 and one share in the nominal amount of
DM 500, all of which are issued and  outstanding.  KGH owns all such outstanding
capital stock of Seller.

            (b) EME.  The  authorized  capital of EME in the  aggregate  nominal
amount of DM 3,000,000 consists exclusively of four shares as follows: one share

            (c) Paks.  The  authorized  capital of Paks consists  exclusively of

are issued and  outstanding.  EME owns 2,208  Voting  Rights of Paks,  and Peter
Starke owns 92 Voting Rights of Paks.

            All of the issued and  outstanding  Capital Stock of each of EME and
Paks are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable,  and are
owned directly by Seller,  free and clear of all Liens and any preemptive rights
in respect  thereto,  other than with respect to 92 Voting  Rights of Paks which
are owned by Peter Starke.  True and complete copies of the  organizational  and
governing  documents  of each of  Seller,  EME and  Paks  have  been  heretofore
delivered to the Purchaser.

            3.4. Authority Relative to the Transaction Documents. Each of Seller
and SL Industries has all requisite corporate authority and power to execute and
deliver  this  Agreement  and the other  Transaction  Documents to which it is a
party and to consummate the transactions  contemplated  hereby and thereby.  The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and
the consummation of the transactions  contemplated  hereby and thereby have been
duly  and  validly  authorized  by  all  required   corporate,   shareholder  or
partnership  action on the part of Seller, SL Industries and each EME Entity and
no  other  corporate,  shareholder  or  partnership  proceedings  on the part of
Seller,  SL  Industries  or any EME  Entity  are  necessary  to  authorize  this
Agreement or the other  Transaction  Documents or to consummate the transactions
contemplated  hereby or thereby.  The Transaction  Documents to which they are a
party have been duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller, SL Industries
and each EME Entity, respectively,  as applicable, and, assuming the Transaction
Documents  have been duly  authorized,  executed and delivered by the Purchaser,
DCX-Chol and/or Chol Enterprises,  as applicable,  the Transaction  Documents to
which they are a party constitute the valid and binding  agreement of Seller, SL
Industries and each EME Entity,  enforceable  against Seller,  SL Industries and
such EME Entity in accordance with their terms,  except as limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,  moratorium or other similar laws now or
hereafter  in effect  relating  to or  affecting  creditors'  rights  generally,
including  the  effect  of  statutory  and  other  laws   regarding   fraudulent
conveyances and preferential transfers and subject to the limitations imposed by
general  equitable   principles   (regardless  whether  such  enforceability  is
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

            3.5.  Consents and Approvals;  No Violations.  Neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents by Seller, SL
Industries  and  the  respective  EME  Entities,  nor  the  consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated  hereby and thereby will (a) violate any provision of
the  organizational  or governing  documents of Seller, SL Industries or any EME
Entity or any  applicable  Law,  (b)  require  any  consent,  waiver,  approval,
exemption,  registration,  declaration,  license, authorization or permit of, or
filing with or notification to, any federal, state, local or foreign government,
executive  official  thereof,  governmental or regulatory  authority,  agency or
commission,  including courts of competent jurisdiction,  domestic or foreign (a
"Governmental Entity"), (c) require any consent,  waiver,  approval,  exemption,
registration,  declaration,  license, authorization or permit of, or filing with
or notification to, any other Person,  except,  with respect to this clause (d),
for such consents, waivers, approvals, exemptions, registrations,  declarations,
licenses, authorizations,  permits, filings or notifications which are listed in
Section  3.5 of the  Disclosure  Schedule  (the  "Consents"),  or which,  if not
obtained  or  made,  will  not  allow  for  the  termination,   cancellation  or
acceleration or any obligation to repay under,  any of the terms,  conditions or

                                       12

<PAGE>



provisions  of  any  Contract  or  obligation  that  would  cost  EME  and  Paks
collectively  more than Twenty Thousand  Dollars  ($20,000) for each instance or
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in the aggregate for all instances,  (e)
result in the imposition of any Lien, (f) result in a violation or breach of, or
constitute  (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give
rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration or any obligation
to repay) under,  any of the terms,  conditions or provisions of any Contract or
obligation to which Seller,  SL  Industries,  EME or Paks is a party or by which
Seller,  SL  Industries,  EME or Paks or any of their  respective  properties or
assets may be bound,  which  violation,  breach or default could have a Material
Adverse Effect, or (g) violate any order, writ,  judgment,  injunction,  decree,
statute,  ordinance, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to
Seller,  SL  Industries,  EME  or  Paks  or by  which  any of  their  respective
properties or assets may be bound which violation could have a Material  Adverse
Effect.

            3.6.  Financial  Statements.   The  Purchaser,   DCX-Chol  and  Chol
Enterprises  have  previously been furnished with (i) the audited balance sheets
of EME and the related  audited  statements of earnings,  retained  earnings and
cash flows of EME  (including  any  related  notes)  for the  fiscal  year ended
December 31, 1999 (EME did not own Paks in 1999), and the audited balance sheets
of EME (which includes Paks as an investment) and the related audited statements
of earnings,  retained earnings and cash flows of EME (which includes Paks as an
investment) (including any related notes) for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2000 and December 31, 2001 (in English), together with the report thereon of the
independent   public   accountant  of  EME  and  Paks  (the  "Annual   Financial
Statements")  and (ii) the unaudited  balance sheets of EME (which includes Paks
as an  investment)  and  related  unaudited  statements  of  earnings,  retained
earnings and cash flows of EME (which includes Paks as an investment) (including
any related  notes) for the  eleven-month  period ending  November 30, 2002 (the
"Interim  Financial  Statements"),   and  together  with  the  Annual  Financial
Statements, the "Financial Statements").  Each of the balance sheets included in
the  Financial  Statements,  in  all  material  respects,  fairly  presents  the
financial  position  of EME  (for  1999)  and  EME  (which  includes  Paks as an
investment) (for 2000 and 2001) as of its date, and the other related statements
included in the Financial Statements,  in all material respects,  fairly present
the  results of  operations  and changes in the  financial  position of EME (for
1999) and EME (which includes Paks as an investment) (for 2000 and 2001) for the
periods presented therein, all in conformity with Law and with the principles of
sound  accounting  and  generally  accepted  accounting  practice in the Federal
Republic of Germany (the "German Accounting Standards") in respect of the Annual
Financial  Statements  and in  conformity  with GAAP in respect  of the  Interim
Financial  Statements,  except for the absence of footnotes and normal  year-end
adjustments  with  respect  to  the  Interim  Financial  Statements.  Except  as
explicitly set forth on the balance sheets in the Financial Statements,  neither
EME nor Paks has any  liability or obligation  of any nature  (whether  accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) which would be required to be reflected on an
audited  balance  sheet  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  German  Accounting
Standards in respect of the Annual  Financial  Statements and in accordance with
GAAP in respect of the Interim Financial Statements.  Each of Seller, KGH and SL
Delaware have no  operations,  have no assets other than  interests in other EME
Entities, and have no liabilities other than in connection with the ownership of
such EME Entities and maintaining their organizational  status and preparing Tax
Returns and other filings required to Governmental Entities.

                                       13

<PAGE>



            3.7. Absence of Certain Changes.  Except as set forth in Section 3.7
of the Disclosure Schedule,  since November 30, 2002, (a) there has not been any
change in the business, operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or
otherwise)  or  operations  of EME or Paks,  except such changes  which,  in the
aggregate, do not and will not have a Material Adverse Effect, (b) there has not
been any event or circumstance  which could have a Material Adverse Effect,  (c)
there has not been any actual,  threatened,  anticipated or contemplated damage,
destruction,   loss   (whether  or  not  covered  by   insurance),   conversion,
termination,  cancellation,  default or taking by eminent domain or other action
by any third party or  Governmental  Entity with respect to any EME Entity which
has or may have a Material  Adverse  Effect;  (d) none of the EME  Entities  has
conducted its respective  businesses in any material respect not in the ordinary
and usual course consistent with past practice, and (e) none of the EME Entities
has (i)  incurred any  indebtedness  or issued any debt  securities  or assumed,
guaranteed or endorsed the obligations of any other Person,  (ii) declared,  set
aside for payment or paid any dividend or other  distribution  (whether in cash,
stock,  property or any combination  thereof), or redeemed or otherwise acquired
any shares of capital stock of any Person, (iii) sold,  transferred or otherwise
disposed of, any of its material property or assets or, (iv) created any Lien on
any of its property or assets.

            3.8.  Contracts and Commitments.  Except as set forth in Section 3.8
of the Disclosure Schedule, neither EME nor Paks is in breach or default and, to
Seller's Knowledge, no other party to any of the material Contracts relating to,
binding on or affecting  EME or Paks,  or the assets used in the business of EME
or Paks, is as of the date of this Agreement and will not be at the Closing,  in
breach or default (and no event has  occurred  which with notice or the lapse of
time or both would  constitute a default or violation) under any of the material
Contracts of EME or Paks,  except such defaults  which,  individually  or in the
aggregate,  will not have a Material Adverse Effect. To the Seller's  Knowledge,
there has not been any threatened cancellation of any material Contract relating
to,  binding on or affecting  EME or Paks, or the assets used in the business of
EME or Paks,  or any  outstanding  dispute  under any such  Contract,  or to the
Seller's  Knowledge,  any bases for any  claim or breach or  default  thereunder
other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. The
execution,  delivery  and  performance  by  Seller  and SL  Industries  of  this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the transactions  contemplated
hereby and thereby will not entitle any other party to any material  Contract of
EME or Paks to cancel,  suspend or  terminate  any such  Contract.  To  Seller's
Knowledge,  there is no reason to believe  that any of such  material  Contracts
that are  renewable  solely at the option of the other party thereto will not be
renewed by the other party on reasonable terms.

            3.9.  No  Undisclosed  Liabilities.  Except as and to the extent set
forth in the Financial  Statements or in Section 3.9 of the Disclosure Schedule,
none of the EME Entities has any  liabilities  of any nature  (whether  accrued,
absolute,  matured,  contingent  or  otherwise)  which  would be required by the
German Accounting  Standards in respect of the Annual Financial Statements or by
GAAP in respect of the  Interim  Financial  Statements  to be  reflected  on its
audited  consolidated  balance  sheet  prepared  in  accordance  with the German
Accounting Standards in respect of the Annual Financial Statements or by GAAP in
respect of the Interim Financial Statements,  except such liabilities which were
incurred in the ordinary course of business since November 30, 2002.

of the Disclosure Schedule, neither EME nor Paks is in default or violation (and
no event has  occurred  which  with  notice  or the lapse of time or both  would
constitute a default or  violation)  of any term,  condition or provision of (i)
its  organizational or governing  documents or (ii) any Law applicable to EME or
Paks.  Each  of  EME  and  Paks  has  all  governmental  permits,  licenses  and
authorizations  necessary  for the conduct of their  businesses  in all material
respects as presently  conducted (the  "Permits") and each of EME and Paks is in
material  compliance  with  the  terms  of  the  Permits,   and  no  suspension,
revocation, termination or cancellation of any of such Permits is pending or, to
Seller's Knowledge, threatened.

            3.11.  Litigation;  Product  Liability.  (a)  Except as set forth in
Section  3.11(a) of the Disclosure  Schedule,  as of the date of this Agreement,
there is no action,  suit or  proceeding  pending,  and, to Seller's  Knowledge,
there is no action, suit or proceeding  threatened,  against or affecting EME or
Paks or any  properties  or  rights of EME or Paks,  before  any  arbitrator  or
Governmental  Entity.  As of the  date of this  Agreement,  none of  Seller,  SL
Industries or any EME Entity has received  notice that EME or Paks is subject to
any outstanding injunction, writ, judgment, order or decree of any arbitrator or
Governmental Entity.

               (a)  Except as set forth in  Section  3.11(b)  of the  Disclosure
Schedule,  as of the  date of this  Agreement,  neither  EME nor  Paks  has been
subject to any written claim, suit or proceeding  relating to product liability,
breach of product  warranty,  or similar claims in 2001 or 2002, and to Seller's
Knowledge  neither  EME nor Paks has been  subject  to any oral  claim,  suit or
proceeding relating to product liability, breach of product warranty, or similar
claims in 2001 or 2002. Except as set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule, to Seller's Knowledge, none of the current products of EME or Paks nor
any of the  manufacturing  processes,  designs,  schematics  or procedures of or
relating to any  products of EME or Paks  contains  any defects or  deficiencies
that  could  result in any  product  liability  or  similar  claims in excess of
$50,000 in the aggregate, except as to any such defects of deficiencies to which
the customer has consented in writing.

            3.12.  Taxes.  (a) Each EME Entity  has,  within the time and manner
prescribed by law, (i) filed or placed on extension with the appropriate  taxing
authorities (or joined in the filing of) all Tax Returns required to be filed by
it in  respect  of any Taxes that were or may become due by or in respect of EME
or Paks,  and each such Tax Return was  complete  and  accurate in all  material
respects  and (ii) paid in full or accrued for all Taxes due by or in respect of
EME or Paks  whether or not  reflected  on the Tax  Returns,  including  but not
limited  to,  Taxes  required to be  withheld  by EME or Paks,  excluding  Taxes
currently being disputed in good faith.

               (b) No deficiencies  for any Taxes have been asserted or assessed
in writing  or, to Seller's  Knowledge,  verbally  proposed  against EME or Paks
which remain unpaid.

               (c) Neither the Seller Dividend nor the activities carried out in
connection therewith will give rise to any liability or obligation for Taxes for
EME,  Paks,  the  Purchaser  or  its  Affiliates   nor,  except  for  the  Taxes
specifically referred to as being split by the parties pursuant to Section 9.11,
will the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and the
other  Transaction  Documents give rise to any liability or obligation for Taxes
for EME or Paks, including but not limited to Taxes required to be withheld.

Paks during all Tax periods or portions thereof through the date of such Interim
Financial  Statements,  including,  but not limited to, any Taxes required to be
withheld by EME or Paks.

               (f) Each of Seller,  EME and Paks is  characterized  as a foreign
corporation as described in Section  7701(a)(5) of the Internal  Revenue Code of

transactions  that  economically  accrued in a prior taxable period but on which
neither EME nor Paks was subject to Tax in any prior taxable period.

               (l) There is no agreement or other document  extending the period
of assessment, payment, remittance or collection of any Taxes by or on behalf of
EME or Paks. No power of attorney with respect to any Taxes has been executed or
filed with any  Governmental  Entity,  including  without  limitation the United
States Internal Revenue Service, by or on behalf of EME or Paks.

               (m) Each of EME and Paks has  complied in all  material  respects
with all  applicable  laws,  rules and  regulations  relating to the payment and
withholding  of Taxes in  connection  with amounts paid or owing to an employee,
independent  contractor,  shareholder,  EME Entity or any other party including,
without limitation, withholding of Taxes pursuant to Code Section 1441, or under
any corresponding  provisions of state, local or foreign income tax law and has,
within the time and manner prescribed by law, withheld from and paid over to the

               (o)  Neither  EME  nor  Paks  is a party  to any  joint  venture,
partnership  or  other  arrangement  or  contract  that  could be  treated  as a
partnership for Tax purposes.

Paks, as the case may be, by the lender.  Any loans payable to EME or Paks by SL

the merits and risks of acquiring its portion of the Purchased  Shares  pursuant
to this  Agreement and the other  Transaction  Documents;  and Purchaser has the
financial  ability to bear the  economic  risks of  acquiring  and  holding  the
Purchased  Shares to be acquired by  Purchaser  pursuant to this  Agreement  for
investment.

               (b) Purchaser  understands  that the  Purchased  Shares are being
offered and sold to it in reliance on specific  exemptions from the registration
requirements of United States federal and state  securities laws and that Seller
and SL  Industries  are  relying  in part upon the truth and  accuracy  of,  and
Purchaser's  compliance  with,  the  representations,   warranties,  agreements,
acknowledgments  and  understandings of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement in
order to determine the  availability  of such  exemptions and the eligibility of
Purchaser to acquire the Purchased Shares.

            4.5. German Control of Concentrations. The annual worldwide sales of
Purchaser,  including the worldwide sales of all  undertakings  controlled by or
controlling (whether alone or jointly together with other enterprises) Purchaser
within  the  sense  of  section  17  of  the  German   Stock   Corporation   Act
(Aktiengesetz, or "AktG") as well as the sales of all companies belonging to the
same group as Purchaser  within the sense of section 18 AktG,  together with the
worldwide  sales of EME which,  in the  fiscal  year ended  December  31,  2002,
amounted to approximately 28,600,000 Euros, did not exceed, in the last business
year, the amount of 500,000,000 Euros.

            5.1.  Commercial  Register.  Purchaser hereby agrees that, within 30
days of the Closing  Date,  Purchaser  shall notify the  Commercial  Register in
Ingolstadt, Germany that a share transfer has occurred.

insure that any notification to the Commercial Register required in such context

                                       23

<PAGE>



that, in the event the termination  should not be legally possible as of January
1, 2003 0.00 hrs,  there  shall be no  obligations  to  transfer  any profits or
absorb any  losses,  as the case may be, for the period  from  January 1 and the
point in time when the  termination  of the  Profit and Loss  Agreement  becomes
effective, and to indemnify each other against such transfer or absorption.

            5.3.  Insurance.  Seller and SL Industries will not cancel Insurance
Policies  in the name of and for the  benefit of EME and Paks after the  Closing
Date,  other than Insurance  Policies which are maintained other than at the EME
and/or  Paks  level,  in which EME and Paks  shall no longer  have an  insurable
interest, which Insurance Policies are, to Seller's Knowledge, listed on Section
3.15(b) of the Disclosure Schedule.

            5.4. Filings.  Promptly after the execution of this Agreement,  each
of the Parties shall prepare and make or cause to be made any required  filings,
submissions,  disclosures  and  notifications  under the laws of any domestic or
foreign jurisdiction to the extent that such filings are necessary to consummate
or as a  result  of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  and  in  the  other
Transaction Documents and will use its reasonable best efforts to take all other
actions necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in a manner
consistent  with  applicable  law. Each of the Parties will furnish to the other
Parties such  necessary  information  and  reasonable  assistance  as such other
Parties may reasonably  request in connection  with the foregoing.  In the event
that a Party is  required  to  disclose  confidential  information  of the other
Parties hereto in any such filings, submissions,  disclosures and notifications,
such  disclosing  Party shall notify the affected Party and provide the affected
Party a reasonable period to review and comment on such disclosures in advance.

            5.5.  Further  Assurances.   Upon  the  terms  and  subject  to  the
conditions  herein provided,  each of the Parties agrees to use its best efforts
to take or cause  to be  taken  all  action,  to do or cause to be done,  and to
assist  and  cooperate  with the  other  Parties  hereto in  doing,  all  things
necessary,  proper  or  advisable  under  applicable  laws  and  regulations  to
consummate and make effective,  in the most expeditious manner practicable,  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  including, but not limited to, the
execution and delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other actions
as the other  Parties  hereto may  reasonably  require in order to carry out the
intent of this Agreement.

            5.6. Tax Covenants.

               (a) Cooperation on Tax and Audit Matters.  The Purchaser,  on the
one hand,  and Seller and SL  Industries,  on the other  hand,  shall  cooperate
fully,  as and to the  extent  reasonably  requested  by  the  other  Party,  in
connection  with the filing of Tax  Returns and any audit,  litigation  or other
proceeding  with respect to Taxes of EME or Paks or audit of the 2002  financial
statement of EME.  Such  cooperation  shall  include the retention and (upon the
other  Party's  request)  the  provision  of records and  information  which are
reasonably  relevant  to any such audit,  litigation,  or other  proceeding  and
making employees  available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material  provided  hereunder.  The Purchaser
agrees,  and will cause EME and Paks,  and Seller and SL Industries  agree,  and
will cause KGH and SL  Delaware,  (i) (A) to retain all books and  records  with
respect  to Tax and  audit  matters  pertinent  to EME or Paks  relating  to any
taxable  period  beginning  before the Closing Date until the  expiration of the

<PAGE>



applicable statute of limitations (and any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods,  and to abide by all record retention  agreements  entered into
with any taxing authority and to retain financial  records relating to the audit
of all  periods  through  the  Closing  Date,  and (B) to give the  other  Party
reasonable  written notice prior to  transferring,  destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the other Party so  requests,  to allow the other
Party to take  possession  of such books and records.  Seller and SL  Industries
will provide  Purchaser and will cause KGH and SL Delaware to provide  Purchaser
within  sixty (60) days after the Closing (i) Forms 5471 for EME and Paks,  (ii)
complete  trial  balances  as of and for the year ending  December  31, 2002 and
(iii) an  existing  appraisal  containing  a detailed  fixed  asset  listing and
architectural drawing for the sites and buildings used by EME or Paks.

               (b)  Responsibility  for Filing 2002 Tax  Returns.  Seller and SL
Industries,  with the cooperation of EME and Paks,  shall prepare or cause to be
prepared  all Tax  Returns  for or in which  EME and Paks are  included  for the
period ended  December 31, 2002 and shall pay any and all Taxes that are payable
in respect of the period ended  December 31, 2002 (the "Final  Period  Returns")
and in respect of the payments and writeoffs set forth on Section  3.2(b) of the
Disclosure  Schedule.  Purchaser  shall  file or cause to be filed all the Final
Period  Returns for EME and Paks.  The Final Period Returns shall be prepared in
accordance  with  applicable  Law. No position will be taken on the Final Period
Returns,  except to the extent  required by applicable law, that would adversely
affect  EME or Paks  after the  Closing.  SL  Industries  shall  deliver  to the
Purchaser a copy of each Final Period Return, together with any schedules,  work
papers and other documentation that are relevant to their preparation, not later
than  thirty  (30)  days  prior to the due date for  such  Final  Period  Return
(including  applicable  extensions) (the "Due Date").  The Purchaser may provide
comments,  including  but not limited to  requested  revisions,  to the proposed
Final Period Return,  which comments shall be delivered to SL Industries  within
ten (10) days after the  Purchaser's  receipt of the copy of such proposed Final
Period  Returns.  The Seller and SL Industries  shall consider in good faith any
such  comments to such Final Period  Return as are  reasonably  requested by the
Purchaser.  Purchaser  shall file the Final Period Returns on the earlier of (i)
the provision to SL Industries by Purchaser of written notice from the Purchaser
indicating the  Purchaser's  consent to such filing or (ii) one (1) day prior to
the Due Date.

               (c) Tax Refunds.  Upon receipt of the Tax Refund,  the  Purchaser
shall, within five (5) days of receipt thereof, pay over (or cause to paid over)
to the Seller the Tax Refund,  together  with any notices  from the  appropriate
taxing authorities  regarding such Tax Refund.  Additionally,  no later than the
earlier of (i) three days prior to the due date or (ii)  September 30, 2003, the
Purchaser  shall pay to the Seller the EME  Additional  Tax  Payment.  Any other
refund of Taxes  received by EME or Paks after the Closing  that  relates to any
Tax period or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date and that are
not accrued for on the Interim Financial  Statements shall be for the account of
and shall be paid to Seller within five (5) days following receipt.

               (d)  Affiliated  Loans.  Any  loan  payable  by EME or Paks to SL
Industries, Seller, or any Affiliate thereof will be forgiven and contributed to
the  capital  of EME or Paks,  as the case may be, by the  lender.  Prior to the
Closing,  any loans  payable  to EME or Paks by SL  Industries,  Seller,  or any
Affiliate thereof, will be forgiven by EME or Paks, as the case may be.

                                       25

<PAGE>



               (e) Defense. In the event Purchaser,  EME or Paks shall receive a
written claim for taxes ("Claim") from any jurisdiction for any period ending on
or  before  December  31,  2002 with  respect  to EME or Paks,  Purchaser  shall
promptly send a copy thereof to SL Industries.  SL Industries  shall at its sole
cost then have the right to contest the Claim and SL  Industries  shall have the
right to select the attorneys  and other persons  necessary to represent EME and
Paks  ("Seller's  Representatives")  in contesting  the Claim.  Purchaser  shall
cooperate, and shall cause EME and Paks to cooperate,  with SL Industries as may
be  reasonably  requested  by SL  Industries  in  contesting  the  Claim.  If SL
Industries receives the Claim directly,  then SL Industries shall have the right
to contest the Claim under the above  procedures and Purchaser  will  cooperate,
and shall cause EME and Paks to cooperate, with SL Industries as provided above.

            5.7. Non-Competition. Each of Seller and SL Industries will not, for
two  (2)  years  from  the  Closing  Date,   directly  or   indirectly   through
subsidiaries,  as an owner,  partner,  shareholder,  joint  venturer,  corporate
officer,  director,  employee,  manager,   consultant,   principal,  trustee  or
licensor, or an other capacity whatsoever of or for any Person:

                 (a)      solicit,  divert or take away,  or attempt to solicit,
                          divert or take away,  the business or patronage of any
                          of the clients, customers or suppliers of EME of Paks;
                          or

                 (b)      lend or allow its name or  reputation to be used by or
                          otherwise allow its skill,  knowledge or experience to
                          be  used  by  any  Person  that   competes   with  the
                          businesses of EME or Paks in the German, Hungarian and
                          European  market  as such  businesses  exist as of the
                          Closing Date, except for the business of SL Montevideo
                          Technology, Inc., together with its subsidiaries.

Upon the sale of SL  Industries  or any of its  subsidiaries,  the  restrictions
contained in this Section 5.7 shall  terminate with respect to the operations of
such division or subsidiary being sold.

            5.8 Confidentiality.

               (a) Each of Seller,  SL Industries,  and their Affiliates has had
access to, and there has been disclosed to each of Seller,  SL  Industries,  and
their Affiliates,  information of a confidential  nature that has great value to
EME and Paks and constitutes a substantial basis upon which the value of EME and
Paks is  predicated.  Such  information  includes  trade  secrets,  customer  or
supplier  lists,  pricing  information,   marketing  arrangements,   strategies,
business plans,  internal  performance  statistics,  training manuals, and other
information   concerning  EME  or  Paks  that  is  competitively   sensitive  or
confidential (the "Confidential Information").

               (b) Each of Seller  and SL  Industries  will not,  and will cause
their  respective  Affiliates  to  not,  (i)  use or  divulge  any  Confidential
Information,  except:  (A) to  EME's  or  Paks'  personnel;  (B)  to the  extent
disclosure may be required by Law; or (C) if such  information  becomes lawfully
obtainable from other sources who were not under a duty of  confidentiality  and

                                       26

<PAGE>



(ii) use or  permit  to be used  any  Confidential  Information  for the gain or
benefit of any Person  other than the  Purchaser  or for his or its own personal
gain or benefit.

            5.9  Reasonableness  of  Restrictions  and   Enforceability.   Given
Seller's  and SL  Industries'  position  as a direct  or  indirect  shareholder,
partner or owner of EME and Paks and Seller's and SL Industries' strong business
ties that are  significant to the growth of the businesses of EME and Paks, each
of Seller and SL Industries acknowledges that the restrictions in this Agreement
are  reasonable  both  individually  and in the aggregate and that the duration,
geographic  scope,  extent and application of each of such  restrictions  are no
greater  than is  necessary  for the  protection  of EME's and Paks'  legitimate
business  interests,  which include but are not limited to EME's and Pak's trade
secrets and other valuable  confidential  business  information  acquired by the
Purchaser, its substantial  relationships with prospective or existing customers
and suppliers, and the goodwill associated with the businesses of EME and Paks.

            5.10 Termination of Profit and Loss Agreement.  Purchaser,  DCX-Chol
and Chol  Enterprises  agree that, in the event a trade  creditor  makes a claim
against KGH arising  from  termination  of the Profit and Loss  Agreement,  they
shall  indemnify KGH from such liability to the extent such liability was stated
on the Interim Financial  Statements or arise in the ordinary course of business
thereafter.

            5.11 Severable  Covenants.  The Parties intend that the covenants in
Section  5.7 will be  construed  as a series  of  separate  covenants.  All such
separate covenants will be deemed identical.  The Parties desire and intend that
this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent  permissible under the Laws and
public policies applied in each  jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If
any  particular  provision  of Sections  5.7, 5.8 and 5.9 is  adjudicated  to be
invalid or unenforceable, (a) each of the Parties agrees that if such provisions
would be valid or  enforceable if some part or parts of them were deleted or the
period or area of application  reduced,  the applicable  restriction  will apply
with the modifications necessary to make it valid and enforceable,  and (b) such
adjudication  will apply only with respect to the operation of this Agreement in
the  particular  jurisdiction  in  which  the  adjudication  is  made,  and  the
unenforceable  covenant  will be  eliminated  from this  Agreement to the extent
necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions of them) to be
enforced.

Affiliates or their Representatives or disclosure by SL Industries,  Seller, the

                    (i) any breach of any representation,  warranty, covenant or
               agreement  (or in the case of claims made by third  parties,  any
               claim or allegation that if true would constitute a breach of any
               representation,  warranty,  covenant  or  agreement)  made  by SL
               Industries or Seller in this Agreement,  including the Disclosure
               Schedule and Exhibits  hereto or any other  document or agreement
               delivered  by  or  on  behalf  of  SL  Industries  or  Seller  in
               connection therewith; and

                    (ii) without  limiting the preceding  clause (i), any claims
               arising  out  or  in  connection  with  the  potential  liability
               relating  to  any  items  listed  in  Section  8.3(a)(ii)  of the
               Disclosure Schedule.

               (b) Indemnification by Purchaser,  DCX-Chol and Chol Enterprises.
The  Purchaser,   DCX-Chol  and  Chol  Enterprises  (together,   the  "Purchaser
Indemnifying  Parties") shall jointly and severally  indemnify,  defend and hold
harmless Seller, SL Industries, SL Delaware, KGH and their Affiliates,  together
with their respective directors, officers, employees, managers, representatives,

               (c) Length of Indemnity  Obligation of Seller and SL  Industries.
The right of the  Purchaser  Indemnified  Parties to make a claim for  indemnity
under  Section  8.3(a)  will  survive  the  Closing and remain in full force and
effect thereafter until the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date,
except  that  any  claim  for   indemnity   arising  in   connection   with  the
representations and warranties  contained in (i) Sections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.12 and
the  indemnity  provided  in  Section  8.3(a)(ii)  and in  connection  with  the
covenants  contained in Section 5.6 shall survive the Closing and remain in full
force and  effect  thereafter  until 30 days  following  the  expiration  of the
applicable statutes of limitations (including any extensions),  and (ii) Section
3.16  shall  survive  the  Closing  in  the  cases  of  claims  relating  (x) to
Purchaser's  Environmental  Losses  until the four (4) year  anniversary  of the
Closing Date, and (y) Prior Environmental Losses under the applicable statute of
limitation under the 1998 Contract;  provided,  however,  that with respect to a
claim of actual fraud, each of the  representations and warranties shall survive
until the applicable statutes of limitations for actual fraud have expired.

               (d) Length of Indemnity Obligation of Purchaser. The right of the
Seller  Indemnified  Parties to make a claim for indemnity  under Section 8.3(b)
will  survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect  thereafter  until
the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however, that
with  respect  to a claim  of  actual  fraud,  each of the  representations  and
warranties shall survive until the applicable statutes of limitations for actual
fraud have expired.

               (e) Indemnification Procedures.

                    (i) Any claim for  recovery or  indemnification  pursuant to
            Section  8.3(a) or 8.3(b) will be made promptly  after  discovery of
            the  circumstances  underlying  such  claim in a  written  statement
            signed by the Party seeking such recovery or indemnification,  which
            will specify in reasonable  detail each individual item of Purchaser
            Loss or  Seller  Loss,  as the case may be,  suffered  by the  Party
            seeking  recovery  or  indemnification   and  the  estimated  amount
            thereof,  the date such item was claimed or the facts giving rise to
            such claim were discovered,  the basis for any alleged liability and
            the  nature  of the  breach  or  claim to which  each  such  item is
            related.

                    (ii) The Party seeking  indemnification  for any third party
            claim  will give the  indemnifying  party(s)  prompt  notice of such
            third  party  claim  which  might  give  rise  to  liability  of the
            indemnifying   party(s)  for  indemnification   hereunder.   If  the
            indemnifying  party(s)  contest any third party claim,  it will have
            the  option  to  defend   (retaining   counsel   acceptable  to  the
            indemnified  party,  which  acceptance  shall  not  be  unreasonably
            withheld or delayed),  at the indemnifying party's expense, any such
            matter,  provided that the indemnified party will have the right, at
            its own cost and  expense,  to  participate  in the  defense of such
            claim. However,  notwithstanding the preceding sentence,  (a) if the
            indemnifying  party  elects not to defend  the claim,  or (b) if the
            claim has been brought or asserted against the indemnifying party(s)
            as  well  as  the  indemnified  party  and  such  indemnified  party
            reasonably  concludes that there may be one or more factual or legal
            defenses  available to it that are in conflict with those  available
            to the indemnifying party(s) and the indemnifying party is unwilling
            to raise  such  defenses,  then the  indemnified  party may elect to

                                       29

<PAGE>

            conduct its defense on its own behalf,  in which case the reasonable
            fees and expenses of the indemnified  party's counsel will be at the
            expense  of the  indemnifying  party(s).  In the latter  event,  the
            indemnified party may settle such claim, after giving notice of such
            proposed  settlement to the indemnifying party, on such terms as the
            indemnified party may reasonably deem appropriate and no such action
            taken by the  indemnified  party in defending or settling such claim
            will release the  indemnifying  party of any  obligation  hereunder.
            Except under the circumstances  described in the preceding sentence,
            the indemnified  party will not enter into any settlement  agreement
            without  the   indemnifying   party's  consent  which  will  not  be
            unreasonably  withheld or delayed.  The  indemnifying  party(s) will
            not,  without the prior  written  consent of the  indemnified  party
            (which will not be unreasonably withheld), enter into any settlement
            of a  claim,  if  pursuant  to or as a  result  of such  settlement,
            injunctive  or other  equitable  relief will be imposed  against the
            indemnified   party  or  if  such   settlement  does  not  expressly
            unconditionally  release the indemnified  party from all liabilities
            or  obligations  with  respect to such claim,  with  prejudice.  The
            indemnified party and the indemnifying  party(s) will cooperate with
            the each other in the defense, compromise or settlement of any claim
            for which indemnification is sought.

               (f) Limitation on Indemnification Obligation.

                    (i) Seller, SL Industries,  SL Delaware and KGH shall not be
            liable, and the Purchaser  Indemnified  Parties agree not to enforce
            any claim for indemnification until the aggregate amount of all such
            claims  exceeds  $100,000  (the  "Purchaser  Threshold");  provided,
            however,  that  once the  amount  of claims  exceeds  the  Purchaser
            Threshold,  the Purchaser  Indemnified  Parties shall be entitled to
            recover the entire amount from all claims in excess of $100,000. The
            Purchaser,  DCX-Chol and Chol Enterprises  shall not be liable,  and
            the Seller  Indemnified  Parties  agree not to enforce any claim for
            indemnification  until  the  aggregate  amount  of all  such  claims
            exceeds $100,000 (the "Seller Threshold");  provided,  however, that
            once the amount of claims exceeds the Seller  Threshold,  the Seller
            Indemnified  Parties  shall be entitled to recover the entire amount
            from all claims in excess of $100,000.  Notwithstanding  anything to
            the contrary  contained herein,  all claims for indemnity for claims
            arising  in  connection  with  the  representations  and  warranties
            contained in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.12 and 3.16 and in connection with
            the  covenants  contained in Section 5.6 shall not be subject to the
            Purchaser  Threshold or the Seller Threshold,  and the party seeking
            indemnity  shall be entitled  to recover  the entire  amount for all
            such  claims,  except  that,  to the extent the claim for  indemnity
            under Section 3.16 relates to Prior Environmental Losses, the Seller
            and SL  Industries  shall have no liability of any kind for any such
            claim, and Seller's and SL Industries' sole responsibility  shall be
            to, in good faith, using  commercially  reasonable  efforts,  and at
            their sole cost,  seek to recover from Datron for such claim, to the
            extent  permitted under the 1998 Agreement,  and to remit such funds
            (net of reimbursed costs from Datron) to Purchaser upon receipt. The
            total  liability  for  Purchaser  Losses by Seller or SL  Industries
            shall not exceed $5,000,000 in the aggregate;  provided,  that there

                                       30

<PAGE>



            shall be no limit in  respect  of  Purchaser  Losses  and  Purchaser
            Environmental  Losses arising in connection with the representations
            and warranties contained in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.12 and 3.16 and the
            indemnity  provided under Section  8.3(a)(ii) and in connection with
            the  covenants  contained in Section 5.6.  The total  liability  for
            Seller Losses by Purchaser,  DCX-Chol and Chol Industries  shall not
            exceed $5,000,000 in the aggregate.

                    (ii) Each party  hereto  shall use  commercially  reasonable
            efforts to recover  Purchaser  Losses or Seller Losses,  as the case
            may be ("Damages") under all applicable  insurance policies and from
            all third parties prior to seeking recovery pursuant to this Article
            8 and the amount of any Damages for which a party may be indemnified
            under Article 8 shall be reduced by any such  recovery.  If a Seller
            Indemnified Party or a Purchaser  Indemnified Party, as the case may
            be,  recovers   insurance  proceeds  after  recovering  any  Damages
            pursuant to this Article 8, then such party shall  promptly remit to
            the  Seller  Indemnifying  Parties  or  the  Purchaser  Indemnifying
            Parties,  as the case may be (the  "Indemnifying  Party")  that paid
            such indemnification hereunder the amount of such insurance proceeds
            to the extent the insurance  proceeds  together with the amount paid
            by the  Indemnifying  Party  exceeds the amount of the Damages up to
            the amount of the  indemnification  for Damages that was paid by the
            Indemnifying Party hereunder.

               (g) Purchaser's Right of Offset.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary  contained in this Agreement or the other  Transaction  Documents,  the
Purchaser,  DCX-Chol  and Chol  Enterprises  shall  have the right to offset any
Purchaser Losses arising in connection with the  representations  and warranties
set forth in Section  3.12  against any amounts  payable  under the terms of the
Unsecured  Note.  Purchaser  shall provide written notice to Seller at least two
(2) days prior to the date of such offset  (the  "Notice of  Offset").  Under no
circumstances shall any amounts,  including without limitation Purchaser Losses,
be offset against any amounts payable under the terms of the Secured Note.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

            9.1.  Amendment and  Modifications.  This  Agreement may be amended,
modified or  supplemented  at any time by the  Parties.  This  Agreement  may be
amended only by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all Parties.

            9.2.  Extension;  Waiver.  At any  time  prior to the  Closing,  the
Parties  entitled to the benefits of the  respective  term or provision  may (i)
extend the time for the  performance of any of the  obligations or other acts of
the other  Parties,  (ii)  waive any  inaccuracies  in the  representations  and
warranties contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
pursuant  hereto  or  (iii)  waive  compliance  with any  obligation,  covenant,
agreement or condition contained herein in order to effectuate the Closing.  Any
agreement  on the part of any Party to any such  extension  or  waiver  shall be
valid  only if set forth in an  instrument  in  writing  signed on behalf of the
Parties  entitled to the benefits of such  extended or waived term or provision,
and no such extension or waiver shall be deemed to be a waiver or release of any


                                       31

<PAGE>



losses or damages (including Purchaser  Indemnified Losses or Seller Indemnified
Losses)  that the  extending  or  waiving  Party  may  incur as a result  of any
underlying  breach or failure that was extended or waived in order to effectuate
the Closing.  No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege  hereunder  shall operate as a waiver  thereof nor shall any single or
partial  exercise  thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  The rights and remedies herein
provided  shall be  cumulative  and not  exclusive  of any  rights  or  remedies
provided by Law.

            9.3.  Entire  Agreement;  Assignment.  This  Agreement and the other
Transaction  Documents (a)  constitute the entire  agreements  among the Parties
with respect to the subject  matter hereof and thereof and  supersedes all other
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties or
any of them with  respect  to the  subject  matter  hereof  and (b) shall not be
assigned  by  operation  of law or  otherwise.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,
Purchaser,  DCX-Chol  and Chol  Enterprises  may assign  their rights under this
Agreement to an Affiliate or Affiliates  after the Closing in connection  with a
transfer of the Purchased Shares to such Affiliate or Affiliates,  in which case
the representations, warranties, indemnities, covenants and other obligations of
Seller,  SL Industries,  SL Delaware and KGH hereunder and under the Transaction
Documents shall inure to the benefit of such Affiliate or Affiliates.

            9.4. Validity.  The invalidity or  unenforceability of any provision
of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or  enforceability  of any other
provision  of this  Agreement,  each of which  shall  remain  in full  force and
effect.

            9.9.  Descriptive  Headings.  The  descriptive  headings  herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of or
to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

            9.10.  Counterparts.   This  Agreement  and  the  other  Transaction
Documents  may be executed in two or more  counterparts,  each of which shall be
deemed to be an  original,  but all of which shall  constitute  one and the same
agreement.

            9.11. Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated,  and except as otherwise  expressly set forth herein,
all  legal  and  other  costs  and  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with the

such  expenses.  All  expenses  incurred  in  Germany  in  connection  with  the
Transaction Documents and the transactions  contemplated therein, such as notary
fees,  sales,  use,  transfer,  real estate,  recording,  stamp and other taxes,
duties or fees shall be paid  equally by  Purchaser  and  Seller.  Seller and SL

            9.12. Parties in Interest.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure  solely to the  benefit of each Party and its  respective  successors  and

Agreement.

            9.13.  Attorneys'  Fees. If any legal action or any  arbitration  or

entitled to recover reasonable  attorneys' fees and other costs incurred in that
action or proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which such party may be
entitled.

            9.14.  Interpretation.  No  reference  in this  Agreement  to  "best
efforts" or "all  reasonable  efforts"  shall require a Person  obligated to use
such efforts to incur  unreasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses or indebtedness or,
except as  expressly  provided  herein,  to institute  litigation  or to consent
generally to service of process in any jurisdiction. All references to "dollars"
or "$" herein refer to United States  dollars.  All references in this Agreement
to Exhibits, Schedules,  Articles, Sections,  subsections, or other subdivisions

particular  subdivision  unless expressly so limited.  The words "this Section,"
"this  subsection,"  and words of similar import,  refer only to the Sections or
