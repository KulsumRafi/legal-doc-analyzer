Commitments as reduced from time to time pursuant to Section 2.03 hereof and

(y) the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Liabilities in respect of the IRB

Credit shall not at any time exceed $6,106,463.

         (b) The Company shall give the Administrative Agent at least three
Business Days' irrevocable prior notice (effective upon receipt) specifying the
date a Letter of Credit is to be issued and describing the proposed terms of
such Letter of Credit and the nature of the transactions proposed to be
supported thereby. Upon receipt of such notice the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender of the contents thereof and of such Lender's Working
Capital Commitment Percentage of the amount of such proposed Letter of Credit.

         (c) On each day during the period commencing with the issuance by
JPMorgan Chase of any Letter of Credit and until such Letter of Credit shall
have expired or been terminated, the Working Capital Commitment of each Lender
shall be deemed to be utilized for all purposes hereof in an amount equal to
such Lender's Working Capital Commitment Percentage of the amount then available
for drawings under such Letter of Credit.

         (d) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any
demand for payment or other drawing under such Letter of Credit, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and each Lender as to the
amount to be paid as a result of such demand or drawing and the respective
payment date. If at any time JPMorgan Chase shall make a payment to a
beneficiary of a Letter of Credit in respect of a drawing or in respect of an
acceptance created in connection with a drawing under such Letter of Credit,
each Lender will pay to JPMorgan Chase, immediately upon JPMorgan Chase's demand
at any time during the period commencing after such payment until reimbursement
therefor in full by the Company, an amount equal to such Lender's Working
Capital Commitment Percentage of such payment, together with interest on such
amount for each day from the date of JPMorgan Chase's demand for such payment
(or, if such demand is made after 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on such date,
from the next succeeding Business Day) to the date of payment by such Lender of
such amount at a rate of interest per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate for
such period.

         (e) The Company shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated
forthwith to reimburse JPMorgan Chase for any amounts paid by JPMorgan Chase
upon any drawing under any Letter of Credit, without presentment, demand,
protest or other formalities of any kind. JPMorgan Chase will pay to each Lender
such Lender's Working Capital Commitment Percentage of all amounts received from
the Company for application in payment, in whole or in part, of the
Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any Letter of Credit, but only to the
extent such Lender has made payment to JPMorgan Chase in respect of such Letter
of Credit pursuant to clause (d) above.

                                       21

<PAGE>

         (f) The issuance by JPMorgan Chase of each Letter of Credit shall, in
addition to the conditions precedent set forth in Section 7 hereof, be subject
to the conditions precedent such Letter of Credit shall be in such form, and
shall contain such terms and support such transactions, as shall be reasonably
satisfactory to JPMorgan Chase, and that the Company shall have executed and
delivered such other instruments and agreements relating to such Letter of
Credit as JPMorgan Chase shall have reasonably requested. No Letter of Credit
shall have a term extending beyond the earlier of (i) one year from the date of
issuance and (ii) seven Business Days prior to the last day of the Working
Capital Availability Period.

         (g) The Company hereby indemnifies and holds harmless each Lender and
the Administrative Agent (which for purposes of this Section 2.02(g) shall
include a reference to JPMorgan Chase acting in its individual capacity
hereunder as issuer of Letters of Credit) from and against any and all claims
and damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which such Lender or the
Administrative Agent may incur (or which may be claimed against such Lender or
the Administrative Agent by any Person whatsoever) by reason of or in connection
with the execution and delivery or transfer of or payment or failure to pay
under any Letter of Credit, including, without limitation, any claims, damages,
losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which the Administrative Agent may incur
by reason of or in connection with the failure of any other Lender to fulfill or
comply with its obligations to the Administrative Agent hereunder (but nothing
herein contained shall affect any rights the Company may have against such
defaulting Lender); provided that the Company shall not be required to indemnify
any Lender or the Administrative Agent for any claims, damages, losses,
liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by
(i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Lender or the
Administrative Agent in determining whether a request presented under any Letter
of Credit complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (ii) such Lender's
failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a
request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of
Credit. Nothing in this Section 2.02(g) is intended to limit the obligations of
the Company under any other provision of this Agreement.

                  Liabilities as provided below) in the amount of and on the
                  date of each receipt by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
                  of Net Cash Proceeds from the incurrence of any Funded
                  Indebtedness not otherwise permitted under Section 9.08 to
                  which the Majority Lenders have consented.

                           (4) Asset Dispositions. The Company shall prepay the
                  Loans (or provide cover for Letter of Credit Liabilities as
                  provided below) in the amount of and on the date of each
                  receipt by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the Net
                  Cash Proceeds of any disposition by such Person of any assets
                  not otherwise permitted under Section 9.12 to which the
                  Majority Lenders have consented.

                           (5) Reversion of Pension Plans. The Company shall
                  prepay the Loans (or provide cover for Letter of Credit
                  Liabilities

                                       26

<PAGE>

                  as provided below) in the amount of and on the date of each
                  receipt by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of Net Cash
                  Proceeds from the termination of a Plan.

         (ii) Prepayment and Cover of Working Capital Obligations. If the
Company shall be required pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (5) of clause
(b)(i) above to prepay any Loans or provide cover for any Letter of Credit
Liabilities, the Company shall, until the Loans have been paid in full, first
prepay the principal of such Loans and then, following such payment in full,
provide cover for the relevant Letter of Credit Liabilities. Cover for Letter of
Credit Liabilities shall be effected by paying all Reimbursement Obligations
then due and payable and then paying to the Administrative Agent immediately
available funds, to be held by the Administrative Agent in the Collateral
Account maintained by the Company pursuant to the Security Documents, in an
amount equal to the required prepayment, which amount shall be retained by the
Administrative Agent in such Collateral Account and applied to pay any
Reimbursement Obligations which become due until such time as the Letters of
Credit shall have been terminated and all of the Letter of Credit Liabilities
paid in full.

         Section 4. Payments of Principal and Interest.

         4.01 Repayment of Loans. The Loans shall mature on the last day of the
 Working Capital Availability Period.

         4.02 Interest. The Company will pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made
by such Lender for the period commencing on the date of such Loan to but
excluding the date such Loan shall be paid in full, at the following rates per
annum:

                  (a) if such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, the Base Rate plus the
          Applicable Margin; and

                  (b) if such Loan is a Eurodollar Loan, the Eurodollar Rate
         plus the Applicable Margin.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Company will pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender interest at the applicable Post-Default
Rate on the principal of any Loan made by such Lender, on any Reimbursement
Obligation and on any other amount payable by the Company hereunder to or for
the account of such Lender (but, if such amount is interest, only to the extent
legally enforceable), which shall not be paid in full when due (whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), for the period commencing on the
due date thereof until the same is paid in full.

                                       27

<PAGE>

         Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable (i) if such Loan is a
Base Rate Loan, on each Quarterly Date, (ii) if such Loan is a Eurodollar Loan,
on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (and, if such Interest
Period exceeds three months' duration, quarterly, commencing on the first
quarterly anniversary of the first day of such Interest Period), and (iii) in
any event, upon the payment, prepayment or conversion thereof, but only on the
principal so paid or prepaid or converted; provided that interest payable at the
Post-Default Rate shall be payable from time to time on demand of the
Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders. Promptly after the determination
of any interest rate provided for herein or any change therein, the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders and the Company thereof.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.02, if at
any time the rate of interest set forth above on any Loan of or other obligation
payable to any Lender (the "Stated Rate") exceeds the maximum non-usurious
interest rate permissible for such Lender to charge commercial borrowers under
applicable law (the "Maximum Rate" for such Lender), the rate of interest
charged on such Loan of or other obligation payable to such Lender hereunder
shall be limited to the Maximum Rate for such Lender.

         If the Stated Rate for any Loan of a Lender that has theretofore been
subject to the preceding paragraph at any time is less than the Maximum Rate for
such Lender, the principal amount of such Loan shall bear interest at the
Maximum Rate for such Lender until the total amount of interest paid to such
Lender or accrued on its Loans hereunder equals the amount of interest which
would have been paid to such Lender or accrued on such Lender's Loans hereunder
if the Stated Rate had at all times been in effect.

         If, upon payment in full of all amounts payable hereunder, the total
amount of interest paid to any Lender or accrued on such Lender's Loans under
the terms of this Agreement is less than the total amount of interest which
would have been paid to such Lender or accrued on such Lender's Loans if the
Stated Rate had, at all times, been in effect, then the Company shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Lender an amount equal to the difference between (a) the lesser
of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on such Lender's Loans if
the Maximum Rate for such Lender had at all times been in effect or (ii) the
amount of interest which would have accrued on such Lender's Loans if the Stated
Rate had at all times been in effect and (b) the amount of interest actually
paid to such Lender or accrued on its Loans under this Agreement.

         If any Lender ever receives, collects or applies as interest any sum in
excess of the Maximum Rate for such Lender, such excess amount shall be applied
to the reduction of the principal balance of its Loans or to other amounts
(other than interest) payable hereunder, and if no such principal is then
outstanding, such excess or part thereof remaining shall be paid to the Company.

         Section 5. Payments; Pro Rata Treatment; Computations; Etc.

         5.01 Payments. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all
payments of principal, interest, Reimbursement Obligations and other amounts to
be made by the Company hereunder and under the Notes shall be made in Dollars,
in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent at the office most
recently designated by the Administrative Agent for such purpose, not later than
12:00 Noon New York time on the date on which such payment shall become due
(each such payment made after such time on such due date to be deemed to have
been made on the next succeeding Business Day). The Administrative Agent, or any
Lender for whose account any such payment is made, may (but shall not be
obligated to) debit the amount of any such payment which is not made by such
time to any ordinary deposit account of the Company with the Administrative
Agent or such Lender, as the case may be. The Company shall, at the time of
making each payment hereunder or under any Note, specify to the Administrative
Agent the Loans or other amounts payable by the Company hereunder to which such
payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails to so specify, or if an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent may
apply such payment as it may elect in its sole discretion to amounts then due,
but subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, including,
without limitation, Section 5.02 hereof; provided that the Administrative Agent
shall apply such payment first to outstanding Base Rate Loans and then to
outstanding Eurodollar Loans). Each payment received by the Administrative Agent
hereunder or under any Note for the account of a Lender shall be paid promptly
to such Lender, in immediately available funds, for the account of such Lender's
Applicable Lending Office. If the due date of any payment hereunder or under any
Note would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day such date shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and interest shall be payable
for any principal so extended for the period of such extension.

         5.02 Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided
herein: (a) each borrowing from the Lenders under Section 2.01 hereof shall be
made from the Lenders, each payment of commitment fees and letter of credit fees
under Section 2.04 hereof shall be made for the account of the Lenders, and each
termination or reduction of the Working Capital Commitments under Section 2.03
hereof shall be applied to the Working Capital Commitments of the Lenders, pro
rata according to the Lenders' respective Working Capital Commitment
Percentages; (b) each payment by the Company of principal of or interest on
Loans of a particular Type (other than payments in respect of Loans of
individual Lenders provided for by Section 6 hereof) shall be made to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with
the respective unpaid principal amounts of such Loans held by the Lenders; (c)
each conversion of Loans of a particular Type (other than conversions of Loans
of individual Lenders pursuant to Section 6.04 hereof) shall be made pro rata
among the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of such
Loans held by the Lenders; and (d) the Lenders (other than JPMorgan Chase) shall
purchase

                                       29

<PAGE>

from JPMorgan Chase participations in the Letters of Credit to the extent of
their respective Working Capital Commitment Percentages.

         5.03 Computations. Interest based on the Prime Rate hereunder shall be
computed on the basis of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and actual days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the
period for which payable. All other interest and fees shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed (including the first day
but, except in the case of letter of credit fees, excluding the last day)
occurring in the period for which payable.

         5.04 Minimum and Maximum Amounts; Types. Except for prepayments made
pursuant to Section 3.02(b) hereof, each borrowing, conversion and prepayment of
principal of Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to (a) in the
case of Eurodollar Loans, $3,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000 and
(b) in the case of Base Rate Loans, $1,000,000 or any larger multiple thereof,
except that any borrowing may be in the aggregate amount of the unused portion
of the Working Capital Commitments (borrowings, conversions or prepayments of
Loans of different Types or, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, having different
Interest Periods, at the same time hereunder to be deemed separate borrowings,
conversions and prepayments for purposes of the foregoing, one for each Type or
Interest Period). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement there shall not be, at any one time, more than eight Interest Periods
in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans.

         5.05 Certain Notices. Notices to the Administrative Agent of
terminations or reductions of Working Capital Commitments, of borrowings,
conversions and prepayments of Loans and of the duration of Interest Periods
shall be irrevocable and shall be effective only if received by the
Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon (or, in the case of borrowings or
prepayments of Base Rate Loans, 10:00 a.m.) New York time on the number of
Business Days prior to the date of the relevant termination, reduction,
borrowing, conversion and/or prepayment specified below:

         Prepayments of Eurodollar Loans                    1

         Each notice of termination or reduction shall specify the amount of the
Working Capital Commitments to be terminated or reduced. Each notice of
borrowing, conversion or prepayment shall specify the amount, Type of the Loans
to be borrowed, converted or prepaid (subject to Sections 3.02(a) and 5.04
hereof), the date of borrowing, conversion or prepayment (which shall be a
Business Day) and, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the duration of the Interest
Period therefor (subject to the definition of Interest Period). Each such notice
of duration of an Interest Period shall specify the Loans to which such Interest
Period is to relate. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders
of the contents of each such notice. In the event that the Company fails to
select the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Loans within the
time period and otherwise as provided in this Section 5.05, such Loans (if
outstanding as Eurodollar Loans) will be automatically converted into Base Rate
Loans on the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loans or (if
outstanding as Base Rate Loans) will remain as, or (if not then outstanding)
will be made as, Base Rate Loans.

         5.06 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender or the Company (the
"Payor") prior to the date on which such Lender is to make payment to the
Administrative Agent of the proceeds of a Loan to be made by it hereunder (or
the payment of any amount by such Lender to reimburse JPMorgan Chase for a
drawing under any Letter of Credit) or the Company is to make a payment to the
Administrative Agent for the account of one or more of the Lenders, as the case
may be (such payment being herein called the "Required Payment"), which notice
shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not intend to make the
Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may
assume that the Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such
assumption (but shall not be required to), make the amount thereof available to
the intended recipient on such date and, if the Payor has not in fact made the

                                       31

<PAGE>

Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment (or,
if such recipient is the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit, the Company and, if
the Company fails to pay the amount thereof to the Administrative Agent
forthwith upon demand, the Lenders ratably in proportion to their respective
Working Capital Percentages) shall, on demand, pay to the Administrative Agent
the amount made available to it together with interest thereon in respect of the
period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the
Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent receives such
amount at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such period.

         5.07 Sharing of Payments, Etc. The Company agrees that, in addition to
(and without limitation of) any right of set-off, bankers' lien or counterclaim
a Lender may otherwise have, each Lender shall be entitled, at its option, to
offset balances held by it for the account of the Company at any of its offices,
in Dollars or in any other currency, against any principal of or interest on any
of such Lender's Loans to the Company hereunder, or any Reimbursement Obligation
or other obligation of the Company hereunder, which is not paid when due
(regardless of whether such balances are then due to the Company), in which case
it shall promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent thereof,
provided that such Lender's failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity thereof. If a Lender shall obtain payment of any principal of or
interest on any Loan made by it under this Agreement, or on any Reimbursement
Obligation or other obligation then due to such Lender hereunder, through the
exercise of any right of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or similar right,
or otherwise, it shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders participations
in the Loans made, or Reimbursement Obligations or other obligations held, by
the other Lenders in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to
time as shall be equitable to the end that all the Lenders shall share the
benefit of such payment (net of any expenses which may be incurred by such
Lender in obtaining or preserving such benefit) pro rata in accordance with the
unpaid principal and interest on the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations or
other obligations then due to each of them. To such end all the Lenders shall
make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations
sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored.
The Company agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under
applicable law, that any Person purchasing a participation in the Loans made, or
Reimbursement Obligations or other obligations held, by another Person, whether
or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise all rights
of set-off, bankers' lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of Loans and
Reimbursement Obligations or other obligations in the amount of such
participation. Nothing contained herein shall require any Lender to exercise any
such right or shall affect the right of any Lender to exercise, and retain the
benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or
obligation of the Company.

                                       32

         5.08 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Company hereunder shall be
made, in accordance with Section 5.01, free and clear of and without deduction
for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case
of each Lender and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and
franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such
Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any
political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on
its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such
Lender's Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all
such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Company shall be
required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, (i) except as provided in
subsection (h) below, the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so
that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section 5.08), such Lender or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Company shall
make such deductions and (iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted to
the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
law.

         (b) In addition, the Company agrees to pay any present or future stamp
or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar
levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, any
Letter of Credit or any other Basic Document or other document referred to
herein or therein (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

         (c) The Company will indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent
for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including related penalties,
interest and expenses resulting from the Company's failure to pay Taxes or Other
Taxes in accordance with this Section 5.08) imposed by any jurisdiction on
amounts payable under this Section 5.08 paid by such Lender or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including
penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.
This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or
the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.

         (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Company
will furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section
12.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

         (e) If any Lender subsequently receives from a taxing authority a
refund of any Tax previously paid by the Company and for which the Company has

                                       33

<PAGE>

indemnified the Lender pursuant to this Section 5.08 or if the Lender takes a
credit for such Tax against taxes otherwise owing by it to the jurisdiction to
which the Company paid the Tax, such Lender shall within 30 days after receipt
of such refund, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, pay to the
Company the net amount of any such recovery after deducting taxes and expenses
attributable thereto.

         (f) Not later than the Closing Date or, in the case of any bank or
financial institution that became or becomes a Lender after the Closing Date
pursuant to Section 12.06, the date of the instrument of assignment pursuant to
which such bank or financial institution became a Lender, and annually
thereafter or at such other times as the Administrative Agent or the Company may
request, each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States has provided or shall provide the Administrative Agent and the
Company with duly completed copies of Form W-8 BEN or Form W-8ECI or any
successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States
certifying as to such Lender's status as exempt from United States withholding
taxes with respect to all payments to be made to such Lender hereunder or other
documents satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent indicating
that all payments to be made to such Lender hereunder are not subject to such
taxes (an "Exemption Certificate"). In the case of payments to or for any Lender
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, unless the
Administrative Agent has received an Exemption Certificate from such Lender, the
Administrative Agent may withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable
statutory rate and the Company shall not be liable therefor under this Section
5.08.

         (g) If the Company is required to pay additional amounts to any Lender
pursuant to this Section 5.08, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to
designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will
thereafter avoid the need for any additional payments under this Section 5.08
and will not, in the sole judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous
to such Lender.

         (h) If a Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States has not delivered an Exemption Certificate to the Company on or
before the Closing Date or, in the case of any bank or financial institution
that became or becomes a Lender after the Closing Date pursuant to Section
12.06, the date of the instrument of assignment pursuant to which such bank or
financial institution became a Lender, then the Company shall not have any
obligation to indemnify such Lender for Taxes (including related penalties,
interest and expenses) imposed by the United States or any political subdivision
thereof pursuant to Section 5.08(a) and (c) hereof.

         Section 6. Yield Protection and Illegality.

         6.01 Additional Costs.

                                       34

<PAGE>

     (a)  The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
each Lender from time to time such amounts as such Lender may determine to be
necessary to compensate it for any costs incurred by such Lender which such
Lender determines are attributable to its making or maintaining of any
Eurodollar Loans hereunder or its obligation to make any of such Loans
hereunder, or any reduction in any amount receivable by such Lender hereunder in
respect of any of such Loans or such obligation (such increases in costs and
reductions in amounts receivable being herein called "Additional Costs"), in
each case resulting from any Regulatory Change which:

          (i)   changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such
     Lender under this Agreement or its Notes in respect of any of such Loans
     (other than changes which affect taxes measured by or imposed on the
     overall net income of such Lender or of its Applicable Lending Office for
     any of such Loans by the jurisdiction in which such Lender has its
     principal office or such Applicable Lending Office and other than Taxes and
     Other Taxes); or

          (ii)  imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit, insurance
     assessment or similar requirements relating to any extensions of credit or
     other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, such Lender
     (including any of such Loans or any deposits referred to in the definition
     of "Eurodollar Base Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof but excluding, with
     respect to any such Eurodollar Loan, any reserve requirements reflected in
     the applicable Eurodollar Rate); or

          (iii) imposes any other condition affecting this Agreement (or any of
     such extensions of credit or liabilities).

     Each Lender will notify the Company through the Administrative Agent of any
event occurring after the date of this Agreement which will entitle such Lender
to compensation pursuant to this Section 6.01(a) as promptly as practicable
after it obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such compensation,
and (if so requested by the Company through the Administrative Agent) will
designate a different Applicable Lending Office for the Eurodollar Loans of such
Lender if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of,
such compensation and will not, in the sole opinion of such Lender, be
disadvantageous to such Lender (provided that such Lender shall have no
obligation to so designate an Applicable Lending Office located in the United
States of America). Each Lender will furnish the Company with a statement
setting forth the basis and amount of each request by such Lender for
compensation under this Section 6.01(a). If any Lender requests compensation
from the Company under this Section 6.01(a), the Company may, by notice to such
Lender through the Administrative Agent, suspend the obligation of such Lender
to make additional Eurodollar Loans to the Company until the Regulatory

                                       35

<PAGE>

Change giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the
provisions of Section 6.04 hereof shall be applicable).

     (b)  Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.01, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Lender
either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a
specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of
such Lender which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on
Eurodollar Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of
extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender which includes Eurodollar
Loans or (ii) becomes subject generally to restrictions on the amount of such a
category of liabilities or assets which it may hold, then, if such Lender so
elects by notice to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the
obligation of such Lender to make or continue, or to convert Base Rate Loans
into, Eurodollar Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the date such Lender
withdraws such notice or such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in which
case the provisions of Section 6.04 hereof shall be applicable).

     (c)  Determinations and allocations by any Lender for purposes of this
Section 6.01 of the effect of any Regulatory Change on its costs of maintaining
its obligations to make Loans or of making or maintaining Loans or on amounts
receivable by it in respect of Loans, and of the additional amounts required to
compensate such Lender in respect of any Additional Costs, shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.

     6.02 Limitation on Types of Loans. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, if, prior to the commencement of any Interest Period with
respect to any Eurodollar Loans:

          (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
     conclusive) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
     ascertaining the Eurodollar Base Rate for such Interest Period; or

          (b) the Majority Lenders determine (which determination shall be
     conclusive) and notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Base
     Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of
     making or maintaining such Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and each Lender
thereof, and so long as such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be
under no obligation to make Eurodollar Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans into
Eurodollar Loans and the Company shall, on the last day(s) of the then current
Interest Period(s) for the outstanding Eurodollar Loans, either prepay such
Loans or convert such Loans into Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section 3.02
hereof.

                                       36

     6.03 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its
Applicable Lending Office to (a) honor its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans
hereunder, or (b) maintain Eurodollar Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall
promptly notify the Company thereof through the Administrative Agent and such
Lender's obligation to make Eurodollar Loans hereunder shall be suspended until
such time as such Lender may again make and maintain Eurodollar Loans (in which
case the provisions of Section 6.04 hereof shall be applicable).

     6.04 Substitute Base Rate Loans. If the obligation of any Lender to make
Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 6.01, 6.02 or 6.03
hereof, all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Lender as Eurodollar
Loans shall be made instead as Base Rate Loans (and, if an event referred to in
Section 6.01(b) or 6.03 hereof has occurred and such Lender so requests by
notice to the Company with a copy to the Administrative Agent, each Eurodollar
Loan of such Lender then outstanding shall be automatically converted into a
Base Rate Loan on the date specified by such Lender in such notice) and, to the
extent that Eurodollar Loans are so made as (or converted into) Base Rate Loans,
all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to such Eurodollar
Loans shall be applied instead to such Base Rate Loans.

     6.05 Compensation. The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each Lender, upon the request of such Lender through the
Administrative Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the
reasonable opinion of such Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost or
expense incurred by it as a result of:

          (a) any payment, prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan made by
     such Lender on a date earlier than the last day of an Interest Period for
     such Loan; or

          (b) any failure by the Company to borrow a Eurodollar Loan to be made
     by such Lender on the date for such borrowing specified in the relevant
     notice of borrowing under Section 5.05 hereof;

such compensation to include, without limitation, an amount equal to the excess,
if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal
amount so paid, prepaid or converted or not borrowed for the period from the
date of such payment, prepayment or conversion or failure to borrow to the last
day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to
borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date
of such failure to borrow) at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan
provided for herein over (ii) the interest component (as reasonably determined
by such Lender) of the amount (as reasonably determined by such Lender) such
Lender would have bid in the London interbank market for Dollar deposits of
leading banks in amounts comparable to such principal amount and maturities
comparable to such period.

                                       37

     6.06 Additional Costs in Respect of Letters of Credit. If as a result of
any Regulatory Change there shall be imposed, modified or deemed applicable any
tax, reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against or with respect to
or measured by reference to Letters of Credit issued or to be issued hereunder
or participations therein, and the result shall be to increase the cost to any
Lender of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or any participation
therein, or reduce any amount receivable by any Lender hereunder in respect of
any Letter of Credit (which increase in cost, or reduction in amount receivable,
shall be the result of such Lender's reasonable allocation of the aggregate of
such increases or reductions resulting from such event), then, upon demand by
such Lender, the Company agrees to pay to such Lender, from time to time as
specified by such Lender, such additional amounts as shall be sufficient to
compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amount. A
statement as to such increased costs or reductions in amount incurred by such
Lender shall be submitted by such Lender to the Company and shall be conclusive
as to the amount thereof absent manifest error.

     6.07 Capital Adequacy. If any Lender shall determine that the adoption or
implementation of any applicable law, rule, regulation or treaty regarding
capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive
regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on capital of such Lender or any Person controlling
such Lender (a "Parent") as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a
level below that which such Lender (or its Parent) could have achieved but for
such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration its policies with
respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material,
then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy
to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay to such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.
A statement of any Lender claiming compensation under this Section and setting
forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. In determining such amount, such Lender may
use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

     Section 7. Conditions Precedent to all Loans and Letters of Credit.

     7.01 Loans and Letters of Credit. The obligation of each Lender to make any
Loan to be made by it hereunder, or to issue any Letter of Credit hereunder, is
subject to the conditions precedent that, as of the date of such Loan or such
issuance, and before and after giving effect thereto:

          (a) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and

<PAGE>

          (b) the representations and warranties made by each of the Company and
     its Subsidiaries in each Basic Document to which it is a party shall be
     true (or, in the case of Basic Documents which are not Financing Documents,
     true in all material respects) on and as of the date of the making of such
     Loan or such issuance, with the same force and effect as if made on and as
     of such date.

     Each notice of borrowing by the Company hereunder, or request for issuance
of a Letter of Credit, shall constitute a certification by the Company to the
effect set forth in the preceding sentence (both as of the date of such notice
and as of the date of such borrowing or issuance).

     Section 8. Representations and Warranties. The Company represents and
warrants to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent as follows:

laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation; (b) has all requisite corporate
power, and has all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals

assumption necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
misleading; provided that (i) although the management of the Company believed as
of the Effective Date that the Company Projections and the other projections
contained in the Offering Materials are reasonable, the Company makes no
representation as to their attainability, and (ii) it is understood that the
Offering Materials are not intended to, and do not, contain all the information
that would be contained in a prospectus prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

     (b)  Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a):

          (i)  The audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its
     Subsidiary as of September 30, 2001 and the related consolidated statements

         flows for the year then ended in conformity with generally accepted
         accounting principles.

         2002 and the results of their operations and cash flows for the nine
         months then ended.

                  (iii) The Company and its Subsidiaries did not on the date of
         the balance sheets referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above, and will
         not on the Effective Date, have any material contingent liabilities,
         material liabilities for taxes, unusual and material forward or
         long-term commitments or material unrealized or anticipated losses from
         any unfavorable commitments, except as referred to or reflected or
         provided for in said balance sheets.

         (c) The Company has disclosed to the Lenders in writing in or pursuant
to this Agreement and in the Offering Materials any and all facts (other than
general economic and industry conditions) which have or pose a material risk of
having a Material Adverse Effect.

come into existence which has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a Material
Adverse Effect.

         8.03 Litigation. There are no legal or arbitral proceedings or any
proceedings by or before any governmental or regulatory authority or agency, now
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which there is a reasonable possibility of
an adverse decision which could have a Material Adverse Effect.

         8.04 No Breach. None of the execution and delivery of the Basic
Documents, the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, or
compliance with the terms and provisions thereof did or will conflict with or
result in a breach of, or require any consent under, the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
applicable law or regulation, or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any
court or governmental authority or agency, or any Basic Document or other
material agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or by which

                                       40

<PAGE>

it is bound or to which it is subject, or constitute a default under any such
agreement or instrument, or (except for the Liens created pursuant to the
Security Documents) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of
the revenues or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
terms of any such agreement or instrument.

     8.05 Corporate Action. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under the Basic Documents to which it is a party; the execution,
delivery and performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of the Basic
Documents to which they are parties have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action; and this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Company and, on the Effective Date, each of the other Basic Documents to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party will constitute its
legal, valid and binding obligation, in each case enforceable in accordance with
its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or moratorium or other similar laws relating to the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles.

     8.06 Approvals. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has obtained all
authorizations, approvals and consents of, and has made all filings and
registrations with, any governmental or regulatory authority or agency and any
third party necessary for the execution, delivery or performance by it of any

thereof, except for filings and recordings of the Liens created pursuant to, or
permitted by, the Security Documents.

is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business
of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock

Federal Reserve System) and no part of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder will
be used to purchase or carry any such margin stock.

fulfilled their obligations under the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the
Code with respect to each Plan and are in compliance in all material respects
with the presently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code with respect to

                  (a) as soon as available and in any event within 90 days after

         Company's Subsidiaries, if aggregated and considered as a single

         specifically stated, that (i) the Company was not in compliance with
         any of the terms, covenants, provisions or conditions of this Agreement
         and (ii) the Company's calculation of the Receivables and Inventory
         included in the Borrowing Base as of the end of such fiscal year was

         such fiscal quarter), and the related consolidated balance sheet as at
         the end of such monthly accounting period (and such fiscal quarter),
         setting forth in each case in comparative form the corresponding
         figures from the Company's operating budget for such fiscal year, and
         accompanied, in each case, by (i) a statement of net sales, sales
         volume, gross margin and operating profit by product group, (ii) a
         certificate of a Senior Officer, which certificate shall state that

                  (c) as soon as available and in any event within (i) ten
         Business Days after the last day of each calendar month, (ii) if either
         (A) the most recently delivered Borrowing Base did not show that the
         Borrowing Base equaled or exceeded 150% of the Working Capital
         Commitments and the Majority Lenders have so requested or (B) a
         Remaining Availability Condition has occurred and is continuing, five

         assumptions on which such budget was prepared, stating that such
         officer has no reason to question the reasonableness of any material
         assumptions on which such budget was prepared and providing such other
         details as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, and (ii) as

         recent such report or update, an update prepared by an independent
         engineer satisfactory to the Administrative Agent of the reports

                  (m) from time to time such other information regarding the
         financial condition, operations, prospects or business of the Company
         as the Administrative Agent or any Lender through the Administrative
         Agent may reasonably request.

         The Company will furnish to each Lender, at the time it furnishes each
set of financial statements pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above, a
certificate of a Senior Officer (i) to the effect that, to the best of his
knowledge after due inquiry, no Default has occurred and is continuing (or, if
any Default has occurred and is continuing, describing the same in reasonable
detail) and (ii) setting forth in reasonable detail the computations necessary
to determine whether it was in compliance with Sections 9.08, 9.10 to 9.15,
inclusive, and 9.18 and 9.20 hereof as of the end of the respective monthly
accounting period, fiscal quarter or fiscal year.

         9.02 Taxes and Claims. The Company will pay and discharge, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to pay and discharge, all material taxes,
assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or upon its
income or profits, or upon any property belonging to it (including with respect
to the Mortgages on such properties), prior to the date on which penalties
attach thereto, and all lawful claims which, if unpaid, might become a Lien upon
the property of the Company or such Subsidiary, provided that neither the
Company nor such Subsidiary shall be required to pay any such tax, assessment,
charge, levy or claim the payment of which is being contested in good faith and
by proper proceedings if (x) it maintains adequate reserves with respect
thereto, (y) such contest, proceedings and reserves have been described in a
certificate of a Senior Officer delivered to the Lenders and (z) foreclosure or
realization upon any Lien on the property of the

                                       50

<PAGE>

         Company or such Subsidiary has not occurred and does not appear to be
         imminent.

                  9.03 Insurance. The Company will maintain, and will cause each
         of its Subsidiaries to maintain, insurance in responsible companies in
         such amounts and against such risks as is usually carried by owners of
         similar businesses and properties in the same general areas in which
         the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, provided that in any event
         the Company shall maintain insurance not less favorable than set forth
         in Schedule VIII.

                  Such insurance shall be written by financially responsible
         companies selected by the Company, having an A.M. Best rating of "A-"
         or better and in a financial size category of XV or larger, or by other
         companies acceptable to the Majority Lenders, and (other than workers'
         compensation) shall name the Administrative Agent as loss payee and/or
         as additional insured, as its interests may appear. Each policy
         referred to in this Section 9.03 shall include effective waivers by the
         insurer of all claims for insurance premiums against the Administrative
         Agent or any Lender, provide that all insurance proceeds in excess of
         $250,000 per claim which would otherwise be payable to the Company or
         any Subsidiary of the Company under any of the policies referred to in
         this Section 9.03 shall be adjusted with and payable to the
         Administrative Agent (for deposit in the Collateral Account maintained
         pursuant to the Security Documents and application in accordance with
         Section 3.02(b)(2)), provide that it will not be cancelled or reduced
         or amended except after not less than 30 days' written notice to the
         Administrative Agent and provide that the interests of the
         Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall not be invalidated by any
         act or negligence of the Company or any Person having an interest in
         the Plants nor by occupancy or use of the Plants for purposes more
         hazardous than permitted by such policy nor by any foreclosure or other
         proceedings relating to the Plants. The Company will advise the
         Administrative Agent promptly of any policy cancellation, reduction or
         amendment.

                  On the Closing Date the Company delivered to the
         Administrative Agent certificates of insurance satisfactory to the
         Administrative Agent evidencing the existence of all insurance required
         to be maintained by the Company hereunder and showing the termination
         or expiry date of such insurance. Thereafter, not later than five
         Business Days prior to the termination or expiry date of any such
         insurance the Company has delivered and shall deliver to the
         Administrative Agent certificates of insurance evidencing that such
         insurance has been renewed or replaced, subject only to the payment of
         premiums as they become due. The Company shall not obtain or carry
         separate insurance concurrent in form or contributing in the event of
         loss with that required by this Section unless the Administrative Agent
         is named as loss payee and insured therein, with loss payable as
         provided herein. The Company will immediately notify the Administrative
         Agent whenever any such separate insurance is obtained and shall
         deliver to the Administrative Agent the certificates evidencing the
         same.

                                       51

<PAGE>

         If, in the opinion of the Company, any of the insurance which it is
required to maintain pursuant to this Section is not available on commercially
reasonable terms, the Company shall so notify the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders and, with the consent of the Majority Lenders, may elect not to purchase
such insurance; provided that if the Company shall not have received notice of
disapproval from the Majority Lenders within 20 days of receipt by the Lenders
of such notice from the Company, the Lenders shall be deemed to have consented,
for the purposes of this Section, to the election not to purchase such
insurance.

         9.04 Maintenance of Existence; Conduct of Business. The Company will
preserve and maintain, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to preserve and
maintain, its corporate existence and all material rights, privileges and
franchises necessary or desirable in the normal conduct of its business, and
will conduct its business in a regular manner; provided that nothing herein
shall prevent the merger and dissolution of any Subsidiary of the Company into
the Company or a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary so long as the Company or such
Wholly-Owned Subsidiary is the surviving corporation.

         9.05 Maintenance of and Access to Properties. The Company will keep,
and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to keep, all of its properties necessary
in its business in good working order and condition (having regard to the
condition of such properties at the time such properties were acquired by the
Company or such Subsidiary), ordinary wear and tear excepted, and proper books
of record and account in which entries shall be made in conformity with GAAP of
all dealings and transactions in relation to its business activities, and will
permit representatives of the Lenders to inspect such properties and, upon
reasonable notice and at reasonable times, to examine and make extracts and
copies from the books and records of the Company and any such Subsidiary.

         9.06 Compliance with Applicable Laws. The Company will comply, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to comply, with the requirements of all
applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of any governmental body or
regulatory authority (including, without limitation, all Environmental Laws), a
breach of which would have a Material Adverse Effect, except where contested in
good faith and by proper proceedings.

         9.07 Litigation. The Company will promptly give to the Administrative
Agent (which shall promptly notify each Lender) notice in writing of (i) all
judgments against it or any of its Subsidiaries which individually exceed
$250,000 or in the aggregate exceed $500,000 and (ii) all litigation and of all
proceedings of which it is aware before any courts, arbitrators or governmental
or regulatory agencies affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except
litigation or proceedings which, if adversely determined, would not in the
reasonable opinion of the Company have a Material Adverse Effect.

         Indebtedness except: (i) Indebtedness to the Lenders under the
         Financing Documents, (ii) Indebtedness outstanding on the Effective
         Date and identified in Schedule VI hereto and any renewals, extensions
         or refinancings of Indebtedness in Part B of such Schedule, provided

         amount of such Indebtedness or of the collateral securing it, (iii)
         Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor to the Company in an aggregate
         principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed $10,000,000, so

         Administrative Agent, (iv) Indebtedness secured by Liens permitted by
         clause (ii) of Section 9.13, (v) Indebtedness under or in respect of

         Government of Canada in an aggregate principal amount at any time
         outstanding not to exceed $1,500,000, provided that (x) such
         Indebtedness is unsecured and contains no covenant or event of default
         the effect of which is to impose a restriction, limitation or
         obligation in favor of the lender not imposed in favor of the Lenders
         hereunder and (y) payments with respect to the principal thereof or
         interest thereon are not required prior to the fourth anniversary of
         the date of incurrence thereof, (viii) the Senior Notes, (ix)

Notes shall be and become automatically and immediately due and payable, without
notice (including, without limitation, notice of intent to accelerate),
presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by the Company.

         10.02 Collateral Account. The Company hereby agrees, in addition to the
provisions of Section 10.01 hereof, that upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, it shall, if requested by the
Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders, pay (and, in the case of any Event
of Default with respect to the Company referred to in clause (f) or (g) of
Section 10.01 hereof, forthwith, without any demand or the taking of any other
action by the Lenders, it shall automatically be obligated to pay) to the
Administrative Agent an amount in immediately available funds equal to the then
aggregate amount available for drawings under all Letters of Credit issued for
the account of the Company, which funds shall be held by the Administrative
Agent in the Collateral Account maintained by the Company pursuant to the
Security Documents, and be subject to investment and withdrawal only as provided
therein.

         Section 11. The Administrative Agent.

         11.01 Appointment, Powers and Immunities. Each Lender hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as its agent
hereunder and under the Letters of Credit and the other Basic Documents with
such powers as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the
terms hereof and thereof, together with such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent (which term as used in this Section
11 shall include reference to its affiliates and its and its affiliates'
officers, directors, employees and agents and to JPMorgan Chase acting in its
individual capacity hereunder as issuer of Letters of Credit): (a) shall have no
duties or

                                       64

<PAGE>

responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Letters
of Credit and the other Basic Documents, and shall not by reason of this
Agreement, the Letters of Credit or any other Basic Document be a trustee for
any Lender; (b) shall not be responsible to the Lenders for any recitals,
statements, representations or warranties contained in this Agreement, the
Letters of Credit or any other Basic Document, or in any certificate or other
document referred to or provided for in, or received by any of them under, this
Agreement, the Letters of Credit or any other Basic Document, or for the value,
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
Agreement, the Letters of Credit or any other Basic Document or any other
document referred to or provided for herein or therein or for any failure by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person to perform any of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder; (c) shall not be required to initiate or
conduct any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder or under any other
Basic Document except to the extent requested by the Majority Lenders, and (d)
shall not be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it
hereunder or under the Letters of Credit, any other Basic Document or any other
document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein or in
connection herewith or therewith, except for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Administrative Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and
shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. Without in any way
limiting any of the foregoing, each Lender acknowledges that the Administrative
Agent shall have no greater responsibility in the operation of Letters of Credit
than is specified in the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits
(1993 Revision), International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 500 (or any
replacement or revision thereof in effect from time to time).

         11.02 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall
be entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication
(including any thereof by telephone, telex, telegram or cable) believed by it to
be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the
proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel,
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent.
As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, the Letters of
Credit or any other Basic Document, the Administrative Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and
thereunder in accordance with instructions signed by the Majority Lenders and
such instructions of the Majority Lenders and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders.

         11.03 Defaults. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of the occurrence of a Default (other than the non-payment of
principal of or interest on Loans or Reimbursement Obligations) unless the
Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Company specifying
such Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event
that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a
Default, the

                                       65

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders (and shall
give each Lender prompt notice of each such non-payment). The Administrative
Agent shall (subject to Section 11.07 hereof) take such action with respect to
such Default as shall be directed by the Majority Lenders, provided that, unless
and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem
advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

         11.04 Rights as a Lender. With respect to its Working Capital
Commitments and the Loans made and Letter of Credit Liabilities held by it,
JPMorgan Chase in its capacity as a Lender hereunder shall have the same rights
and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it
were not acting as the Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders"
shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent
in its individual capacity. The Administrative Agent may (without having to
account therefor to any Lender) accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the
Company (and any of its Affiliates) as if it were not acting as the
Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may accept fees and other
consideration from the Company (in addition to the agency fees and arrangement
fees heretofore agreed to between the Company, the Administrative Agent for
services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to
account for the same to the Lenders.

         11.05 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the
Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 2.02(g), 12.03
or 12.04 hereof, but without limiting the obligations of the Company under said
Sections 2.02(g), 12.03 and 12.04), ratably in accordance with their respective
Working Capital Commitments, for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, the Letters of Credit or any other Basic Document or any
other documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including, without limitation, the
costs and expenses which the Company is obligated to pay under Sections 2.02(g),
12.03 and 12.04 hereof but excluding, unless a Default has occurred and is
continuing, normal administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance
of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or
thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable
for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified.

         11.06 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each
Lender agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and

                                       66

<PAGE>

information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the
Company and decision to enter into this Agreement and that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not
taking action under this Agreement, the Letters of Credit or any of the other
Basic Documents. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep itself
informed as to the performance or observance by the Company (other than
maintaining records of payments by the Company to it) or any other Person of
this Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents or any other document
referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or
books of the Company or any other Person. Except for notices, reports and other
documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by
the Administrative Agent hereunder, under the Letters of Credit or the other
Basic Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the Company or any
other Person (or any of their affiliates) which may come into the possession of
the Administrative Agent.

         11.07 Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required of the
Administrative Agent hereunder, under the Letters of Credit and under the other
Basic Documents, the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully justified
in failing or refusing to act hereunder and thereunder unless it shall receive
further assurances to its satisfaction by the Lenders of their indemnification
obligations under Section 11.05 hereof against any and all liability and expense
which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action.

         11.08 Resignation or Removal of Administrative Agent. Subject to the
appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided
below, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof
to the Lenders and the Company and the Administrative Agent may be removed at
any time with or without cause by the Majority Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to appoint a
successor Administrative Agent reasonably acceptable to the Company. If no
successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the
retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority
Lenders' removal of the retiring Administrative Agent (the "Notice Date"), then
the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a
successor Administrative Agent reasonably acceptable to the Company. Any
successor Administrative Agent shall be (i) a Lender or (ii) if no Lender has
accepted such appointment within 40 days after the Notice Date, a bank which has
an office in New York, New York with a combined capital and surplus of at least
$250,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,

                                       67

<PAGE>

privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation or removal
hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 11 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent.

         11.09 Collateral Sub-Agents. Each Lender by its execution and delivery
of this Agreement agrees, as contemplated by the Security Documents, that, in
the event it shall hold any Liquid Investments referred to therein, such Liquid
Investments shall be held in the name and under the control of such Lender and
such Lender shall hold such Liquid Investments as a collateral sub-agent for the
Administrative Agent thereunder.

         Section 12. Miscellaneous.

         12.01 Waiver. No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with
respect to, any right, power or privilege under any Basic Document shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
power or privilege thereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The remedies provided in
the Basic Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by
law.

         12.02 Notices. All notices and other communications provided for herein
(including, without limitation, any modifications of, or waivers or consents
under, this Agreement) shall be given or made by telex, telegraph, telecopy,
cable or other writing and telexed, telecopied, telegraphed, cabled, mailed or
delivered to the intended recipient at the "Address for Notices" specified below
its name on the signature pages hereof; or, as to any party, at such other
address as shall be designated by such party in a notice to the Company and the
Administrative Agent given in accordance with this Section 12.02. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, all such communications shall be deemed to
have been duly given when transmitted by telex or telecopier, delivered to the
telegraph or cable office or personally delivered or, in the case of a mailed
notice, upon receipt, in each case given or addressed as aforesaid.

         12.03 Expenses, Etc. The Company agrees to pay or reimburse each of the
Lenders and the Administrative Agent for paying: (a) the reasonable fees and
expenses of Davis Polk & Wardwell, special counsel to the Administrative Agent,
and special local counsel to the Administrative Agent in the States in which the
Mortgages are recorded in connection with (i) the preparation, execution and

Documents and the making of the Loans and issuance of Letters of Credit
hereunder and (ii) any modification, supplement or waiver of any of the terms of
this Agreement, the Letters of Credit or any other Basic Document; (b) if an

                                       68

Administrative Agent (including reasonable counsels' fees) incurred as a result
of such Event of Default and collection, enforcement, bankruptcy, insolvency and
other proceedings resulting therefrom; (c) all costs, expenses, taxes,

of title insurance procured with respect to the Liens created pursuant to the
Mortgages.

         12.04 Indemnification. The Company shall indemnify the Administrative
Agent, the Lenders and each affiliate thereof and their respective directors,
officers, employees, attorneys and agents from, and hold each of them harmless
against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims or damages to which any of them
may become subject, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims or damages arise
out of or result from (i) any actual or proposed use by the Company of the
proceeds of any extension of credit (whether a Loan or a Letter of Credit) by
any Lender hereunder or breach by the Company of this Agreement or any other
Basic Document, (ii) any Environmental Liabilities, (iii) any accident, injury
to or death of Persons or loss of or damage to property occurring in, on or
about any of the Plants or on any sidewalks, curbs, property or parking areas
adjoining the Plants, (iv) the performance of any labor or services or the
furnishing of any materials or other property in respect of any of the Plants,
or (v) any investigation, litigation or other proceeding (including any
threatened investigation or proceeding) relating to the foregoing, whether or
not the indemnified Person is a party thereto, and the Company shall reimburse
the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and each affiliate thereof and their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents, upon demand for any
expenses (including legal fees and fees of engineers, environmental consultants
and similar technical personnel) incurred in connection with any such
investigation or proceeding; but excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims,
damages or expenses incurred by reason of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Person to be indemnified or as a result of a successful suit
by the Company seeking to enforce its rights against such Person under the
Financing Documents.

         12.05 Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or the Notes or any other Financing Document, nor any consent to any
departure by the Company therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be agreed or consented to by the Majority Lenders and the Company,
and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, that no amendment,
waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Lenders, do any

Lenders or subject the Lenders to any additional obligations; (ii) reduce the
principal of, or interest on, any Loan, Reimbursement Obligation or fees
hereunder; (iii) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or

                                       69

<PAGE>

interest on, any Loan, Reimbursement Obligation or fee hereunder pursuant to
Sections 2.02, 2.04, 4.01 or 4.02 hereof; (iv) change the percentage of any of
the Working Capital Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
any of the Loans and Letter of Credit Liabilities, or the number of Lenders,
which shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action under
this Agreement; (v) change any provision contained in Sections 2.08, 6, 12.03 or

under this Agreement or any Note. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.05
to the contrary, no amendment, waiver or consent shall be made with respect to
Section 11 without the consent of the Administrative Agent.

         12.06 Successors and Assigns. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns except that the Company may not assign its rights or obligations
hereunder or under the Notes without the prior written consent of all of the
Lenders. Each Lender may assign any Loan or Loans or Letter of Credit
Liabilities or all or any part of its Working Capital Commitments (i) to any
affiliate thereof, (ii) to any other Lender, or (iii) with the consent of the
Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, to any
other bank or financial institution or fund; provided that any assignment shall
not be less than $2,000,000 or, if less, shall constitute an assignment of all
of such Lender's Working Capital Commitments, Loans and Letter of Credit
Liabilities. Upon execution by the assignor and the assignee of an instrument
pursuant to which the assignee assumes such rights and obligations, payment by
such assignee to such assignor of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed
between such assignor and such assignee and delivery to the Administrative Agent
and the Company of an executed copy of such instrument together with payment by
such assignee to the Administrative Agent of a processing fee of $2,500, such
assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment (unless otherwise provided
therein), the same rights and benefits as it would have if it were a Lender
hereunder and the assignor shall be, to the extent of such assignment (unless
otherwise provided therein) released from its obligations under this Agreement.
Upon the consummation of such assignment, the Company shall make appropriate
arrangements so that, if required, new Notes are issued to the assignor and the
assignee. If such assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United
States of America or a state thereof, it shall, prior to the date of the
applicable instrument of assumption, deliver to the Company and the
Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding
of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 5.08(f).
Each Lender may (without the consent of any other party to this Agreement) sell
participations in all or any part of any Loan or Loans made or Letter of Credit
Liabilities held by it to another bank or other entity, in which event the
participant shall not have any rights under this Agreement (except as provided
in the next succeeding sentence hereof), or in the case of a Loan, such Lender's
Note (the participant's rights against such Lender in respect of such
participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by

                                       70

<PAGE>

such Lender in favor of the participant relating thereto, which agreement shall
not give the participant the right to consent to any modification, amendment or
waiver other than one described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (vi) of Section
12.05 hereof). The Company agrees that each participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 5.07 and 6 with respect to its participation; provided that
no participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such
Sections than the transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in
respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender
to such participant had no such transfer occurred. Each Lender may furnish any
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries in the possession of
such Lender from time to time to assignees and participants (including
prospective assignees and participants) which have agreed in writing to be bound
by the provisions of Section 12.07 hereof. The Administrative Agent and the
Company may, for all purposes of this Agreement, treat any Lender as the holder
of any Note drawn to its order (and owner of the Loans evidenced thereby) until
written notice of assignment or other transfer shall have been received by them
from such Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any Lender may at
any time assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement, its Notes
and the other Financing Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment
shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations under the Financing
Documents.

          (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an
"SPC") of such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time
by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Company, the option
to provide to the Company all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender
would otherwise be obligated to make to the Company, provided that (i) nothing
herein shall constitute a commitment to make any Loan by any SPC and (ii) if an
SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any
part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan
pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall
utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if,
such Loan were made by the Granting Lender. Each party hereto agrees that no SPC
shall be liable for any payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would
otherwise be liable, for so long as, and to the extent, the related Granting
Lender makes such payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto
hereby agrees that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the
payment in full of all outstanding senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not
institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings
or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.
In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
12.06 any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of,
the Company or the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee
therefor, assign all or portion of its interests in any Loans to its Granting
Lender or to any financial institutions (if consented to by the Company and the
Administrative Agent)

                                       71

providing liquidity and/or credit facilities to or for the account of such SPC
to fund the Loans made by such SPC or to support the securities (if any) issued
by such SPC to fund such Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any
non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial
paper dealer or provider of a surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity
enhancement to such SPC.

         12.07 Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees to exercise all reasonable
efforts to keep confidential any information delivered or made available by the
Company to it which is clearly indicated to be confidential information;
provided that nothing herein shall prevent any Lender from disclosing such
information (i) to any other Lender, (ii) to its officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys and accountants who have a need to know such information in
accordance with customary banking practices and who receive such information
having been made aware of the restrictions set forth in this Section, (iii) upon
the order of any court or administrative agency, (iv) upon the request or demand
of any regulatory agency or authority having jurisdiction over such Lender, (v)
which has been publicly disclosed, (vi) to the extent reasonably required in
connection with any litigation to which the Administrative Agent, any Lender,
the Company or their respective affiliates may be a party, (vii) to the extent
reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder,
(viii) to such Lender's legal counsel and independent auditors, and (ix) to any
actual or proposed participant or assignee of all or part of its rights
hereunder which has agreed in writing to be bound by the provisions of this
Section 12.07.

         12.08 Survival. The obligations of the Company under Sections 2.02(g),
5.08, 6.01, 6.05, 6.06, 6.07, 12.03 and 12.04 hereof and the obligations of the
Lenders under Section 11.05 shall survive the repayment of the Loans and
Reimbursement Obligations and the termination of the Working Capital Commitments
and the Letters of Credit.

         12.09 Captions. The table of contents and the captions and section
headings appearing herein are included solely for convenience of reference and
are not intended to affect the interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement.

         12.10 Counterparts; Integration. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the
same instrument, and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by
signing any such counterpart. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior
agreements and understandings, oral and written, relating to the subject matter
hereof (except to the extent specific reference is made to any such agreement in
Section 2.04 hereof).

                              Environmental Matters


1.   Asbestos is present throughout the facilities located in Covington,
     Virginia ("Covington") and Terre Haute, Indiana ("Terre Haute").


2.   An open AST issue at Covington exists in regard to an abandoned, removed
     AST formerly used for "used machine lubrications" where ground
     contamination was detected and corrected. All DEQ notifications are in
     order.

3.   The Covington facility has three wastewater lagoons which are permitted by
     the VPDES. Phase II testing at and near the site of the lagoons indicates
     that there may be levels of 1,1-dichloroethene and heptachlor epoxide
     exceeding levels of state regulatory concern. This is monitored each time a
     permit is renewed. No EPA or DEQ monitoring or correction action has been
     mandated.

4.   The Covington facility is listed on CERCLIS with the notation "no further
     action". The Company is aware that two disposal sites used in connection
     with the Covington facility, Cyanokem, in Detroit, Michigan and Chem Met
     Services in Wyandotte, Michigan are listed on the Michigan State Priority
     List.

5.   There is a former on-site solid waste disposal area at Covington (not
     including the area to be retained by Hercules, Inc. known as the Hercules
     Industrial Landfill) located near the wastewater lagoon. Results of testing
     conducted at or near this area are described in no. 4 above.


6.   Approximately 2,400 gallons of no. 2 fuel oil were released as a result of
     the overfill of an aboveground fuel oil storage tank at Terre Haute.


7.   The facility located in Varennes, Quebec has conducted training at a "fire
     practice area" where small amounts of gasoline, no. 2 fuel oil and kerosene
     were ignited. It is possible that some of the petroleum compounds were
     spilled and/or spread on the soils in the area.

8.   The Company has received an information request with respect to the Solvent
     Recovery Services of New England Site in Southington, Connecticut. A
     predecessor entity has assumed responsibility for that notice.

9.   Covington air permit is pending Virginia DEQ approval. Terre Haute water
     and air permits are pending IDEM action.

10.  Terre Haute's pH levels have exceeded the pH parameters of its NPDES permit
     at times.




<PAGE>

11.  Written Notices have been received by:

     a. Terre Haute for exceeding drinking water lead and copper levels.
        (corrective action implemented and plan submitted to IDEM for approval).
        Awaiting IDEM feedback/approval of plan.

     b. Covington has received one "Warning Letter" from DEQ for not inspecting
        an abandoned A.S.T. (tank removed as corrective action), and not having
        two AST level gages at loading station for the 2 fuel oil tanks. (2 tank
        gages were installed).

     c. "Warning Letters" received from DEQ for missing data on V.P.D.E.S. DMR
        reports. Warning letter is the most minimal method of formal
        communication from DEQ. All corrections to data submitted. No pending
        action.

     d. Covington has received "Warning Letters" for vegetation control on lab
        methods under VPDES permit. Corrective actions taken. No pending
        actions.

12.  There are two underground fuel oil storage tanks at Terre Haute that have
     been "environmentally cleaned" and abandoned in place. Formal IDEM closure
     conducted.

13.  Threshold planning quantities of hazardous substances exist at Terre Haute
     and Covington such as VDC, sulfuric acid, MMA, etc. All are used for raw
     materials to processes.

     WHEREAS, this Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the "Agreement") relates
to the Credit Agreement dated as of April 7, 1994 and amended and restated as of
September 20, 2002 (as further amended from time to time, the "Credit
Agreement") among Applied Extrusion Technologies, Inc. (the "Borrower"), the
Lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent;

     WHEREAS, the Assignor proposes to assign to the Assignee all of the rights
of the Assignor under the Credit Agreement in respect of [a portion of] its

contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     Section 1. Definitions. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein
have the respective meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement.

     Section 2. Assignment. The Assignor hereby assigns and sells to the
Assignee all of the rights of the Assignor under the Credit Agreement to the

delivery hereof by the Assignor and the Assignee [and the execution of the
consent attached hereto by the Administrative Agent]/1/ and the payment of the
amounts specified in Section 3 required to be paid on the date hereof, (i) the
Assignee shall, to the extent of the Assigned Amount, have the rights and

provided in the Credit Agreement, the Assignor shall, to the extent of the

hereof in Federal funds the amount heretofore agreed between them./2/ Fees
accrued before the date hereof with respect to amounts assigned to the Assignee
hereunder are for the account of the Assignor and such fees accruing on and
after the date hereof with respect to such amounts are for the account of the
Assignee. Each of the Assignor and the Assignee agrees that if it receives any

without reliance on the Assignor, and based on such documents and information as

into this Agreement and will continue to be responsible for making its own
independent appraisal of the business, affairs and financial condition of the

     /2/ Amount should combine principal together with accrued interest and
breakage compensation, if any, to be paid by the Assignee, net of any portion of
any upfront fee to be paid by the Assignor to the Assignee. It may be preferable
in an appropriate case to specify these amounts generically or by formula rather
than as a fixed sum.

                               OPINION OF COUNSEL
                                 FOR THE COMPANY

                                                              September 20, 2002

To the Lenders and
the Administrative Agent
Referred to Below
c/o JPMorgan Chase Bank
270 Park Avenue
New York, New York 10017-2070

Dear Sirs:

     We have acted as counsel for Applied Extrusion Technologies, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Credit Agreement dated as of April 7, 1994 (the "Original
Agreement") and amended and restated as of September 20, 2002 (as so amended and
restated, the "Amended Agreement") among the Company, the lenders listed on the
signature pages thereof and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent. This
opinion is delivered pursuant to Section 13.01(e) of the Amended Agreement.
Terms defined in the Amended Agreement, including in the schedules and exhibits
thereto, and not otherwise defined herein are used herein as defined in the
Amended Agreement, including in such schedules and exhibits.

     We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to
our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public
officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of
fact and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this
opinion. As to questions of fact not independently verified by us, we have
relied, to the extent we deemed appropriate, upon representations and
certificates of officers of the Company, public officials and other appropriate
persons and on the representations as to matters of fact (not constituting
conclusions of law) set forth in the Amended Agreement.

     The opinions expressed herein are limited to matters governed by the
internal laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and the federal law of the United States
of America. We call your attention to the fact that each of the Amended
Agreement, the Pledge Agreement, the Security Agreement and the Subsidiary
Guaranty provide that they are to be construed in accordance with and governed
by the laws of the State of New York (the Pledge Agreement, the Security
Agreement, the Subsidiary Guaranty, the Mortgages and the Guarantor
Acknowledgment are collectively referred to herein as the "Security Documents").
We are of the opinion that a Massachusetts court or a

<PAGE>

federal court sitting in Massachusetts would, under conflict of laws principles
observed by the courts of Massachusetts, give effect to such provision. For
purposes of rendering the opinions expressed in paragraphs 4, 5 and 8 below, and
for purposes of rendering the opinions with respect to the Indenture in
paragraphs 2 and 3 below, we have assumed that New York law is in all respects
identical to Massachusetts law.

     Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

     1. Each of the Company and Applied Extrusion Technologies (Canada), Inc.
(the "Subsidiary Guarantor") is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
all requisite corporate power required to carry on its business as now conducted
as described in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2001 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     2. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Amended Agreement and
the Notes and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder and
under the Pledge Agreement, the Security Agreement (the Pledge Agreement and the
Security Agreement, together with the Amended Agreement and the Notes, the
"Company Documents") and the Mortgages to which it is a party (i) are within the
Company's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action, (ii) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with,
any governmental body, agency or official (except as contemplated by the
Security Documents) and (iii) do not contravene, or constitute a default under,
any provision of (a) Massachusetts or Federal law or regulation or of the DGCL,
(b) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or (c) the
Indenture dated as of June 14, 2001, as in effect on the date hereof (the
"Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National
Association, Trustee, relating to the Company's 103/4% Senior Notes due 2011.

     3. The execution and delivery by the Subsidiary Guarantor of the Guarantor
Acknowledgment and the performance by the Subsidiary Guarantor of its
obligations thereunder and under the Subsidiary Guaranty (the Subsidiary
Guaranty, together with the Guarantor Acknowledgment, the "Guarantor Documents",
and the Guarantor Documents together with the Company Documents, the "Credit
Documents") and the Mortgage to which it is a party (i) are within the
Subsidiary Guarantor's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, (ii) require no action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any governmental body, agency or official (except as contemplated
by the Security Documents), and (iii) do not contravene, or constitute a default
under, any provision of (a) Massachusetts or federal law or regulation or of the
DGCL, (b) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Subsidiary
Guarantor or (c) the Indenture.

     4. Subject to the qualifications appearing after the numbered paragraphs
hereof, the Company Documents constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of
the Company, in each case enforceable against the Company in accordance with
their terms.

                                        2

<PAGE>

     5. Subject to the qualifications appearing after the numbered paragraphs
hereof, the Guarantor Documents constitute legal, valid and binding obligations
of the Subsidiary Guarantor, enforceable against the Subsidiary Guarantor in
accordance with their terms.

     6. Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary Guarantor is an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
and, to our knowledge, is not, directly or indirectly, controlled by or acting
on behalf of any Person which is an "investment company", within the meaning of
said Act.

     7. Neither the Company nor the Subsidiary Guarantor is a "holding company",
or, to our knowledge, an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or a "subsidiary
company" of a "holding company", within the meaning of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

     8. The security interests created by the Security Agreement and the Pledge
Agreement secure the Secured Obligations (as defined in each of the Security
Agreement and the Pledge Agreement) in respect of all future Loans made by the
Lenders to, and all obligations with respect to Letters of Credit incurred by,
the Company under the Amended Agreement whether or not at the time such Loans
are made or obligations incurred an Event of Default or other event not within
the control of the Lenders has relieved or may relieve the Lenders from their
obligations to make such Loans or to perform under Letters of Credit.

     Our opinion that the Credit Documents to which the Company or the
Subsidiary Guarantor are party constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligations of such of the foregoing Persons as are party thereto, enforceable
against each such Person in accordance with their terms, is subject to (i)
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of
general application affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and secured
parties and (ii) general principles of equity, regardless of whether applied in
proceedings in equity or at law.

     The opinions expressed herein do not purport to cover, and we express no
opinion with respect to, the applicability of Section 548 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of state law.

     The opinions expressed herein are subject to the qualification that the
enforceability of provisions in the Credit Documents providing for
indemnification or contribution may be limited by public policy considerations.

     In addition, we express no opinion as to (i) the extent to which broadly
worded waivers may be enforced, (ii) the enforceability of any provision of the
Credit Documents which purports to grant the right of setoff to a purchaser of a
participation in the loans outstanding thereunder or which provides for interest
on interest or automatic compounding interest, or (iii) the extent to which
provisions providing for conclusive presumptions or determinations,
non-effectiveness of oral modifications, arbitration, submission to
jurisdiction, waiver of or consent to service of process and venue or waiver of
offset or defenses will be enforced.

                                        3

<PAGE>

     In addition, certain provisions contained in the Security Documents,
including the grant of powers of attorney thereunder, may be unenforceable in
whole or in part but the inclusion of such provisions in the Security Documents
does not affect the validity of any of the other provisions thereof, and the
remaining provisions of the Security Documents are sufficient for the practical
realization of the benefits intended to be provided thereby.

     We further express no opinion as to the existence of, or as to the title of
any Person who has granted a security interest in any collateral under the
Security Agreements (the "Collateral") to, any item of Collateral or as to the
priority or the perfection of any security interest in the Collateral. For
purposes of paragraph 8 above, we express no opinion with respect to security
interests of goods to the extent that a security interest is limited by Section
9-336 of Massachusetts Uniform Commercial Code or Article 9 of the Delaware
Uniform Commercial Code.

     This opinion is solely for the benefit of the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent in connection with the transactions provided for in or
contemplated by the Amended Agreement. It may not be otherwise distributed or
relied upon by any Person or quoted or reproduced, in whole or in part, in any
other document or filed with any government agency without our prior written
consent except that a copy of this opinion may be delivered to any participant
or assignee under the Amended Agreement.

                                  Very truly yours,


                                  Ropes & Gray

"Administrative Agent"), and have acted as special counsel for the
Administrative Agent for the purpose of rendering this opinion pursuant to
Section 13.01(f) of the Credit Agreement. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement,
including the schedules and exhibits thereto, and not otherwise defined herein
are used herein as therein defined in the Credit Agreement, including schedules
and exhibits.

     We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to
our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate and partnership records,
certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such
other investigations of fact and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable
for purposes of this opinion.

     Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, assuming that
the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement
are within the Company's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, the Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Company.

     In giving the foregoing opinion, we express no opinion as to (1) the effect
of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or comparable provisions of other
applicable law on the conclusions expressed above; (2) the effect (if any) of
any law of any jurisdiction (except the State of New York) in which any Lender
is located which limits the rate of interest that such Lender may charge or
collect; or (3) whether provisions of the Basic Documents which permit the
Administrative Agent, the Majority Lenders or any Lender to take action or make
determinations or to require payments under indemnity and similar provisions may
be subject to a requirement that such action be taken or such determinations be
made on a reasonable basis and in

good faith and that any action or omission to act in respect of which any such
payment is so required be reasonable and in good faith.

     We are members of the bar of the State of New York and we do not herein
express any opinion as to any matters governed by any laws other than the laws
of the State of New York.

This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon
by or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent.

         SECTION 2. Representations and Warranties

         (A) The Company has good and marketable title to all of the Collateral,
free and clear of any Liens other than the Permitted Liens.

         (B) The Company has not performed any acts which might prevent the
Administrative Agent from enforcing any of the terms of this Agreement or which
would limit the Administrative Agent in any such enforcement. Other than
financing statements or other similar or equivalent documents or instruments
with respect to the Security Interests and Permitted Liens, no financing
statement, mortgage, security agreement or similar or equivalent document or
instrument covering all or any part of the Collateral is on file or of record in
any jurisdiction in which such filing or

                                       5

<PAGE>

recording would be effective to perfect a Lien on such Collateral. No Collateral
is in the possession of any Person (other than the Company) asserting any claim
thereto or security interest therein, except that the Administrative Agent or
its designee may have possession of Collateral as contemplated hereby, other
than Collateral being repaired by third parties in the ordinary course of
business, Inventory in transit and Inventory held by warehousemen.

         (C) Not later than the date of the first borrowing under the Credit
Agreement, the Company shall deliver the Perfection Certificate to the
Administrative Agent. The information set forth therein shall be correct and
complete. Not later than 60 days following the date of the first borrowing, the
Company shall furnish to the Administrative Agent file search reports from each
filing office set forth in Schedule 7 to the Perfection Certificate or other
evidence satisfactory to the Majority Lenders acting through the Administrative
Agent confirming the filing information set forth in such Schedule.

         (D) The Security Interests constitute valid security interests under
the UCC securing the Secured Obligations. When UCC financing statements in the
form specified in the Perfection Certificate have been filed in the offices
specified in the Perfection Certificate, and this Agreement and any amendments
hereto in appropriate form have been filed in the office of the Secretary of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, with respect to any Rolling Stock, Leased
Rolling Stock or Rolling Stock Leases, the Security Interests shall constitute
perfected security interests in the Collateral (except Inventory in transit) to
the extent that a security interest therein may be perfected by filing pursuant
to the UCC and the Interstate Commerce Act, prior to all other Liens and rights
of others therein except for the Permitted Liens. When the Patent Security
Agreement and the Trademark Security Agreement have been filed with the United
States Patent and Trademark Office, the Security Interests shall constitute
perfected security interests in all right, title and interest of the Company in
Patents and Trademarks, prior to all other Liens and rights of others therein
except for the Permitted Liens. When a Copyright Security Agreement has been
filed with the United States Copyright Office, the Security Interests shall
constitute perfected security interests in all right, title and interest of the
Company in Copyrights, prior to all other Liens and rights of others therein
except for the Permitted Liens.

         (E) The Inventory and Equipment are insured in accordance with the
requirements of the Credit Agreement.

applicable requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended.

Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, and to secure the performance

Agreement, the Company hereby hypothecates, assigns by way of security,
transfers and grants to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the
Secured Parties a continuing security interest in and to all right, title and
interest of the Company in and to the

                  (9)  All right, title, claims and benefits now owned or
         hereafter acquired by the Company in and to any railcar leases,
         subleases, rental agreements and car hire contracts in which the
         Company shall at any time have any interest, and any right, title,
         claim and benefits of the Company now owned or hereafter acquired in
         and to any management agreement concerning all such leases and
         agreements (collectively, "Rolling Stock Leases"); and all right, title
         and interest of the Company in the railcars and equipment provided
         pursuant to any Rolling Stock Leases ("Leased Rolling Stock"); in each
         case, including, without limitation, all rights of the Company to
         receive and apply any Rolling Stock Revenues attributable to any Leased
         Rolling Stock or pursuant to any Rolling Stock Leases; and

         substitutions for, all or any of the Collateral described in Clauses 1
         through 10 hereof.

         (B) The Security Interests are granted as security only and shall not
subject the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to, or transfer or
in any way affect or modify, any obligation or liability of the Company with
respect to any of the Collateral or any transaction in connection therewith.

notice thereof and taken all steps reasonably requested by the Administrative
Agent to perfect the Security Interests contemplated hereby with respect to the
new location in question (including without limitation an opinion of counsel, if
so requested). The Company shall not in any event change the location of any
Collateral if such change would cause the Security Interests in such Collateral
to lapse or cease to be perfected.

         (II) The Company will not change its name, identity or corporate
structure in any manner unless it shall have given the Administrative Agent
prior notice thereof and taken all steps reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent to perfect the Security Interests contemplated hereby in
connection with such change (including without limitation an opinion of counsel,
if so requested).

         (B)  The Company will, from time to time, at its expense, execute,
deliver, file and record any statement, assignment, instrument, document,
agreement or other paper and take any other action (including, without
limitation, any filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, any
filings with the United States Copyright Office, any filings with the Interstate
Commerce Commission, any filings of financing or continuation statements under
the UCC and any filings in, or agreements governed by the laws of, any foreign
jurisdictions) that from time to time may be necessary or desirable, or that the
Administrative Agent may request, in order to create, preserve, upgrade in rank
(to the extent required hereby), perfect, confirm or validate the Security
Interests or to enable the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties to
obtain the full benefits of this Agreement, or to enable the Administrative
Agent to exercise and enforce, or facilitate the exercise and enforcement of,
any of its rights, powers and remedies hereunder with respect to any of the
Collateral. To the extent permitted by law, the Company hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent to execute and file financing statements or continuation
statements without the Company's signature appearing thereon. The Company agrees
that a carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement or of a
financing statement is sufficient as a financing statement. The Company shall
pay the costs of, or incidental to, any recording or filing of any financing or
continuation statements concerning the Collateral.

         (C)  If any Collateral is at any time in the possession or control of
any warehouseman, bailee or any of the Company's agents or processors, the
Company shall, upon the request of the Administrative Agent acting on the
instructions of the Majority Lenders, notify such warehouseman, bailee, agent or
processor of the Security Interests created hereby and instruct such Person to
hold all such Collateral for the Administrative Agent's account subject to the
Administrative Agent's instructions.

         (D) The Company shall keep full and accurate books and records relating
to the Collateral, and stamp or otherwise mark such books and records in such
manner as the Majority Lenders may reasonably request in order to reflect the
Security Interests.

         (E) The Company will immediately deliver and pledge each Instrument to
the Administrative Agent, appropriately endorsed to the Administrative Agent,
provided that so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Company may retain for collection in the ordinary course any
Instruments (other than checks and drafts constituting payments in respect of
Accounts, as to which the provisions of Section 5(B) shall apply) received by it
in the ordinary course of business and the Administrative Agent shall, promptly
upon request of the Company, make appropriate arrangements for making any other
Instrument pledged by the Company available to it for purposes of presentation,
collection or renewal (any such arrangement to be effected, to the extent deemed
appropriate to the Administrative Agent, against trust receipt or like
document).

         (F) The Company shall use its best efforts, subject to reasonable
business practices, to collect from its account debtors, as and when due, any
and all amounts owing under or on account of each Account (including, without
limitation, Accounts which are delinquent, such Accounts to be collected in
accordance with lawful collection procedures) and to apply forthwith upon
receipt thereof all such amounts as are so collected to the outstanding balance
of such Account. Unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and
the Administrative Agent is exercising its rights hereunder to collect Accounts,
the Company may allow in the ordinary course of business as adjustments to
amounts owing under its Accounts (i) an extension or renewal of the time or
times of payment, or settlement for less than the total unpaid balance, which
the Company finds appropriate in accordance with sound business judgment and
(ii) a refund or credit due as a result of returned or damaged merchandise, all
in accordance with the Company's ordinary course of business consistent with its
historical collection practices. The costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, attorney's fees) of collection, whether incurred by the Company or
the Administrative Agent, shall be borne by the Company.

         (G) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, upon the request of the Majority Lenders acting through the
Administrative Agent, the Company will promptly notify (and the Company hereby
authorizes the Administrative Agent so to notify) each account debtor in respect
of any Account or Instrument that such Collateral has been assigned to the
Administrative Agent hereunder, and that any payments due or to become due in
respect of such Collateral are to be made directly to the Administrative Agent
or its designee.

         (H) The Company shall, (i) as soon as practicable after the date
hereof, in the case of Equipment now owned constituting goods in which a
security interest is perfected by a notation on the certificate of title or
similar evidence of the ownership of such goods, and (ii) within 10 days of
acquiring any other similar Equipment, in each case, (a) having a value in
excess of $50,000 or (b) having a value in excess of $25,000, if the aggregate
of all such items owned by the Company at any time is greater than $100,000,
deliver to the Administrative Agent any and all certificates of

title, applications for title or similar evidence of ownership of such Equipment
and shall cause the Administrative Agent to be named as lienholder on any such
certificate of title or other evidence of ownership; provided that the foregoing
shall not apply to up to three automobiles owned by the Company unless the
Administrative Agent otherwise so requests. The Company shall not permit any
such items to become a fixture to real estate other than real estate described
in the Mortgages.

         (I) The Company shall as soon as practicable after the date hereof, at
its own cost and expense, cause to be plainly, distinctly, permanently and
conspicuously placed, fastened or painted upon each side of each item of Rolling
Stock a legend bearing such words as the Administrative Agent may request
indicating the Lien over and security interest in such Rolling Stock created
hereby in letters not less than one inch in height. The Company may permit the
Rolling Stock to be operated within the United States, but shall not permit the
Rolling Stock to be operated outside the boundaries of the continental United
States.

         (J) Without the prior written consent of the Majority Lenders, the
Company will not (a) sell, lease, exchange, assign or otherwise dispose of, or
grant any option with respect to, any Collateral except, subject to the rights
of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder if an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, as permitted under Section 9.12 of the
Credit Agreement and, in the case of any such disposition, the Security
Interests created hereby in such item (but not in any Proceeds arising from such
sale or exchange) shall cease immediately without any further action on the part
of the Administrative Agent; or (b) create, incur or suffer to exist any Lien
with respect to any Collateral, except for the Permitted Liens.

         (K) The Company will maintain insurance in accordance with Section 9.03
of the Credit Agreement.

         (L) The Company will, promptly upon request, provide to the
Administrative Agent all information and evidence it may reasonably request
concerning the Collateral, and in particular the Accounts, to enable the
Administrative Agent to enforce the provisions of this Agreement.

         (M) If the Company shall, either itself or through any agent, employee
or licensee, file an application for the registration of any Copyright with the
United States Copyright Office or any Patent or Trademark with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office, or with any similar office or agency in any other
country or any political subdivision thereof, not less than 30 days thereafter
it shall inform the Administrative Agent, and, upon request of the
Administrative Agent, execute and deliver any and all agreements, instruments,
documents and papers the Administrative Agent may request to evidence the
Security Interests in such Copyright, Patent or Trademark and the goodwill and
general intangibles of the Company relating thereto or represented thereby, and
the Company hereby constitutes the Administrative Agent its attorney-in-fact to
execute and file all such writings for the foregoing purposes, all acts of such
attorney being hereby ratified and confirmed; such power, being coupled with an
interest, shall be irrevocable until the Secured Obligations are paid in full.

                                       10

<PAGE>

         (N) If the Administrative Agent shall so request, based on its
determination that changed circumstances warrant such a request, the Company
shall, at its cost and expense, cause to be delivered to the Secured Parties an
opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as to such matters
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby as the Majority Lenders may
reasonably request.

         SECTION 5. Collateral Account

         (A) There is hereby established with the Administrative Agent a cash
collateral account (the "Collateral Account") in the name and under the control
of the Administrative Agent into which there shall be deposited from time to
time the cash proceeds of the Collateral required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (B) of this Section 5 or any other
provision of this Agreement, any other Security Document or the Credit
Agreement. Any income received by the Administrative Agent with respect to the
balance from time to time standing to the credit of the Collateral Account,
including any interest or capital gains on Liquid Investments, shall remain, or
be deposited, in the Collateral Account. All right, title and interest in and to
the cash amounts on deposit from time to time in the Collateral Account together
with any Liquid Investments from time to time made pursuant to subsection (D) of
this Section shall vest in the Administrative Agent, shall constitute part of
the Collateral hereunder and shall not constitute payment of the Secured
Obligations until applied thereto as hereinafter provided.

         (B) The Company shall instruct all account debtors and other Persons
obligated in respect of all Accounts to make all payments in respect of such
Accounts either (i) directly to the Administrative Agent (by instructing that
such payments be remitted to a post office box which shall be in the name and
under the control of the Administrative Agent) or (ii) to one or more other
banks in any state (other than Louisiana) in the United States (each a "Lockbox
Bank") (by instructing that such payments be remitted to a post office box which
shall be in the name and under the control of such Lockbox Bank) for deposit
into an account in the name and under the control of such Lockbox Bank (a
"Lockbox Account") under a Lockbox Letter substantially in the form of Exhibit G
hereto duly executed by the Company and such Lockbox Bank or under other
arrangements, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,
pursuant to which the Company shall have irrevocably instructed such Lockbox
Bank (and such Lockbox Bank shall have agreed) to remit all proceeds of such
payments directly to the Administrative Agent for deposit into the Collateral
Account or as the Administrative Agent may otherwise instruct such Lockbox Bank;
provided that on or prior to the 60th day after the Closing Date, account
debtors and other Persons obligated in respect of such Accounts shall be
permitted to make all payments in respect of such Accounts to one or more other
banks for deposit in an account in the name and control of Hercules
Incorporated, such payments to be remitted by Hercules Incorporated to the
Company. Unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Administrative Agent shall instruct such Lockbox Bank to remit
such proceeds to the Company or as the Company may otherwise so instruct such
Lockbox Bank. All such payments made to the Administrative Agent shall be
deposited in the Collateral Account. In addition to the foregoing, the Company
agrees that if the proceeds of any Collateral hereunder (including the payments
made in respect of Accounts) shall be received by

                                       11

<PAGE>

it, the Company shall as promptly as possible deposit such proceeds into a
Lockbox Account. Until so deposited, all such proceeds shall be held in trust by
the Company for and as the property of the Administrative Agent and the Secured
Parties and shall not be commingled with any other funds or property of the
Company.

         (C) The balance from time to time standing to the credit of the
Collateral Account shall, except (i) upon the occurrence and continuation of an
Event of Default or (ii) as provided by Section 3.02(b)(i)(2) of the Credit
Agreement, be distributed to the Company upon the order of the Company. If
immediately available cash on deposit in the Collateral Account is not
sufficient to make any distribution to the Company referred to in the previous
sentence of this Section 5(C), the Administrative Agent shall liquidate as
promptly as practicable Liquid Investments as required to obtain sufficient cash
to make such distribution and, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 5, such distribution shall not be made until such liquidation has taken
place. Upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, the
Administrative Agent shall, if so instructed by the Majority Lenders, apply or
cause to be applied (subject to collection) any or all of the balance from time
to time standing to the credit of the Collateral Account in the manner specified
in Section 9.

         (D) Amounts on deposit in the Collateral Account shall be invested and
re-invested from time to time in such Liquid Investments as the Company shall
determine, which Liquid Investments shall be held in the name and be under the
control of the Administrative Agent, provided that, if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall, if instructed by the
Majority Lenders, liquidate any such Liquid Investments and apply or cause to be
applied the proceeds thereof to the payment of the Secured Obligations in the
manner specified in Section 9. For this purpose, (i) each Liquid Investment
shall mature within 30 days after it is acquired by the Administrative Agent and
(ii) in order to provide the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the
Secured Parties, with a perfected security interest therein, each Liquid
Investment shall be either:

             (i)  evidenced by negotiable certificates or instruments, or if
         non-negotiable then issued in the name of the Administrative Agent,
         which (together with any appropriate instruments of transfer) are
         delivered to, and held by, the Administrative Agent or an agent thereof
         (which shall not be the Company or any of its Affiliates) in the State
         of New York; or

             (ii) in book-entry form and issued by the United States and subject
         to pledge under applicable state law and Treasury regulations and as to
         which (in the opinion of counsel to the Administrative Agent)
         appropriate measures shall have been taken for perfection of the
         Security Interests.

         SECTION 6. General Authority

         The Company hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent its
true and lawful attorney, with full power of substitution, in the name of the
Company, the Administrative Agent, the Secured Parties or otherwise, for the
sole use and benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties,
but at the Company's expense, to the extent permitted by law to exercise, at any
time and from time to time

                                       12

<PAGE>

while an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all or any of the
following powers with respect to all or any of the Collateral:

             (i)   to demand, sue for, collect, receive and give acquittance for
         any and all monies due or to become due thereon or by virtue thereof,
         including without limitation the endorsement of the Company's name on
         any checks, notes, acceptances, money orders, drafts or other forms of
         payment,

             (ii)  to settle, compromise, compound, prosecute or defend any
         action or proceeding with respect thereto,

             (iii) to sell, transfer, assign or otherwise deal in or with the
         same or the proceeds or avails thereof, as fully and effectually as if
         the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof, and

             (iv)  to extend the time of payment of any or all thereof and to
         make any allowance and other adjustments with reference thereto;

provided that the Administrative Agent shall give the Company not less than ten
days' prior written notice of the time and place of any sale or other intended
disposition of any of the Collateral, except any Collateral which is perishable
or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a
recognized market. The Company agrees that such notice constitutes "reasonable
notification" within the meaning of Section 9-504(3) of the UCC.

         SECTION 7. Remedies upon Event of Default

         (A) If any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Administrative Agent may exercise on behalf of the Secured Parties all rights of
a secured party under the UCC (to the extent permitted by law, whether or not in
effect in the jurisdiction where such rights are exercised) and, in addition,
the Administrative Agent may, without being required to give any notice, except
as herein provided or as may be required by mandatory provisions of law, (i)
withdraw all cash and Liquid Investments in the Collateral Account and apply
such monies, Liquid Investments and other cash, if any, then held by it as
Collateral as specified in Section 9 and (ii) if there shall be no such monies,
Liquid Investments or cash or if such monies, Liquid Investments or cash shall
be insufficient to pay all the Secured Obligations in full, sell the Collateral
or any part thereof at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for
future delivery, and at such price or prices as the Administrative Agent may
deem satisfactory so long as the sale is conducted in a commercially reasonable
manner. The Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may be the purchaser
of any or all of the Collateral so sold at any public sale (or, if the
Collateral is of a type customarily sold in a recognized market or is of a type
which is the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations, at any
private sale) and thereafter hold the same, absolutely, free from any right or
claim of whatsoever kind. The Company will execute and deliver such documents
and take such other action as the Administrative Agent deems necessary or
advisable in order that any such sale may be made in compliance with law. Upon
any such sale the Administrative Agent shall have the right to deliver, assign
and transfer to the purchaser thereof the Collateral so sold.

                                       13

<PAGE>

Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the Collateral so sold to it
absolutely, free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any
equity or right of redemption of the Company which may be waived, and the
Company, to the extent permitted by law, hereby specifically waives all rights
of redemption, stay or appraisal which it has or may have under any law now
existing or hereafter adopted. The notice (if any) of such sale required by
Section 6 shall (1) in case of a public sale, state the time and place fixed for
such sale, and (2) in the case of a private sale, state the day after which such
sale may be consummated. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or
times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the
Administrative Agent may fix in the notice of such sale. At any such sale the
Collateral may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the
Administrative Agent may determine. The Administrative Agent shall not be
obligated to make any such sale pursuant to any such notice. The Administrative
Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or
cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and
place fixed for the sale, and such sale may be made at any time or place to
which the same may be so adjourned. In case of any sale of all or any part of
the Collateral on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be
retained by the Administrative Agent until the selling price is paid by the
purchaser thereof, but the Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability in
case of the failure of such purchaser to take up and pay for the Collateral so
sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may again be sold upon
like notice. The Administrative Agent, instead of exercising the power of sale
herein conferred upon it, may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to
foreclose the Security Interests and sell the Collateral, or any portion
thereof, under a judgment or decree of a court or courts of competent
jurisdiction.

         (B) For the purpose of enforcing any and all rights and remedies under
this Agreement the Administrative Agent may (i) require the Company to, and the
Company agrees that it will, at its expense and upon the request of the
Administrative Agent, forthwith assemble all or any part of the Collateral as
directed by the Administrative Agent and make it available at a place designated
by the Administrative Agent which is, in its opinion, reasonably convenient to
the Administrative Agent and the Company, whether at the premises of the Company
or otherwise, (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, enter, with or
without process of law and without breach of the peace, any premise where any of
the Collateral is or may be located, and without charge or liability to it seize
and remove such Collateral from such premises, (iii) have access to and use the
Company's books and records relating to the Collateral and (iv) prior to the
disposition of the Collateral, store or transfer it without charge in or by
means of any storage or transportation facility owned or leased by the Company,
process, repair or recondition it or otherwise prepare it for disposition in any
manner and to the extent the Administrative Agent deems appropriate and, in
connection with such preparation and disposition, use without charge any
copyright, trademark, trade name, patent or technical process used by the
Company.

         (C) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing,

                                       14

<PAGE>

                  (i)   the Administrative Agent may license, or sublicense,
         whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or
         non-exclusive basis, any Copyrights, Patents or Trademarks included in
         the Collateral throughout the world for such term or terms, on such
         conditions and in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall in its
         sole discretion determine;

                  (ii)  the Administrative Agent may (without assuming any
         obligations or liability thereunder), at any time and from time to
         time, in its sole discretion, enforce (and shall have the exclusive
         right to enforce) against any licensee or sublicensee all rights and
         remedies of the Company in, to and under any Copyright Licenses, Patent
         Licenses or Trademark Licenses and take or refrain from taking any
         action under any thereof, and the Company hereby releases the
         Administrative Agent and each of the other Secured Parties from, and
         agrees to hold the Administrative Agent and each of the other Secured
         Parties free and harmless from and against any claims and expenses
         arising out of, any lawful action so taken or omitted to be taken with
         respect thereto; and

                  (iii) upon request by the Administrative Agent, the Company
         will execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a power of
         attorney, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative
         Agent, for the implementation of any lease, assignment, license,
         sublicense, grant of option, sale or other disposition of a Copyright,
         Patent or Trademark or any action related thereto. In the event of any
         such disposition pursuant to this Section, the Company shall supply its
         know-how and expertise relating to the manufacture and sale of the
         products bearing Trademarks or the products or services made or
         rendered in connection with Patents, and its customer lists and other
         records relating to such Patents or Trademarks and to the distribution
         of said products, to the Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 8. Limitation on Duty of Administrative Agent in
                    Respect of Collateral

         Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody thereof, the
Administrative Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral in its possession
or control or in the possession or control of any agent or bailee or any income
thereon or as to the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other
rights pertaining thereto. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have
exercised reasonable care in the custody of the Collateral in its possession if
the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which it
accords its own property, and shall not be liable or responsible for any loss or
damage to any of the Collateral, or for any diminution in the value thereof, by
reason of the act or omission of any warehouseman, carrier, forwarding agency,
consignee or other agent or bailee selected by the Administrative Agent in good
faith.

         SECTION 9. Application of Proceeds

         (A) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the proceeds of any sale of, or other realization upon, all or any part
of the Collateral

                                       15

<PAGE>

and any cash held in the Collateral Account shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent in the following order of priorities:

                         first, to payment of the expenses of such sale or other
                    realization, including reasonable compensation to the
                    Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and all
                    expenses, liabilities and advances incurred or made by the
                    Administrative Agent in connection therewith, and any other
                    unreimbursed expenses for which the Administrative Agent or
                    any other Secured Party is to be reimbursed pursuant to
                    Section 12.03 of the Credit Agreement or Section 13 hereof
                    and unpaid fees owing to the Administrative Agent under the
                    Credit Agreement;

                         second, to the ratable payment of accrued but unpaid
                    interest on the Secured Obligations;

                         third, to the ratable payment of unpaid principal of
                    the Secured Obligations;

                         fourth, to the ratable payment of all other Secured
                    Obligations, until all Secured Obligations shall have been
                    paid in full; and

                         finally, to payment to the Company or its successors or
                    assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct,
                    of any surplus then remaining from such proceeds.

     (B) The Administrative Agent may make distributions hereunder in cash or in
kind or, on a ratable basis, in any combination thereof. The Administrative
Agent shall invest all amounts to be applied to Letter of Credit Liabilities in
Liquid Investments selected by it and hold such amount in trust for application
to future drawings under the Letters of Credit notified to it by the issuing
Lenders in the order in which such drawings are made. If the Administrative
Agent holds any amounts which were distributable in respect of Letter of Credit
Liabilities after the Letters of Credit have expired and all amounts payable
with respect thereto have been paid, such amounts shall be applied in the order
set forth in subsection (A) above.

     (C) In making the determinations and allocations required by this Section,
the Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any of the Lenders for
actions taken in reliance on information supplied by the Lenders as to the
amounts of the Secured Obligations held by them. All distributions made by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall be final and the
Administrative Agent shall have no duty to inquire as to the application by the
Lenders of any amount distributed to them. However, if at any time the
Administrative Agent determines that an allocation or distribution previously
made pursuant to this Section was based on a mistake of fact (including, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, mistakes based on an assumption that
principal or interest has been paid by payments which are subsequently recovered
from the recipient thereof through the operation of any bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency or other laws or otherwise), the Administrative Agent
may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, adjust subsequent

                                       16

<PAGE>

allocations and distributions hereunder so that, on a cumulative basis, the
Secured Parties receive the distributions to which they would have been entitled
if such mistake of fact had not been made.

     SECTION 10. Assigned Agreements

     The Company hereby irrevocably authorizes and empowers the Administrative
Agent for and on behalf of the Secured Parties, in the Administrative Agent's
sole discretion, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to
assert, either directly or on behalf of the Company any claims the Company may
have, from time to time, against any other party to the Assigned Agreements or
to otherwise exercise any right or remedy of the Company under the Assigned
Agreements (including, without limitation, the right to enforce directly against
any party to an Assigned Agreement all of the Company's rights thereunder, to
make all demands and give all notices and make all requests required or
permitted to be made by the Company under the Assigned Agreements) as the
Administrative Agent may deem proper. The Company hereby irrevocably makes,
constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent (and all officers, employees
or agents designated by the Administrative Agent) as the Company's true and
lawful attorney-in-fact for the purpose of enabling the Administrative Agent, to
assert and collect such claims and to exercise such rights and remedies. The
Company shall keep the Administrative Agent informed of all material
circumstances bearing upon the right, title and interest of the Company under
the Assigned Agreements.

     SECTION 11. Concerning the Administrative Agent

     The provisions of Section 11 of the Credit Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of the Administrative Agent in respect of this Agreement and shall be
binding upon the parties to the Credit Agreement in such respect. In furtherance
and not in derogation of the rights, privileges and immunities of the
Administrative Agent therein set forth:

     (A) The Administrative Agent is authorized to take all such action as is
provided to be taken by it as Administrative Agent hereunder and all other
action reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided
for herein (including, without limitation, the timing and methods of realization
upon the Collateral) the Administrative Agent shall act or refrain from acting
in accordance with written instructions from the Majority Lenders or, in the
absence of such instructions, in accordance with its discretion.

     (B) The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the existence,
genuineness or value of any of the Collateral or for the validity, perfection,
priority or enforceability of the Security Interests in any of the Collateral,
whether impaired by operation of law or by reason of any action or omission to
act on its part hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall have no duty to
ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms of
this Agreement by the Company.

     SECTION 12. Appointment of Co-Administrative Agents

                                       17

<PAGE>

     At any time or times, in order to comply with any legal requirement in any
jurisdiction, the Administrative Agent may appoint another bank or trust company
or one or more other persons, either to act as co-agent or co-agents, jointly
with the Administrative Agent, or to act as separate agent or agents on behalf
of the Secured Parties with such power and authority as may be necessary for the
effectual operation of the provisions hereof and may be specified in the
instrument of appointment (which may, in the discretion of the Administrative
Agent, include provisions for the protection of such co-agent or separate agent
similar to the provisions of Section 11).

     SECTION 13. Expenses

     In the event that the Company fails to comply with the provisions of the
Credit Agreement or this Agreement, such that the value of any Collateral or the
validity, perfection, rank or value of any Security Interest is thereby
diminished or potentially diminished or put at risk, the Administrative Agent if
requested by the Majority Lenders may, but shall not be required to, effect such
compliance on behalf of the Company, and the Company shall reimburse the
Administrative Agent for the costs thereof on demand. All insurance expenses and
all expenses of protecting, storing, warehousing, appraising, insuring,
handling, maintaining and shipping the Collateral, any and all excise, property,
sales, and use taxes imposed by any state, federal, or local authority on any of
the Collateral, or in respect of periodic appraisals and inspections of the
Collateral to the extent the same may reasonably be requested by the Majority
Lenders acting through the Administrative Agent from time to time, or in respect
of the sale or other disposition thereof, shall be borne and paid by the
Company; and if the Company fails to promptly pay any portion thereof when due,
except, if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, with respect to
taxes which are being contested as permitted by Section 9.02 of the Credit
Agreement, the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may, at its
option, but shall not be required to, pay the same and charge the Company's
account therefor, and the Company agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent
or such Secured Party therefor on demand. All sums so paid or incurred by the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party for any of the foregoing and any
and all other sums for which the Company may become liable hereunder and all
costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees, legal expenses and court costs)
reasonably incurred by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in
enforcing or protecting the Security Interests or any of their rights or
remedies under this Agreement, shall, together with interest thereon for each
day until paid at the Post-Default Rate for such day, be additional Secured
Obligations hereunder.

     SECTION 14. Termination of Security Interests; Release of Collateral

     Upon the repayment in full of all Secured Obligations and the termination
of the Commitments and Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement, the
Security Interests shall terminate and all rights to the Collateral shall revert
to the Company. At any time and from time to time prior to such termination of
the Security Interests, the Administrative Agent may release all or any part of
the Collateral with the prior consent of the Majority Lenders; provided that if
any such release would constitute a release of all or substantially all of the
security for the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement or under
any Note, such release will require the consent

                                       18

<PAGE>

of all the Lenders. Upon any such termination of the Security Interests or
release of Collateral, the Administrative Agent will, at the expense of the
Company, execute and deliver to the Company such documents as the Company shall
reasonably request to evidence the termination of the Security Interests or the
release of such Collateral, as the case may be.

     SECTION 15. Notices

     All notices, approvals, requests, demands and other communications
hereunder shall be given in accordance with Section 12.02 of the Credit
Agreement.

     SECTION 16. Waivers, Non-Exclusive Remedies

     No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no
delay in exercising and no course of dealing with respect to, any right under
the Credit Agreement or this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor

                                     * * * *

         The Security Agreement creates and constitutes as security for the
Secured Obligations (as defined in the Security Agreement and including any
future obligations which are Secured Obligations), in favor of the
Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, a valid
security interest in all right, title and interest of the Company in the
Collateral and all right, title and interest of the Company in the Collateral
Accounts. The security interests of the Administrative Agent in all right, title
and interest of the Company in the Collateral created by the Security Agreement
constitute perfected security interests under the Uniform Commercial Code, as in
effect in the State of _______ ("UCC"), the Interstate Commerce Act ("ICA"), the
United States Copyright Act ("CA"), the United States Patent Act ("PA") and the
United States Trademark Act ("TA"), to the extent that a security interest
therein may be perfected under the UCC, the ICA, the CA, the PA or the TA.
Insofar as the priority thereof is governed by the UCC, the priority of the
security interests created by the Security Agreement in the Collateral in which
the Company has rights on the date hereof will be the same with respect to Loans
made or deemed made or Letters of Credit issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement
after the date hereof as with respect to any such Loans made, Letters of Credit
issued or obligations incurred on the date hereof, except to the extent that any
priority may be affected by any security interest, lien or other encumbrance
imposed by law in favor of any government or governmental authority or agency.
Unless otherwise specifically defined herein, each term defined herein has the
meaning assigned to such term in the Security Agreement.

         With respect to the enforceability of the Security Documents, we
express no opinion as to the availability of specific performance. Moreover, our
opinion with respect to the enforceability of the Security Documents is subject
to the further qualification that certain remedial provisions thereof may be
limited by the law of the State of _______ and applicable law of the United
States of America, but such laws do not, in our opinion, make the remedies
afforded thereby inadequate for the practical realization of the benefits of the
security intended to be provided thereby.

delivery of the Pledged Instruments and the certificates representing the
Pledged Stock to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 4 hereof,

Interests. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has

limit the Administrative Agent in any such enforcement.

located at the address specified below its name on the signature pages hereof.

     SECTION 3. The Security Interests

     In order to secure the full and punctual payment of the Secured Obligations
in accordance with the terms thereof, and to secure the performance of all the
obligations of the Company hereunder and under the Credit Agreement:

     (A) The Company hereby assigns and pledges to and with the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and grants to the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties security interests in the Pledged
Securities, and all of its rights and privileges with respect thereto, and all
proceeds, income and profits thereon, and all interest, dividends and other
payments and distributions with respect thereto (the "Collateral").
Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery hereof, the Company is
delivering the certificates representing the Pledged Instruments and the
certificates representing the Pledged Stock in pledge hereunder.

     (B) In the event that any Issuer at any time issues any additional or
substitute shares of capital stock of any class or any note, or owes any other
Indebtedness to the Company evidenced by an instrument, the Company will
immediately pledge and deposit with the Administrative Agent certificates
representing all such shares and such note or an instrument evidencing such
other Indebtedness as additional security for the Secured Obligations. All such
shares, notes and instruments constitute Pledged Securities and are subject to
all provisions of this Agreement.

     (C) The Security Interests are granted as security only and shall not
subject the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to, or transfer or
in any way affect or modify, any obligation or liability of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect to any of the Collateral or any transaction in
connection therewith.

     SECTION 4. Delivery of Pledged Securities

     All Pledged Instruments delivered to the Administrative Agent by the
Company pursuant hereto shall be endorsed in suitable form for transfer by
endorsement and delivery by the Administrative Agent, and accompanied by any
required transfer tax stamps, all in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent. All certificates representing Pledged Stock delivered to
the

                                        3

Administrative Agent by the Company pursuant hereto shall be in suitable form
for transfer by delivery, or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments
of transfer or assignment in blank, with signatures appropriately guaranteed,
and accompanied by any required transfer tax stamps, all in form and substance
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

     SECTION 5. Filing; Further Assurances

     (A) The Company agrees that it will, at its expense and in such manner and
form as the Administrative Agent may require, execute, deliver, file and record
any financing statement, specific assignment or other paper and take any other
action that the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary or desirable
in order to create, preserve, perfect or validate any Security Interest or to
enable the Administrative Agent to exercise and enforce its rights hereunder
with respect to any of the Collateral. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, the Company hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to execute and file,
in the name of the Company or otherwise, Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements (which may be carbon, photographic or other reproductions of this
Agreement or of a financing statement relating to this Agreement) which the
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may deem necessary or appropriate to
further perfect the Security Interests.

     (B) The Company agrees that it will not change (i) its name, identity or
corporate structure in any manner or (ii) the location of its chief executive
office unless it shall have given the Administrative Agent not more than four
months' nor less than 10 days' prior notice thereof.

     SECTION 6. Record Ownership of Pledged Stock.

     The Administrative Agent may at any time or from time to time during the
continuance of an Event of Default, in its sole discretion, cause any or all of
the Pledged Stock to be transferred of record into the name of the
Administrative Agent or its nominee. The Company will promptly give to the
Administrative Agent copies of any notices or other communications received by
it with respect to Pledged Stock registered in the name of the Company and the
Administrative Agent will promptly give to the Company copies of any notices and
communications received by the Administrative Agent with respect to Pledged
Stock registered in the name of the Administrative Agent or its nominee.

     SECTION 7. Right to Receive Distributions on Collateral.

     The Administrative Agent shall have the right to receive all dividends,
interest and other payments and distributions made upon or with respect to the
Collateral ("Collateral Distributions") other than cash dividends ("Cash
Dividends") and, during the continuance of any Event of Default, to receive Cash
Dividends and to retain all Collateral Distributions, in each case as Collateral
hereunder, and the Company shall take all such action as the Administrative
Agent may deem necessary or appropriate to give effect to such right. All
Collateral Distributions which are received by the Company shall be received in
trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties
and, if the Administrative Agent so directs during the

                                        4

<PAGE>

continuance of an Event of Default, shall be segregated from other funds of the
Company and shall, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent during the
continuance of an Event of Default, be paid over to the Administrative Agent as
Collateral in the same form as received (with any necessary endorsement, without
recourse). After all Events of Default have been cured, the Administrative
Agent's right to retain Collateral Distributions under this Section 7 shall
cease.

     SECTION 8. Right to Vote Pledged Stock.

     Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Company shall have the right, from time to time, to vote and to give consents,
ratifications and waivers with respect to the Pledged Stock, and the
Administrative Agent shall, upon receiving a written request from the Company
accompanied by a certificate signed by its principal financial officer stating
that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, deliver to the Company
or as specified in such request such proxies, powers of attorney, consents,
ratifications and waivers in respect of any of the Pledged Stock which is
registered in the name of the Administrative Agent or its nominee as shall be
specified in such request and be in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent.

     If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Administrative Agent shall have the right to the extent permitted by law, and
the Company shall take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate to
give effect to such right, to vote and to give consents, ratifications and
waivers, and take any other action with respect to any or all of the Pledged
Stock with the same force and effect as if the Administrative Agent were the
absolute and sole owner thereof.

     SECTION 9. General Authority

     The Company hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent its true
and lawful attorney, with full power of substitution, in the name of the
Company, the Administrative Agent, the Secured Parties or otherwise, for the
sole use and benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties,
but at the expense of the Company, to the extent permitted by law to exercise,
at any time and from time to time while an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, all or any of the following powers with respect to all or any of the
Collateral:

               (i)   to demand, sue for, collect, receive and give acquittance
          for any and all monies due or to become due upon or by virtue thereof,

               (ii)  to settle, compromise, compound, prosecute or defend any
          action or proceeding with respect thereto,

               (iii) to sell, transfer, assign or otherwise deal in or with the
          same or the proceeds or avails thereof, as fully and effectually as if
          the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof, and

               (iv)  to extend the time of payment of any or all thereof and to
          make any allowance and other adjustments with reference thereto;

                                        5

<PAGE>

provided that the Administrative Agent shall give the Company not less than ten
days' prior written notice of the time and place of any sale or other intended
disposition of any of the Collateral except any Collateral which threatens to
decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized
market. The Administrative Agent and the Company agree that such notice
constitutes "reasonable notification" within the meaning of Section 9-504(3) of
the Uniform Commercial Code.

     SECTION 10. Remedies upon Event of Default

     If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Administrative Agent may exercise on behalf of the Secured Parties all the
rights of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code (to the extent
permitted by law, whether or not in effect in the jurisdiction where such rights
are exercised) and, in addition, the Administrative Agent may, without being
required to give any notice, except as herein provided or as may be required by
law, (i) apply the cash, if any, then held by it as Collateral as specified in
Section 13 and (ii) if there shall be no such cash or if such cash shall be
insufficient to pay all the Secured Obligations in full, sell the Collateral or
any part thereof at public or private sale or at any broker's board or on any
securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery, and at such
price or prices as the Administrative Agent may deem satisfactory. The
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may be the purchaser of any or
all of the Collateral so sold at any public sale (or, if the Collateral is of a
type customarily sold in a recognized market or is of a type which is the
subject of widely distributed standard price quotations, at any private sale)
and thereafter hold the same, absolutely, free from any right or claim of
whatsoever kind.

     The Administrative Agent is authorized, in connection with any such sale,
if it deems it advisable so to do, (i) to restrict the prospective bidders on or
purchasers of any of the Pledged Securities to a limited number of sophisticated
investors who will represent and agree that they are purchasing for their own
account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale of any of
such Pledged Securities, (ii) to cause to be placed on any or all of the Pledged
Instruments and on certificates for any or all of the Pledged Stock or on any
other securities pledged hereunder a legend to the effect that such security has
not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be disposed of
in violation of the provisions of said Act, and (iii) to impose such other
limitations or conditions in connection with any such sale as the Administrative
Agent deems necessary or advisable in order to comply with said Act or any other
law. The Company covenants and agrees that it will execute and deliver such
documents and take such other action as the Administrative Agent deems necessary
or advisable in order that any such sale may be made in compliance with law.
Upon any such sale the Administrative Agent shall have the right to deliver,
assign and transfer to the purchaser thereof the Collateral so sold. Each
purchaser at any such sale shall hold the Collateral so sold absolutely and free
from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any equity or right of
redemption of the Company which may be waived, and the Company, to the extent
permitted by law, hereby specifically WAIVES all rights of redemption, stay or
appraisal which it has or may have under any law now existing or hereafter
adopted. The notice (if any) of such sale required by Section 9 shall (1) in
case of a public sale, state the time and place fixed for such sale, (2) in case
of sale at a broker's board or on a securities exchange,

                                        6

<PAGE>

state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on
which the Collateral, or the portion thereof so being sold, will first be
offered for sale at such board or exchange, and (3) in the case of a private
sale, state the day after which such sale may be consummated. Any such public
sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at
such place or places as the Administrative Agent may fix in the notice of such
sale. At any such sale the Collateral may be sold in one lot as an entirety or
in separate parcels, as the Administrative Agent may determine. The
Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any such sale pursuant to
any such notice. The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication,
adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time
to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for the sale, and such sale
may be made at any time or place to which the same may be so adjourned. In case
of any sale of all or any part of the Collateral on credit or for future
delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Administrative Agent
until the selling price is paid by the purchaser thereof, but the Administrative
Agent shall not incur any liability in case of the failure of such purchaser to
take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure,
such Collateral may again be sold upon like notice. The Administrative Agent,
instead of exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, may proceed by
a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose the Security Interests and sell
the Collateral, or any portion thereof, under a judgment or decree of a court or
courts of competent jurisdiction.

     SECTION 11. Expenses The Company agrees that it will forthwith upon demand
pay to the Administrative Agent:

               (i)  the amount of any taxes which the Administrative Agent may
          have been required to pay by reason of the Security Interests or to
          free any of the Collateral from any Lien thereon, and

               (ii) the amount of any and all out-of-pocket expenses, including
          the fees and disbursements of counsel and of any other experts
          employed to evaluate, protect or realize the value of the Collateral,
          which the Administrative Agent may incur in connection with (w) the
          administration or enforcement of this Agreement, including such
          expenses as are incurred to preserve the value of the Collateral and
          the validity, perfection, rank and value of any Security Interest, (x)
          the collection, sale or other disposition of any of the Collateral,
          (y) the exercise by the Administrative Agent of any of the rights
          conferred upon it hereunder or (z) any Default or Event of Default.

     Any such amount not paid on demand shall bear interest for each day until
paid at the Post-Default Rate for such day.

     SECTION 12. Limitation on Duty of Administrative Agent in Respect of
                 Collateral.

     Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody thereof, th
Administrative Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral in its possession
or control or in the possession or control of any agent or bailee or any income
thereon or

                                       7

<PAGE>

as to the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other rights
pertaining thereto. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have exercised
reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its
possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that
which it accords its own property, and shall not be liable or responsible for
any loss or damage to any of the Collateral, or for any diminution in the value
thereof, by reason of the act or omission of any agent or bailee selected by the
Administrative Agent in good faith.

     SECTION 13. Application of Proceeds

     (A) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
the proceeds of any sale of, or other realization upon, all or any part of the
Collateral and any cash held shall be applied by the Administrative Agent in the
following order of priorities:

               first, to payment of the expenses of such sale or other
          realization, including reasonable compensation to the Administrative
          Agent and its agents and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and
          advances incurred or made by the Administrative Agent in connection
          therewith, and any other unreimbursed expenses for which the
          Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party is to be reimbursed
          pursuant to Section 12.03 of the Credit Agreement or Section 11 hereof
          and unpaid fees owing to the Administrative Agent under the Credit
          Agreement;

               second, to the ratable payment of accrued but unpaid interest on
          the Secured Obligations;

               third, to the ratable payment of unpaid principal of the Secured
          Obligations;

               fourth, to the ratable payment of all other Secured Obligations,
          until all Secured Obligations shall have been paid in full; and

               finally, to payment to the Company or its successors or assigns,
          or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct, of any surplus
          then remaining from such proceeds.

     (B) The Administrative Agent may make distributions hereunder in cash or in
kind or, on a ratable basis, in any combination thereof. The Administrative
Agent shall invest all amounts to be applied to Letter of Credit Liabilities in
Liquid Investments selected by it and hold such amount in trust for application
to future drawings under the Letters of Credit notified to it by the issuing
Lenders in the order in which such drawings are made. If the Administrative
Agent holds any amounts which were distributable in respect of Letter of Credit
Liabilities after the Letters of Credit have expired and all amounts payable
with respect thereto have been paid, such amounts shall be applied in the order
set forth in subsection (A) above.

                                        8

<PAGE>

     (C) In making the determinations and allocations required by this Section,
the Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any of the Lenders for
actions taken in reliance on information supplied by the Lenders as to the
amounts of the Secured Obligations held by them. All distributions made by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall be final and the
Administrative Agent shall have no duty to inquire as to the application by the
Lenders of any amount distributed to them. However, if at any time the
Administrative Agent determines that an allocation or distribution previously
made pursuant to this Section was based on a mistake of fact (including, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, mistakes based on an assumption that
principal or interest has been paid by payments which are subsequently recovered
from the recipient thereof through the operation of any bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency or other laws or otherwise), the Administrative Agent
may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, adjust subsequent
allocations and distributions hereunder so that, on a cumulative basis, the
Secured Parties receive the distributions to which they would have been entitled
if such mistake of fact had not been made.

     SECTION 14. Concerning the Administrative Agent

     The provisions of Section 11 of the Credit Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of the Administrative Agent in respect of this Agreement and shall be
binding upon the parties to the Credit Agreement in such respect. In furtherance
and not in derogation of the rights, privileges and immunities of the
Administrative Agent therein set forth:

     (A) The Administrative Agent is authorized to take all such action as is
provided to be taken by it as Administrative Agent hereunder and all other
action reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided
for herein (including, without limitation, the timing and methods of realization
upon the Collateral), the Administrative Agent shall act or refrain from acting
in accordance with written instructions from the Majority Lenders or, in the
absence of such instructions, in accordance with its discretion.

     (B) The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the existence,
genuineness or value of any of the Collateral or for the validity, perfection,
priority or enforceability of the Security Interests in any of the Collateral,
whether impaired by operation of law or by reason of any action or omission to
act on its part hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall have no duty to
ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms of
this Agreement by the Company.

     SECTION 15. Appointment of Co-Administrative Agents

     At any time or times, in order to comply with any legal requirement in any
jurisdiction, the Administrative Agent may appoint another bank or trust company
or one or more other persons, either to act as co-administrative agent or
co-administrative agents, jointly with the Administrative Agent, or to act as
separate administrative agent or administrative agents on behalf of the Lenders
with such

                                        9

<PAGE>

power and authority as may be necessary for the effectual operation of the
provisions hereof and may be specified in the instrument of appointment (which
may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, include provisions for the
protection of such co-administrative agent or separate administrative agent
similar to the provisions of Section 14).

     SECTION 16. Termination of Security Interests; Release of Collateral

     Upon the repayment in full of all Secured Obligations and the termination
of the Commitments and Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement, the
Security Interests shall terminate and all rights to the Collateral shall revert
to the Company. At any time and from time to time prior to such termination of
the Security Interests, the Administrative Agent may release all or any part of
the Collateral with the prior consent of the Majority Lenders; provided that if
any such release would constitute a release of all or substantially all of the
security for the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement or under
any Note, such release will require the consent of all the Lenders. Upon any
such termination of the Security Interests or release of Collateral, the
Administrative Agent will, at the expense of the Company, execute and deliver to
the Company such documents as the Company shall reasonably request to evidence
the termination of the Security Interests or the release of such Collateral, as
the case may be.

     SECTION 17. Notices

     All notices, communications and distributions hereunder shall be given in
accordance with Section 12.02 of the Credit Agreement.

     SECTION 18. Waivers, Non-Exclusive Remedies

     No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no
delay in exercising and no course of dealing with respect to, any right under
this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise by the Administrative Agent of any right under the Credit
Agreement or this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right. The rights in this Agreement and the Credit
Agreement are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies provided by
law.

     SECTION 19. Successors and Assigns

     This Agreement is for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other
Secured Parties and their successors and assigns, and in the event of an
assignment of all or any of the Secured Obligations, the rights hereunder, to
the extent applicable to the indebtedness so assigned, may be transferred with
such indebtedness. This Agreement shall be binding on the Company and its
successors and assigns and the rights of the Company hereunder shall inure to
the benefit of the Company's successors and permitted assigns.

     SECTION 20. Changes in Writing

                                       10

<PAGE>

     Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived,
discharged or terminated orally, but only in writing signed by the Company and
the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Majority Lenders (or, in the
case of Section 16 and this Section, the Lenders).

     SECTION 21. NEW YORK LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

     THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY MANDATORY
PROVISIONS OF LAW AND EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT REMEDIES PROVIDED BY THE LAWS OF
ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN NEW YORK ARE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF SUCH
JURISDICTION. THE COMPANY HEREBY SUBMITS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND OF ANY
NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE COMPANY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING
OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT
ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM. EACH OF THE COMPANY AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

     SECTION 22. Severability

     If any provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) the other provisions hereof
shall remain in full force and effect in such jurisdiction and shall be
liberally construed in favor of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in
order to carry out the intentions of the parties hereto as nearly as may be
possible; and (ii) the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof in
any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

     SECTION 23. Counterparts

     This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument and any of the
parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart.

whereby the Guarantor shall guarantee the payment when due of all principal,
interest and other amounts that shall be at any time payable by the Company
under the Credit Agreement, the Security Documents; and

     WHEREAS, in order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to
enter into the Credit Agreement, the Guarantor is willing to guarantee the
obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement and the Security
Documents;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Guarantor agrees as follows:

     SECTION 1. Definitions. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement and not
otherwise defined herein have, as used herein, the respective meanings provided
for therein.

     SECTION 2. Representations and Warranties. The Guarantor represents that:

          (a) The Guarantor (i) is a corporation duly organized, validly
     existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
     incorporation; (ii) has all requisite corporate power, and has all material
     governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals necessary to
     own its assets and carry on

<PAGE>

     its business as now being or as proposed to be conducted, except in the
     case of such licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals, where the
     failure to obtain them would not have a material adverse effect on its
     condition (financial or otherwise), assets, nature of assets, liabilities
     (including without limitation, tax, ERISA and Environmental Liabilities) or
     prospects; and (iii) is qualified to do business in all jurisdictions in
     which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification
     necessary and where failure so to qualify would have a material adverse
     effect on its condition (financial or otherwise), assets, nature of assets,
     liabilities (including, without limitation, tax, ERISA and environmental
     liabilities) or prospects.

          (b) The Guarantor has all necessary corporate power and authority to
     execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Subsidiary
     Guaranty; the execution, delivery and performance by the Guarantor of this
     Subsidiary Guaranty has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
     action; and this Subsidiary Guaranty has been duly and validly executed and
     delivered by the Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
     obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
     except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
     insolvency, reorganization or moratorium or other similar laws relating to
     the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable
     principles.

          (c) Neither the execution and delivery by the Guarantor of the Basic
     Documents to which it is party nor compliance with the terms and provisions
     thereof by the Guarantor will conflict with or result in a breach of, or
     require any consent under, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
     the Guarantor or any applicable law or regulation, or any order, writ,
     injunction or decree of any court or governmental authority or agency, or
     any Basic Document or other material agreement or instrument to which the
     Guarantor is a party or by which it is bound or to which it is subject, or
     constitute a default under any such agreement or instrument, or (except for
     the Liens created pursuant to, or permitted by, the Security Documents)
     result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the revenues
     or assets of the Guarantor pursuant to the terms of any such agreement or
     instrument.

          (d) There are no legal or arbitral proceedings or any proceedings by
     or before any governmental or regulatory authority or agency, now pending
     or, to the knowledge of the Guarantor, threatened against or affecting the
     Guarantor in which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision
     which could have a material adverse effect on its condition (financial or
     otherwise), assets, nature of assets, liabilities (including, without
     limitation, tax, ERISA and Environmental Liabilities) or prospects.

          (e) The Guarantor has obtained all authorizations, approvals and
     consents of, and has made all filings and registrations with, any
     governmental or regulatory authority or agency and any third party
     necessary for the consummation of the Acquisition and the execution,
     delivery or performance by it of any Basic Document to which it is a party,
     or for the validity or

                                        2

<PAGE>

     enforceability thereof, except for filing and recordings of the Liens
     created pursuant to, or permitted by, the Security Documents.

     SECTION 3. The Guaranty. The Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees
the full and punctual payment (whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or
otherwise) of the principal of and interest on each Note issued by the Company
pursuant to, and each Reimbursement Obligation of the Company under, the Credit
Agreement, and the full and punctual payment of all other amounts payable by the
Company under the Credit Agreement and the Security Documents. Upon failure by
the Company to pay punctually any such amount, the Guarantor agrees that it
shall forthwith on demand pay the amount not so paid at the place and in the
manner specified in the Credit Agreement or the relevant Security Document, as
the case may be.

     SECTION 4. Guaranty Unconditional. The obligations of the Guarantor
hereunder shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise
affected by:

          (i)   any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or
     release in respect of any obligation of the Company under the Credit
     Agreement, any Note or any Security Document, or any obligation of the
     Guarantor hereunder or under any Security Document, by operation of law or
     otherwise;

          (ii)  any modification or amendment of or supplement to the Credit
     Agreement, any Note or any Security Document;

          (iii) any release, non-perfection or invalidity of any direct or
     indirect security for any obligation of the Company under the Credit
     Agreement, any Note or any Security Document or any obligation of the
     Guarantor hereunder or under any Security Document;

          (iv)  any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of
     the Company, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
     proceeding affecting the Company or its assets or any resulting release or
     discharge of any obligation of the Company contained in the Credit
     Agreement, any Note of any Security Document;

          (v)   the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which the
     Guarantor may have at any time against the Company, the Administrative
     Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or
     any unrelated transactions, provided that nothing herein shall prevent the
     assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;

          (vi)  any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against the
     Company for any reason of the Credit Agreement, any Note or any Security
     Document, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to
     prohibit the payment by the Company of the principal of or interest on any
     Note or any other amount payable by the Company under the Credit Agreement
     or any Security Document; or

                                        3

<PAGE>

          (vii) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the
     Company, the Guarantor, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other
     Person or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the
     provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of
     the Guarantor's obligations hereunder.

     SECTION 5.  Discharge Only Upon Payment In Full; Reinstatement In Certain
Circumstances. The Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall remain in full force
and effect until the principal of and interest on the Notes and all other
amounts payable by the Company under the Credit Agreement and the Security
Documents shall have been paid in full and the Commitments and Letters of Credit
under the Credit Agreement shall have terminated or expired. If at any time any
payment of the principal of or interest on any Note or any other amount payable
by the Company under the Credit Agreement or any Security Document is rescinded
or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of the Company or otherwise, the Guarantor's obligations
hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated as though such
payment had been due but not made at such time.

     SECTION 6.  Waiver by the Guarantor. The Guarantor waives acceptance
hereof, presentment, demand, protest and, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any
time any action be taken by any Person against the Company, the Guarantor
hereunder, or any other Person.

     SECTION 7.  Waiver of Subrogation. The Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives
any right or claim of exoneration, reimbursement, subrogation, contribution or
indemnity and any other similar right or claim arising out of any payment by the
Guarantor hereunder.

     SECTION 8.  Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment
of any amount payable by the Company under the Credit Agreement or any Note is
stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, all
such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit
Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor hereunder forthwith on
demand by the Administrative Agent made at the request of the Majority Lenders.

     SECTION 9.  Limitation on Guarantor's Obligations. The obligations of the
Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest
amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance
under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable provisions of
comparable state law. The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall rank pari
passu.

     SECTION 10. Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be given or made by telex, telegraph, telecopy, cable or
other writing and telexed, telecopied, telegraphed, cabled, mailed or delivered
to the intended recipient at its address or telex or facsimile transmission
number set forth on the signature page hereof or such other address or telex or
telecopy number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to
the Administrative Agent.

                                        4

<PAGE>

Except as otherwise provided in this Subsidiary Guaranty, all such
communications shall be deemed to have been duly given when transmitted by telex
or telecopier, delivered to the telegraph or cable office or personally
delivered or, in the case of a mailed notice, upon receipt, in each case given
or addressed as aforesaid.

     SECTION 11. No Waivers. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or
any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege. The rights and remedies provided in this Subsidiary Guaranty, the
Credit Agreement and the Security Documents shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

     SECTION 12. Successors and Assigns. This Subsidiary Guaranty is for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective
successors and assigns and in the event of an assignment of the Loans or other
amounts payable under the Credit Agreement or the Security Documents, the rights
hereunder, to the extent applicable to the indebtedness so assigned, may be
transferred with such indebtedness. This Subsidiary Guaranty shall be binding
upon the Guarantor and its successors and assigns.

     SECTION 13. Changes in Writing. Neither this Subsidiary Guaranty nor any
provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but
only in writing signed by the Guarantor and the Administrative Agent with the
consent of the Majority Lenders.

     SECTION 14. GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY
TRIAL. THIS SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. THE GUARANTOR HEREBY SUBMITS TO THE
NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND OF ANY NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY
FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE GUARANTOR
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH
IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING
BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A
COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. THE GUARANTOR HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

                                        5
