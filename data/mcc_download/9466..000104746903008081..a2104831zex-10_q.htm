<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,

of the Company's Generation Group on the terms and conditions herein set forth, for a period commencing on January&nbsp;2, 2002 and expiring on December&nbsp;31, 2004 (the "Term"). Executive's
duties and responsibilities shall be determined by Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") consistent with Executive's qualifications and the best interests of Company. Executive also shall perform

affairs of Company on a full-time basis during normal business hours, and as reasonably required, outside normal business hours, and shall not be engaged in any other business activity,
regardless of whether such business activity is pursued for gain, profit or other pecuniary advantage, unless the CEO otherwise consents in writing; but this shall not be construed as preventing
Executive from investing his assets in such form or manner as will not require any services on the part of the Executive in the operation of the affairs of the companies in which such investments are
made and will not otherwise conflict with the provisions of this Agreement. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incentive Plan.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the term of this Agreement, Executive shall be eligible to participate in Company's
annual incentive plan for executives, which shall have a target performance bonus totaling up to an additional one hundred percent (100%) of Base Salary for the first year of this Agreement based on
achieving reasonably attainable individual and overall Company performance goals. For the first year of this Agreement, the maximum performance bonus of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) will

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-Term Incentive.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to June&nbsp;30, 2002, Company expects to adopt a new
long-term incentive plan for officers. Assuming such a plan is adopted, Executive will receive a participation valued at Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), with such value to be determined
on the same basis as for other senior executives. In the event a new long-term incentive plan has not been implemented by June&nbsp;30, 2002, Executive will be granted "phantom" stock
options with a strike price of the fair market value of Company's stock on June&nbsp;30, 2002, and/or other equity-linked instruments, valued at Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). Executive's
participation in the long-term incentive plan or ownership of the phantom stock options (or other equity-linked instruments) will vest ratably over the Initial Term of this Agreement,
commencing retroactively to January&nbsp;2, 2002. In the event of a "termination without cause" or a "resignation for good reason" provided by subparagraphs 7(d) and 7(e) of this Agreement,
Executive will be deemed fully vested in the long-term incentive plan or ownership of the phantom stock options (or other equity-linked instruments). </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Executive Supplemental Plan.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of calculating Executive's benefit under the Senior
Executive Supplemental Plan, Company will credit Executive with seven (7)&nbsp;years of vesting service immediately upon hire. Under this plan, Executive will earn five and one-half
percent (5.5%) of average annual base pay plus average annual incentive for each year of service, to a maximum of fifty-five percent (55%) of pay. Retirement eligibility under the Plan is
age fifty-five (55)&nbsp;with ten (10)&nbsp;years' service, or age sixty-two (62)&nbsp;with five (5)&nbsp;years' service, and therefore Executive would be eligible to
retire after three (3)&nbsp;years of service with a benefit of sixteen and one-half percent (16.5%) of pay. </FONT></P>

Executive's right to terminate employment for Good Reason shall not be affected by the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness. The Executive's continued employment

to the provisions of paragraph&nbsp;(c) of this Section&nbsp;6, all determinations required to be made under this Section&nbsp;6, including whether and
when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by one of the
major internationally recognized certified public accounting firms (commonly referred to, as of the date hereof, as a Big Four firm) designated by the Executive and approved by the Company (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) (the "Accounting Firm"), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within fifteen (15)&nbsp;business

shall not be unreasonably withheld) to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five (5)&nbsp;days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. Any determination by the Accounting
Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the
Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment") consistent with the calculations
required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;(c) of this Section&nbsp;6 and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment
of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the
