Section 2(a) of the Agreement shall be $12,000,000.

         3. Subsequent Note. The term "Subsequent Note," defined in Section 2(f)
of the Agreement, shall hereafter mean a secured promissory note for a principal
amount  equal to a  Subsequent  Draw Down  Amount  substantially  in the form of
Exhibit E to the  Agreement  or  substantially  in the form of Exhibit A to this
Amendment.  The  parties  acknowledge  that upon  execution  of this  Amendment,
Subsidiary shall issue a secured  subordinated  promissory note substantially in

whether before or after an event of default thereunder.
