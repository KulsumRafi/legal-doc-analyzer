<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Amount  </B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum aggregate amount outstanding under the facility at any time (calculated on the basis of cleared funds) shall not exceed US$3,000,000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Availability  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank's present intention is to make the facility available until 31<SUP>st</SUP>December&nbsp;2003 and all moneys from time to time owing to the Bank
under the facility shall be repaid no later than this date or such later date as may from time to time be advised in writing by the Bank. The Bank may, nevertheless, terminate the facility at any time
and may at such time or at any time thereafter demand immediate payment of all amounts owing under or in connection with the facility. The amounts owing at to any time may include interest costs or

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

period of availability. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amounts
outstanding in connection with the foreign exchange facility, the indemnity line, the negotiations facility, the TravelLink facility and the Lloyds Auto Dealing facility may be

currency other than sterling shall be notionally converted into sterling on the date of the proposed utilization on the basis of the rate at which the Bank would sell the relevant currency for
sterling at that time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
upon termination of the overdraft facility (or earlier cancellation of any of these additional facilities) there are any foreign exchange contracts outstanding or any contingent

completed. </FONT></DD></DL>

such conversion advise the sterling amount then owing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Bank may debit any amount owing in connection with these additional facilities to your account with the Bank whether or not that would cause the account to become overdrawn or the
agreed overdraft limit on the account to be breached. </FONT></P>
