outstanding and such deemed use of the aggregate amount of such Commitments
shall be applied to all the Lenders ratably according to their respective
Commitments (such deemed use of the aggregate amount of the Commitments being a
"B REDUCTION"). Each A Borrowing consisting of Revolving A Advances shall be in
an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 in the case of an A Borrowing comprised of
Base Rate Advances and $25,000,000 in the case of an A Borrowing comprised of
Eurodollar Rate Advances, or, in either case an integral multiple of $1,000,000
in excess thereof (or, in the case of an A Borrowing of Base Rate Advances, the
aggregate unused Commitments, if less) and shall consist of A Advances of the
same Type made on the same day by the Lenders ratably according to their
respective Commitments. Within the limits of each Lender's Commitment, the
Borrower may make more than one Borrowing on any Business Day and may borrow,
prepay pursuant to Section 2.10, and reborrow under this Section 2.01(a).

         (b)      Term A Advances. Each Lender severally agrees, at the option
of the Borrower and on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to
make an A Advance to the Borrower on the Stated Termination Date in an aggregate
amount up to but not exceeding the amount of its Commitment. Each A Borrowing
consisting of Term A Advances shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 in
the case of an A Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Advances and $25,000,000 in
the case of an A Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, or, in either
case an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall consist of A
Advances of the same Type made on the Stated Termination Date by the Lenders
ratably according to their respective Commitments.

         SECTION 2.02.     Making the A Advances.

         (a)      Each A Borrowing shall be made on notice by the Borrower to
the Administrative Agent (a "NOTICE OF A BORROWING") received by the
Administrative Agent, (i) in the case of a proposed A Borrowing comprised of
Base Rate Advances, not later than

                                       22
<PAGE>
10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Business Day of such proposed A
Borrowing, and (ii) in the case of a proposed A Borrowing comprised of
Eurodollar Rate Advances, not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the
third Business Day prior to the date of such proposed A Borrowing. Each Notice
of A Borrowing shall be by telecopy, telefax or other teletransmission or by
telephone (and if by telephone, confirmed promptly by telecopier, telefax or
other teletransmission), in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto,
specifying therein the requested (w) date of such A Borrowing, (x) Type of A
Advances comprising such A Borrowing and, additionally, whether such A Borrowing
consists of Revolving A Advances or Term A Advances, (y) aggregate amount of
such A Borrowing, and (z) in the case of an A Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar
Rate Advances, the initial Interest Period for each such A Advance. Each Lender
shall, before 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of such A Borrowing,
make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the
Administrative Agent in care of JPMorgan Chase Bank, Agency Services, One Chase
Manhattan Plaza, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10081, Attention: Muniram Appanna,
Reference: Burlington Resources Inc., or at such other location designated by
notice from the Administrative Agent to the Lenders pursuant to Section 8.02, in
same day funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such A Borrowing. Immediately
after the Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of
the applicable conditions set forth in Article 3, the Administrative Agent will
make such funds available to the Borrower at JPMorgan Chase Bank, One Chase
Manhattan Plaza, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10081, or at any account of the
Borrower maintained by the Administrative Agent (or any successor Administrative
Agent) designated by the Borrower and agreed to by the Administrative Agent (or
such successor Administrative Agent), in same day funds.

         (b)      Each Notice of A Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on
the Borrower. In the case of any A Borrowing which the related Notice of A
Borrowing specified is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, if such A
Advances are not made as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the
date specified for such A Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in
Article 3, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or
expense incurred by such Lender as a

                                       23
<PAGE>
result of such failure, including any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason
of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such
Lender to fund the A Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such A
Borrowing.

         (c)      If any Lender makes a Term A Advance to the Borrower hereunder
on a day on which the Borrower is to repay all or any part of an outstanding
Revolving A Advance from such Lender, such Lender shall apply the proceeds of
its Term A Advance to make such repayment and only an amount equal to the
difference (if any) between the amount being borrowed and the amount being
repaid shall be made available by such Lender to the Administrative Agent as
provided in subsection 2.02(a), or remitted by the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent as provided in Section 2.14, as the case may be.

         (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the date of any A Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such
A Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such A Borrowing in
accordance with subsections (a) and (c) of this Section 2.02 and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent such
Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the
Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to
the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together
with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available
to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative
Agent, at the Effective Federal Funds Rate for such day. If such Lender shall
repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so
repaid shall constitute such Lender's A Advance to the Borrower as part of such
A Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

         (e)      The failure of any Lender to make the A Advance to be made by
it as part of any A Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its A Advance on the date of such A
Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any

                                       24
<PAGE>
other Lender to make the A Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date
of any A Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.03.     Fees.

         (a)      FACILITY FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender (other than a Designated Bidder) a facility
fee on the average daily amount of such Lender's Commitment, whether or not used
or deemed used, from the Effective Date in the case of each Initial Lender and
from the effective date specified in the Assignment and Acceptance or Commitment
Increase Agreement pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of each
other Lender, in each case until the Termination Date, payable quarterly in
arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December during the
term of such Lender's Commitment and on the Termination Date, at a rate per
annum equal to the Facility Fee Percentage in effect from time to time.

         (b)      UTILIZATION FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender (i) for any Utilization Fee
Period, if during such Utilization Fee Period the Average Aggregate Facility
Advances were greater than 25% and less than or equal to 50% of the Average
Aggregate Facility Commitments, a utilization fee of 0.125% per annum on the
average daily amount of such Lender's Advances during such Utilization Fee
Period; and (ii) for any Utilization Fee Period, if during such Utilization Fee
Period the Average Aggregate Facility Advances were greater than 50% of the
Average Aggregate Facility Commitments, a utilization fee of 0.25% per annum on
the average daily amount of such Lender's Advances during such Utilization Fee
Period. If a utilization fee is owing in respect of any Utilization Fee Period,
such fee shall be payable on the last day of such Utilization Fee Period.

         (c)      TERM A ADVANCE PREMIUM FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a premium fee of 0.25% per
annum on the average daily amount of the outstanding principal amount of such
Lender's Term A Advances hereunder, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day
of each March, June, September and December and on the date on which the last of
such Lender's Term A Advances shall be repaid.

                                       25
<PAGE>
         (d)      AGENCY FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent, for its own account, such agency fees as may be separately agreed to in
writing by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, such fees to be in the
amounts and payable on the dates as may be so agreed to.

         (e)      ARRANGEMENT FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for its own account, an arrangement fee in the amount and
payable on the date separately agreed to in writing by the Administrative Agent
and the Borrower.

         SECTION 2.04.     Reduction of the Commitments. The Borrower shall have
the right, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the Administrative
Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the unused portions of
the Commitments of the Lenders (being the amount by which such Commitments
exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Advances), provided
that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $20,000,000 or
any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

         SECTION 2.05.     Repayment of A Advances. (a) The Borrower shall repay
to each Lender on the Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of the
Revolving A Advances, together with accrued interest thereon, then owing to such
Lender.

         (b)      The Borrower shall repay to each Lender on the Final Maturity
Date the aggregate principal amount of the Term A Advances, together with
accrued interest thereon, then owing to such Lender.

         SECTION 2.06.     Interest on A Advances.

         (a)      ORDINARY INTEREST. The Borrower shall pay interest on the
unpaid principal amount of each A Advance owing to each Lender from the date of
such A Advance until such principal amount is due (whether at stated maturity,
by acceleration or otherwise), at the following rates:

                  (i)      BASE RATE ADVANCES. During such periods as such A
         Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to
         the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus, in the case of any Term
         A Advance, as additional interest in lieu of the facility fee, the
         Facility Fee Percentage in effect from time to

                                       26
<PAGE>
         time, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June,
         September and December during such periods and on the date such Base
         Rate Advance shall be Converted or due (whether at stated maturity, by
         acceleration or otherwise).

                  (ii)     EURODOLLAR RATE ADVANCES. During such periods as such
         A Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all
         times during each Interest Period for such A Advance to the sum of the
         Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Eurodollar Rate
         Margin in effect from time to time plus, in the case of any Term A
         Advance, as additional interest in lieu of the facility fee, the
         Facility Fee Percentage in effect from time to time, payable on the
         last day of each such Interest Period and, if any such Interest Period
         has a duration of more than three months, on each day which occurs
         during such Interest Period every three months from the first day of
         such Interest Period and, if such A Advance is Converted into a Base
         Rate Advance on any date other than the last day of any Interest Period
         for such A Advance, on the date of such Conversion or, if later, the
         Business Day on which the Borrower shall have received at least one
         Business Day's prior notice from the Administrative Agent or the
         applicable Lender of the amount of unpaid interest accrued on such A
         Advance to the date of such Conversion.

                  (iii)    ADDITIONAL INTEREST ON TERM A ADVANCES. In addition
         to amounts payable under clause (i) or (ii) above and under Section
         2.03(c) in respect of any Term A Advance, the Borrower shall pay to
         each Lender hereunder as additional interest an amount in lieu of the
         utilization fee equal to 0.25% per annum on the average daily amount of
         such Lender's Term A Advances during any period (each such period, an
         "Additional Interest Period") commencing on the Termination Date or on
         a subsequent January 1, April 1, July 1 or October 1 and ending in each
         case on the earliest to occur of the next succeeding March 31, June 30,
         September 30 or December 31 and the Final Maturity Date (or, if any
         Term A Advances remain outstanding after the Final Maturity Date, such
         later date on which all such Advances are repaid in full).

                                       27
<PAGE>
         Additional interest owing in respect of any Additional Interest Period
         shall be payable on the last day of such Additional Interest Period;
         provided that additional interest owing after the Final Maturity Date
         shall be payable on demand.

         (b)      DEFAULT INTEREST. The Borrower shall pay interest on the
unpaid principal amount of each Advance that is not paid when due (whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) from the date on which such
amount is due until such amount is paid in full, payable on demand, at a rate
per annum equal at all times (i) from such due date to the last day of the then
existing Interest Period therefor, in the case of each Eurodollar Rate Advance,
to 1% per annum above the interest rate per annum required to be paid on such A
Advance immediately prior to the date on which such amount became due and (ii)
from and after the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, in
the case of each Eurodollar Rate Advance, and at all times in the case of each
Base Rate Advance or B Advance, to 1% per annum above the Base Rate in effect
from time to time, plus, in the case of a Term A Advance, any additional
interest payable pursuant to Section 2.06(a)(iii).

         SECTION 2.07.     Additional Interest on Eurodollar Rate Advances. If
any Lender shall determine in good faith that reserves under regulations of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System are required to be maintained
by it in respect of, or a portion of its costs of maintaining reserves under
such regulations is properly attributable to, one or more of its Eurodollar Rate
Advances, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender additional interest on the
unpaid principal amount of each such Eurodollar Rate Advance payable on the same
day or days on which interest is payable on such A Advance, at an interest rate
per annum up to but not exceeding at all times during each Interest Period for
such A Advance the excess of (i) the rate obtained by dividing the Eurodollar
Rate for such Interest Period by a percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar
Reserve Percentage, if any, for such Lender for such Interest Period over (ii)
the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period. Any Lender wishing to require
payment of such additional interest (x) shall so notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent, in which case such additional

                                       28
<PAGE>
interest on the Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Lender shall be payable to such
Lender at the place indicated in such notice with respect to each Interest
Period commencing at least five Business Days after the giving of such notice
and (y) shall furnish to the Borrower at least five Business Days prior to each
date on which interest is payable on the Eurodollar Rate Advances an officer's
certificate setting forth the amount to which such Lender is then entitled under
this Section, which certificate shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

         SECTION 2.08.     Interest Rate Determination.

         (a)      Each Reference Bank agrees to furnish to the Administrative
Agent timely information for the purpose of determining each Eurodollar Rate. If
any one or more of the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information
to the Administrative Agent for the purpose of determining any such interest
rate, the Administrative Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis
of timely information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks.

         (b)      The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the
Borrower and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the
Administrative Agent for purposes of Section 2.06(a)(i) or (ii), and the
applicable rate, if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of
determining the applicable interest rate under Section 2.06(a)(ii) or (iii).

         (c)      If fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely information
to the Administrative Agent for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any
applicable A Advances,

                  (i)      the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower and
         each Lender prompt notice by telephone (confirmed in writing) that the
         interest rate cannot be determined for such applicable A Advances,

                  (ii)      each such A Advance that is a Eurodollar Rate
         Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing
         Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance (or if such
         A Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate
         Advance), and

                                       29
<PAGE>
                  (iii)      the obligations of the Lenders to make, or to
         Convert A Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances, as the case may be,
         shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
         Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension
         no longer exist.

         (d)      If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Majority
Lenders determine and give notice to the Administrative Agent that as a result
of conditions in or generally affecting the relevant market, the rates of
interest determined on the basis of the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period
for such A Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority
Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar Rate
Advances for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so
notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon:

                  (i)      each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically,
         on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert
         into a Base Rate Advance, and

                  (ii)      the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert
         A Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the
         Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the
         circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

         (e)      If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any
Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the
provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the
Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and
such Eurodollar Rate Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then
existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into Eurodollar Rate Advances with an
Interest Period of one month.

         (f)      On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
A Advances comprising any A Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment
or otherwise, to less than $10,000,000, such A Advances shall, if they are
Eurodollar Rate Advances, automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances, and on
and after such date the right of the Borrower to Convert such A Advances into

                                       30
<PAGE>
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall terminate; provided, however, that if and so long
as each such A Advance shall be, or be elected to be Converted to, Eurodollar
Rate Advances having the same Interest Period as Eurodollar Rate Advances
comprising another A Borrowing or other A Borrowings, and the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of all such Eurodollar Rate Advances shall, or upon such
Conversion will, equal or exceed $20,000,000, the Borrower shall have the right
to continue all such Eurodollar Rate Advances as, or to Convert all such A
Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances having such Interest Period.

         SECTION 2.09      Voluntary Conversion of A Advances . The Borrower may
on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Administrative Agent, not later
than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date
of the proposed Conversion, and subject to the provisions of Section 2.08, 2.11
and 2.13, Convert all A Advances of one Type comprising the same A Borrowing
into A Advances of the other Type; provided, however, that any Conversion of any
Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances made on any day other than the
last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 8.04(b). Each such notice of a Conversion
shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such
Conversion, (ii) the A Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such Conversion is
into Eurodollar Rate Advances, the duration of the Interest Period for each such
Eurodollar Rate Advance.

         SECTION 2.10.     Prepayments. The Borrower may, upon (i) in the case
of Eurodollar Rate Advances, at least three Business Days notice or (ii) in the
case of Base Rate Advances, telephonic notice not later than 12:00 noon (New
York City time) on the date of prepayment, to the Administrative Agent which
specifies the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment and
the Type of A Advances to be prepaid, and if such notice is given the Borrower
shall, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of the A Advances comprising the
same A Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to
the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid; provided, however, that (x)
each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount not less than
$10,000,000 or an

                                       31
<PAGE>
integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) in the event of any
such prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Advances on any day other than the last day
of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall be
obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to, and to the
extent required by, Section 8.04(b); provided, further, however, that the
Borrower will use its best efforts to give notice to the Administrative Agent of
the proposed prepayment of Base Rate Advances on the Business Day prior to the
date of such proposed prepayment.

         SECTION 2.11.     Increased Costs.

         (a)      If, due to either (i) the introduction after the Effective
Date of or any change after the Effective Date (including any change by way of
imposition or increase of reserve requirements or assessments other than those
referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar Reserve Percentage" contained in
Section 1.01) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the
compliance with any guideline or request issued or made after the Effective Date
from or by any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not
having the force of law), in each case above other than those referred to in
Section 2.12, there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing
to make, fund or maintain, or of making, funding or maintaining, Eurodollar Rate
Advances funded in the interbank Eurodollar market, then the Borrower shall from
time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Lender additional amounts sufficient to reimburse such Lender for all such
increased costs (except those incurred more than 60 days prior to the date of
such demand; for the purposes hereof any cost or expense allocable to a period
prior to the publication or effective date of such an introduction, change,
guideline or request shall be deemed to be incurred on the later of such
publication or effective date). Each Lender agrees to use its best reasonable
efforts promptly to notify the Borrower of any event referred to in clause (i)
or (ii) above, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the rights of any Lender under this Section 2.11(a) (except as otherwise
expressly provided above in this Section 2.11(a)). A certificate as to the
amount of

                                       32
<PAGE>
such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by
such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error. After one or more Lenders have notified the Borrower of any increased
costs pursuant to this Section 2.11, the Borrower may specify by notice to the
Administrative Agent and the affected Lenders that, after the date of such
notice whenever the election of a Eurodollar Rate Advance by the Borrower for an
Interest Period or portion thereof would give rise to such increased costs, such
election shall not apply to the A Advances of such Lender or Lenders during such
Interest Period or portion thereof, and, in lieu thereof, such A Advances shall
during such Interest Period or portion thereof be Base Rate Advances. Each
Lender agrees to use its best reasonable efforts (including a reasonable effort
to change its Applicable Lending Office or to transfer its affected A Advances
to an Affiliate of such Lender) to avoid, or minimize the amount of, any demand
for payment from the Borrower under this Section 2.11, provided that such
avoidance would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender.

         (b)      In the event that any Lender shall change its Eurodollar
Lending Office and such change results (at the time of such change) in increased
costs to such Lender, the Borrower shall not be liable to such Lender for such
increased costs incurred by such Lender to the extent, but only to the extent,
that such increased costs shall exceed the increased costs which such Lender
would have incurred if the Eurodollar Lending Office of such Lender had not been
so changed, but, subject to subsection (a) of this Section 2.11 and to Section
2.13, nothing herein shall require any Lender to change its Eurodollar Lending
Office for any reason.

         SECTION 2.12.     Increased Capital. If either (i) the introduction of
or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii)
compliance by any Lender with any guideline or request from any central bank or
other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or
would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender (including any determination
after the Effective Date by any such central bank, governmental

                                       33
<PAGE>
authority or comparable agency that, for purposes of capital adequacy
requirements, the Commitments hereunder do not constitute commitments with an
original maturity of one year or less) and such Lender determines that the
amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such
Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other commitments of this type, then,
within ten days after demand, and delivery to the Borrower of the certificate
referred to in the last sentence of this Section 2.12 by such Lender (with a
copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as
specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such
Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent
that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable
to the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder (except any such
increase in capital incurred more than, or compensation attributable to the
period before, 90 days prior to the date of such demand; for the purposes hereof
any increase in capital allocable to, or compensation attributable to, a period
prior to the publication or effective date of such an introduction, change,
guideline or request shall be deemed to be incurred on the later of such
publication or effective date). Each Lender agrees to use its best reasonable
efforts promptly to notify the Borrower of any event referred to in clause (i)
or (ii) above, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the rights of any Lender under this Section 2.12 (except as otherwise expressly
provided above in this Section 2.12). A certificate in reasonable detail as to
the basis for, and the amount of, such compensation submitted to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent by such Lender shall, in the absence of manifest
error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes.

         SECTION 2.13.     Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation
of any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other
governmental authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its
Applicable Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make
Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain such Advances
hereunder, such Lender may,

                                       34
<PAGE>
by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, suspend the right of the
Borrower to elect Eurodollar Rate Advances from such Lender and, if necessary in
the reasonable opinion of such Lender to comply with such law or regulation,
Convert all such Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Lender to Base Rate Advances
at the latest time permitted by the applicable law or regulation, and such
suspension and, if applicable, such Conversion shall continue until such Lender
notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances making
it unlawful for such Lender to perform such obligations no longer exist (which
such Lender shall promptly do when such circumstances no longer exist). So long
as the obligation of any Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Advances has been
suspended under this Section 2.13, all Notices of A Borrowing specifying A
Advances of such Type shall be deemed, as to such Lender, to be requests for
Base Rate Advances. Each Lender agrees to use its best reasonable efforts
(including a reasonable effort to change its Applicable Lending Office or to
transfer its affected A Advances to an affiliate) to avoid any such illegality,
provided that such avoidance would not, in the reasonable judgment of such
Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

         SECTION 2.14.     Payments and Computations.

         (a)      The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder (including
under Section 2.03, 2.05, 2.06 or 2.19) and under the Notes, whether the amount
so paid is owing to any or all of the Lenders or to the Administrative Agent,
not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) without setoff, counterclaim, or
any other deduction whatsoever, on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the
Administrative Agent in care of JPMorgan Chase Bank, Agency Services, One Chase
Manhattan Plaza, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10081, Attention: Muniram Appanna,
Reference: Burlington Resources Inc., or at such other location designated by
notice to the Borrower from the Administrative Agent and agreed to by the
Borrower, in same day funds. Each such payment made by the Borrower for the
account of any Lender hereunder, when so made to the Administrative Agent, shall
be deemed duly made for all purposes of this Agreement and the Notes, except
that if at any time any such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be returned
by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization of the

                                       35
<PAGE>
Borrower or otherwise, such payment shall be deemed not to have been so made.
The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like
funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other
than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.07, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.15, 2.19 or
8.04(b)) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending
Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to
any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in
each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its
acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information
contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(d), from and after
the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the
Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in
respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and
the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate
adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly
between themselves.

         (b)      All computations of interest based on the Base Rate and of
facility fees and utilization fees (or amounts in lieu thereof) shall be made by
the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case
may be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate, or the
Effective Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Administrative Agent, and all
computations of interest pursuant to Section 2.07 shall be made by each Lender
with respect to its own Eurodollar Rate Advances, on the basis of a year of 360
days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but
excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees
are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of
Section 2.07, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.15, 2.19 or 8.04(b), by each Lender with
respect to its own Advances) of an interest rate or an increased cost, loss or
expense or increased capital or of illegality or taxes hereunder shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes if made reasonably and in good faith.

         (c)      Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made
on the

                                       36
<PAGE>
next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fees, as the case
may be; provided, however, if such extension would cause payment of interest on
or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following
calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

         (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such
due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the
extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the
Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative
Agent, at a rate equal to the Effective Federal Funds Rate for such day.

         SECTION 2.15.     Taxes.

         (a)      Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder or under the
Notes shall be made in accordance with Section 2.14, free and clear of and
without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding in the case of each Indemnified Party, (i) all taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges, or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
imposed on or determined by reference to its income or profits, and all
franchise taxes, and (ii) all other taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges,
or withholdings in effect at the time that such Indemnified Party executed this
Agreement or otherwise became an "Indemnified Party" hereunder, and liabilities
with respect thereto, imposed on it by reason of the jurisdiction in which such
Indemnified Party is organized, domiciled, resident or doing business, or

                                       37
<PAGE>
any political subdivision thereof, or by reason of the jurisdiction of its
Applicable Lending Office or any other office from which it makes or maintains
any extension of credit hereunder or any political subdivision thereof (all such
non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities in respect of payments under this Agreement or under the Notes being
herein referred to as "TAXES"). If the Borrower shall be required by law to
deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any
Note to any Indemnified Party, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15) such Indemnified
Party receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower (or the Administrative Agent, as
applicable) shall make such deductions at the applicable statutory rate and
(iii) the Borrower (or the Administrative Agent, as applicable) shall pay the
full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable law, provided that the Borrower shall not be required
to pay any additional amount (and shall be relieved of any liability with
respect thereto) pursuant to this subsection (a) (or pursuant to Section
2.15(c), except to the extent Section 2.15(c) relates to Other Taxes) to any
Indemnified Party that either (x) on the date such Indemnified Party executed
this Agreement or otherwise became an "Indemnified Party" hereunder, both (A)
was not entitled to submit a U.S. Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN (relating
to such Indemnified Party, and entitling it to a complete exemption from
withholding on all amounts to be received by such Indemnified Party, including
fees, pursuant to this Agreement or the Advances) or a U.S. Internal Revenue
Service form W-8ECI (relating to all amounts to be received by such Indemnified
Party, including fees, pursuant to this Agreement and the Advances) and (B) is
not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of
the Internal Revenue Code), or (y) has failed to submit any form or certificate
that it was required to file or provide pursuant to subsection (d) of this
Section 2.15 and is entitled to file or give, as applicable, under applicable
law, provided, further, that should an Indemnified Party become subject to Taxes
because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower

                                       38
<PAGE>
shall take such administrative steps as such Indemnified Party shall reasonably
request to assist such Indemnified Party to recover such Taxes, and provided
further, that each Indemnified Party, with respect to itself, agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Borrower from any taxes, penalties, interest and
other expenses, costs and losses incurred or payable by the Borrower as a result
of the failure of the Borrower to comply with its obligations under clauses (ii)
or (iii) above in reliance on any form or certificate provided to it by such
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 2.15. If any Indemnified Party
receives a net credit or refund in respect of such Taxes or amounts so paid by
the Borrower, it shall promptly notify the Borrower of such net credit or refund
and shall promptly pay such net credit or refund to the Borrower, provided that
the Borrower agrees to return such net credit or refund if the Indemnified Party
to which such net credit or refund is applicable, is required to repay it.

         (b)      In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes or
from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to,
this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as "OTHER TAXES").

         (c)      The Borrower will indemnify each Indemnified Party for the
full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed
by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.15) paid by such
Indemnified Party and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses)
arising therefrom or with respect thereto except as a result of the gross
negligence (which shall in any event include the failure of such Indemnified
Party to provide to the Borrower any form or certificate that it was required to
provide pursuant to subsection (d) below) or willful misconduct of such
Indemnified Party, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally asserted. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the
date such Indemnified Party makes written demand therefor.

         (d)      On or prior to the date on which each Indemnified Party that
is not a United States person

                                       39
<PAGE>
(as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code)
executes this Agreement or otherwise becomes an "Indemnified Party" hereunder,
such Indemnified Party shall provide the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
with U.S. Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any
successor form prescribed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, certifying that
such Indemnified Party is fully exempt from United States withholding taxes with
respect to all payments to be made to such Indemnified Party hereunder, or other
documents satisfactory to the Borrower indicating that all payments to be made
to such Indemnified Party hereunder are fully exempt from such taxes. Thereafter
and from time to time, each such Indemnified Party shall submit to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of
one or the other of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from
time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may be (i)
notified by the Borrower to such Indemnified Party and (ii) required under
then-current United States law or regulations to avoid United States withholding
taxes on payments in respect of all amounts to be received by such Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes, including fees. Upon the request
of the Borrower from time to time, each Indemnified Party that is a United
States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal
Revenue Code) shall submit to the Borrower a certificate to the effect that it
is such a United States person. If any Indemnified Party determines, as a result
of any change in applicable law, regulation or treaty, or in any official
application or interpretation thereof, that it is unable to submit to the
Borrower any form or certificate that such Indemnified Party is obligated to
submit pursuant to this subsection (d), or that such Indemnified Party is
required to withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate previously
submitted, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent of such fact.

         (e)      Any Indemnified Party claiming any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall use its best reasonable efforts (consistent
with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the
jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change
would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts
which may

                                       40
<PAGE>
thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Indemnified
Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Indemnified Party.

         (f)      Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower and each
Indemnified Party contained in this Section 2.15 shall survive the payment in
full of principal and interest hereunder and under the Notes.

         SECTION 2.16.     Sharing of Payments, Etc.. If any Lender shall obtain
any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right
of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the A Advances made by it (other than
pursuant to Section 2.07, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.15 or 8.04(b)) in excess of its
ratable share of payments on account of the A Advances obtained by all the
Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the A Advances made by them as shall be necessary to cause
such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them,
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender
shall be rescinded and each Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the
purchase price to the extent of such Lender's ratable share (according to the
proportion of (i) the amount of the participation purchased from such Lender as
a result of such excess payment to (ii) the total amount of such excess payment)
of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (A) the amount of such Lender's required
repayment to (B) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect
of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section may, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as
if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

         SECTION 2.17.     Evidence of Debt.

                                       41
<PAGE>
         (a)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of the Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Advance made by such Lender hereunder, including
the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lender from time
to time hereunder.

         (b)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts and records
in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Advance made hereunder, the type
of Advance and, in the cases of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the relevant Interest
Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder,
and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder
for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

         (c)      The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
Sections 2.17(a) and (b) shall be conclusive evidence (absent manifest error) of
the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay the Advances in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In the
event of a conflict between the records maintained by the Administrative Agent
and any Lender, the records maintained by the Lender shall govern. Any Lender
may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a Note. In such event, the
Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the
order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its
registered assigns) and substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto.
Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all
times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 8.07) be represented by
one or more Notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein
(or, if such Note is a registered Note, to such payee and its registered
assigns).

         SECTION 2.18.     Use of Proceeds. Proceeds of the Advances may be used
for general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including
for acquisitions and for payment of commercial paper issued by the Borrower.

                                       42
<PAGE>
         SECTION 2.19.     The B Advances. (a) Each Lender severally agrees that
the Borrower may make B Borrowings under this Section 2.19 from time to time on
any Business Day during the period from the Effective Date until the earlier of
(I) the Termination Date or (II) the date falling 30 days prior to the Stated
Termination Date, in the manner set forth below; provided that (x) each B
Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple
of $5,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) following the making of each B
Borrowing, the aggregate number of outstanding B Borrowings shall not exceed
seven and the aggregate amount of all Advances then outstanding shall not exceed
the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Lenders (computed without regard
to any B Reduction).

                  (i)      The Borrower may request a B Borrowing under this
         Section 2.19 by delivering to the Administrative Agent, by telecopy,
         telefax or other teletransmission, a notice of a B Borrowing (a "NOTICE
         OF B BORROWING"), in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto,
         specifying the date and aggregate amount of the proposed B Borrowing,
         the maturity date for repayment of each B Advance to be made as part of
         such B Borrowing (which maturity date may not be earlier than the date
         occurring 30 days after the date of such B Borrowing or later than the
         earlier of (x) 180 days after the date of such B Borrowing or (y) the
         Stated Termination Date), the interest payment date or dates relating
         thereto, and any other terms to be applicable to such B Borrowing, not
         later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) (A) at least one Business
         Day prior to the date of the proposed B Borrowing, if the Borrower
         shall specify in the Notice of B Borrowing that the rates of interest
         to be offered by the Lenders shall be fixed rates per annum and (B) at
         least four Business Days prior to the date of the proposed B Borrowing,
         if the Borrower shall instead specify in the Notice of B Borrowing the
         basis to be used by the Lenders in determining the rates of interest to
         be offered by them. The Administrative Agent shall in turn promptly
         notify each Lender of each request for a B Borrowing received by it
         from the Borrower by sending such Lender a copy of the related Notice
         of B Borrowing.

                                       43
<PAGE>
                  (ii)      Each Lender may, if in its sole and absolute
         discretion it elects to do so, irrevocably offer to make one or more B
         Advances to the Borrower as part of such proposed B Borrowing at a rate
         or rates of interest specified by such Lender in its sole discretion,
         by notifying the Administrative Agent (which shall give prompt notice
         thereof to the Borrower), before 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) (x) on
         the date of such proposed B Borrowing in the case of a Notice of B
         Borrowing delivered pursuant to clause (A) of paragraph (i) above, and
         (y) three Business Days before the date of such proposed B Borrowing in
         the case of a Notice of B Borrowing delivered pursuant to clause (B) of
         paragraph (i) above, of the maximum amount of each B Advance which such
         Lender would be willing to make as part of such proposed B Borrowing
         (which amount may, subject to clause (y) of the proviso to the first
         sentence of this Section 2.19(a), exceed such Lender's Commitment), the
         rate or rates of interest therefor and such Lender's Applicable Lending
         Office with respect to such B Advance; provided that if the
         Administrative Agent or an Affiliate thereof in its capacity as a
         Lender shall, in its sole discretion, elect to make any such offer, it
         shall notify the Borrower of such offer before 9:45 A.M. (New York City
         time) on the date on which notice of such election is to be given to
         the Administrative Agent by the other Lenders. If any Lender shall
         elect not to make such an offer, such Lender shall so notify the
         Administrative Agent, before 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the
         date on which notice of such election is to be given to the
         Administrative Agent by the other Lenders, and such Lender shall not be
         obligated to, and shall not, make any B Advance as part of such B
         Borrowing; provided that the failure by any Lender to give such notice
         shall not cause such Lender to be obligated to make any B Advance as
         part of such proposed B Borrowing.

                  (iii)      The Borrower shall, in turn, before 11:00 A.M. (New
         York City time) (x) on the date of such proposed B Borrowing, in the
         case of a Notice of B Borrowing delivered pursuant to clause (A) of
         paragraph (i) above and (y) three Business Days before the date of such
         proposed B Borrowing in the case of a Notice of

                                       44
<PAGE>
         B Borrowing delivered pursuant to clause (B) of paragraph (i) above,
         either

                           (A)      cancel such B Borrowing by giving the
                  Administrative Agent notice to that effect, or

                           (B)      accept one or more of the offers made by any
                  Lender or Lenders pursuant to paragraph (ii) above, in order
                  of the lowest to highest rates of interest or margins (or, if
                  two or more Lenders bid at the same rates of interest, and the
                  amount of accepted offers is less than the aggregate amount of
                  such offers, the amount to be borrowed from such Lenders as
                  part of such B Borrowing shall be allocated among such Lenders
                  pro rata on the basis of the maximum amount offered by such
                  Lenders at such rates or margin in connection with such B
                  Borrowing), in any aggregate amount up to the aggregate amount
                  initially requested by the Borrower in the relevant Notice of
                  B Borrowing, by giving notice to the Administrative Agent of
                  the amount of each B Advance (which amount shall be equal to
                  or greater than the minimum amount, and equal to or less than
                  the maximum amount, notified to the Borrower by the
                  Administrative Agent on behalf of such Lender for such B
                  Advance pursuant to paragraph (ii) above) to be made by each
                  Lender as part of such B Borrowing, and reject any remaining
                  offers made by Lenders pursuant to paragraph (ii) above by
                  giving the Administrative Agent notice to that effect.

                  (iv)     If the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent
         that such B Borrowing is cancelled pursuant to paragraph (iii)(A)
         above, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the
         Lenders and such B Borrowing shall not be made.

                  (v)      If the Borrower accepts one or more of the offers
         made by any Lender or Lenders pursuant to paragraph (iii)(B) above, the
         Administrative Agent shall in turn promptly notify (A) each Lender that
         has made an offer as described in paragraph (ii) above, of the date and
         aggregate amount of such B Borrowing and

                                       45
<PAGE>
         whether or not any offer or offers made by such Lender pursuant to
         paragraph (ii) above have been accepted by the Borrower, (B) each
         Lender that is to make a B Advance as part of such B Borrowing, of the
         amount of each B Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such B
         Borrowing, and (C) each Lender that is to make a B Advance as part of
         such B Borrowing, upon receipt, that the Administrative Agent has
         received forms of documents appearing to fulfill the applicable
         conditions set forth in Article 3. Each Lender that is to make a B
         Advance as part of such B Borrowing shall, before 12:00 noon (New York
         City time) on the date of such B Borrowing specified in the notice
         received from the Administrative Agent pursuant to clause (A) of the
         preceding sentence or any later time when such Lender shall have
         received notice from the Administrative Agent pursuant to clause (C) of
         the preceding sentence, make available for the account of its
         Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent at its address
         referred to in Section 8.02 such Lender's portion of such B Borrowing,
         in same day funds. Upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set
         forth in Article 3 and after receipt by the Administrative Agent of
         such funds, the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to
         the Borrower at the Administrative Agent's aforesaid address. Promptly
         after each B Borrowing the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender
         of the amount of the B Borrowing, the consequent B Reduction and the
         dates upon which such B Reduction commenced and will terminate.

         (b)      Within the limits and on the conditions set forth in this
Section 2.19, the Borrower may from time to time borrow under this Section 2.19,
repay or prepay pursuant to subsection (c) below, and reborrow under this
Section 2.19.

         (c)      The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender which has made a B Advance, or each other holder of a
Note, on the maturity date of each B Advance (such maturity date being that
specified by the Borrower for repayment in the related Notice of B Borrowing and
provided in the Note, if any, evidencing such B Advance), the then unpaid
principal amount of such B Advance. The Borrower shall have no right to prepay
any B Advance unless, and then only on the

                                       46
<PAGE>
terms, specified by the Borrower for such B Advance in the related Notice of B
Borrowing delivered pursuant to Section 2.19(a)(i) and set forth in the Note, if
any, evidencing such B Advance or unless the holder of such B Advance otherwise
consents in writing to such prepayment.

         (d)      The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount
of each B Advance from the date of such B Advance to the date the principal
amount of such B Advance is repaid in full at the rate of interest for such B
Advance specified by the Lender making such B Advance in its notice delivered
pursuant to subsection (a)(ii) above on the interest date or dates specified by
the Borrower for such B Advance in the related Notice of B Borrowing and set
forth in the Note, if any, evidencing such B Advance, subject to Section
2.06(b).

         (e)      Each time that the Borrower gives a Notice of B Borrowing, the
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its own account such fee as
may be agreed between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent from time to
time, whether or not any B Borrowing is in fact made.

         (f)      Following the making of each B Borrowing, the Borrower agrees
that it will be in compliance with the limitations set forth in clause (y) of
the proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.19(a).

         (g)      The failure of any Lender to make the B Advance to be made by
it as part of any B Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its B Advance on the date of such B
Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Lender to make the B Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any
B Borrowing. If any Designated Bidder fails to make the B Advance to be made by
it as part of any B Borrowing, such Designated Bidder shall not thereafter have
the right to offer to make any B Advance without the prior written consent of
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 2.20.     Increase of Commitments. (a) At any time after the
Effective Date, provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Borrower may request an increase of the aggregate Commitments by
notice to the Administrative Agent in writing of the amount (the

                                       47
<PAGE>
"OFFERED INCREASE AMOUNT") of such proposed increase (such notice, a "COMMITMENT
INCREASE NOTICE"). Any such Commitment Increase Notice must offer each Lender
the opportunity to subscribe for its pro rata share of the increased
Commitments. If any portion of the increased Commitments is not subscribed for
by the Lenders, the Borrower may, in its sole discretion, but with the consent
of the Administrative Agent as to any Person that is not at such time a Lender
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), offer to any existing Lender
or to one or more additional banks or financial institutions the opportunity to
participate in all or a portion of such unsubscribed portion of the increased
Commitments pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) below, as applicable.

         (b)      Any additional bank or financial institution that the Borrower
selects to offer participation in the increased Commitments, and that elects to
become a party to this Agreement and obtain a Commitment, shall execute a New
Lender Agreement with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, substantially
in the form of Exhibit E (a "NEW LENDER AGREEMENT"), whereupon such bank or
financial institution (a "NEW LENDER") shall become a Lender for all purposes
and to the same extent as if originally a party hereto and shall be bound by and
entitled to the benefits of this Agreement, and the signature pages and Schedule
III hereof shall be deemed to be amended to add the name and Commitment of such
New Lender, provided that the Commitment of any such New Lender shall be in an
amount not less than $10,000,000.

         (c)      Any Lender that accepts an offer to it by the Borrower to
increase its Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall, in each case,
execute a Commitment Increase Agreement with the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit F (a "COMMITMENT INCREASE
AGREEMENT"), whereupon such Lender shall be bound by and entitled to the
benefits of this Agreement with respect to the full amount of its Commitment as
so increased, and Schedule III hereof shall be deemed to be amended to so
increase the Commitment of such Lender.

         (d)      The effectiveness of any New Lender Agreement or Commitment
Increase Agreement shall be contingent upon receipt by the Administrative Agent
of such corporate resolutions of the Borrower and

                                       48
<PAGE>
legal opinions of counsel to the Borrower as the Administrative Agent shall
reasonably request with respect thereto, in each case, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

         (e)      If any bank or financial institution becomes a New Lender
pursuant to Section 2.20(b) or any Lender's Commitment is increased pursuant to
Section 2.20(c), additional A Advances made on or after the effectiveness
thereof (the "RE-ALLOCATION DATE") shall be made pro rata based on the
Commitment Percentages in effect on and after such Re-Allocation Date (except to
the extent that any such pro rata borrowings would result in any Lender making
an aggregate principal amount of A Advances in excess of its Commitment, in
which case such excess amount will be allocated to, and made by, such New Lender
and/or Lenders with such increased Commitments to the extent of, and pro rata
based on, their respective Commitments), and continuations of Eurodollar Rate
Advances outstanding on such Re-Allocation Date shall be effected by repayment
of such Eurodollar Rate Advances on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto and the making of new Eurodollar Rate Advances pro rata based
on such new Commitment Percentages. In the event that on any such Re-Allocation
Date there is an unpaid principal amount of Base Rate Advances, the Borrower
shall make prepayments thereof and borrowings of Base Rate Advances so that,
after giving effect thereto, the Base Rate Advances outstanding are held pro
rata based on such new Commitment Percentages. In the event that on any such
Re-Allocation Date there is an unpaid principal amount of Eurodollar Rate
Advances, such Eurodollar Rate Advances shall remain outstanding with the
respective holders thereof until the expiration of their respective Interest
Periods (unless the applicable Borrower elects to prepay any thereof in
accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement), and interest on
and repayments of such Eurodollar Rate Advances will be paid thereon to the
respective Lenders holding such Eurodollar Rate Advances pro rata based on the
respective principal amounts thereof outstanding.

         (f)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.20,
(i) no increase pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall be effective without the
consent of the Required Lenders, (ii) no Lender shall have any obligation to
increase its Commitment unless it agrees to do so in its sole discretion and
(iii) the

                                       49
<PAGE>
aggregate amount by which the Commitments hereunder are increased pursuant to
this Section 2.20 shall not exceed $120,000,000.

         (g)      The Borrower shall execute and deliver a Note to each new bank
or other financial institution becoming a Lender that requests one.

         SECTION 2.21.     Extension of Stated Termination Date .(a) Not earlier
than 65 days prior to and not later than 45 days prior to the Stated Termination
Date then in effect, provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, the Borrower may request an extension of such Stated Termination
Date by submitting to the Administrative Agent an Extension Request containing
the information in respect of such extension specified in Exhibit G, which the
Administrative Agent shall promptly furnish to each Lender. Each Lender shall,
by the later of (i) the date 30 days after its receipt from the Administrative
Agent of the applicable Extension Request and (ii) the date 30 days prior to the
Stated Termination Date, notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its
election to extend or not extend the Stated Termination Date as requested in
such Extension Request. If the Required Lenders shall approve in writing the
extension of the Stated Termination Date requested in such Extension Request,
and unless the Borrower shall elect to give notice for a Term A Advance pursuant
to Section 2.01(b), the Stated Termination Date shall automatically and without
any further action by any Person be extended for an additional 364 days provided
that the Commitment of any Lender that does not consent in writing within the
period specified above (an "OBJECTING LENDER") shall, unless earlier terminated
in accordance with this Agreement, expire on the Stated Termination Date in
effect on the date of such Extension Request (such Stated Termination Date, if
any, referred to as the "COMMITMENT EXPIRATION DATE" with respect to such
Objecting Lender). If, within the period specified above, the Required Lenders
shall not approve in writing the extension of the Stated Termination Date
requested in an Extension Request, the Stated Termination Date shall not be
extended pursuant to such Extension Request. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify (y) the Lenders and the Borrower of any extension of the Stated
Termination Date pursuant to this Section

                                       50
<PAGE>
2.21 and (z) the Borrower of any Lender that becomes an Objecting Lender.

         (b)      A Advances owing to any Objecting Lender on the Commitment
Expiration Date, together with accrued interest thereon, any amounts payable
pursuant to Sections 2.06, 2.07, 2.11, 2.12, 2.15 and 8.04(b) and any accrued
and unpaid facility fee or utilization fee or other amounts payable with respect
to such Lender shall be repaid in full on or before such Commitment Expiration
Date.

         (c)      The Borrower shall have the right, so long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is then continuing, upon giving notice to the
Administrative Agent and the Objecting Lenders in accordance with Section 2.10,
to prepay in full the A Advances of the Objecting Lenders, together with accrued
interest thereon, any amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.06, 2.07, 2.11,
2.12, 2.15 and 8.04(b) and any accrued and unpaid facility fee or utilization
fee or other amounts payable to the Objecting Lenders hereunder and, upon giving
not less than three Business Days' notice to the Objecting Lenders and the
Administrative Agent, to cancel the whole or part of the Commitments of the
Objecting Lenders.

         (d)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Lender becomes an
Objecting Lender, the Borrower may, at its own expense and in the sole
discretion and prior to the then Stated Termination Date, require such Lender
(and each related Designated Bidder (as defined herein or in the Long-Term
Revolving Credit Agreement or the Canadian Credit Agreement, as the case may
be)) to transfer or assign, in whole or in part, without recourse (in accordance
with Section 8.07), all or part of its interests, rights and obligations under
this Agreement and, if the Borrower shall so determine in its sole discretion,
the Long-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and/or the Canadian Credit Agreement,
as the Borrower may determine in its sole discretion and specify by notice to
such Lender, to an Eligible Assignee (provided that the Borrower, with the full
cooperation of such Lender, can identify an Eligible Assignee that is ready,
willing and able to be an assignee with respect thereto) which shall assume such
assigned obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if such assignee
Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (A) the assignee or the Borrower,
as the case may be, shall have paid to

                                       51
<PAGE>
such Lender in immediately available funds the principal of and interest accrued
to the date of such payment on the Advances made by it hereunder and all other
amounts owed to it hereunder, including any amounts owing pursuant to Section
8.04(b), and, if the Borrower shall have so determined as specified above, the
"Advances" made by it under, and as defined in, the Long-Term Revolving Credit
Agreement and/or the Canadian Credit Agreement, as the case may be, and all
other amounts owed to it thereunder, including any amounts owing pursuant to the
provision of the Long-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and/or the Canadian Credit
Agreement, as the case may be, comparable to Section 8.04 hereof) and any
amounts that would be owing under such Section (or comparable provision) if such
Advances and "Advances" (as so defined) were prepaid on the date of such
assignment, and (B) such assignment does not conflict with any law, rule or
regulation or order of any governmental authority. Any assignee that becomes a
Lender as a result of such an assignment made pursuant to this paragraph (d)
shall be deemed to have consented to the applicable Extension Request and,
therefore, shall not be an Objecting Lender.

         SECTION 2.22.     Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests
compensation under Sections 2.07, 2.11 or 2.12 or if the Borrower is required to
pay any additional amount to any Lender or any taxing authority or other
authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, or if any
Lender suspends the right of the Borrower to elect Eurodollar Rate Advances from
such Lender pursuant to Section 2.13, or if any Lender defaults in its
obligation to fund Advances hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole
expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent,
require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with
and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 8.07), all its interests,
rights and obligations under this Agreement (other than any outstanding B
Advances held by it) and, if the Borrower shall so determine in its sole
discretion, the Long-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and/or the Canadian Credit
Agreement, as the Borrower may determine in its sole discretion and specify by
notice to such Lender (other than "B Advances" under, and as defined in, the
Long-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and/or the Canadian Credit Agreement, as
the case may be) to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which

                                       52
<PAGE>
assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided
that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii)
such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding
principal of its Advances (other than B Advances) hereunder and, if the Borrower
shall have so determined as specified above, its "Advances" (other than "B
Advances") (each under and as defined in the Long-Term Revolving Credit
Agreement and/or the Canadian Credit Agreement, as the case may be), and all
accrued interest thereon, accrued fees, accrued costs in connection with
compensation under Sections 2.07, 2.11 or 2.12 or payments required to be made
pursuant to Section 2.15, if any, and all other amounts (other than B Advances)
payable to it hereunder and, if the Borrower shall have so determined as
specified above, under the Long-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and/or the
Canadian Credit Agreement, as the case may be, from the assignee (to the extent
of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in
the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment
resulting from a claim for compensation under Sections 2.07, 2.11 or 2.12 or
payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment will
result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be
required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a
result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the
Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         SECTION 4.01.     Representations and Warranties of the Borrower. The
Borrower represents and warrants as follows:

         (a)      The Borrower is a Business Entity duly formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each
Material Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing in
the jurisdiction of its formation. The Borrower and each Material Subsidiary
possess all applicable Business Entity powers and all other authorizations and
licenses necessary to engage in its business and operations as now conducted,

Each Subsidiary which is, on and as of the Effective Date, a Material Subsidiary

         (b)      The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of
this Agreement and the Notes, if any, are within the Borrower's applicable

Business Entity action, and do not contravene (i) the Borrower's organizational
documents or (ii) law or any contractual restriction binding on or affecting the
Borrower.

         (c)      No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice

required in the ordinary course to comply with ongoing covenant obligations of
the Borrower hereunder the performance of which is not yet due and (ii) that
will, in the ordinary course of business in accordance with this Agreement, be
duly made or obtained on or prior to the time or times the performance of such
obligations shall be due.

         (d)      This Agreement constitutes, and the Notes (if and when
delivered hereunder) shall constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of
the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their
respective terms, except as may be limited by

                                       57

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws affecting creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity.

         (e)      The consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2001 and the related consolidated
statements of income and cash flow for the fiscal year then ended, reported on
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, independent public accountants, and the
consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its consolidated subsidiaries as
at September 30, 2002 and the related consolidated statements of income and cash
flow for the nine-month period then ended, certified by the chief financial
officer of the Borrower, copies of each of which have been furnished to the
Administrative Agent and the Initial Lenders, fairly present the consolidated
financial condition of the Borrower and such Subsidiaries as at December 31,
2001, and September 30, 2002, respectively, and the consolidated results of
their operations for such fiscal periods, subject in the case of the September
30, 2002 statements to normal year-end adjustments, all in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied. From September
30, 2002 to and including the Effective Date there has been no material adverse
change in such condition or results of operations.

         (f)      As at the Effective Date, there is no action, suit or
proceeding pending, or to the knowledge of the Borrower threatened, against or
involving the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary in any court, or before any
arbitrator of any kind, or before or by any governmental body, which in the
reasonable judgment of the Borrower (taking into account the exhaustion of all
appeals) would have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or
which purports to affect the legality, validity, binding effect or
enforceability of this Agreement or the Notes, if any.

         (g)      The Borrower and each consolidated Subsidiary have duly filed
all tax returns required to be filed, and duly paid and discharged all taxes,
assessments and governmental charges upon it or against its properties now due
and payable, the failure to file or pay which, as applicable, would have a
Material Adverse Effect, unless and to the

                                       58
<PAGE>
extent only that the same are being contested in good faith and by appropriate
proceedings by the Borrower or the appropriate Subsidiary.

         (h)      Except to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 5.02(e),
neither the Borrower nor any Material Subsidiary is subject to any contractual
restrictions which limit the amount of dividends payable by any Subsidiary.

         (i)      No Termination Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to
occur with respect to any Plan which, with the giving of notice or lapse of
time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default under Section 6.01(g).

         (j)      Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or
is reasonably expected to incur, any Withdrawal Liability to any Multiemployer
Plan that, when aggregated with all other amounts required to be paid to
Multiemployer Plans in connection with Withdrawal Liability (as of the date of
determination), exceeds 5% of the Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of the
Borrower.

         (k)      Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has received any
notification that any Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization or has been
terminated, within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA, and no Multiemployer Plan
is reasonably expected to be in reorganization or to be terminated within the
meaning of Title IV of ERISA the effect of which reorganization or termination
would be the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 6.01(i).

         (l)      The Borrower is not an "investment company" or a "company"
controlled by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

         (m)      The Borrower is not a "holding company" or a "subsidiary
company" of a "holding company", or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of
a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or a "public utility" within the
meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

         (n)      The proceeds of the Advances will not be used in any way which
would violate the provisions of Regulation U or X of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System.

         All representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein or made
in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the making of the
Advances and the execution and delivery to the Lenders of this Agreement and the
Notes, if any.

                            COVENANTS OF THE BORROWER

         SECTION 5.01.     Affirmative Covenants. So long as any Advance, Note
or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder shall remain unpaid or any
Lender shall have any Commitment hereunder, the Borrower will, unless the
Majority Lenders shall otherwise consent in writing:

         (a)      PRESERVATION OF EXISTENCE, ETC. Preserve and maintain, and
cause each Material Subsidiary to preserve and maintain, its existence, rights
(organizational and statutory) and material franchises, except as otherwise
contemplated or permitted by Section 5.02(c) or 5.02(d); provided, that any
Material Subsidiary may change its form of organization to a partnership or
other form of Business Entity.

         (b)      COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, ETC. Comply, and cause each Subsidiary
to comply, in all material respects, with all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and orders (including all environmental laws and laws requiring
payment of all taxes, assessments and governmental charges imposed upon it or
upon its property except to the extent contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings) the failure to comply with which would have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         (c)      VISITATION RIGHTS. At such reasonable times and intervals as
the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders (other than Designated Bidders)
may desire, permit the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders (other than
Designated Bidders) to visit the Borrower and to discuss the affairs, finances,
accounts and mineral reserve performance of the Borrower and any of its
Subsidiaries with officers of the Borrower and independent certified public
accountants of the Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries, provided that if an
Event of Default, or an event which with the giving of notice or the

                                       60
<PAGE>
passage of time, or both, would become an Event of Default, has occurred and is
continuing, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may, in addition to the other
provisions of this subsection (c) and at such reasonable times and intervals as
the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders may desire, visit and inspect,
under guidance of officers of the Borrower, any properties significant to the
consolidated operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and to examine the
books and records of account (other than with respect to any mineral reserve
information that the Borrower determines to be confidential, except, during the
continuation of an Event of Default, if such Lenders shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with respect to such information satisfactory in form
and substance to the Borrower) of the Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries and
to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of any of the Borrower's
Subsidiaries with any of the officers of such Subsidiary.

         (d)      BOOKS AND RECORDS. Keep, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to
keep, proper books of record and account, in which full and correct entries
shall be made of all financial transactions and the assets and business of the
Borrower and each Subsidiary in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles either (i) consistently applied or (ii) applied in a changed manner
that does not, under generally accepted accounting principles or public
reporting requirements applicable to the Borrower, either require disclosure in
the consolidated financial statements of the Borrower and its consolidated
Subsidiaries or require the consent of the accountants which (as required by
Section 5.03(b)) report on such financial statements for the fiscal year in
which such change shall have occurred, or (iii) applied in a changed manner not
covered by clause (ii) above provided such change shall have been disclosed to
the Administrative Agent and shall have been consented to by the accountants
which (as required by Section 5.03(b)) report on the consolidated financial
statements of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the fiscal year
in which such change shall have occurred, provided that if any change referred
to in clause (ii) or (iii) above would not meet the standard set forth in clause
(i) or (ii) of Section 1.03, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the
Borrower agree to amend the covenants contained in Section 5.01 and 5.02 so that
the

                                       61
<PAGE>
relative protection afforded thereby to the Lenders and the relative flexibility
afforded thereby to the Borrower will in substance be retained after such
amendment, provided, however, that until such amendment becomes effective
hereunder, the covenants as set forth herein shall remain in full force and
effect and those accounting principles applicable to the Borrower and its
consolidated Subsidiaries which do meet the standards set forth in clause (i) or
(ii) of Section 1.03 shall be applied to determine whether or not the Borrower
is in compliance with such covenants.

         (e)      MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES, ETC. Maintain and preserve, and
cause each Material Subsidiary to maintain and preserve, all of its properties
which are used in the conduct of its business in good working order and
condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, to the extent that any failure to do
so would have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (f)      MAINTENANCE OF INSURANCE. Maintain, and cause each Material
Subsidiary to maintain, insurance with responsible and reputable insurance
companies or associations in such amounts and covering such risks as is usually
carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and owning similar properties
in the same general areas in which the Borrower or such Subsidiary operates.

         SECTION 5.02.     Negative Covenants. So long as any Advance, Note or
other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder shall remain unpaid or any Lender
shall have any Commitment hereunder, the Borrower will not, unless the Majority
Lenders shall otherwise consent in writing:

         (a)      LIENS, ETC. (i) Create, assume or suffer to exist, or permit
any Material Subsidiary to create, assume or suffer to exist, any Liens upon or
with respect to any of the Equity Interests in any Material Subsidiary, whether
now owned or hereafter acquired, or (ii) create or assume, or permit any
Material Subsidiary to create or assume, any Liens upon or with respect to any
other assets material to the consolidated operations of the Borrower and its
consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole securing the payment of Debt and
Guaranties in an aggregate amount (determined without duplication of amount (so
that the amount of a Guaranty will be excluded to the extent the Debt Guaranteed
thereby is included

                                       62
<PAGE>
in computing such aggregate amount)) exceeding the greater of (x) $250,000,000
and (y) 10% of Consolidated Tangible Net Worth as at the date of such creation
or assumption; provided, however, that this subsection (a) shall not apply to:

                           (A)      Liens on assets acquired by the Borrower or
                  any of its Subsidiaries after the Original Effective Date to
                  the extent that such Liens existed at the time of such
                  acquisition and were not placed thereon by or with the consent
                  of the Borrower in contemplation of such acquisition;

                           (B)      Liens on Equity Interests acquired after the
                  Original Effective Date in a Business Entity which has become
                  or becomes a Subsidiary of the Borrower, or on assets of any
                  such Business Entity, to the extent that such Liens existed at
                  the time of such acquisition and were not placed thereon by or
                  with the consent of the Borrower in contemplation of such
                  acquisition;

                           (C)      Liens on Margin Stock;

                           (D)      Liens on the Equity Interests in, or Debt or
                  other obligations of, or assets of, any Project Financing
                  Subsidiary (or any Equity Interests in, Debt or other
                  obligations of any Business Entity which are owned by any
                  Project Financing Subsidiary) securing the payment of a
                  Project Financing and related obligations;

                           (E)      Permitted Liens;

                           (F)      Liens arising out of the refinancing,
                  extension, renewal or refunding of any Debt or Guaranty
                  secured by any Lien permitted by any of the foregoing clauses
                  of this Section, provided that the principal amount of such
                  Debt or Guaranty is not increased (except by the amount of
                  costs reasonably incurred in connection with the issuance
                  thereof) and such Debt or Guaranty is not secured by any
                  additional assets that would not have been permitted by this
                  Section to secure the Debt or Guaranty refinanced, extended,
                  renewed or refunded; and

                                       63
<PAGE>
                           (G)      Liens on products and proceeds (including

                  proceeds) of, and property evidencing or embodying, or
                  constituting rights or other general intangibles relating to,
                  and accessions and improvements to, collateral subject to
                  Liens permitted by this Section 5.02.

         (b)      DEBT, ETC. Create, assume or suffer to exist, or permit any of
its consolidated Subsidiaries to create, assume or suffer to exist, any Debt or
any Guaranty unless, immediately after giving effect to such Debt or Guaranty
and the receipt and application of any proceeds thereof or value received in
connection therewith,

                           (1)      the sum (without duplication) of (i)
                  consolidated Debt of the Borrower and its consolidated
                  Subsidiaries plus (ii) the aggregate amount (determined on a
                  consolidated basis) of Guaranties by the Borrower and its
                  consolidated Subsidiaries is less than 60% of Capitalization,
                  provided that Debt for borrowed money either maturing within
                  one year and evidenced by instruments commonly known as
                  commercial paper, or evidenced by variable demand notes or
                  other similar short-term financing instruments issued to
                  commercial banks and trust companies (other than Debt incurred
                  pursuant to this Agreement or the Long-Term Revolving Credit
                  Agreement or the Canadian Credit Agreement or any replacement
                  therefor), shall not exceed the sum of the unused commitments
                  under the Canadian Credit Agreement and the aggregate of the
                  Borrower's unused bank lines of credit and unused credit
                  available to the Borrower under financing arrangements with
                  banks or other financial institutions; and

                           (2)      with respect to any such Debt created or
                  assumed by a consolidated Subsidiary that is either a
                  Subsidiary of the Borrower as of the Original Effective Date
                  or a Subsidiary of the Borrower acquired or created after the
                  Original Effective Date and owning a material

                                       64
<PAGE>

                  Original Effective Date of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries,

                  Subsidiaries is less than the greater of (i) $500,000,000
                  (exclusive of public Debt of LL&E existing at the time LL&E
                  became a Subsidiary, the principal amount of which at such
                  time was approximately $400,000,000, and any refinancing of
                  such Debt, in a principal amount not to exceed the principal
                  amount refinanced) and (ii) 30% of Consolidated Tangible Net
                  Worth as at the date of incurrence or creation of such Debt.

         (c)      SALE, ETC. OF ASSETS. Sell, lease or otherwise transfer, or
permit any Material Subsidiary to sell, lease or otherwise transfer (in either
case, whether in one transaction or in a series of transactions, and except, in
either case, to the Borrower or an entity which after giving effect to such
transfer will be or become a Material Subsidiary in which the Borrower's direct
or indirect Equity Interests will be at least as great as its direct or indirect
Equity Interests in the transferor immediately prior thereto, and except as
permitted by Section 5.02(d)), assets constituting all or substantially all of
the consolidated assets of the Borrower and its Material Subsidiaries, provided
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary may
sell, lease or otherwise transfer any Permitted Assets constituting all or
substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Borrower and its Material
Subsidiaries, so long as (A) such Permitted Assets are sold, leased or otherwise
transferred in exchange for other Permitted Assets and/or (B) the proceeds from
such sale, lease or other transfer, or an amount equal to the proceeds thereof,
are (x) reinvested within one year from the date of receipt thereof in Permitted
Assets and/or the development of Permitted Assets and/or (y) used to repay Debt
the proceeds of which were or are being used for investment in, and/or the
development of, Permitted Assets; provided further that, no such sale, lease or
other transfer shall be permitted by

                                       65
<PAGE>
the foregoing proviso unless either (1) after giving effect to such sale, lease
or other transfer, no Event of Default, and no event which with lapse of time or
the giving of notice, or both, would constitute an Event of Default, shall have
occurred and be continuing or (2) the Borrower or the relevant Material
Subsidiary, as the case may be, was contractually obligated, prior to the
occurrence of such Event of Default or event, to consummate such sale, lease or
other transfer.

         (d)      MERGERS, ETC. Merge, amalgamate or consolidate with any
Person, or permit any Material Subsidiary to merge, amalgamate or consolidate
with any Person, except that:

                           (i)      any Subsidiary may merge, amalgamate or
                  consolidate with (or liquidate into) any other Subsidiary or
                  may merge, amalgamate or consolidate with (or liquidate into)
                  the Borrower, provided that (A) if such Subsidiary merges,
                  amalgamates or consolidates with (or liquidates into) the
                  Borrower, either the survivor or successor is the Borrower or
                  such successor or surviving Business Entity is organized and
                  existing under the laws of the United States and expressly
                  assumes the obligations of the Borrower hereunder and under
                  the Notes, (B) if any such Subsidiary merges, amalgamates or
                  consolidates with (or liquidates into) any other Subsidiary of
                  the Borrower, one or more Business Entities that are
                  Subsidiaries of the Borrower are the surviving or successor
                  Business Entity(ies) and, if any such Subsidiary is not
                  directly or indirectly wholly-owned by the Borrower, such
                  merger, amalgamation or consolidation is on an arm's length
                  basis and (C) as a result of such merger, amalgamation or
                  consolidation, no Event of Default, and no event which with
                  lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both, would
                  constitute an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be
                  continuing, and

                           (ii)     the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary may
                  merge, amalgamate or consolidate with any other Business
                  Entity (that is, in addition to the Borrower or any other
                  Subsidiary), provided that (A) if the

                                       66
<PAGE>
                  Borrower merges, amalgamates or consolidates with any such
                  other Business Entity(ies), the survivor or successor Business
                  Entity is the Borrower, (B) if any Material Subsidiary merges,
                  amalgamates or consolidates with any such other Business
                  Entity, each surviving or successor Business Entity is a
                  directly or indirectly wholly-owned Subsidiary, and (C) if
                  either the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary merges,
                  amalgamates or consolidates with any such other Business
                  Entity, after giving effect to such merger, amalgamation or
                  consolidation no Event of Default, and no event which with
                  lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both, would
                  constitute an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be
                  continuing.

         (e)      DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS. Create, or consent or agree to, or
permit any of its Material Subsidiaries existing on the Original Effective Date
or any of its Subsidiaries thereafter created or acquired and owning a material
portion of the consolidated operating assets existing at the Original Effective
Date of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, to create, or consent or agree to,
any restrictions, contained in any agreement or instrument relating to or
evidencing Debt, on any such Subsidiary's ability to pay dividends or to make
advances to the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower; provided, however,
that this subsection (e) shall not apply to any such restrictions (including any
extensions of the term of any thereof (by amendment, or continuation thereof in
any refinancing of the Debt to which such restriction relates, or otherwise))
applicable to the Equity Interests in any Subsidiary of the Borrower the Equity
Interests in which are acquired by the Borrower after the Original Effective
Date and which restrictions are existing at the time such Subsidiary first
becomes a Subsidiary of the Borrower and are not placed thereon by or with the
consent of the Borrower in contemplation of such acquisition by the Borrower.

         SECTION 5.03.     Reporting Requirements. So long as any Advance shall
remain unpaid or any Lender shall have any Commitment hereunder, the Borrower
will furnish to each Lender in such reasonable quantities as shall from time to
time be requested by such Lender:

                                       67
<PAGE>
         (a)      within 60 days after the end of each of the first three
quarters of each fiscal year of the Borrower, a consolidated balance sheet of
the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the end of such quarter,
and consolidated statements of income and cash flow of the Borrower and its
consolidated Subsidiaries each for the period commencing at the end of the
previous fiscal year and ending with the end of such quarter, certified (subject
to normal year-end adjustments) as to fairness and utilization of generally

Borrower, (i) declare the obligation of each Lender to make Advances to be
terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and (ii) declare the

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         SECTION 7.01.     Authorization and Action. Each Lender hereby appoints
and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
this Agreement (including enforcement of this Agreement or collection of the
Notes), the Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any
discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from
acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting)
upon the instructions of the Majority Lenders, and such instructions shall be
binding upon all Lenders and all holders of Notes; provided, however, that the
Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the
Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this
Agreement or applicable law. The Administrative Agent agrees to give to each
Lender prompt notice of

                                       75
<PAGE>
each notice given to it by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

whatsoever.

         SECTION 7.02.     Administrative Agent's Reliance, Etc.. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees
shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under
or in connection with this Agreement, except for its or their own gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the
foregoing, the Administrative Agent: (i) may treat the payee of any Note as the
holder thereof until the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an Assignment
and Acceptance entered into by the Lender which is the payee of such Note, as
assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in Section 8.07;
(ii) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the Borrower),
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (iii) makes
no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any
Lender for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written or
oral) made in or in connection with this Agreement; (iv) shall not have any duty
to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the
terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of the Borrower or
to inspect the property (including the books and records) of the Borrower; (v)
shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or
any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi) shall incur
no liability under or in respect of this Agreement by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telegram,
telecopy, cable or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the
proper party or parties.

         SECTION 7.03.     JPMorgan and Affiliates. With respect to its
Commitments, the Advances made by it and the Notes issued to it, JPMorgan shall
have the

                                       76
<PAGE>
same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise
the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent; and the term "Lender"
or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include JPMorgan in
its individual capacity. JPMorgan and its affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any
kind of business with, the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries and any Person who
may do business with or own securities of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, all as
if JPMorgan were not the Administrative Agent and without any duty to account
therefor to the other Lenders.

         SECTION 7.04.     Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that
it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01
and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its
own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement.

         SECTION 7.05.     Indemnification. THE LENDERS (OTHER THAN THE
DESIGNATED BIDDERS) AGREE TO INDEMNIFY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT (TO THE EXTENT
NOT REIMBURSED BY THE BORROWER), RATABLY ACCORDING TO THE RESPECTIVE PRINCIPAL
AMOUNTS OF THE ADVANCES THEN HELD BY EACH OF THEM (OR IF NO ADVANCES ARE AT THE
TIME OUTSTANDING OR IF ANY ADVANCES ARE HELD BY PERSONS WHICH ARE NOT LENDERS,
RATABLY ACCORDING TO THE RESPECTIVE AMOUNTS OF THEIR COMMITMENTS OR THE
RESPECTIVE AMOUNTS OF THEIR COMMITMENTS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO TERMINATION IF THE
COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN TERMINATED), FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES,

RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER
INSTRUMENT OR DOCUMENT FURNISHED PURSUANT HERETO OR IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR
ANY ACTION TAKEN OR OMITTED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, OR
ANY OF THE NOTES OR

                                       77
<PAGE>
ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT OR DOCUMENT FURNISHED PURSUANT HERETO OR IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH; PROVIDED THAT NO LENDER SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY PORTION OF SUCH
LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS, SUITS,
COSTS, EXPENSES OR DISBURSEMENTS RESULTING FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILFUL MISCONDUCT. Without limitation of the foregoing, each
Lender (other than the Designated Bidders) agrees to reimburse the
Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for such Lender's ratable share of any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the
Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings, in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, or
otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under,
this Agreement, any of the Notes or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto or in connection herewith to the extent that the Administrative
Agent acts in its capacity as Administrative Agent and is not reimbursed for
such expenses by the Borrower.

         SECTION 7.06.     Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and
the Borrower and may be removed at any time with or without cause by the
Majority Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders
shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no
successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority
Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the
retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority
Lenders' removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, then such retiring
Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized, or authorized
to conduct a banking business, under the laws of the United States of America or
of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative

                                       78
<PAGE>
Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Article 7 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

         SECTION 7.07.     Auction Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent shall until such time as it so notifies the Borrower and the Lenders
discharge its duties under Section 2.19 through the Auction Administrative Agent
and all references to the "Administrative Agent" or to JPMorgan relating to such
duties or made in this Article 7 shall be deemed to also refer to the Auction
Administrative Agent and any Affiliate of JPMorgan serving in such capacity. All
payments to be made to or by the Auction Administrative Agent shall be made
through the Administrative Agent.

Article 2 or 7 shall not be effective until received by the Administrative
Agent. A notice received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender by telephone
pursuant to Section 2.02(a) or 2.10(ii) shall be effective if the Administrative
Agent or Lender believes in good faith that it was given by an authorized
representative of the Borrower and acts pursuant thereto, notwithstanding the
absence of written confirmation or any contradictory provision thereof.

         SECTION 8.03.     No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder or under any Note preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The
remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided by law.

         SECTION 8.4.      Costs and Expenses; Indemnity.

         (a)      The Borrower agrees to pay on demand (i) all reasonable fees
and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for the Administrative Agent in connection
with the preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Notes and
the other documents to be delivered hereunder and with respect to advising the
Administrative Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under this Agreement,
(ii) all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and
its Affiliates in initially syndicating all or any portion of the Commitments
hereunder, including the related reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of
counsel for the Administrative Agent or its Affiliates, travel expenses,
duplication and printing costs and courier and postage fees, and excluding any
syndication fees paid to other parties joining the syndicate and (iii) all
out-of-pocket costs and expenses, if any, of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses and the allocated costs
of in-house counsel), in connection with the enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings, in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, or
otherwise) of this

                                       81
<PAGE>
Agreement, the Notes and the other documents to be delivered hereunder and
thereunder.

         (b)      If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any
Eurodollar Rate Advance is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a
Lender on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such
Advance, as a result of a prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10 or a Conversion
pursuant to Section 2.08(f) or Section 2.09 or due to acceleration of the
maturity of the Advances pursuant to Section 6.01 or due to any other reason
attributable to the Borrower, or if the Borrower shall fail to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Eurodollar Rate Advance on the date specified in any
notice delivered pursuant hereto, the Borrower shall, upon demand by such Lender
(with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to
compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses which it may
reasonably incur as a result of such payment or Conversion, including any loss
(excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of
the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any
Lender to fund or maintain such Advance.

         (c)      THE BORROWER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE ARRANGER AND EACH LENDER FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL
CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING FEES AND DISBURSEMENTS OF
COUNSEL) WHICH MAY BE INCURRED BY OR ASSERTED AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT,
THE ARRANGER OR SUCH LENDER IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF ANY
INVESTIGATION, LITIGATION, OR PROCEEDING (WHETHER OR NOT THE ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT, THE ARRANGER OR SUCH LENDER IS PARTY THERETO) RELATED TO ANY ACQUISITION
OR PROPOSED ACQUISITION BY THE BORROWER, OR BY ANY SUBSIDIARY OF THE BORROWER,
OF ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE EQUITY INTERESTS IN, OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL THE
ASSETS OF, ANY PERSON OR ANY USE OR PROPOSED USE OF THE ADVANCES BY THE BORROWER
(EXCLUDING ANY CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES OR EXPENSES INCURRED BY REASON OF
THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE PARTY TO BE INDEMNIFIED OR ITS
EMPLOYEES OR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENTS, OR BY REASON OF ANY USE OR DISCLOSURE OF
INFORMATION RELATING TO ANY SUCH ACQUISITION OR USE OR PROPOSED USE OF THE
PROCEEDS BY THE PARTY TO BE INDEMNIFIED OR ITS EMPLOYEES OR ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENTS).

<PAGE>
         SECTION 8.05.     Right of Set-off. Upon the declaration of the
Advances as due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01, each
Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the
account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower
now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and any Note held by such Lender,
irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this
Agreement or such Note and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and
application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of
each Lender under this Section 8.05 are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of set-off) which such Lender may have.

         SECTION 8.06.     Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective
in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.01, and thereafter shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
the Arranger and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except
that the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any
interest herein without the prior written consent of all of the Lenders.

         SECTION 8.07.     Assignments and Participations.

         (a)      Each Lender (other than a Designated Bidder) may assign to one
or more banks or other entities all or a portion of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment, the A
Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that
each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, and the parties to each
such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its
acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together
with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment and, except in the case of an
assignment to a Lender Affiliate, a

                                       83
<PAGE>
processing and recordation fee of $3,000, and shall send to the Borrower an
executed counterpart of such Assignment and Acceptance, and provided further,
however, that (i) the sum of (x) the amount of the Commitment of the assigning
Lender being assigned to the assignee pursuant to each such assignment
(determined as of the date of the Assignment) plus (y) the amount of the
"Commitment" of the assigning Lender under the Long-Term Revolving Credit
Agreement and/or the Canadian Credit Agreement contemporaneously assigned by
such assigning Lender to such assignee as contemplated by clause (iii) of this
sentence must be equal to or greater than $25,000,000, or if less, the entire
amount of such assigning Lender's "Commitment" (unless the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent shall otherwise consent, which consent may be withheld for
any reason) and must be an integral multiple of $1,000,000, (ii) any assignment
to a Lender Affiliate will not relieve the assigning Lender of its obligation to
make Advances hereunder timely in accordance with the terms hereof in the event
such Lender Affiliate shall fail to do so and (iii) except in the case of an
assignment to a Lender Affiliate or as required by the Borrower pursuant Section
2.21(d) or 2.22, each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying,
percentage of all such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
(other than any right to make B Advances, any B Advances or any Notes) and the
same constant percentage of all such Lender's rights and obligations, if any,
under the Long-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and the Canadian Credit Agreement
unless the Long-Term Revolving Credit Agreement or the Canadian Agreement, as
the case may be, has been terminated, shall be contemporaneously assigned by
such assigning Lender to the same assignee pursuant to Section 8.07(a) of the
Long-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and Section 9.07(a) of the Canadian Credit
Agreement. Upon the execution, delivery, acceptance and recording of each
Assignment and Acceptance by the parties thereto, from and after the effective
date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder
shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder
have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the
rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (y) except as otherwise
provided in clause (ii) above, the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it

                                       84
<PAGE>
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be
released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, except in the
circumstances contemplated by clause (ii) above, in the case of an Assignment
and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto, provided, however, that such assigning Lender shall retain any
claim with respect to any fee, interest, cost, expense or indemnity which
accrues, or relates to an event that occurs, prior to the date of such
assignment pursuant to Section 2.03, 2.06, 2.07, 2.11, 2.12, 2.15 or 8.04).

         (b)      By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, each
Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with
each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided
in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation
or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the
Borrower or the performance or observance by the Borrower of any of its
obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of
this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in
Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such assigning Lender or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking
action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is (subject to
approval in writing by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to the extent
required) an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such

                                       85
<PAGE>
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement
as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with
such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees
that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which
by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

         (c)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address
referred to in Section 8.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance, each
Designation Agreement, each New Lender Agreement and each Commitment Increase
Agreement delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders and, with respect to Lenders other than
Designated Bidders, the Commitment of, and principal amount of the A Advances
owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the
Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

         (d)      Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by
an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible
Assignee, together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the
Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed
and is in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto, (i) accept such Assignment
and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register
and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower. Within five Business Days
after its receipt of such notice and its receipt of an executed counterpart of
such Assignment and Acceptance, the Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute
and deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for any surrendered Note or
Notes a new Note to the order of such Eligible Assignee and, if the assigning
Lender has retained a Commitment hereunder, a new Note to the order of the
assigning Lender. Any such new Note or Notes shall be dated the effective date
of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the
form of Exhibit A hereto.

                                       86
<PAGE>
         (e)      Each Lender (other than a Designated Bidder) may designate one
or more banks or other entities to have a right to make B Advances as a Lender
pursuant to Section 2.19; provided that (i) such Lender shall have obtained the
written consent of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, (ii) no such Lender shall be entitled to make more
than two such designations, (iii) each such Lender making one or more of such
designations shall retain the right to make B Advances as a Lender pursuant to
Section 2.19, (iv) each such designation shall be to a Designated Bidder and (v)
the parties to each such designation shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, a
Designation Agreement. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording,
from and after the effective date specified in each Designation Agreement, the
designee thereunder shall be a party hereto with a right to make B Advances as a
Lender pursuant to Section 2.19 and the obligations related thereto.

         (f)      By executing and delivering a Designation Agreement, the
Lender making the designation thereunder and its designee thereunder confirm and
agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) such Lender
makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect
to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with
this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant hereto, (ii) such Lender makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition
of the Borrower or the performance or observance by the Borrower of any of its
obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto; (iii) such designee confirms that it has received a copy of
this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in
Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into the
Designation Agreement; (iv) such designee will, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such designating Lender or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall

                                       87
<PAGE>
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such designee confirms
that it is a Designated Bidder; (vi) such designee appoints and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise
such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by
the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto, and (vii) such designee agrees that it will perform in accordance with
their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are
required to be performed by it as a Lender.

         (g)      Upon its receipt of a Designation Agreement executed by a
designating Lender and a designee representing that it is a Designated Bidder,
the Administrative Agent shall, if such Designation Agreement has been completed
and is substantially in the form of Exhibit J hereto, (i) accept such
Designation Agreement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the
Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower.

         (h)      Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or
other entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment, and the Advances
owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such
Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including its Commitment to the
Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of
this Agreement, (iv) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (v)
such Lender shall continue to be able to agree to any modification or amendment
of this Agreement or any waiver hereunder without the consent, approval or vote
of any such participant or group of participants, other than modifications,
amendments and waivers which (A) postpone any date fixed for any payment of, or
reduce any payment of, principal of or interest on such Lender's Advances or any
facility fees or utilization fees payable under this Agreement, or (B) increase
the amount of such

                                       88
<PAGE>
Lender's Commitment in a manner which would have the effect of increasing the
amount of a participant's participation, or (C) reduce the interest rate payable
under this Agreement and such Lender's Advances, or (D) consent to the
assignment or the transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations
under the Agreement, and (vi) except as contemplated by the immediately
preceding clause (v), no participant shall be deemed to be or to have any of the
rights or obligations of a "Lender" hereunder.

         (i)      Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment, designation
or participation or proposed assignment, designation or participation pursuant
to this Section 8.07, disclose to the assignee, designee or participant or
proposed assignee, designee or participant, any information relating to the
Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided
that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee, designee or participant or
proposed assignee, designee or participant shall agree in writing for the
benefit of the Borrower to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential
information relating to the Borrower received by it from such Lender in a manner
consistent with Section 8.08.

         (j)      Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of
its rights under this Agreement (including the Advances owing to it) and the
Notes, if any, issued to it hereunder in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in
accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (or any successor regulation) and the applicable operating circular of
such Federal Reserve Bank.

         SECTION 8.08.     Confidentiality. Each Lender and the Administrative
Agent (each, a "PARTY") agrees that it will use its best reasonable efforts not
to disclose, without the prior consent of the Borrower (other than to its, or
its Affiliates, employees, auditors, accountants, counsel or other
representatives, whether existing at the Original Effective Date or any
subsequent time), any information with respect to the Borrower which is
furnished pursuant to this Agreement, provided that any party may disclose any
such information (i) as has become generally available to the public,

                                       89
<PAGE>
(ii) as may be required or appropriate in any report, statement or testimony
submitted to any municipal, state or Federal regulatory body having or claiming
to have jurisdiction over such party or to the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or similar
organizations (whether in the United States or elsewhere) or their successors,
(iii) as may be required or appropriate in response to any summons or subpoena
or in connection with any litigation or regulatory proceeding, (iv) in order to
comply with any law, order, regulation or ruling applicable to such party, or
(v) to any prospective assignee, designee or participant in connection with any
contemplated assignment of any rights or obligations hereunder, any designation
or any sale of any participation therein, by such party pursuant to Section
8.07, if such prospective assignee, designee or participant, as the case may be,
executes an agreement with the Borrower containing provisions substantially
similar to those contained in this Section 8.08; provided, however, that the
Borrower acknowledges that the Administrative Agent has disclosed and may
continue to disclose such information as the Administrative Agent in its sole
discretion determines is appropriate to the Lenders from time to time.

         SECTION 8.09.     Consent to Jurisdiction.

         (a)      The Borrower hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of
any New York State or Federal court sitting in New York City and any appellate
court from any thereof in any action or proceeding by the Administrative Agent,
the Arranger, any Lender or the holder of any Note in respect of, but only in
respect of, any claims or causes of action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Notes (such claims and causes of action, collectively, being
"PERMITTED CLAIMS"), and the Borrower hereby irrevocably agrees that all
Permitted Claims may be heard and determined in such New York State court or in
such Federal court. The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any aforementioned court in respect
of Permitted Claims. Service of the summons and complaint and any other process
which may be served by the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, any Lender or the
holder of any Note on the Borrower in

                                       90
<PAGE>
any such action or proceeding in any aforementioned court in respect of
Permitted Claims may be made by delivering separate copies of such process to
the Borrower by courier and by certified mail (return receipt requested), fees
and postage prepaid at the Borrower's address specified pursuant to Section
8.02, to the attention of each of the Treasurer and the Executive Vice
President, Law. The Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

         (b)      Nothing in this Section 8.09 (i) shall affect the right of the
Arranger, the Borrower, any Lender, the holder of any Note or the Administrative
Agent to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect any
right otherwise existing of the Borrower, any Lender, the Arranger, the holder
of any Note or the Administrative Agent to bring any action or proceeding in the
courts of other jurisdictions or (ii) shall be deemed to be a general consent to
jurisdiction in any particular court or a general waiver of any defense or a
consent to jurisdiction of the courts expressly referred to in subsection (a)
above in any action or proceeding in respect of any claim or cause of action
other than Permitted Claims.

         SECTION 8.10.     Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York.

         SECTION 8.11.     Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. Delivery to the Administrative Agent of a counterpart executed by a
Lender shall constitute delivery of such counterpart to all of the Lenders.
Delivery of an executed counterpart by facsimile shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed original counterpart.

         SECTION 8.12.     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF

                                       91

THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT OR DOCUMENT FURNISHED PURSUANT HERETO OR IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

         SECTION 8.13      Entire Agreement, Etc.. This Agreement, together with
any other documents executed in connection herewith, express the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby. Neither this Agreement nor any term hereof may be changed, waived,
discharged or terminated, except as provided in Section 8.01.

The applicable pricing level shall change on the date of any relevant change in
the rating by S&P or Moody's of any public long term senior unsecured debt
securities of the Borrower. In the case of split ratings from S&P and Moody's,
the rating to be used to determine the applicable pricing level is the higher of
the two (e.g., A-/Baa1 results in Level II pricing), provided that in the event
the split is more than one full category, the average (or the higher of two
intermediate ratings) shall be used (e.g., A-/Baa2 results in Level III pricing,
as does A-/Baa3).
