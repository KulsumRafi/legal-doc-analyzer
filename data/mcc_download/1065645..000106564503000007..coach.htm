If the deceased, dissolved, retired, incompetent or bankrupt Limited Partner's Partnership Interest passes to a successor in interest of such Limited Partner, such successor in interest shall succeed to the deceased, dissolved, retired, incompetent or bankrupt Limited Partner's entire Partnership Interest and shall become a limited Partner of Partnership, with the same obligations with respect to contributions to the capital of the Partnership, the same rights in and to all distributions made by the Partnership in liquidation or otherwise and the same share of the Partnership's net profits or net losses as the deceased, dissolved, retired, incompetent or bankrupt Limited Partner had with respect to his interest in the Partnership. If a successor in interest of a Limited Partner is admitted to the Partnership as a limited Partner hereunder, such successor shall promptly, upon demand of the Partnership, execute and deliver to the Partnership all documents that may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of counsel for the Partnership, to reflect his admission to the Partnership as a limited Partner and his agreement to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</P>

<U><P>Section 13.</U>&#9;<U>Regulatory Provisions</U>.</P>

<P>The Partnership is authorized to execute a Note and Mortgage in order to secure a loan from the Fl-IA Mortgagee to be insured by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (the "Secretary") and to execute a Regulatory Agreement and other documents required by the Secretary in connection with such loan. Any incoming Partner shall, as a condition of receiving an interest in the Partnership property, agree to be bound by the Note, Mortgage and Regulatory Agreement and other documents required in connection with the FHA-insured loan to the same extent and on the same terms as the other Partners. Upon any dissolution, no title or right to possession and control of the Property, and no right to collect the rents therefrom, shall pass to any person who is not bound by the Regulatory Agreement in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary.</P>

<U><P>Section 14.</U>&#9;<U>Riggs Agreement - Payment of Fees</U>.</P>

<P>(a)&#9;<U>Explanation; Intention</U>.</P>

<P>(1)&#9;IGC LP, IBC, the Partnership and Riggs have entered into the Riggs Agreement which, among other things, obligates IGC LP, IBC and the Partnership to potentially pay certain fees to Riggs to the extent funds to pay such fees are not available from the FHA Loan proceeds. Riggs has agreed to make its credit available at a floating rate of interest rather than the ten percent (10%) fixed rate of interest contemplated by the FHA Commitment. Accordingly, the Riggs Agreement provides for the payment of certain discounts or charges in lieu of interest in order to provide the agreed-upon interest rate yield to Riggs (&quot;Interest Charges&quot;). In addition, the FHA Commitment contemplates that the FHA Loan will mature 40 years after commencement of amortization, but Riggs has only agreed to make its credit available to the Partnership for approximately 3 years. At or before the end of the 3-year period, Riggs intends to sell or assign the FHA Loan to another FHA Mortgagee. Accordingly, the Riggs Agreement provides for the payment of permanent loan discounts or financing fees upon the sale and assignment of the FHA Loan (&quot;Permanent Loan Discount&quot;).</P>

<P>(2)&#9;All such Interest Charges and Permanent Loan Discounts are referred to herein as "Riggs Financing Fees&quot;. The term Permanent Loan Discount shall also mean any such discount payable by the Partnership in connection with any subsequent sale or assignment of the FHA Loan.</P>

<P>(3)&#9;It is the intention of the parties that all Riggs Financing Fees shall be payable out of the amounts available under the FHA Loan to pay interest ($343,705) and financing fees ($206,223 of which $147,302 will remain available following initial closing of the FHA Loan, $58,921 being payable to Riggs at initial closing). To the extent monies available from the FHA Loan for interest and financing fees together with Interim Income or other operating income of the Partnership are inadequate to pay Riggs Financing Fees, IBC shall make Working Capital Loans to the Partnership to pay such fees, as more particularly provided below.</P>

<P>(b)&#9;<U>Payment of Riggs Financing Fees Prior to HUD Cut-Off Date</U>.</P>

<P>(1)&#9;To the extent that the average interest rate payable to Riggs exceeds ten percent (10%) prior to the cut-off date for HUD Cost Certification purposes, IBC will make a Working Capital Loan to the Partnership to fund such additional Interest Charges.</P>

<P>(2)&#9;To the extent that any Permanent Loan Discount is payable prior to the cut-off date for HUD Cost Certification purposes and the financing fees remaining available from the FHA Loan proceeds ($147,302) are inadequate to pay such Permanent Loan Discount, IBC will make a Working Capital Loan to the Partnership to fund the deficiency.</P>

<P>(c)&#9;<U>Special Distribution of Financing Fee Savings</U>. If the aggregate amount of Riggs Financing Fees paid or payable prior to the cut off date for HUD cost certification purposes is less than the aggregate amount available under the FHA Loan to pay interest ($343,705) and financing fees ($206,223), and provided such savings do not result in a mortgage reduction, such savings shall be used and distributed as follows:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>i.&#9;First, to be paid to IBC in repayment of any Working Capital Loans (interest and other charges, and principal) previously made by IBC pursuant to the preceding <U>Section 14(b)</U>; and</P>

<P>ii.&#9;Second, to cover other hard and soft costs of completing construction of the Improvements not otherwise covered under the FHA Loan; and</P>

<P>iii.&#9;Third, to be paid to IGC LP as a return of capital pursuant to <U>Section 10(f)</U>.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Savings used and distributed under subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) above shall constitute &quot;Financing Fee Savings&quot;. IGC LP shall be obligated to contribute to the Partnership an amount equivalent to the Financing Fee Savings in order to pay subsequent Riggs Financing Fees in accordance with <U>Section 14(d</U>) below.</P>

<P>(d)&#9;<U>Payment of Permanent Loan Discount After HUD Cut-Off Date</U>. Any Permanent Loan Discount payable after the cut-off date for HUD cost certification purposes shall be paid out of Capital Contributions to be made by IGC LP as provided in the preceding <U>Section 14(c)</U>. To the extent such Capital Contributions are insufficient, such Permanent Loan Discount shall next be paid, to the extent practicable out of the operating income of the Partnership.  To the extent operating income and such Capital Contributions of IGC LP are insufficient, IBC shall make a Working Capital Loan to the Partnership to pay such Permanent Loan Discount.</P>

<P>(e)&#9;<U>Premium</U>. If any premium is paid to the Partnership in connection with the sale of the FHA Loan by Riggs to another FHA Mortgagee, or in connection with any subsequent sale of the FHA Loan to yet another FHA Mortgagee, the Partnership shall make a special distribution of such premium to IGC LP.</P>

<U><P>Section 15.  Miscellaneous Provisions</U>.</P>

<P>(a)&#9;<U>Liability</U>. Except for the required Capital Contributions and for the loans under <U>Section 5</U> and <U>Section 14</U> hereof, no Partner shall be liable to any other Partner or to the Partnership by reason of its actions or omissions to act in connection with the Partnership, except for fraud, bad faith or gross negligence.</P>

<P>(b)&#9;<U>No Agency</U>. Except as provided herein, nothing herein contained shall be construed to constitute any Partner hereof the agent of any other Partner hereof or to limit in any manner any Partner in the carrying on of its own respective businesses or activities. Any Partner may engage in and/or possess any interest in other business ventures of every nature and description, independently or with others, whether existing as of the date hereof or hereafter coming into existence; and neither the Partnership nor any Partner hereof shall have any rights in or to any such independent ventures or the income or profits derived therefrom.</P>

<P>(c)&#9;<U>Power of Attorney</U>. Notwithstanding <U>Section 15(b)</U>, each Partner does hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint the Managing General Partner its true and lawful attorney, in its name, place and stead, to make, execute, consent to, swear to, acknowledge, record and file:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(1)&#9;A Certificate of Limited Partnership under the applicable laws of the State of Maryland, and under the applicable laws of any other jurisdiction in which the Managing General Partner deems such filing to be necessary or desirable; and</P>

<P>(2)&#9;Any certificate or other instrument which may be required to be filed by the Partnership or the Partners under the laws of the State of Maryland and/or under the applicable laws of any other jurisdiction to the extent the Managing General Partner deems such filing to be necessary or desirable; and</P>

<P>(3)&#9;Any and all amendments, restatements or modifications of this Agreement or to any other certificate or other instrument described above; and</P>
<B>
</B><P>(4)&#9;All certifications and other instruments which may be required to effectuate the dissolution and termination of the Partnership pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>However, no such amendment, restatement or modification shall increase the liability of any Limited Partner beyond the liability of the Limited Partner expressly set forth in this Agreement. It is expressly understood, intended and agreed by each of the Partners for itself and its successors and assigns that the grant of the power of attorney to the Managing General Partner pursuant to <U>Section 15(c</U>) is coupled with an interest, is irrevocable and shall survive the death or legal incompetency of the Partner or the assignment of its interest in the Partnership.</P>

<P>(d)&#9;<U>Arbitration</U>. Unless otherwise provided herein, it is understood and agreed by and among the parties hereto that as a condition precedent to any litigation with respect to any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or a breach hereof or thereof, any such claim or controversy shall, upon the request of any party involved, be submitted to and settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (or any other form of arbitration mutually acceptable to the parties involved) then obtaining in the State of Maryland. The decision made pursuant to such arbitration shall be binding and conclusive on all parties involved; and judgment upon such decision may be entered in any Federal or state forum having general jurisdiction.</P>

<P>(e)&#9;<U>Notices</U>. All notices provided for herein shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and first-class postage prepaid, to the address of the Partners as shown in <U>Exhibit A</U>, unless notice of a change of address is given to the Partnership pursuant to the provisions of this <U>Section 15(e)</U>. Time periods shall commence on the date of mailing of such notice. Any notice which is required to be given within a stated period of time shall be considered timely given if actually delivered within such period or if postmarked three (3) days prior to the last day of such period.</P>

<P>(f)&#9;<U>Meetings; Consents</U>. Any action of the Partnership or by the Managing General Partner requiring the approval of all or a specified portion of all Partners may be obtained at a meeting of the Partnership, held not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days after notice to the Partners of the time, place and subject matter of the meeting, or, in lieu thereof, such approval may be obtained by written consents signed by all or the specified portion of all Partners in lieu of a meeting.</P>

<P>(g)&#9;<U>Delay</U>. Unless otherwise provided to the contrary in this Agreement, where this Agreement requires the approval or consent of any Partner, such consent or approval is not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.</P>
<B>
</B><P>(h)&#9;<U>Integration</U>. This Agreement Bets forth all (and is intended by all parties hereto to be an integration of all) of the promises, agreements, conditions, understandings, warranties and representations among the parties hereto with respect to the Partnership, the Partnership business and the Partnership Assets, and there are no promises, agreements, conditions, understandings, warranties or representations, oral or written, express or implied, except as are set forth herein.</P>

<P>(i)&#9;<U>Modifications</U>. No change or modification of this Agreement, specifically including (but not limited to) this <U>Section 15(i)</U>, shall be valid or binding upon the Partners, nor shall any waiver of any term or condition in the future, unless such change, modification or waiver shall be in writing and signed by all of the Partners, either personally or pursuant to the power of attorney provided in <U>Section 15(c)</U>.</P>

<P>(j)&#9;<U>Bankrupt</U>. The terms &quot;bankruptcy&quot; and &quot;bankrupt&quot; and derivations thereof, shall be deemed to refer not only to an adjudication of bankruptcy under the Federal Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended or superseded, but also to an adjudication of insolvency under any state or local insolvency statute or procedure.</P>

<P>(k)&#9;<U>Governing Law</U>. It is the intention of the parties hereto that all questions with respect to the construction, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement and the rights and liabilities of the parties hereto shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland.</P>

<P>(1)&#9;<U>Severability</U>. This Agreement is intended to be performed in accordance with, and only to the extent permitted by, all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall, for any reason and to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby, but rather shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law.</P>

<P>(m)&#9;<U>Duplicate Originals</U>. For the convenience of the Partners, any number of counterparts hereof may be executed, and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original instrument.</P>

<P>(n)&#9;<U>Captions and Cross References</U>. The titles of the Sections and Subsections herein have been inserted as a matter of convenience for reference only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of the terms or provisions herein. Any reference in this Agreement to an &quot;Exhibit,&quot; a &quot;Section,&quot; or a &quot;Sub3~ction&quot; shall, unless otherwise explicitly provided, be construed as referring, respectively, to an Exhibit attached to this Agreement as in effect from time to time, a Section of this Agreement, or a Subsection of the Section of this Agreement in which the reference appears. All Exhibits attached to or referred to in this Agreement are incorporated by reference into this Agreement.</P>

<P>(o)&#9;<U>No Reliance</U>. The provisions of this Agreement, including but not limited to the provisions of <U>Section 5</U> relating to the capital of the Partnership, are not intended to be for the benefit of any creditor or other person (other than a Partner in its capacity as a Partner) to whom any debts, liabilities or obligations are owed by (or who otherwise has any claim against) the Partnership or any of the Partners; and no such creditor or other person shall obtain any right under any such provision against the Partnership or any of the Partners by reason of any debt, liability or obligation (or otherwise).</P>

<P>(p)&#9;<U>Partition</U>. Each of the Partners does hereby agree to waive and does hereby waive any right it may have to cause the Partnership Assets or any part thereof to be partitioned or to file a complaint or to institute any proceeding at law or in equity to cause the Partnership Assets or any part thereof to be partitioned.</P>

<P>(q)&#9;<U>Statutes and Regulations</U>. Any reference in this Agreement to a statute or regulation shall be deemed to include all amendments to and successors to such statute or regulation, whether adopted before or after the date of this Agreement.</P>

<P>(r)&#9;<U>Binding Effect</U>. This Agreement is binding upon, and insures to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors and (subject to the provisions of <U>Section</U> 11 hereof) assigns.</P>

<P>&#9;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Partners have caused their respective appropriate officers of partners, as the case may be, to execute, seal and deliver this Agreement hereunto affixed their signatures and seals as of the date and year first above written.</P>
