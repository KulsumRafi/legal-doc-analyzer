                            STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

                          Dated as of December 29, 2002

         The parties to this Agreement (this "Agreement") are Hub U.S. Holdings,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Buyer"), and Fifth Third Financial Corp., an
Ohio corporation (the "Seller").

         WHEREAS, the Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock (the "Shares") of Fifth Third Insurance Services, Inc. (the "Company"), an
Indiana corporation; and

         WHEREAS, the Buyer desires to purchase all of the Shares, and the
Seller desires to sell all of the Shares to the Buyer, upon and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth below.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the Buyer and the Seller hereby agree as follows:

         1. The Purchase. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, the Seller shall sell, assign, transfer,
convey and deliver the Shares to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase the
Shares, free and clear of any Encumbrances. The Seller will deliver to the Buyer
at the Closing on the Closing Date (i) one or more certificates representing all
of the Shares, which stock certificates shall be duly endorsed in blank for
transfer and shall be presented with stock powers duly executed in blank, and
(ii) such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Buyer to effect a
valid transfer of the Shares by the Seller to the Buyer.

         2. Purchase Price.

               2.1 As consideration for the Shares, the Buyer shall pay the
Seller a purchase price equal to the sum of (a) the Fixed Amount Component, plus
(b) the Cash Component, plus (c) the Accounts Receivable Component, minus (d)
the Payables Component (the "Purchase Price").

               2.2 On the Closing Date, the Buyer is delivering to the Seller,
by wire transfer or certified bank check, an agreed-upon estimate of the
Purchase Price, subject to final adjustment in accordance with the provisions
hereof, in the amount of $37,000,000, which amount is (a) the Fixed Amount
Component ($37,000,000), plus (b) Estimated Cash Component ($473,033), plus (c)
the Estimated Accounts Receivable Component ($6,166,220), minus (d) the
Estimated Payables Component ($6,639,253).

               2.3 Purchase Price Adjustment

                    (a) On or before March 31, 2003, the Buyer will prepare and
deliver to the Seller financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year of
the Company ending on December 31, 2002 including schedules showing the
calculations of the Cash Component, the


<PAGE>

Accounts Receivable Component, the Payables Component and Agency Revenue as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2002 (collectively, the "Closing Financial
Statements"). The Closing Financial Statements shall be prepared on the basis of
United States generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied
("GAAP"). If within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Closing Financial
Statements, the Seller has not given the Buyer written notice of the Seller's
objection to the Closing Financial Statements (which notice shall state the
basis for the Seller's objection), then the Closing Financial Statements shall
be binding and conclusive on the parties and shall be used in computing any
adjustment to the Purchase Price provided in this Section 2.3 and in Section
2.5. If the Seller duly gives the Buyer such notice of objection, and if the
Buyer and the Seller fail to resolve the issues outstanding with respect to the
Closing Financial Statements within ten (10) business days of receipt of notice
of such objection, then the Buyer and the Seller shall submit the issues
remaining in dispute to Ernst & Young (the "Independent Accountants") for
resolution. The determination by the Independent Accountants shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the parties. The Seller and the Buyer will each bear
fifty percent (50%) of the fees and costs of the Independent Accountants for
such determination.

                    (b) For all purposes of calculating the Estimated Accounts
Receivable Component and the Accounts Receivable Component, Accounts Receivable
aged ninety (90) days or over on the Closing Date (the "Non-Valued Receivables")
will be deemed to have no value and such Non-Valued Receivables shall not be
taken into account in determining the Purchase Price.

                    (c) If the actual Accounts Receivable Component determined
in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this Section 2.3 exceeds the Estimated
Accounts Receivable Component, then the Buyer shall pay the Seller the
difference between such amounts. If the Estimated Accounts Receivable Component
exceeds the actual Accounts Receivable Component, then the Seller shall pay the
Buyer the difference between such amounts.

                    (d) If the actual Cash Component determined in accordance
with subparagraph (a) of this Section 2.3 exceeds the Estimated Cash Component,
then the Buyer shall pay the Seller the difference between such amounts. If the
Estimated Cash Component exceeds the actual Cash Component, then the Seller
shall pay the Buyer the difference between such amounts.

                    (e) If the actual Payables Component determined in
accordance with subparagraph (a) of this Section 2.3 exceeds the Estimated
Payables Component, then the Seller shall pay the Buyer the difference between
such amounts. If the Estimated Payables Component exceeds the actual Payables
Component, then the Buyer shall pay the Seller the difference between such
amounts.

                    (f) Any net payment required to be made pursuant to
subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e) above shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within ten (10) business days of the final
determination of the Closing Financial Statements pursuant to subparagraph (a)
above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Seller gives the Buyer a
notice of objection that indicates that a portion of such net payment is not in
dispute, then the undisputed portion of the payment shall be made by the Seller
or the Buyer, as the case may be, within ten (10) business days after the notice
of objection is delivered by the Seller to the Buyer.

               2.4 Accounts Receivable Payments.

                    (a) On the date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, the Buyer will deliver to the Seller a detailed statement setting forth
the then uncollected amounts of Accounts Receivable which were ascribed a value
in determining the Purchase Price (the "Valued Receivables") and which, despite
commercially reasonable efforts of the Buyer after the Closing Date (including
the application, subject to applicable Law, with respect to each customer of
amounts received from such customer to the oldest then outstanding Accounts
Receivable from such customer aged less than 365 days at the time of such
receipt), shall have not yet then been collected in full by the Buyer. The
Seller shall pay the Buyer a cash amount equal to the uncollected face amount of
the Valued Receivables within ten (10) business days after receipt of such
statement by the Seller;

                    (b) Within fifteen (15) business days after the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall assign to the Seller, for no consideration, the Non-Valued
Receivables. In addition, to the extent that the Buyer shall have received
payment from the Seller under Section 2.4(a) with respect to any of the Valued
Receivables, the Buyer shall assign, for no additional consideration, the Valued
Receivables as to which such payment has been received from the Seller. The
Buyer and the Seller will consult with respect to their respective collection
efforts, so as to develop collection processes and procedures that are
reasonable under all of the circumstances.

                    (c) With respect to the Valued Receivables as to which
payment has been received from the Seller under Section 2.4(a) and with respect
to the Non-Valued Receivables, if any of such Valued or Non-Valued Receivables
are subsequently collected by the Buyer within six (6) months of the Closing
Date, the Buyer will pay to the Seller the amount of any such collection,
subject to a reasonable deduction for interest accrued on the Valued Receivables
until, and costs associated with, the collection of the Valued and the
Non-Valued Receivables.

               2.5 Client Retention Adjustment.

                    (a) If the excess, if any, of (i) $26,337,000 over (ii) the
Agency Revenue reflected on the Closing Financial Statements is $1 million or
more, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer the product of (i) such excess in its
entirety and (ii) 1.4. Such payment, if any, shall be made promptly in
immediately available funds by the Seller to the Buyer, after the Closing
Financial Statements are final.

                    (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Agency Revenue" means,
as derived from the Closing Financial Statements, revenue generated by the
Business from fees, volume overrides, commissions and contingent profits for the
calendar year

               2.6 [RESERVED]

               2.7 Closing. Except as otherwise mutually agreed upon by the
Buyer and the Seller, the Closing shall occur no later than December 31, 2002,
subject to satisfaction or waiver of each condition to Closing.

               3.4 No Violations; Consents and Approvals.

                    (a) The execution, delivery and performance of each of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents by the Seller do not, and the
consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not:
(i) violate any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the
Seller or the Company, (ii) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to

the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
guarantee, other evidence of indebtedness, license, lease, option, employment
agreement, contract, undertaking, understanding, covenant, agreement or other

                    (b) No filing or registration with, notification to, or

otherwise as are set forth on Schedule 3.4(b) hereof (the "Required Consents").

               3.5 Financial Statements.

                    (a) Attached to Schedule 3.5(a) is the balance sheet of the
Company as of November 30, 2002 (the "Latest Balance Sheet"), together with the
related unaudited statements of income for the eleven-month period ended
November 30, 2002 ("Interim Financial Statements") and the unaudited balance
sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, together
with the related unaudited statements of income (including the related notes, if
any) for the two fiscal years then ended (together, with the Latest Balance
Sheet and the Interim Financial Statements, the "Regular Financial Statements").

                    (b) The Regular Financial Statements have been prepared by
the Company and have been derived from, and agree with, the books and records of
the Company and fairly present the financial position of the Company as of the
respective dates thereof and the results of operations of the Company for the
respective periods set forth therein. The Regular Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP as of the dates and for the periods involved,
subject to the absence of notes and, in the case of the Latest Balance Sheet and
the related statements of operations for the interim period, to normal fiscal
year-end adjustments



                                       5

Business, the Excluded Assets and the Excluded Liabilities and (ii) the
reclassification of certain accounts payable, accounts receivable and other
assets as set forth on Schedule 3.5(c). The Pro Forma Adjusted Balance Sheet was
prepared in accordance with GAAP based upon, and agrees with, the Interim
Financial Statements and the books and records of the Company, was prepared in
good faith and fairly presents the financial condition of the Company as of
December 26, 2002 after giving effect to said adjustments and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.


               3.6 Operation of Business. (a) Since the date of the Latest
Balance Sheet, the Company has continued to operate the Business in a manner and
system of operation employed immediately prior to the date of the Latest Balance
Sheet, and the Company has used its best efforts to prevent harm or damage to

of any proprietorship, firm, association, corporation or other business
organization or division thereof; (x) except in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, increased the compensation payable, or to become
payable, to any of its directors or employees, or made any bonus payment or
similar arrangement with any directors or employees or increased the scope or
nature of any fringe benefits provided for its employees or directors; (xi) made
any capital investment in, any loan to or any acquisition of the securities or
assets of any other person; (xii) canceled, compromised, waived or released any
material right or claim; (xiii) made any change in employment terms for any of
its directors, officers or employees outside the ordinary course of business;
(xiv) made or pledged to make any charitable contribution or other capital
contribution outside the ordinary course of business; (xv) violated any Law, if
such violation could have resulted in a material adverse effect on the condition
(financial or otherwise), business, assets, results of operations or prospects
of the Company (a



                                       6
<PAGE>

"Material Adverse Effect"), or failed to maintain all governmental licenses and
approvals required to operate its business as currently being conducted; or
(xvi) agreed or committed, whether in writing or otherwise, to do any of the
foregoing other than pursuant to the Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. In addition, since the date of the Latest
Balance Sheet the Company has not accelerated, terminated, modified or canceled
any material agreement, contract, lease or license to which it is a party or by
which it or its assets are bound.

                    (c) Since the date of the Latest Balance Sheet, no event,
condition or circumstance has occurred that could, or could be reasonably likely
to, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business.

               3.7 No Undisclosed Liabilities.

                    (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.7(a), the Company has
no liabilities (whether accrued, contingent, known, or otherwise) other than
those that (i) are set forth or reserved against on the Latest Balance Sheet; or
(ii) were incurred in the operation of the Business since the date of the Latest
Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business.

                    (b) The accounts payable of the Company set forth in the
Latest Balance Sheet or arising subsequent thereto are the result of bona fide
transactions in the ordinary course of business.

               3.8 Litigation; Compliance with Law; Licenses and Permits.

                    (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.8(a), there is no
claim, suit, action, investigation or proceeding (each, a "Proceeding") pending,
nor is there any Proceeding threatened, that involves or affects the Company, by
or before any Governmental Entity, court, arbitration panel or any other Person.

                    (b) The Company has since January 2000, and on the Closing
Date will have, complied with all applicable Laws, including but not limited to
Laws relating to Taxes, zoning, building codes, antitrust, occupational safety
and health, industrial hygiene, environmental protection, water, ground or air
pollution, the generation, handling, treatment, storage or disposal of Hazardous
Substances, consumer product safety, product liability, hiring, wages, hours,
employee benefit plans and programs, collective bargaining and the payment of
withholding and social security taxes, except for any non-compliance that did
not have or will not have a Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2000, the
Company has not received any notice of any violation of any Law.

                    (c) The Company has every license, permit, certification,
qualification or franchise issued by any Governmental Entity (each, a
"License"), and every Consent by or on behalf of any Person that is not a party
to this Agreement, required for it to conduct its business as presently
conducted. All such Licenses and Consents are in full force and effect and
neither the Company nor the Seller has received notice of any pending
cancellation or suspension of any thereof nor is any cancellation or suspension
thereof threatened. The applicability and validity of each such License and
Consent will not be adversely affected by the consummation of the transactions

(including, without limitation, the Payroll Practices) which any of the Seller,
the Company or an ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) has sponsored, maintained
or contributed to, or to which such entities have or have had any obligation or
any liability of any nature on or before the Closing for the benefit of any
employees of the Company (and their beneficiaries) (individually a "Plan" or
collectively the "Plans") have been administered in all respects in accordance
with its terms, and any of the Company, the Seller or any ERISA Affiliate (as
the case may be) has met its obligations with respect to such Plan.. For

post-retirement compensation which has been sponsored, maintained or contributed
to, by any of the Company, the Seller or any ERISA Affiliate, or for which the
Company, Seller or any ERISA Affiliate has or has had any obligation or any

<PAGE>

manager, consultant, or other independent contractor with respect to any Listed
Plan, (J) any notification to any employee of his rights under ERISA Section 601
et seq. and Section 4980B of the Code, (K) any notice that was given by any of
the Company, the Seller or any ERISA Affiliate or any Plan to the IRS, the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC"), or any participant or
beneficiary, pursuant to statute, within the four (4) years preceding the
Closing Date, including notices that are expressly mentioned elsewhere in this
Agreement, and (L) any notices that were given by the IRS, the PBGC, or the
Department of Labor to the Company, the Seller or any ERISA Affiliate, or any
Listed Plan within the four (4) years preceding the Closing Date. Each of the
Company, the Seller and each ERISA Affiliate and Plan is in compliance (both in
form and operation) in all respects with the currently applicable provisions of
ERISA and the Code and the regulations thereunder, and other applicable laws to
the extent required.

                    (b) There are no termination proceedings with respect to any
of the Plans (excluding any Payroll Practices). There are no claims (except
claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the Plan and proceedings
with respect to qualified domestic relations orders), suits or proceedings
against or involving any Plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits
under any Plan that could give rise to any liability. To the Seller's, each
ERISA Affiliate's and Company's knowledge, there are no investigations by any
governmental entity involving any Plan.

                    (c) To the knowledge of any of the Company, the Seller and
any ERISA Affiliate, there are no threatened audits, investigations, claims,
suits, grievances or other proceedings, involving, directly or indirectly, any
Plan, or any rights or benefits thereunder (except claims for benefits payable
in the normal operation of the Plan and proceedings with respect to qualified
domestic relations orders).

                    (d) The Plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code have received determination letters from the IRS to
the effect that such Plans are qualified and the plans and the trusts related
thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the Code. No such determination letter has been revoked and
revocation has not been threatened.

                    (e) No Plan is or has been a multiemployer plan. The Company
does not have any liability or obligation of any nature to any Employee Benefit
Plan, the PBGC or any other person, arising directly or indirectly under Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No "reportable event" within the meaning
of Section 4043 of ERISA for which reporting is not waived has occurred with
respect to any Plan that would in any manner give rise to liability or
obligation to the Company or Buyer. None of the Company, the Seller or any ERISA
Affiliate has ceased operations at any facility which has subjected or could
subject the Company or Buyer to any liability or obligation under Sections
4062(e), 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. None of the Company, the Seller or any ERISA
Affiliate currently has any obligation, to make any withdrawal liability payment
to any Employee Benefit Plan which is a multiemployer plan, but only if such
withdrawal liability payment has resulted or could result in any liability or
obligation to the Company or Buyer. None of the Company, the Seller or any ERISA
Affiliate has been a party to a sale of assets to which Section 4204 of ERISA
applied with respect to which it could incur any withdrawal liability (including
any contingent or secondary withdrawal liability) to any multiemployer plan, but
only to the extent that any such liability has subjected or


                                       9
<PAGE>

could subject to the Company or Buyer to any liability or obligation. None of
the Company, the Seller, or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or has experienced
an event that may, within the ensuing twelve (12) months, result in a "complete
withdrawal" or "partial withdrawal" as such terms are defined in Sections 4203
or 4205 of ERISA and nothing has occurred that could result in such a complete
or partial withdrawal, but only to the extent that any such withdrawal has
subjected or could subject to the Company or Buyer to any liability or
obligation. None of the Company, the Seller or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred
a decline in contributions to any multiemployer plan such that, if the current
rate of contributions continues, a seventy percent (70%) decline in
contributions (as defined in Section 4205 of ERISA) will occur within the next
three plan years, but only to the extent that any such decline in contributions
has subjected or could subject the Company or Buyer to any liability or
obligation.

                    (f) No act or omission has occurred and no condition exists
with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan maintained by the Company, Seller or
an ERISA Affiliate that would subject either Buyer or the Company to any fine,
penalty or Taxes.

                    (g) To the knowledge of the Company, the Seller and each
ERISA Affiliate, neither the Company, the Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate, or any
plan fiduciary of any employee welfare benefit plan or employee pension benefit
plan has engaged in any transaction in violation of Section 406(a) or (b) of
ERISA or any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975(c)(1) of the
Code), which could subject the Company, the Seller or the Buyer to any Taxes,
penalties or other liabilities resulting from such prohibited transaction.

                    (h) There are no unfunded obligations which have subjected
or could subject the Company or Buyer to any liability or obligation under any
Employee Benefit Plan providing benefits after termination of employment of any
employee of the Company, the Seller or any ERISA Affiliate (or to any
beneficiary of any such employee), including but not limited to, any retiree
health coverage and deferred compensation, but excluding continuation of health
coverage required to be continued under Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA") and
insurance conversion privileges under state law. No written or oral
representations have been made to any employee or former employee of the Company
promising or guaranteeing any employer payment or funding for the continuation
of medical, dental or disability coverage beyond that legally required. No
unwritten amendment exists with respect to any Plan.

                    (i) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.9(i), no Plan which is
legally or otherwise assumed by Company or Buyer on or after the Closing as a
result of the consummation of this Agreement, including those set forth in
Section 5.16 ("Assumed Plan") is funded by, associated with, or related to a
"voluntary employee's beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code, a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section
419 of the Code, a "qualified asset account" within the meaning of Section 419A
of the Code or a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" within the meaning of
Section 3(40) of ERISA. No Plan which is an employee welfare benefit plan is a
multiemployer plan.

                    (j) No plan documentation or agreement, summary plan
description or other written communication distributed generally to employees
prohibits the Company, the Seller or any ERISA Affiliate from amending or
terminating any Assumed Plan.



                                       10
<PAGE>

                    (k) None of the assets of any Assumed Plan include any
securities issued by the Company, the Seller or any ERISA Affiliate; provided
however, some Plans referred to in Section 5.16 may include such securities.

                    (l) "Severance Plans" shall mean (i) each agreement with any
employee or director of the Company (A) the benefits of which are contingent, or
the terms of which are altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving
the Company, the Seller or an ERISA Affiliate of the nature of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) providing any term of
employment or compensation guarantee or (C) providing severance benefits or
other benefits after the termination of employment of such employee or director;
(ii) each agreement, plan or arrangement under which any person may receive
payments from the Company, the Seller or any ERISA Affiliate that has subjected
or could subject the Buyer or Company to the Taxes imposed by Section 4999 of
the Code or included in the determination of such person's parachute payment
under Section 280G of the Code; and (iii) each agreement, plan or arrangement,
including without limitation any stock option plan, stock appreciation right
plan, restricted stock plan, stock purchase plan or severance benefit plan which
has subjected or could subject the Buyer or Company to any liability or
obligation. None of the Severance Plans which are Assumed Plans provide that any
of the benefits under such Severance Plans will be increased, nor will the
vesting of the benefits under such Severance Plans which are Assumed Plans be
accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement nor will the value of any of the benefits under such Severance Plans
which are Assumed Plans be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No payments under any Severance Plans or other
agreement will be parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code that are
non-deductible to the Company or the Buyer or subject to Taxes under Section
4999 of the Code.

                    (m) Schedule 3.9(m) sets forth a reasonable estimate of the
Company's accrued liability for vacation, sickness and disability expenses
through and including the Closing Date.

                    (n) None of the assets of any Assumed Plan is or has been
invested in any property constituting employee real property or any employee
security within the meaning of Section 407(d) of ERISA; provided, however, some
of the Plans referred to in Section 5.16 may include employer securities.

                    (o) On and after the Closing Date and except as otherwise
provided in Section 5.16, neither Company nor Buyer will have any liability or
be under any obligation with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan (excluding
Payroll Practices which are assumed or otherwise adopted by the Company or the
Buyer after Closing Date).

                    (p) Full payment has or will, prior to the Closing Date,
have been made of all amounts which the Company, the Seller or any ERISA
Affiliate is directly or indirectly required, under applicable law, the terms of
any Plan or any agreement relating to any Plan to have paid as a contribution,
premium or other remittance thereto or benefit thereunder if such payment has a
deadline on or before the Closing Date. The Company, the Seller and each ERISA
Affiliate has made adequate provisions for reserves or accruals in accordance
with GAAP to meet contribution, benefit or funding obligations arising under
applicable law or the


                                       11
<PAGE>

terms of any Plan or related agreement. There will be no change on or before the
Closing Date in the operation of any Plan or any documents with respect thereto
which will result in an increase in the benefit under such plans, except as may
be required by law.

                    (q) The Company, the Seller and each ERISA Affiliate have
timely complied with all reporting and disclosure obligations with respect to
the Plans imposed by the Code, ERISA or other applicable law.

                    (r) The transactions contemplated herein will not result in
the acceleration of accrual, vesting, funding or payment of any contribution or
benefit under any Employee Benefit Plan which could subject the Company or Buyer
to any liability or obligation.

                    (s) No action or omission of the Company, the Seller, any
ERISA Affiliate or any director, officer, employee, or agent thereof in any way
restricts, impairs or prohibits the Buyer, the Seller or the Company or any
successor thereof from amending, merging, or terminating any Assumed Plan in
accordance with the express terms of any such plan and applicable law.

                    (t) To the knowledge of the Company, any Seller or ERISA
Affiliate, the actuarial report for a Plan fairly presents the financial
condition and the results of operations of each such Plan in accordance with
GAAP as of the date stated therein.

                    (u) Each Assumed Plan covers only employees of the Company
(or former employees or beneficiaries with respect to service with each such
Company or Subsidiary), so that except as provided in Section 5.16, the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement will require no spin-off of assets or
other division or transfer of rights with respect to any such plan.

                    (v) The Company does not now, nor has it ever, had the
obligation to maintain, establish, sponsor, participate in, or contribute to any
International Employee Plan. International Employee Plan shall mean any Employee
Benefit Plan (determined without regard to whether such plan is subject to
ERISA) that has been adopted or maintained by the Company, the Seller or any
ERISA Affiliate, whether formally or informally, or with respect to which the
Company, the Seller or any ERISA Affiliate will or may have any liability, for
the benefit of any employees who perform services outside of the United States.

               3.10 Real Property.

                    (a) The Company owns no real property.

                    (b) Schedule 3.10(b) contains a true, correct and complete
list and summary of all Leases under which the Company uses or occupies or has
the right to use or occupy, now or in the future, any Leased Real Property. The
Company has heretofore delivered to the Buyer true and correct copies of all
Leases with parties that are not Affiliates to the Seller. Each such Lease is in
full force and effect, is enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance
with its terms, all rent and other sums and charges payable by the Company
thereunder are current, no termination event or condition or default which has
remained uncured beyond applicable cure periods on the part of the Company or
any other Person exists under any such Lease, and no event has occurred and no
condition exists which, with the giving of notice or


                                       12
<PAGE>

the lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default or termination event
or condition. Except to the extent set forth in Schedule 3.10(b), no such Lease
has been amended, modified or extended as of the date hereof. The Company is in
possession of and quietly enjoys the Leased Real Property applicable to it and
the Company has a valid and enforceable leasehold interest, subject to no Title
Defects except such immaterial easements and rights-of-way, none of which
interferes with the operation of the business. The Company has not entered into
any assignment of any Lease, sublease of all or any portion of any Leased Real
Property and no Person has any right to occupy the Leased Real Property other
than the Company.

                    (c) There has been no service, material or other work
provided or supplied to the Leased Real Property that has not been paid in full.

thereof and all septic service and water supply facilities required for the
present use of the Leased Real Property are properly and fully installed and
operating and (iii) all curb cut and street opening permits or licenses required
for vehicles access to and from and part of the Leased Real Property to any
adjoining public street have been obtained and if required, paid for by the
Company and are in full force and effect. The Company has obtained all necessary
governmental approvals to build and operate its septic system which system was
built by a company licensed for the construction of septic systems. There is no
Leased Real Property of any kind whatsoever used by the Company in its business,
except for the Leased Real Property, and the Leased Real Property constitutes
all of the Leased Real Property necessary to conduct such business as presently
conducted.

                    (e) All Approvals in connection with the construction, use,
occupancy and maintenance of any Leased Real Property of all governmental
authorities or from all insurance companies and fire rating and similar boards
and organizations required to have been issued to enable the Leased Real
Property to be lawfully occupied and used for all of the purposes for which it
is presently occupied now and lawfully issued and are in full force and effect
in accordance with the respective terms thereof, and none of the Approvals has
been amended, assigned, pledged or otherwise transferred. There is no
alteration, improvement or change in use of any building or other improvement
located on the Leased Real Property that would require any new Approvals or
amendment of an existing Approval. The condition and use of the Leased Real
Property conforms to each Approval. The Company and the Leased Real Property is
in compliance with all Leased Real Property Laws or any public health, public
safety, sewage, water or sanitation Law, any Environmental Law or any Title
Defect affecting the Leased Real Property, and no notice of any such default or
violation has been received by the Company or the Seller. The Company has
obtained all of the approvals necessary for the operation of its business on the
Leased Real Property. The Leased Real Property and its continued use, occupancy
and operation as currently used, occupied or operated does not constitute a
non-conforming use under any Leased Real Property Law and the continued
existence, use, occupancy and operation of the Leased Real Property and the
right and ability to repair and/or rebuild any improvements thereon in the event
of a casualty, is not dependent on any special permit exception, approval or
variance.

tax certiorari proceeding with respect to any Leased Real Property or (vii)
changes in road patterns or grades that may adversely affect access to any roads

                    (h) Neither the Company nor the Seller have received notice
from any insurance company or Board of Fire Underwriters (or organization
exercising functions similar thereto) or from any mortgagee requesting the
performance of any work or alteration in respect of any of the Leased Real
Property, and there are no outstanding requirements or recommendations from any
of the foregoing.

                    (m) The Company does not owe any monies to any contractor,
subcontractor, materialman or other Person for labor or materials performed,
rendered or


                                       14

                    (p) Each parcel of Leased Real Property is an independent
unit which does not rely or depend on land, improvements, drainage, rights of
way, easements, utility lines or equipment, sewer service, access to public
ways, parking, structural or other facilities located on any Leased Real
Property not forming part of the Leased Real Property to satisfy or comply with
any Leased Real Property Laws or to sustain its current operations at the
subject location.

Delaware. The Buyer has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on
its business as now being conducted, except, as to subsidiaries, for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing
individually or in the aggregate would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the

standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,

transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly
authorized by the board of directors of the Buyer and no other corporate

Agreements by the Buyer, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated

has been duly executed and delivered by the Buyer, and is a valid and binding
obligation of the Buyer, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,
except that the enforceability hereof may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect
relating to creditors' rights generally, and that the remedy of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to
the equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any

consummation by the Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
will not, (i) violate any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws of the Buyer, (ii) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to

conditions or provisions of any material Contract to which the Buyer is a party
or by which the Buyer or any of its respective properties or assets may be bound
or otherwise subject to, or (iii) violate any Law applicable to the Buyer, or

                    (a) The Seller covenants and agrees that, for a period of
five (5) years following the Closing Date (the "Prohibited Period"), the Seller
and its Affiliates will not directly or indirectly, alone or as a partner, joint
venturer or otherwise, engage in the insurance agency business anywhere in the
United States, other than (i) pursuant to an agreement with the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, and (ii) such activities undertaken for the purposes of
operating the Excluded Business.

                    (b) The Seller covenants and agrees that, during the
Prohibited Period, the Seller and its Affiliates will not directly or
indirectly, employ, hire, engage or be associated with Mr. Roger Forystek, or
(other than through advertisements to the general public) solicit any


                                       23
<PAGE>

Person (including Mr. Roger Forystek) who was employed by, or acted as an
independent contractor or consultant for, the Company during the twelve (12)
months prior to the Closing Date or is employed by, or acts as a sales
representative for, the Company at any time during the seven-year period from
and after the Closing Date.

                    (c) Notwithstanding the above, if at any time during the
Prohibited Period, the Seller or any of its Affiliates should acquire the stock
or assets of another Person (through a purchase of stock or assets, merger,
consolidation or otherwise), the provisions of Section 5.1(a) shall not preclude
the Seller or its Affiliate from continuing, through such acquired Person, to
engage in operations that would otherwise breach Section 5.1(a) so long as
Seller divests or otherwise discontinues the competitive activity as soon as
commercially practicable, but in any event no later than twelve (12) months from
the closing of the acquisition. If the Seller elects to divest such operations
(which election shall be made within six months of the closing of such
acquisition), then the Seller or one of its Affiliates shall notify the Buyer of
such election to divest and for a period of twenty (20) business days following
the Buyer's receipt of a notice from Seller or one of its Affiliates (the
"Negotiation Period), the Seller shall, if the Buyer desires, negotiate
exclusively with the Buyer in good faith in an attempt to reach agreement upon
the terms and conditions of such sale to the Buyer. If, at the end of the
Negotiation Period, the parties have not reached an agreement with respect to
such sale to the Buyer, the Seller's obligations under this Section to negotiate
exclusively with the Buyer shall terminate and the Seller may elect to proceed
with a third party suitor on whatever terms and conditions as it determines in
its sole discretion; provided that if the Seller fails to complete such sale
within six months following the end of the Negotiation Period, then this Section
shall apply again.

                    (d) Notwithstanding the above, a Competitive Acquirer may
continue its competitive activity after it acquires control of a majority of the
capital stock of the Seller or an Affiliate of Seller in a sale of stock or
merger, except that: (a) the Competitive Acquirer may not, directly or
indirectly, engage through the then existing branch network of the Seller and
its Affiliates in activity which would be a breach of Section 5.1(a); and (b) if
the Competitive Acquirer is not, prior to the sale of stock or merger,
conducting competitive activity within 50 miles from where the Company conducts
its business, then this Section 5.1 shall prohibit the Competitive Acquirer from
engaging in competitive activity within such area.

                    (e) The Seller covenants and agrees that it will not, at any
time during the Prohibited Period (except that with respect to trade secrets,
the undertakings in this Section 5.1(e) shall be applicable without any time
limitation after the date hereof), disclose, directly or indirectly, or make
available to any person, or in any manner use for its own benefit, any
confidential information or trade secrets relating to the Business, or any
information concerning the Seller's or the Buyer's or the Company's financial
condition, prospects, customers, franchisees, licensees, suppliers, sources of
leads and methods of obtaining new business, distribution methods or any other
methods of doing and operating the Business, except to the extent that such
information is or becomes, through no action of the Seller, a matter of public
knowledge or is required to be disclosed by law, or in any proceedings involving
the Seller for which its counsel informs the Seller that such disclosure is
required by law (in which case prior to such disclosure the disclosing party
shall promptly provide prior written notice of such


                                       24
<PAGE>

required disclosure to the Buyer in order to afford the Buyer the opportunity to
seek an appropriate protective order preventing such disclosure).

         The Buyer covenants and agrees that it will not (and will cause its
Affiliates not to), at any time during the Prohibited Period (except that with
respect to trade secrets, the undertakings in this Section 5.1(e) shall be
applicable without any time limitation after the date hereof), disclose,
directly or indirectly, or make available to any person, or in any manner use
for its own benefit, any confidential information or trade secrets relating to
the Excluded Business, or any information concerning the Seller's or its
Affiliates financial condition, prospects, customers, franchisees, licensees,
suppliers, sources of leads and methods of obtaining new business, distribution
methods or any other methods of doing and operating the Excluded Business,
except to the extent that such information is or becomes, through no action of
the Buyer or one of its Affiliates, a matter of public knowledge or is required
to be disclosed by law, or in any proceedings involving the Buyer for which its
counsel informs the Buyer that such disclosure is required by law (in which case
prior to such disclosure the disclosing party shall promptly provide prior
written notice of such required disclosure to the Seller in order to afford the
Seller the opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order preventing such
disclosure) and except to the extent that such information as is required to

days thereafter (or for a shorter period, at the Buyer's option) ("Continuation
Coverage Period"), the Buyer and Company hereby adopt plans identical in
substantive benefits to the Seller's Health Plans ("Buyer's Health Plans") (but
not any flexible or dependent care


                                       30
<PAGE>

spending accounts) only for the benefit of Company employees (and their eligible
dependents), effective on the Closing; provided, that the Buyer's Health Plans
shall in all cases for purposes of the Code and ERISA be treated as a separate
plan spun-off from the Seller's Health Plans. Buyer and Company hereby adopt as
of the Closing the respective Seller's Health Plans documents to serve as the
plan documents which document the Buyer's Health Plans, provided, however, that
(i) the name of the Seller shall be deleted from the Buyer's Health Plans, (ii)
the Company shall be substituted in each and every place where the name of the
Seller appeared and was deleted, (iii) notwithstanding any provision in the
Buyer's Health Plans to the contrary, only employees (and their eligible
dependents) of the Company shall be eligible to participate in the Buyer's
Health Plans, and (iv) all elections made under the Seller's Health Plans by
participants before Closing may (in the sole discretion of the Buyer timely
communicated to Seller) continue to apply under the Buyer's Health Plans as if
such elections were made under the Buyer's Health Plans. The proper officers of
Buyer are authorized, empowered, and directed to take such action or amend such
other plans of Buyer or Company as may be necessary to transition the employees
of the Company into any other of Buyer's or Company's health plans at the end of
the Continuation Coverage Period, including, without limitation, the
establishment or amendment of any new benefit programs or plans for employees of
Company, and any such benefit programs, plans or amendments are adopted by the
Company and Buyer without further action.


             Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 5.16 to the contrary,
Buyer shall use its best efforts commencing on Closing Date to secure long-term
disability coverage and health and dental coverage for the Company employees
under another of Buyer's plans within thirty (30) days from the date of Closing.
The proper officers of the Buyer and Seller shall be and are authorized,
empowered and directed to take all action and to cooperate with each other with
regard to the Buyer's Health Plans.

         Each and all of the Buyer's Health Plans shall terminate as determined
by a proper officer of Buyer within sixty (60) days of the Closing, or if no
officer terminates such Buyer's Health Plans within that sixty (60) day period,
each of the Buyer's Health Plans, respectively, shall automatically terminate at
the end of the sixtieth (60th) day following the Closing, or if earlier, the
date that alternative coverage with respect to each of the respective Buyer's
Health Plans is secured as provided in the directly preceding paragraph.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Buyer's cafeteria plan established
pursuant to this Section 5.16 shall terminate as determined by a proper officer
of the Buyer at any time during or at the end of the sixty (60) day Continuation
Coverage Period. For the Continuation Coverage Period, the Seller shall provide
such reasonable administrative services under the Buyer's Health Plans as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer for such period.

         The Buyer shall reimburse the Seller for the actual premiums incurred
by Seller with respect to third-party insurers only, as shown on the books and
records of the Seller and determined on the date of Closing under the Seller's
Health Plans, which premiums shall equal the amount withheld from participants'
salary for payment of benefits under the Buyer's Health Plans and an additional
amount equal to Seller's portion of such applicable premium. Such reimbursement
shall be made by the Buyer to the Seller promptly after the Seller submits to
the Buyer evidence satisfactory to the Buyer as to such premiums; provided,
however, that Buyer shall have the right to offset or set-off from any amounts
due under this paragraph an amount


                                       31
<PAGE>

equal to the amounts which may be due to Buyer from Seller under the directly
following paragraph.

         Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Seller shall indemnify Buyer fully and completely (100%) from the first dollar
($1) for all claims for benefits incurred by Buyer or Company under the Buyer's
Health Plans attributable to the Continuation Coverage Period, but only the
extent such claims under the Buyer's Health Plans are not satisfied by a
third-party insurer or provider unrelated to Buyer or the Company; provided,
however, between the thirty-first (31st) day of the Continuation Coverage Period
and the last day of the Continuation Coverage Period, inclusive, instead of a
100% indemnification by Seller, the Seller shall indemnify the Buyer in an
amount equal to 50 cents ($.50) for each dollar of claims (from the first dollar
($1)) for benefits claimed under the Buyer's Health Plans. Such indemnification
shall be made by the Seller to the Buyer promptly after the Buyer submits to the
Seller evidence satisfactory to the Buyer as to such claims.

          Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.16, the employees (and
their dependents and beneficiaries) of the Company shall no longer be active
participants or eligible for benefits in any Employee Benefit Plan of Seller or
Seller's ERISA Affiliates after the Closing Date; provided, however that the
employees of the Company shall be treated as (i) employed by the Company, (ii)
active participants and (iii) eligible for benefits under each and every Plan
(and for all Plan purposes) for the entire Closing Date, regardless of when
Closing actually occurs during that day.

         The Seller agrees to cooperate, at the reasonable request of the Buyer,
and the Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller with respect to any reasonable
request made to Buyer, regarding the transfer of all or any portion of a Plan to
the Buyer on or after the Closing, and the Seller agrees, at the reasonable
request of Buyer, to amend any Plan to the extent necessary to effectuate
distribution of plan benefits to employees of the Company, but only to the
extent that the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
would not otherwise cause or permit full and complete distribution of benefits
under such Plan on or after the Closing to employees of the Company.

         All employees of the Company on short-term disability on the date of
Closing shall continue as employees of the Seller on and after the Closing Date
until such employee's first return to employment with the Company after the
Closing Date.

               5.17 Other Actions. Each of the parties hereto shall use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, do, or cause to
be done, all things, and execute and deliver all documents, as in each case may
be necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or reasonably required
in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Buyer
and the Seller will, and will each cause its representatives to, deliver all
documents required to be delivered at the Closing by such persons and entities
as required and as set forth in Article 6 hereof.

               5.18 Release. As part of its post-Closing retention and
compensation program, the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain


                                       32
<PAGE>

from each employee of the Company an executed general release of claims against
Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Company) in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Buyer and the Seller.

               7.5 Limitations on Liability.

                    (a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall not be
obligated to indemnify and hold harmless any Buyer Indemnitee from Damages under
clause (a) of Section 7.3 (which are not also Damages under clauses (b) through
(i) of Section 7.3) unless and until the aggregate amount of such Damages
exceeds $200,000, and the Buyer shall not be obligated to indemnify and hold
harmless any Seller Indemnitee from Damages under clause (a) of Section 7.4
(which are not also Damages under clauses (b) through (d) of Section 7.4) unless
and until the aggregate amount of such Damages exceeds $200,000. The aggregate
indemnification liability of the Seller for Damages under clause (a) of Section
7.3 (which are not also Damages under clauses (b) through (i) of Section 7.3)
shall not exceed the Purchase Price.

                    (b) Any indemnification payment made pursuant to this
Agreement in respect of any claim (i) shall be net of any insurance proceeds
realized by and paid to the indemnified party in respect of such claim; and (ii)
shall be reduced by an amount equal to any tax benefits attributable to such
claim, and increased by an amount equal to any taxes attributable to the receipt
of such payment, but only to the extent that such tax benefits are actually
realized, or such taxes are actually paid, as the case may be, by the Seller or
by the Buyer or by any consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which the
Buyer or the Seller is a member. The indemnified party shall use its reasonable
efforts to make insurance claims relating to any claim for which it is seeking
indemnification pursuant to this Section. Any indemnity payment under this
Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the purchase price.

               7.6 Indemnification Procedures.

                    (a) Promptly after notice to an indemnified party of any
claim or the commencement of any Proceeding, including any Proceeding by a third
party, such indemnified party shall, if a claim for indemnification in respect
thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to this Article 7,
give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such claim or
Proceeding, setting forth in reasonable detail the nature thereof and the basis
upon which such party seeks indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that
the failure of any indemnified party to give such notice shall not relieve the
indemnifying party of its obligations under such section, except to the extent
that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by the failure to give such
notice.

                    (b) In the case of any such Proceeding by a third party
against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall, upon notice as
provided above, assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the indemnified party, provided, however, that (i) the indemnifying party
provides the indemnifying party with a written representation to the effect that
the indemnified party has sufficient financial resources to satisfy the amount
of any adverse monetary judgment that is reasonably likely to result; (ii) the
liability claim solely seeks (and continues to seek) monetary damages; and (iii)
the indemnifying party expressly agrees in writing that, as between the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be
solely obligated to satisfy and discharge the liability claim in accordance with
this Agreement (the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) are
collectively referred to as the "Litigation Conditions") and, after notice from
the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its assumption of the defense
thereof and compliance with the


                                       38
<PAGE>

Litigation Conditions, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such
indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof (but the indemnified
party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate at its own
cost and expense in such defense by counsel of its own choice) or for any
amounts paid or foregone by the indemnified party as a result of the settlement
or compromise thereof (without the written consent of the indemnifying party).
Anything in this Section 7.6 (b) notwithstanding, if both the indemnifying party
and the indemnified party are named as parties or subject to such Proceeding and
either such party determines with advice of counsel that there may be one or
more legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to
those available to the other party or that a material conflict of interest
between such parties may exist in respect of such Proceeding, then the
indemnifying party may decline to assume the defense on behalf of the
indemnified party or the indemnified party may retain the defense on its own
behalf, and, in either such case, after notice to such effect is duly given
hereunder to the other party, the indemnifying party shall be relieved of its
obligation to assume the defense on behalf of the indemnified party, but shall
be required to pay any legal or other expenses including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred by the indemnified party
in such defense.

                    (c) If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of any
such Proceeding, the indemnified party shall cooperate fully with the
indemnifying party and shall appear and give testimony, produce documents and
other tangible evidence, allow the indemnifying party access to the books and
records of the indemnified party and otherwise assist the indemnifying party in
conducting such defense. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the
indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
or compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all
liability in respect of such claim or Proceeding. If the indemnifying party
shall (x) fail promptly and diligently to assume the defense of any Proceeding,
or (y) the Litigation Conditions cease to be met, then the indemnified party may
respond to, contest and defend against such Proceeding and may make in good
faith any compromise or settlement with respect thereto, and recover from the
indemnifying party the entire cost and expense thereof including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements and all amounts paid or
foregone as a result of such Proceeding, or the settlement or compromise
thereof. The indemnification required hereunder shall be made by periodic
payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or
defense, as and when bills or invoices are received or loss, liability,
obligation, damage or expense is actually suffered or incurred.

                    (d) The liability of an indemnifying party to indemnify the
indemnified party for Damages shall be limited to claims as to which the
indemnified party has given written notice on or prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival periods set forth in Section 7.1.

               7.7 No Double Recovery. The Buyer shall not be entitled to
indemnification to the extent that it is compensated as part of an adjustment
under Section 2.3(c).
