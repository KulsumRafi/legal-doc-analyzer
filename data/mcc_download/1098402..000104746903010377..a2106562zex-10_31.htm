<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Employment Separation Agreement and Release (the "Agreement") is being entered into between VIA NET.WORKS,&nbsp;INC. ("VIA") and Karl A. Maier
("Executive") effective as of this 21st day of February&nbsp;2003. For and in consideration of the mutual promises contained in this Agreement, and for other good and sufficient consideration,
receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, VIA and Executive (sometimes referred to in this Agreement as the "parties") agree as follows: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination of Employment and Payment.  </B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive's
employment with VIA and all its subsidiaries shall end on June&nbsp;30, 2003 (the "Separation Date"). On or before March&nbsp;31, 2003, VIA will release
Executive from his responsibilities as President and Chief Operating Officer (the "Leave Date"). On and effective as of his Leave Date, Executive shall resign from all boards, committees and all
offices and positions he holds with VIA and its subsidiaries, including without limitation his position as President and Chief Operating Officer. To the extent that Executive holds any other offices
or positions with VIA as of his Leave Date, Executive's resignation on that date shall constitute a resignation from any such other offices or positions. Executive agrees to execute and deliver to VIA
any formal written resignations requested by VIA to document the resignations described herein. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;From
the Leave Date (if prior to March&nbsp;31, 2003) through March&nbsp;31, 2003, Executive shall provide executive-level services to VIA as may reasonably be
requested by VIA's Chief Executive Officer from time to time. After March&nbsp;31 and through the Separation Date, Executive will make himself reasonably available for consultation on matters
involving VIA and its business with VIA's Chief Executive Officer and other officers, employees and agents of VIA that the Chief Executive Officer may delegate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive
shall be paid at his current base salary rate, including his Foreign Assistance Payment, through the Separation Date. Executive will use all unused and accrued
vacation time before June&nbsp;30, 2003, and shall be entitled to no vacation or leave benefit or payment after that date. Executive's health insurance, life insurance, disability benefits, vacation
or other paid leave, and all other benefits provided or funded by VIA will terminate as of Separation Date. All such payments shall be in accordance with VIA's usual payroll practices and policies and
shall be less standard deductions for federal, state, and local taxes, subject to Part Two of the VIA International Assignment Policy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive
shall be eligible for a bonus for calendar year 2002 in accordance with his Employment Agreement dated as of July&nbsp;1, 2002 ("Employment Agreement") and
VIA's bonus policy in effect for that year, and which payment, shall be made at the time and in accordance with VIA practice for payment of annual bonuses. The amount of the bonus to be paid shall be
60% of his base salary, subject to completion of the audit of VIA's 2002 results and approval by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Executive shall also be eligible for a bonus for
the first three months of 2003 in accordance with VIA policy and subject to satisfactory completion of personal objectives established by VIA. This bonus payment shall be made at such time as all
other VIA employee bonuses for the first quarter 2003 are paid. All bonus payments shall be less standard deductions and withholdings. Executive will not be eligible for any bonus program or payment
with respect to any period beginning after March&nbsp;31, 2003, except as specifically contemplated above. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;From
and after the Separation Date, Executive shall not be eligible to participate in any VIA benefit plan, including, but not limited to, VIA-provided
dental and medical insurance, the retirement and 401(k) plan, vacation leave, sick leave, long-term disability insurance, life insurance, or personal accident insurance. However, nothing
in this Paragraph shall prevent Executive from participating in a COBRA continuation coverage program (and any similar state health care continuation coverage program). </FONT></P>

any successor to such plan) and is not waiving any claims under VIA's health plan, stock option plan or other benefit plans or any claims for indemnification or under VIA's director and officer or
other insurance policies to which Executive may be entitled to coverage. Executive agrees, without limiting the generality of the above release, not to file any claim or lawsuit seeking damages or
other relief and asserting any claims that are lawfully released in this Paragraph. Executive further hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any and all rights to recover any relief and damages
concerning the claims that are lawfully released in this Paragraph. Executive represents and warrants that he has not previously filed or joined in any such claims against VIA or any of its affiliates
or subsidiaries, and that he has not given or sold any portion of any claims released herein to anyone else, and that he will indemnify and hold harmless the persons and entities released herein from
all liabilities, claims, demands, costs, expenses and/or attorneys' fees incurred as a result of any such assignment or transfer. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph&nbsp;2, the parties
agree that the foregoing release is not a release of Executive's rights or claims under or specifically preserved in this Agreement, nor is it a release of any claims with respect to events that occur
after the date that Executive signs this Agreement. </FONT></P>
