Eurodollar Advance, the Interest Period applicable thereto from time to time.
The Borrower shall give the Agent irrevocable notice (a "Borrowing Notice") not
later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least one Business Day before the
Borrowing Date of each Floating Rate Advance and three Business Days before the
Borrowing Date for each Eurodollar Advance, specifying:

                  (a) the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
         Advance,

                  (b) the aggregate amount of such Advance,

                  (c) the Type of Advance selected, and

                  (d) in the case of each Eurodollar Advance, the Interest
         Period applicable thereto.

Not later than noon (Chicago time) on each Borrowing Date, each Lender shall
make available its Loan or Loans in funds immediately available in Chicago to
the Agent at its address specified pursuant to Article 13. The Agent will make
the funds so received from the Lenders available to the Borrower at the Agent's
aforesaid address.

         2.9. Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances. Floating Rate
Advances shall continue as Floating Rate Advances unless and until such Floating
Rate Advances are converted into Eurodollar Advances pursuant to this Section
2.9 or are repaid in accordance with Section 2.7. Each Eurodollar Advance shall
continue as a Eurodollar Advance until the end of the then applicable Interest
Period therefor, at which time such Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically
converted into a Floating Rate Advance unless (x) such Eurodollar Advance is or
was repaid in accordance with Section 2.7 or (y) the Borrower shall have given
the Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice (as defined below) requesting that,
at the end of such Interest


                                       15

<PAGE>

Period, such Eurodollar Advance continue as a Eurodollar Advance for the same or
another Interest Period. Subject to the terms of Section 2.6, the Borrower may
elect from time to time to convert all or any part of a Floating Rate Advance
into a Eurodollar Advance. The Borrower shall give the Agent irrevocable notice
(a "Conversion/Continuation Notice") of each conversion of a Floating Rate
Advance into a Eurodollar Advance or continuation of a Eurodollar Advance not
later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least three Business Days prior to the
date of the requested conversion or continuation, specifying:

                  (a) the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
         conversion or continuation,

                  (b) the aggregate amount and Type of the Advance which is to
         be converted or continued, and

                  (c) the amount of such Advance which is to be converted into
         or continued as a Eurodollar Advance and the duration of the Interest
         Period applicable thereto.

         2.10. Changes in Interest Rate, etc. Each Floating Rate Advance shall
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and
including the date such Advance is made or is automatically converted from a
Eurodollar Advance into a Floating Rate Advance pursuant to Section 2.9, to but
excluding the date it is paid or is converted into a Eurodollar Advance pursuant
to Section 2.9 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate for such
day. Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained
as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in
the Alternate Base Rate. Each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such
Interest Period at the interest rate determined by the Agent as applicable to
such Eurodollar Advance based upon the Borrower's selections under Sections 2.8
and 2.9 and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof. No Interest Period
may end after the Facility Termination Date.

         2.11. Rates Applicable After Default. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 2.8, 2.9 or 2.10, during the continuance of a
Default or Unmatured Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by
notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the
Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring
unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that no
Advance may be made as, converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Advance.
During the continuance of a Default the Required Lenders may, at their option,
by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the
Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring
unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that (a)
each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable
Interest Period at the rate otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus 2%
per annum, (b) each Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to the Floating Rate in effect from time to time plus 2% per annum
and (c) the LC Fee shall be increased by 2% per annum, provided that, during the
continuance of a Default under Section 7.6 or 7.7, the interest rates set forth
in clauses (a) and (b) above and the increase in the LC Fee set forth in clause
(c)


                                       16

<PAGE>

above shall be applicable to all Credit Extensions without any election or
action on the part of the Agent or any Lender.

         2.12. Method of Payment. All payments of the Obligations hereunder
shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately
available funds to the Agent at the Agent's address specified pursuant to
Article 13, or at any other Lending Installation of the Agent specified in
writing by the Agent to the Borrower, by noon (local time) on the date when due
and shall (except in the case of Reimbursement Obligations for which the LC
Issuer has not been fully indemnified by the Lenders, or as otherwise
specifically required hereunder) be applied ratably by the Agent among the
Lenders. Each payment delivered to the Agent for the account of any Lender shall
be delivered promptly by the Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that
the Agent received at its address specified pursuant to Article 13 or at any
Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the Agent from such
Lender. The Agent is hereby authorized to charge the account of the Borrower
maintained with Bank One for each payment of principal, interest, Reimbursement
Obligations and fees as it becomes due hereunder. Each reference to the Agent in
this Section 2.12 shall also be deemed to refer, and shall apply equally, to the
LC Issuer, in the case of payments required to be made by the Borrower to the LC
Issuer pursuant to Section 2.19(f).

         2.13. Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness.

                  (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
         practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the
         Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender
         from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest
         payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

                  (b) The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will
         record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and
         the Interest Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any
         principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from
         the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, (iii) the original stated amount
         of each Facility LC and the amount of LC Obligations outstanding at any
         time, and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder
         from the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

                  (c) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant
         to paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be prima facie evidence of the
         existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided,
         however, that the failure of the Agent or any Lender to maintain such
         accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
         obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with
         their terms.

                  (d) Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by a
         promissory note (a "Note"). In such event, the Borrower shall prepare,
         execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such
         Lender in a form supplied by the Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced
         by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (prior to any
         assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be represented by one or more
         Notes payable to the order of the payee named therein, except to the
         extent that any such Lender subsequently


                                       17

<PAGE>

         returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans
         once again be evidenced as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) above.

         2.14. Telephonic Notices. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders
and the Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of
Types of Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any
person or persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on
behalf of the Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is
specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices and Conversion/Continuation
Notices to be given telephonically. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to
the Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent
or any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer. If the
written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by
the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern
absent manifest error.

         2.15. Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Interest accrued
on each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing
with the first such date to occur after the date hereof and at maturity.
Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the last day of
its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar Advance is
prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued
on each Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months
shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such
Interest Period. Interest, commitment fees and LC Fees shall be calculated for
actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest shall be payable
for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount
paid if payment is received prior to noon (local time) at the place of payment.
If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a
day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension
of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.

         2.16. Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and
Commitment Reductions. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify
each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice,
Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received
by it hereunder. Promptly after notice from the LC Issuer, the Agent will notify
each Lender of the contents of each request for issuance of a Facility LC
hereunder. The Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to
each Eurodollar Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and
will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.

         2.17. Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans and its
participation in any LC Obligations and the LC Issuer may book the Facility LCs
at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender or the LC Issuer, as the
case may be, and may change its Lending Installation from time to time. All
terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the
Loans, Facility LCs, participations in LC Obligations and any Notes issued
hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender or the LC Issuer, as the case may
be, for the benefit of any such Lending Installation. Each Lender and the LC
Issuer may, by written notice to the Agent and the Borrower in accordance with
Article 13, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through
which Loans will be made by it or Facility LCs will be


                                       18

<PAGE>

issued by it and for whose account Loan payments or payments with respect to
Facility LCs are to be made.

         2.18. Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent. Unless the Borrower or a
Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is
scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the
proceeds of a Loan or (b) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal,
interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not
intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been
made. The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such
payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If
such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such
payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the
Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest
thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such
amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such
amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the
Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and,
thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case
of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

         2.19. Facility LCs.

                  (a) Issuance. The LC Issuer hereby agrees, on the terms and
         conditions set forth in this Agreement, to issue standby and commercial
         letters of credit (each, a "Facility LC") and to renew, extend,
         increase, decrease or otherwise modify each Facility LC ("Modify," and
         each such action a "Modification"), from time to time from and
         including the date of this Agreement and prior to the Facility
         Termination Date upon the request of the Borrower; provided that
         immediately after each such Facility LC is issued or Modified, (i) the
         aggregate amount of the outstanding LC Obligations shall not exceed
         $10,000,000 and (ii) the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure shall
         not exceed the Aggregate Commitment. No Facility LC shall have an
         expiry date later than the fifth Business Day prior to the Facility
         Termination Date.

                  (b) Participations. Upon the issuance or Modification by the
         LC Issuer of a Facility LC in accordance with this Section 2.19, the LC
         Issuer shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to
         have unconditionally and irrevocably sold to each Lender, and each
         Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to
         have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from the LC Issuer, a
         participation in such Facility LC (and each Modification thereof) and
         the related LC Obligations in proportion to its Pro Rata Share.

                  (c) Notice. Subject to Section 2.19(a), the Borrower shall
         give the LC Issuer notice prior to 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least
         five Business Days prior to the proposed date of issuance or
         Modification of each Facility LC, specifying the beneficiary, the
         proposed date of issuance (or Modification) and the expiry date of such
         Facility LC, and describing the proposed terms of such Facility LC and
         the nature of the transactions proposed to be supported thereby. Upon
         receipt of such notice, the LC Issuer shall promptly notify the Agent,
         and the Agent shall promptly notify each Lender, of the contents
         thereof and of the amount of such Lender's participation in such
         proposed


                                       19

<PAGE>

         Facility LC. The issuance or Modification by the LC Issuer of any
         Facility LC shall, in addition to the conditions precedent set forth in
         Article 4 (the satisfaction of which the LC Issuer shall have no duty
         to ascertain), be subject to the conditions precedent that such
         Facility LC shall be satisfactory to the LC Issuer and that the
         Borrower shall have executed and delivered such application agreement
         and/or such other instruments and agreements relating to such Facility
         LC as the LC Issuer shall have reasonably requested (each, a "Facility
         LC Application"). In the event of any conflict between the terms of
         this Agreement and the terms of any Facility LC Application, the terms
         of this Agreement shall control.

                  (d) LC Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the
         account of the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Pro
         Rata Shares, (i) with respect to each standby Facility LC, a letter of
         credit fee at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Fee Rate in
         effect from time to time on the average daily undrawn stated amount
         under such standby Facility LC, such fee to be payable in arrears on
         each Payment Date, and (ii) with respect to each commercial Facility
         LC, a one-time letter of credit fee in an amount equal to the product
         of one half of the Applicable Fee Rate then in effect times the initial
         stated amount (or, with respect to a Modification of any such
         commercial Facility LC which increases the stated amount thereof, such
         increase in the stated amount) of such Facility LC, such fee to be
         payable on the date of such issuance or increase (each such fee
         described in this sentence an "LC Fee"). The Borrower shall also pay to
         the LC Issuer for its own account (x) at the time of issuance of each
         Facility LC, a fronting fee in an amount equal to 0.25% of the face
         amount of such Facility LC, and (y) documentary and processing charges
         in connection with the issuance or Modification of and draws under
         Facility LCs in accordance with the LC Issuer's standard schedule for
         such charges as in effect from time to time.

                  (e) Administration; Reimbursement by Lenders. Upon receipt
         from the beneficiary of any Facility LC of any demand for payment under
         such Facility LC, the LC Issuer shall notify the Agent and the Agent
         shall promptly notify the Borrower and each other Lender as to the
         amount to be paid by the LC Issuer as a result of such demand and the
         proposed payment date (the "LC Payment Date"). The responsibility of
         the LC Issuer to the Borrower and each Lender shall be only to
         determine that the documents (including each demand for payment)
         delivered under each Facility LC in connection with such presentment
         shall be in conformity in all material respects with such Facility LC.
         The LC Issuer shall endeavor to exercise the same care in the issuance
         and administration of the Facility LCs as it does with respect to
         letters of credit in which no participations are granted, it being
         understood that in the absence of any gross negligence or willful
         misconduct by the LC Issuer, each Lender shall be unconditionally and
         irrevocably liable without regard to the occurrence of any Default or
         any condition precedent whatsoever, to reimburse the LC Issuer on
         demand for (i) such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the amount of each
         payment made by the LC Issuer under each Facility LC to the extent such
         amount is not reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19(f)
         below, plus (ii) interest on the foregoing amount to be reimbursed by
         such Lender, for each day from the date of the LC Issuer's demand for
         such reimbursement (or, if such demand is made after 11:00 a.m.
         (Chicago time) on such date, from the next succeeding Business Day) to
         the date on which such Lender pays the amount to be reimbursed by it,


                                       20

<PAGE>

         at a rate of interest per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective
         Rate for the first three days and, thereafter, at a rate of interest
         equal to the rate applicable to Floating Rate Advances.

                  (f) Reimbursement by Borrower. The Borrower shall be
         irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to reimburse the LC Issuer on
         or before the applicable LC Payment Date for any amounts to be paid by
         the LC Issuer upon any drawing under any Facility LC, without
         presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind; provided
         that neither the Borrower nor any Lender shall hereby be precluded from
         asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered
         by the Borrower or such Lender to the extent, but only to the extent,
         caused by (i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the LC
         Issuer in determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC
         issued by it complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (ii) the LC
         Issuer's failure to pay under any Facility LC issued by it after the
         presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and
         conditions of such Facility LC. All such amounts paid by the LC Issuer
         and remaining unpaid by the Borrower shall bear interest, payable on
         demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to (x) the
         rate applicable to Floating Rate Advances for such day if such day
         falls on or before the applicable LC Payment Date and (y) the sum of 2%
         plus the rate applicable to Floating Rate Advances for such day if such
         day falls after such LC Payment Date. The LC Issuer will pay to each
         Lender ratably in accordance with its Pro Rata Share all amounts
         received by it from the Borrower for application in payment, in whole
         or in part, of the Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any Facility
         LC issued by the LC Issuer, but only to the extent such Lender has made
         payment to the LC Issuer in respect of such Facility LC pursuant to
         Section 2.19(e). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
         (including without limitation the submission of a Borrowing Notice in
         compliance with Section 2.8 and the satisfaction of the applicable
         conditions precedent set forth in Article 4), the Borrower may request
         an Advance hereunder for the purpose of satisfying any Reimbursement
         Obligation.

                  (g) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligations under
         this Section 2.19 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
         circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense
         to payment which the Borrower may have or have had against the LC
         Issuer, any Lender or any beneficiary of a Facility LC. The Borrower
         further agrees with the LC Issuer and the Lenders that the LC Issuer
         and the Lenders shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower's
         Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any Facility LC shall not be
         affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of
         documents or of any endorsements thereon, even if such documents should
         in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, fraudulent or
         forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower, any of its
         Affiliates, the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any financing
         institution or other party to whom any Facility LC may be transferred
         or any claims or defenses whatsoever of the Borrower or of any of its
         Affiliates against the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any such
         transferee. The LC Issuer shall not be liable for any error, omission,
         interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any
         message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Facility
         LC. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the LC
         Issuer or any Lender under or in connection with each Facility LC and
         the related drafts and documents, if done without gross


                                       21

<PAGE>

         negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding upon the Borrower
         and shall not put the LC Issuer or any Lender under any liability to
         the Borrower. Nothing in this Section 2.19(g) is intended to limit the
         right of the Borrower to make a claim against the LC Issuer for damages
         as contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of Section
         2.19(f).

                  (h) Actions of LC Issuer. The LC Issuer shall be entitled to
         rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Facility LC,
         draft, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit,
         letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message,
         statement, order or other document believed by it to be genuine and
         correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or
         Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent
         accountants and other experts selected by the LC Issuer. The LC Issuer
         shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action
         under this Agreement unless it shall first have received such advice or
         concurrence of the Required Lenders as it reasonably deems appropriate
         or it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the
         Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred
         by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.19, the LC Issuer
         shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
         acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request of the
         Required Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to
         act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders and any future
         holders of a participation in any Facility LC.

                  (i) Indemnification. The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify
         and hold harmless each Lender, the LC Issuer and the Agent, and their
         respective directors, officers, agents and employees from and against
         any and all claims and damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses
         which such Lender, the LC Issuer or the Agent may incur (or which may
         be claimed against such Lender, the LC Issuer or the Agent by any
         Person whatsoever) by reason of or in connection with the issuance,
         execution and delivery or transfer of or payment or failure to pay
         under any Facility LC or any actual or proposed use of any Facility LC,
         including, without limitation, any claims, damages, losses,
         liabilities, costs or expenses which the LC Issuer may incur by reason
         of or in connection with (i) the failure of any other Lender to fulfill
         or comply with its obligations to the LC Issuer hereunder (but nothing
         herein contained shall affect any rights the Borrower may have against
         any defaulting Lender) or (ii) by reason of or on account of the LC
         Issuer issuing any Facility LC which specifies that the term
         "Beneficiary" included therein includes any successor by operation of
         law of the named Beneficiary, but which Facility LC does not require
         that any drawing by any such successor Beneficiary be accompanied by a
         copy of a legal document, satisfactory to the LC Issuer, evidencing the
         appointment of such successor Beneficiary; provided that the Borrower
         shall not be required to indemnify any Lender, the LC Issuer or the
         Agent for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses
         to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (x) the willful
         misconduct or gross negligence of the LC Issuer in determining whether
         a request presented under any Facility LC complied with the terms of
         such Facility LC or (y) the LC Issuer's failure to pay under any
         Facility LC after the presentation to it of a request strictly
         complying with the terms and conditions of such Facility LC. Nothing in
         this Section 2.19(i) is intended to limit the obligations of the
         Borrower under any other provision of this Agreement.


                                       22

                  (j) Lenders' Indemnification. Each Lender shall, ratably in
         accordance with its Pro Rata Share, indemnify the LC Issuer, its
         affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agents and
         employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) against any
         cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements),
         claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from
         such indemnitees' gross negligence or willful misconduct or the LC
         Issuer's failure to pay under any Facility LC after the presentation to
         it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the
         Facility LC) that such indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection
         with this Section 2.19 or any action taken or omitted by such
         indemnitees hereunder.

                  (k) Facility LC Collateral Account. The Borrower agrees that
         it will, upon the request of the Agent or the Required Lenders (which
         request may be made only after the occurrence and during the
         continuance of a Default or Unmatured Default) and until the final
         expiration date of any Facility LC and thereafter as long as any amount
         is payable to the LC Issuer or the Lenders in respect of any Facility
         LC, maintain a special collateral account pursuant to arrangements
         satisfactory to the Agent (the "Facility LC Collateral Account") at the
         Agent's office at the address specified pursuant to Article 13, in the
         name of such Borrower but under the sole dominion and control of the
         Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and in which such Borrower shall
         have no interest other than as set forth in Section 8.1. The Borrower
         hereby pledges, assigns and grants to the Agent, on behalf of and for
         the ratable benefit of the Lenders and the LC Issuer, a security
         interest under the Uniform Commercial Code in all of the Borrower's
         right, title and interest in and to all funds which may from time to
         time be on deposit in the Facility LC Collateral Account to secure the
         prompt and complete payment and performance of the Obligations. The
         Agent will invest any funds on deposit from time to time in the
         Facility LC Collateral Account in certificates of deposit of Bank One
         having a maturity not exceeding 30 days. Nothing in this Section
         2.19(k) shall either obligate the Agent to require the Borrower to
         deposit any funds in the Facility LC Collateral Account or limit the
         right of the Agent to release any funds held in the Facility LC
         Collateral Account in each case other than as required by Section 8.1.

                  (l) Rights as a Lender. In its capacity as a Lender, the LC
         Issuer shall have the same rights and obligations as any other Lender.

         2.20. Extension of Facility Termination Date.

                  (a) The Borrower may request an extension of the Facility
         Termination Date by submitting a request for an extension to the Agent
         (an "Extension Request") no more than 60 days prior to the Facility
         Termination Date. The Extension Request must specify the new Facility
         Termination Date requested by the Borrower and the date (which must be
         at least 30 days after the Extension Request is delivered to the Agent)
         as of which the Lenders must respond to the Extension Request (the
         "Response Date"). The new Facility Termination Date shall be no more
         than 364 days after the Facility Termination Date in effect at the time
         the Extension Request is received, including the Facility Termination
         Date as one of the days in the calculation of the days elapsed.
         Promptly upon receipt of an Extension Request, the Agent shall notify
         each Lender of the contents thereof and shall request each Lender to
         approve the Extension Request. Each Lender may approve


                                       23

<PAGE>

         or reject the Extension Request in such Lender's sole discretion. Each
         Lender approving the Extension Request (each a "Consenting Lender")
         shall deliver its written consent to the Agent and the Borrower no
         later than the Response Date. Each Lender that fails to so deliver its
         written consent shall be deemed to have rejected the Extension Request.

                  (b) If the consent of Lenders having at least 50% of the
         Aggregate Commitment is received by the Agent, the new Facility
         Termination Date specified in the Extension Request shall become
         effective on the existing Facility Termination Date as to the
         Consenting Lenders (and the Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower
         and each Lender of the new Facility Termination Date), but the existing
         Facility Termination Date shall not be extended as to any Lender that
         is not a Consenting Lender (each a "Non-Consenting Lender"). To the
         extent that the Facility Termination Date is not extended as to any
         Lender pursuant to this Section 2.20, the Commitment of such
         Non-Consenting Lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such
         unextended Facility Termination Date without any further notice or
         other action by the Borrower, such Lender or any other Person;
         provided, that such Non-Consenting Lender's rights under Sections 3.1,
         3.2, 3.4, 3.5 and 9.6 of this Agreement and -------- its obligations
         under Sections 3.5(g) and 10.8 of this Agreement shall survive the
         Facility Termination Date for such Non-Consenting Lender as to matters
         occurring prior to such date.

         2.21. Replacement of Lender.If the Borrower is required pursuant to
Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any
Lender's obligation to make or continue, or to convert Floating Rate Advances
into, Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 (any Lender
so affected an "Affected Lender"), the Borrower may elect, if such amounts
continue to be charged or such suspension is still effective, to replace such
Affected Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that no Default or
Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such
replacement, and provided further that, concurrently with such replacement, (i)
another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower
and the Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Advances
and other Obligations due to the Affected Lender pursuant to an assignment
substantially in the form of Exhibit C and to become a Lender for all purposes
under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected Lender to be
terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of Section 12.3
applicable to assignments, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Affected
Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (A) all interest, fees
and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Affected Lender by the
Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without
limitation payments due to such Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5,
and (B) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to
such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 3.4 had the Loans of
such Affected Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the
replacement Lender.

                             -----------------------

         3.1. Yield Protection. If, on or after the date of this Agreement, the
adoption of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy, guideline or directive


                                       24

(whether or not having the force of law), or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental or quasi-governmental authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or applicable Lending
Installation or the LC Issuer with any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency:

                  (a) subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
         or the LC Issuer to any Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of
         payments (other than with respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender or
         the LC Issuer in respect of its Eurodollar Loans, Facility LCs or
         participations therein, or

                  (b) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
         assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement
         against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
         extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation or the
         LC Issuer (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in
         determining the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances), or

                  (c) imposes any other condition the result of which is to
         increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
         or the LC Issuer of making, funding or maintaining its Eurodollar
         Loans, or of issuing or participating in Facility LCs, or reduces any
         amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
         or the LC Issuer in connection with its Eurodollar Loans, Facility LCs
         or participations therein, or requires any Lender or any applicable
         Lending Installation or the LC Issuer to make any payment calculated by
         reference to the amount of Eurodollar Loans, Facility LCs or
         participations therein held or interest or LC Fees received by it, by
         an amount deemed material by such Lender or the LC Issuer as the case
         may be,

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Installation or the LC Issuer, as the case may be, of making
or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or Commitment or of issuing or participating
in Facility LCs or to reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable
Lending Installation or the LC Issuer, as the case may be, in connection with
such Eurodollar Loans, Commitment, Facility LCs or participations therein, then,
within 15 days of demand by such Lender or the LC Issuer, as the case may be,
the Borrower shall pay such Lender or the LC Issuer, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the LC Issuer, as
the case may be, for such increased cost or reduction in amount received.

         3.2. Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender or the LC
Issuer determines the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by
such Lender or the LC Issuer, any Lending Installation of such Lender or the LC
Issuer, or any corporation controlling such Lender or the LC Issuer is increased
as a result of a Change, then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender or the LC
Issuer, the Borrower shall pay such Lender or the LC Issuer the amount necessary
to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such
increased capital which such Lender or the LC Issuer determines is attributable
to this Agreement, its Outstanding Credit Exposure or its Commitment to make
Loans and issue or participate in Facility LCs, as the case may be, hereunder
(after taking into account such Lender's or the LC Issuer's policies as to
capital adequacy). "Change" means (i) any change


                                       25

<PAGE>

after the date of this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (ii)
any adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental
rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) after the date of this Agreement which affects the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or the LC
Issuer or any Lending Installation or any corporation controlling any Lender or
the LC Issuer. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based capital
guidelines in effect in the United States on the date of this Agreement,
including transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations
promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the
July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory
Practices Entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and
Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any amendments to such
regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.

         3.3. Availability of Types of Advances. If any Lender determines that
maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would
violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not
having the force of law, or if the Required Lenders determine that (a) deposits
of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances are not
available or (b) the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances does not
accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurodollar Advances, then
the Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar Advances and require any
affected Eurodollar Advances to be repaid or converted to Floating Rate
Advances, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required
by Section 3.4.

         3.4. Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a Eurodollar Advance
occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Eurodollar
Advance is not made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other
than default by the Lenders, the Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any
loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation,
any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or
maintain such Eurodollar Advance.

         3.5. Taxes.

                  (a) All payments by the Borrower to or for the account of any
         Lender, the LC Issuer or the Agent hereunder or under any Note or
         Facility LC Application shall be made free and clear of and without
         deduction for any and all Taxes. If the Borrower shall be required by
         law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder
         to any Lender, the LC Issuer or the Agent, (a) the sum payable shall be
         increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
         (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
         Section 3.5) such Lender, the LC Issuer or the Agent (as the case may
         be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no
         such deductions been made, (b) the Borrower shall make such deductions,
         (c) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
         authority in accordance with applicable law and (d) the Borrower shall
         furnish to the Agent the original copy of a receipt evidencing payment
         thereof within 30 days after such payment is made.


                                       26

<PAGE>

                  (b) In addition, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay any present
         or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property
         taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made
         hereunder or under any Note or Facility LC Application or from the
         execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement
         or any Note or Facility LC Application ("Other Taxes").

                  (c) The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent, the LC
         Issuer and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes
         (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on
         amounts payable under this Section 3.5) paid by the Agent, the LC
         Issuer or such Lender and any liability (including penalties, interest
         and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. Payments due
         under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days of the date the
         Agent, the LC Issuer or such Lender makes demand therefor pursuant to
         Section 3.6.

                  (d) Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the
         United States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S. Lender")
         agrees that it will, not more than ten Business Days after the date of
         this Agreement, (i) deliver to the Agent two duly completed copies of
         United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI,
         certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to receive
         payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
         United States federal income taxes, and (ii) deliver to the Agent a
         United States Internal Revenue Form W-8 or W-9, as the case may be, and
         certify that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup
         withholding tax. Each Non-U.S. Lender further undertakes to deliver to
         each of the Borrower and the Agent (x) renewals or additional copies of
         such form (or any successor form) on or before the date that such form
         expires or becomes obsolete, and (y) after the occurrence of any event
         requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such
         additional forms or amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested
         by the Borrower or the Agent. All forms or amendments described in the
         preceding sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled to
         receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding
         of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event (including
         without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has
         occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise
         be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would
         prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form
         or amendment with respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower
         and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any
         deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.

                  (e) For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed
         to provide the Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to clause
         (d), above (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or
         regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration
         thereof by any governmental authority, occurring subsequent to the date
         on which a form originally was required to be provided), such Non-U.S.
         Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5
         with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that,
         should a Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a
         reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to Taxes because of its
         failure to deliver a form required under clause (d), above, the
         Borrower shall take such


                                       27

<PAGE>

         steps as such Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request to assist such
         Non-U.S. Lender to recover such Taxes.

                  (f) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
         reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under this
         Agreement or any Note pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction
         or any treaty shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent),
         at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly
         completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as
         will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a
         reduced rate.

                  (g) If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other
         governmental authority of the United States or any other country or any
         political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the Agent did not
         properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any
         Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered or properly
         completed, because such Lender failed to notify the Agent of a change
         in circumstances which rendered its exemption from withholding
         ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the
         Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Agent
         as tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and
         interest, and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
         payable to the Agent under this subsection, together with all costs and
         expenses related thereto (including attorneys fees and time charges of
         attorneys for the Agent, which attorneys may be employees of the
         Agent). The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 3.5(g) shall
         survive the payment of the Obligations and termination of this
         Agreement.

         3.6. Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent reasonably
possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with
respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such
Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of
Eurodollar Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in
the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall
deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5. Such
written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon
which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error. Determination of
amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall
be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar Loan through the
purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used
as a reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan,
whether in fact that is the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the
amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on
demand after receipt by the Borrower of such written statement. The obligations
of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of
the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

         4.1. Initial Credit Extension. The Lenders shall not be required to

the Agent with sufficient copies for the Lenders:

                  (a) Copies of the articles or certificate of incorporation of

         form of Exhibit D, addressed to the Agent and signed by an Authorized

                  (k) If the initial Credit Extension will be the issuance of a

                  (m) Such other documents as any Lender or its counsel may have
         reasonably requested.

         4.2. Each Credit Extension. The Lenders shall not be required to make

                                   ARTICLE 5

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                         ------------------------------

         The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:


                                       30

<PAGE>

         5.1. Existence and Standing. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
is a corporation, partnership (in the case of Subsidiaries only) or limited
liability company duly and properly incorporated or organized, as the case may
be, validly existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each
jurisdiction in which its business is conducted, except where the failure to
have such authority could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         5.2. Authorization and Validity. The Borrower has the power and
authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents to which it
is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery
by the Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the performance
of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper corporate
proceedings, and the Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party constitute
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the
Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally.

         5.3. No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and
delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the
consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the
provisions thereof will violate (a) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or (b) the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's articles or certificate
of incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of partnership, articles or
certificate of organization, by-laws, or operating or other management
agreement, as the case may be, or (c) the provisions of any indenture,
instrument or agreement to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with
or constitute a default thereunder, or result in, or require, the creation or
imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of the Borrower or a Subsidiary
pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, instrument or agreement. No order,
consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or
filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in
respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision
thereof, which has not been obtained by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
is required to be obtained by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings
under this Agreement, the payment and performance by the Borrower of the
Obligations or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any
of the Loan Documents.

         5.4. Financial Statements. The audited consolidated financial
statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended April
27, 2002 and the unaudited financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended
July 27, 2002 heretofore delivered to the Lenders were prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in effect on the date such
statements were prepared and fairly present the consolidated financial condition
and operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries at such date and the
consolidated results of their operations for the period then ended.


                                       31

<PAGE>

         5.5. Material Adverse Change. Since July 27, 2002, there has been no
change in the business, Property, condition (financial or otherwise) or results
of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.6. Taxes. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all United
States federal tax returns and all other tax returns which are required to be
filed and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any
assessment received by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except such
taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate
reserves have been provided in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles
and as to which no Lien exists. The United States income tax returns of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service
through the fiscal year ended April 25, 1998. No tax liens have been filed and
no claims are being asserted with respect to any such taxes. The charges,
accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in
respect of any taxes or other governmental charges are adequate. If the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries is a limited liability company, each such limited
liability company qualifies for partnership tax treatment under United States
federal tax law.

         5.7. Litigation and Contingent Obligations. There is no litigation,
arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to
the knowledge of any of their officers, threatened against or affecting the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay the making of
any Credit Extensions. Other than any liability incident to any litigation,
arbitration or proceeding which could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, the Borrower has no material contingent obligations not
provided for or disclosed in the financial statements referred to in Section
5.4.

         5.8. Subsidiaries. Schedule 1 contains an accurate list of all
Subsidiaries of the Borrower as of the date of this Agreement, setting forth
their respective jurisdictions of organization and the percentage of their
respective capital stock or other ownership interests owned by the Borrower or
other Subsidiaries. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or
other ownership interests of such Subsidiaries have been (to the extent such
concepts are relevant with respect to such ownership interests) duly authorized
and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

         5.9. ERISA. Neither the Borrower nor any member of the Controlled Group
maintains, participates in or contributes to, or has at any time within the past
15 years maintained, participated in or contributed to, any Plan. With respect
to any Plan that the Borrower or any member of the Controlled Group previously
maintained, participated in or contributed to, the Plan has been terminated in a
"standard termination" under Title IV of ERISA, and no such Person has or
reasonably expects to have, any liability with respect to any Plan.

         5.10. Accuracy of Information. No information, exhibit or report
furnished by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Agent or to any
Lender in connection with the negotiation of, or compliance with, the Loan
Documents contained any material misstatement of fact or omitted to state a
material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not
misleading.


                                       32

<PAGE>

         5.11. Regulation U. Margin stock (as defined in Regulation U)
constitutes less than 25% of the value of those assets of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries which are subject to any limitation on sale, pledge, or other
restriction hereunder.

         5.12. Material Agreements. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a
party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any charter or other
corporate restriction which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default in the
performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or
conditions contained in (a) any agreement to which it is a party, which default
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (b) any
agreement or instrument evidencing or governing Indebtedness.

         5.13. Compliance With Laws. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have
complied with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and
restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or any instrumentality or
agency thereof having jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective
businesses or the ownership of their respective Property except for any failure
to comply with any of the foregoing which could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.14. Ownership of Properties. Except as set forth on Schedule 2, on
the date of this Agreement, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries will have good
title, free of all Liens other than those permitted by Section 6.15, to all of
the Property and assets reflected in the Borrower's most recent consolidated
financial statements provided to the Agent as owned by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries.

         5.15. Plan Assets; Prohibited Transactions. The Borrower is not an
entity deemed to hold "plan assets" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. ss.
2510.3-101 of an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA)
which is subject to Title I of ERISA or any plan (within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code), and neither the execution of this Agreement nor the making of
Credit Extensions hereunder gives rise to a prohibited transaction within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

         5.16. Environmental Matters. In the ordinary course of its business,
the officers of the Borrower consider the effect of Environmental Laws on the
business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, in the course of which they
identify and evaluate potential risks and liabilities accruing to the Borrower
due to Environmental Laws. On the basis of this consideration, the Borrower has
concluded that Environmental Laws cannot reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has received
any notice to the effect that its operations are not in material compliance with
any of the requirements of applicable Environmental Laws or are the subject of
any federal or state investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is
needed to respond to a release of any toxic or hazardous waste or substance into
the environment, which non-compliance or remedial action could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.17. Investment Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary
is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company",
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.


                                       33

<PAGE>

         5.18. Public Utility Holding Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company", or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company"
of a "holding company", within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended.

         5.19. Post-Retirement Benefits. The present value of the expected cost
of post-retirement medical and insurance benefits payable by the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries to its employees and former employees, as estimated by the
Borrower in accordance with procedures and assumptions deemed reasonable by the
Required Lenders is zero.

         5.20. Prior Credit Agreement. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
dated as of April 28, 2000, as from time to time in effect, by and among the
Borrower, U.S. Bank National Association, individually and as agent, and the
other banks party thereto, has been terminated (except for those provisions that
expressly survive the termination thereof) and all loans outstanding and other
amounts owed to the lenders or agents thereunder have been or shall
simultaneously with the initial Credit Extension hereunder be paid in full.


                                    ARTICLE 6

                                    COVENANTS
                                    ---------

         During the term of this Agreement, unless the Required Lenders shall
otherwise consent in writing:

         6.1. Financial Reporting. The Borrower will maintain, for itself and
each Subsidiary, a system of accounting established and administered in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and furnish to the
Lenders:

                  (a) Within 90 days after the close of each of its fiscal
         years, an unqualified (except for qualifications relating to changes in
         accounting principles or practices reflecting changes in generally
         accepted accounting principles and required or approved by the
         Borrower's independent certified public accountants) audit report
         certified by independent certified public accountants acceptable to the
         Lenders, prepared in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles on
         a consolidated basis (and, if requested by the Agent or any Lender and
         available, on a consolidating basis, though, in any event,
         consolidating statements need not be certified by such accountants) for
         itself and its Subsidiaries, including balance sheets as of the end of
         such period, related profit and loss and reconciliation of surplus
         statements, and a statement of cash flows, accompanied by (i) any
         management letter prepared by said accountants, and (ii) a certificate
         of said accountants that, in the course of their examination necessary
         for their certification of the foregoing, they have obtained no
         knowledge of any Default or Unmatured Default, or if, in the opinion of
         such accountants, any Default or Unmatured Default shall exist, stating
         the nature and status thereof.

                  (b) Within 45 days after the close of the first three
         quarterly periods of each of its fiscal years, for itself and its
         Subsidiaries, unaudited consolidated (and, if requested by the Agent or
         any Lender and available, consolidating) balance sheets as at the close
         of


                                       34

<PAGE>

         each such period and consolidated (and, if requested by the Agent or
         any Lender and available, consolidating) profit and loss and
         reconciliation of surplus statements and a statement of cash flows for
         the period from the beginning of such fiscal year to the end of such
         quarter, all certified by its chief financial officer.

                  (c) Together with the financial statements required under
         Sections 6.1(a) and (b), a compliance certificate in substantially the
         form of Exhibit B signed by its chief financial officer showing the
         calculations necessary to determine compliance with this Agreement and
         stating that no Default or Unmatured Default exists, or if any Default
         or Unmatured Default exists, stating the nature and status thereof.

                  (d) Prior to adoption thereof, written notice of the intent of
         the Borrower or any member of the Controlled Group to adopt any Plan.

                  (e) As soon as possible and in any event within 10 days after
         the Borrower knows that any Reportable Event has occurred with respect
         to any Plan, a statement, signed by the chief financial officer of the
         Borrower, describing said Reportable Event and the action which the
         Borrower proposes to take with respect thereto.

                  (f) As soon as possible and in any event within 10 days after
         receipt by the Borrower, a copy of (i) any notice or claim to the
         effect that the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be liable
         to any Person as a result of the release by the Borrower, any of its
         Subsidiaries, or any other Person of any toxic or hazardous waste or
         substance into the environment, and (ii) any notice alleging any
         violation of any federal, state or local environmental, health or
         safety law or regulation by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
         which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to have a Material
         Adverse Effect.

                  (g) Promptly upon the furnishing thereof to the shareholders
         of the Borrower, copies of all financial statements, reports and proxy
         statements so furnished.

         and Exchange Commission.

                  (i) Such other information (including non-financial
         information) as the Agent or any Lender may from time to time
         reasonably request.

         6.2. Use of Proceeds. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary
to, use the proceeds of the Credit Extensions for general corporate purposes.

proceeds of the Credit Extensions to purchase or carry any "margin stock" (as
defined in Regulation U).

         6.3. Notice of Default. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, give prompt notice in writing to the Lenders of the occurrence of
any Default or Unmatured Default and of any other development, financial or
otherwise, which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


                                       35

<PAGE>

         6.4. Conduct of Business. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, carry on and conduct its business in substantially the same
manner and in substantially the same fields of enterprise as it is presently
conducted and do all things necessary to remain duly incorporated or organized,
validly existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in good
standing as a domestic corporation, partnership or limited liability company in
its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, as the case may be, and,
except to the extent the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, maintain all requisite authority to conduct its
business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.

         6.5. Taxes. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to,
timely file complete and correct United States federal and applicable foreign,
state and local tax returns required by law and pay when due all taxes,
assessments and governmental charges and levies upon it or its income, profits
or Property, except those which are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and with respect to which adequate reserves have been set aside in
accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles. At any time that the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries is organized as a limited liability company, each
such limited liability company will qualify for partnership tax treatment under
United States federal tax law.

         6.6. Insurance. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to,
maintain with financially sound and reputable insurance companies insurance on
all their Property in such amounts and covering such risks as is consistent with
sound business practice, and the Borrower will furnish to any Lender upon
request full information as to the insurance carried.

         6.7. Compliance with Laws. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs,
judgments, injunctions, decrees or awards to which it may be subject including,
without limitation, all Environmental Laws, except to the extent the failure to
do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.8. Maintenance of Properties. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, do all things necessary to maintain, preserve, protect and keep
its Property in good repair, working order and condition, and make all necessary
and proper repairs, renewals and replacements so that its business carried on in
connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times.

         6.9. Inspection. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to,
permit the Agent and the Lenders, by their respective representatives and
agents, to inspect any of the Property, books and financial records of the
Borrower and each Subsidiary, to examine and make copies of the books of
accounts and other financial records of the Borrower and each Subsidiary, and to
discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Borrower and each Subsidiary
with, and to be advised as to the same by, their respective officers at such
reasonable times and intervals as the Agent or any Lender may designate.

         6.10. Intentionally omitted.

         6.11. Indebtedness. The Borrower will not permit any Subsidiary to
create, incur or suffer to exist any Indebtedness, except:

                  (a) Indebtedness existing on the date hereof and described in
         Schedule 2.


                                       36

<PAGE>

                  (b) Indebtedness arising under Financial Contracts that are
         entered into in the ordinary course of business and not for speculative
         purposes.

                  (c) Receivables Transaction Attributed Indebtedness in an
         aggregate amount not in excess of $250,000,000 at any time.

                  (d) Contingent Obligations under the Guaranty.

                  (e) Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities in an aggregate amount not
         in excess of $10,000,000 at any time.

                  (f) Indebtedness of Subsidiaries to other Subsidiaries or to
         the Borrower.

                  (g) Other Indebtedness of Subsidiaries in an aggregate amount
         for all Subsidiaries not in excess of $10,000,000 at any time.

         6.12. Merger. The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary

         twelve-month period ending with the month in which any such lease, sale

         Guarantors.

                  (c) Investments in Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors;

         Authorized Officer of the Borrower setting forth in reasonable detail

         (assuming that such Acquisition (and any related incurrence of
         Indebtedness) had occurred on the first day of the four-fiscal quarter
         period ending at the last fiscal quarter-end) after giving effect to
         such Acquisition, (x) the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt at the last
         fiscal quarter-end to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the four-fiscal
         quarter period ending at the last fiscal quarter-end will not exceed
         1.75 to 1.0 and (y) no Default or Unmatured Default will exist.

         landlords' and mechanics' liens and other similar liens arising in the
         ordinary course of business which secure payment of obligations not
         more than 60 days past due or which are being contested in good faith
         by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves shall have
         been set aside on its books.

         encumbrances or charges against real property as are of a nature
         generally existing with respect to properties of a similar character

         or its Subsidiaries.

                  (e) Liens existing on the date hereof and described in
         Schedule 2.

         Account Sales, but only to the extent the Receivables Transaction
         Attributed Indebtedness is permitted Indebtedness pursuant to Section
         6.11(c).

                  (g) Any Lien securing either a loan whose proceeds were used
         by the Borrower or a Subsidiary to acquire assets or a Capitalized

any Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any Subsidiary or other special-purpose
entity created to engage solely in either Qualified Receivables Transaction.

30 days, after a Person shall become a Material Domestic Subsidiary that is not
a Material Domestic Subsidiary on the date hereof, the Borrower shall cause such
new Material Domestic Subsidiary to become a Guarantor under the Guaranty by
executing and delivering to the Agent a counterpart to the Guaranty in the form
of Annex I to the Guaranty, along with such other documents, opinions and
information as the Agent may require regarding such Material Domestic Subsidiary
and the enforceability of such Guaranty. If at any time (a) the aggregate assets
of all of the Borrower's Domestic Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors under the
Guaranty exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the consolidated total assets of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries, or (b) the aggregate Consolidated Adjusted Net
Income for the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended of all of
the Borrower's Domestic Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors under the Guaranty
exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the Borrower's Consolidated Adjusted Net Income
for such period, the Borrower will, within 30 days after its senior management
becomes aware (or reasonably should have become aware) of such event, cause to
be executed and delivered to the

necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, the threshold levels in clauses
(a) and (b) above are not exceeded.

or directly or indirectly voluntarily prepay, defease or in substance defease,
purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire, any Subordinated Indebtedness.

         6.19. Sale of Accounts. The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any

         times maintain Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of not less than the sum
         of (i) $300,000,000, plus (ii) 50% of the cumulative positive quarterly
         Consolidated Net Income for all fiscal quarters of the Borrower
         following the fiscal quarter of the Borrower ending April 27, 2002
         (without taking into account any net loss in any such fiscal quarter),
         plus (iii) 100% of the amount, if any, by which stockholder's equity of
         the Borrower is, in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles,
         increased for all fiscal quarters of the Borrower following the fiscal
         quarter of the Borrower ending April 27, 2002 as a result of (A) the
         issuance of any capital stock of the Borrower or (B) any Acquisition.

                  (b) Leverage Ratio. The Borrower will maintain, as of the end
         of each fiscal quarter, a Leverage Ratio of not greater than 2.0 to

                 ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES
                 ----------------------------------------------

         8.1. Acceleration; Facility LC Collateral Account.

                  (a) If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 occurs with
         respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
         hereunder and the obligation and power of the LC Issuer to issue
         Facility LCs shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall
         immediately become due and payable without any election or action on
         the part of the Agent, the LC Issuer or any Lender and the Borrower
         will be and become thereby unconditionally obligated, without any
         further notice, act or demand, to pay to the Agent an amount in
         immediately available funds, which funds shall be held in the Facility
         LC Collateral Account, equal to the difference of (x) the amount of LC
         Obligations at such time, less (y) the amount on deposit in the
         Facility LC Collateral Account at such time which is free and clear of
         all rights and claims of third parties and has not been applied against
         the Obligations (such difference, the "Collateral Shortfall Amount").
         If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders (or the Agent with
         the consent of the Required Lenders) may (i) terminate or suspend the
         obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder and the obligation
         and power of the LC Issuer to issue


                                       42

<PAGE>

         Facility LCs, or declare the Obligations to be due and payable, or
         both, whereupon the Obligations shall become immediately due and
         payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind,
         all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives, and (ii) upon notice
         to the Borrower and in addition to the continuing right to demand
         payment of all amounts payable under this Agreement, make demand on the
         Borrower to pay, and the Borrower will, forthwith upon such demand and
         without any further notice or act, pay to the Agent the Collateral
         Shortfall Amount, which funds shall be deposited in the Facility LC
         Collateral Account.

                  (b) If at any time while any Default is continuing, the Agent
         determines that the Collateral Shortfall Amount at such time is greater
         than zero, the Agent may make demand on the Borrower to pay, and the
         Borrower will, forthwith upon such demand and without any further
         notice or act, pay to the Agent the Collateral Shortfall Amount, which
         funds shall be deposited in the Facility LC Collateral Account.

                  (c) The Agent may at any time or from time to time after funds
         are deposited in the Facility LC Collateral Account, apply such funds
         to the payment of the Obligations and any other amounts as shall from
         time to time have become due and payable by the Borrower to the Lenders
         or the LC Issuer under the Loan Documents.

                  (d) At any time while any Default is continuing, neither the
         Borrower nor any Person claiming on behalf of or through the Borrower
         shall have any right to withdraw any of the funds held in the Facility
         LC Collateral Account. After all of the Obligations have been
         indefeasibly paid in full and the Aggregate Commitment has been
         terminated, any funds remaining in the Facility LC Collateral Account
         shall be returned by the Agent to the Borrower or paid to whomever may
         be legally entitled thereto at such time.

                  (e) If, within 30 days after acceleration of the maturity of
         the Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Lenders to
         make Loans and the obligation and power of the LC Issuer to issue
         Facility LCs hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any
         Default as described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 with respect to the
         Borrower) and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the
         Obligations due shall have been obtained or entered, the Required
         Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the Agent shall, by
         notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration and/or
         termination.

         8.2. Amendments. Subject to the provisions of this Section 8.2, the
Required Lenders (or the Agent with the consent in writing of the Required
Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing
in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or waiving any
Default hereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall,
without the consent of all of the Lenders:

                  (a) Extend the final maturity of any Loan (except by extension
         of the Facility Termination Date pursuant to Section 2.20), or extend
         the expiry date of any Facility LC to a date after the Facility
         Termination Date or forgive all or any portion of the principal amount
         thereof or any Reimbursement Obligation related thereto, or reduce the
         rate or


                                       43

<PAGE>

         extend the time of payment of interest or fees thereon or Reimbursement
         Obligations related thereto.

                  (b) Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
         Required Lenders.

                  (c) Extend the Facility Termination Date (except by extension
         of the Facility Termination Date pursuant to Section 2.20), or reduce
         the amount or extend the payment date for, the mandatory payments
         required under Section 2.2, or increase the amount of the Aggregate
         Commitment or of the Commitment of any Lender hereunder or the
         commitment to issue Facility LCs, or permit the Borrower to assign its
         rights under this Agreement.

                  (d) Amend this Section 8.2.

                  (e) Release any Guarantor that remains a Material Domestic
         Subsidiary.

No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Agent shall be
effective without the written consent of the Agent, and no amendment of any
provision relating to the LC Issuer shall be effective without the written
consent of the LC Issuer. The Agent may waive payment of the fee required under
Section 12.3(c) without obtaining the consent of any other party to this
Agreement.

         8.3. Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders, the
LC Issuer or the Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall
impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an
acquiescence therein, and the making of a Credit Extension notwithstanding the
existence of a Default or the inability of the Borrower to satisfy the
conditions precedent to such Credit Extension shall not constitute any waiver or
acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not
preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or
provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing
signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only to the
extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the
Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available
to the Agent, the LC Issuer and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid
in full.

         9.2. Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, neither the LC Issuer nor any Lender shall be
obligated to extend credit to the Borrower in violation of any limitation or
prohibition provided by any applicable statute or regulation.

         9.3. Headings. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of
the provisions of the Loan Documents.

         9.4. Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement
and understanding among the Borrower, the Agent, the LC Issuer and the Lenders
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the Borrower, the
Agent, the LC Issuer and the Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof
other than those contained in the fee letter described in Section 10.13 which
shall survive and remain in full force and effect during the term of this
Agreement.

         9.5. Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement. The respective
obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the
Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to perform any of
its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any
right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and
their respective successors and assigns, provided, however, that the parties
hereto expressly agree that the Arranger shall enjoy the benefits of the
provisions of Sections 9.6, 9.10, 10.11 and 10.13 to the extent specifically set
forth therein and shall have the right to enforce such provisions on its own
behalf and in its own name to the same extent as if it were a party to this
Agreement.

         9.6. Expenses; Indemnification.

                  (a) The Borrower shall reimburse the Agent and the Arranger
         for any costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including
         attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent, which
         attorneys may be employees of the Agent) paid or incurred by the Agent
         or the Arranger in connection with the preparation, negotiation,
         execution, delivery, syndication, distribution (including, without
         limitation, via the internet), review, amendment, modification, and
         administration of the Loan Documents. The Borrower also agrees to
         reimburse the Agent, the Arranger, the LC Issuer and the Lenders for
         any costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including
         attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent, the
         Arranger, the LC Issuer and the Lenders, which attorneys may be
         employees of the Agent, the Arranger, the LC Issuer or the Lenders)
         paid or incurred by the Agent, the Arranger, the LC Issuer or any
         Lender in connection with the collection and enforcement of the Loan
         Documents. Expenses being reimbursed by the Borrower under this Section
         include, without limitation, costs and expenses incurred in connection
         with the Reports described in the following sentence. The Borrower
         acknowledges that from time to time Bank One may prepare and may
         distribute to the Lenders (but shall have no obligation or duty to
         prepare or to distribute to the Lenders) certain audit reports (the
         "Reports") pertaining to the Borrower's assets for internal use by Bank
         One from information furnished to it by or on behalf of the Borrower,
         after Bank One has exercised its rights of inspection pursuant to this
         Agreement.

                  (b) The Borrower hereby further agrees to indemnify the Agent,
         the Arranger, the LC Issuer, each Lender, their respective affiliates,
         and each of their directors, officers


                                       45

<PAGE>

         and employees against all losses, claims, damages, penalties,
         judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, all
         expenses of litigation or preparation therefor whether or not the
         Agent, the Arranger, the LC Issuer, any Lender or any affiliate is a
         party thereto) which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or
         relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the transactions
         contemplated hereby or the direct or indirect application or proposed
         application of the proceeds of any Credit Extension hereunder except to
         the extent that they are determined in a final non-appealable judgment
         by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross
         negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification.
         The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 9.6 shall survive
         the termination of this Agreement.

         9.7. Numbers of Documents. All statements, notices, closing documents,
and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Agent with sufficient
counterparts so that the Agent may furnish one to each of the Lenders.

         9.8. Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all
accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting
determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting
Principles, except that any calculation or determination which is to be made on
a consolidated basis shall be made for the Borrower and all its Subsidiaries,
including those Subsidiaries, if any, which are unconsolidated on the Borrower's
audited financial statements.

         9.9. Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid
without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

         9.10. Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Borrower on
the one hand and the Lenders, the LC Issuer and the Agent on the other hand
shall be solely that of borrower and lender. Neither the Agent, the Arranger,
the LC Issuer nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the
Borrower. Neither the Agent, the Arranger, the LC Issuer nor any Lender
undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the Borrower
of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrower's business or
operations. The Borrower agrees that neither the Agent, the Arranger, the LC
Issuer nor any Lender shall have liability to the Borrower (whether sounding in
tort, contract or otherwise) for losses suffered by the Borrower in connection
with, arising out of, or in any way related to, the transactions contemplated
and the relationship established by the Loan Documents, or any act, omission or
event occurring in connection therewith, unless it is determined in a final
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such losses
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party from which
recovery is sought. Neither the Agent, the Arranger, the LC Issuer nor any
Lender shall have any liability with respect to, and the Borrower hereby waives,
releases and agrees not to sue for, any special, indirect, consequential or
punitive damages suffered by the Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or
in any way related to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated
thereby.


                                       46

         9.11. Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees to hold any confidential
information which it may receive from the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement in
confidence, except for disclosure (a) to its Affiliates and to other Lenders and
their respective Affiliates, (b) to legal counsel, accountants, and other
professional advisors to such Lender or to a Transferee, (c) to regulatory
officials, (d) to any Person as requested pursuant to or as required by law,
regulation, or legal process, (e) to any Person in connection with any legal
proceeding to which such Lender is a party, (f) to such Lender's direct or
indirect contractual counterparties in swap agreements or to legal counsel,
accountants and other professional advisors to such counterparties, (g)
permitted by Section 12.4 and (h) to rating agencies if requested or required by
such agencies in connection with a rating relating to the Credit Extensions
hereunder.

         9.12. Nonreliance. Each Lender hereby represents that it is not relying
on or looking to any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System) for the repayment of the Credit
Extensions provided for herein.

         9.13. Disclosure. The Borrower and each Lender hereby acknowledge and
agree that Bank One and/or its Affiliates from time to time may hold investments
in, make other loans to or have other relationships with the Borrower and its
Affiliates.


                                   ARTICLE 10

                                    THE AGENT
                                    ---------

         10.1. Appointment; Nature of Relationship. Bank One, NA is hereby
appointed by each of the Lenders as its contractual representative (herein
referred to as the "Agent") hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and
each of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Agent to act as the contractual
representative of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly set forth
herein and in the other Loan Documents. The Agent agrees to act as such
contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in this Article
10. Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Agent," it is expressly
understood and agreed that the Agent shall not have any fiduciary
responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and that the Agent is merely acting as the contractual representative
of the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In its capacity as the Lenders'
contractual representative, the Agent (x) does not hereby assume any fiduciary
duties to any of the Lenders, (y) is a "representative" of the Lenders within
the meaning of the term "secured party" as defined in the Illinois Uniform
Commercial Code and (z) is acting as an independent contractor, the rights and
duties of which are limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents. Each of the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim
against the Agent on any agency theory or any other theory of liability for
breach of fiduciary duty, all of which claims each Lender hereby waives.

         10.2. Powers. The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under
the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of
each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the
Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action specifically provided by
the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.


                                       47

<PAGE>

         10.3. General Immunity. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, the Lenders or
any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder
or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except
to the extent such action or inaction is determined in a final non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

         10.4. No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc. Neither the Agent nor
any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or
have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any statement, warranty
or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any borrowing
hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or
agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each
Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article 4, except
receipt of items required to be delivered solely to the Agent; (d) the existence
or possible existence of any Default or Unmatured Default; (e) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any Loan Document
or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith; (f) the
value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or priority of any Lien in any
collateral security; or (g) the financial condition of the Borrower or any
guarantor of any of the Obligations or of any of the Borrower's or any such
guarantor's respective Subsidiaries. The Agent shall have no duty to disclose to
the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished by the Borrower to
the Agent at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by the Borrower to the
Agent (either in its capacity as Agent or in its individual capacity).

         10.5. Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under
any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the
Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The Lenders hereby
acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary
action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by
the Required Lenders. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and
all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

         10.6. Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Agent may execute any of
its duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through
employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the
Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care. The Agent shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between the Agent and the Lenders
and all matters pertaining to the Agent's duties hereunder and under any other
Loan Document.

         10.7. Reliance on Documents; Counsel. The Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed or sent by the proper person or


                                       48

<PAGE>

persons, and, in respect to legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected
by the Agent, which counsel may be employees of the Agent.

         10.8. Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders agree to
reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective
Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their
Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (a) for any amounts not
reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Agent is entitled to reimbursement by
the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (b) for any other expenses incurred by
the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Agent in
connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or
more of the Lenders) and (c) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or
any other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions
contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such amounts
incurred by or asserted against the Agent in connection with any dispute between
the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the
enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other
documents, provided that (i) no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing
to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment
by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the Agent and (ii) any indemnification required
pursuant to Section 3.5(g) shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section
10.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions thereof.
The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall survive payment of
the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

         10.9. Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default
hereunder unless the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the
Borrower referring to this Agreement describing such Default or Unmatured
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that
the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to
the Lenders.

         10.10. Rights as a Lender. In the event the Agent is a Lender, the
Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is a Lender, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The Agent and
its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in
any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such Subsidiary is not
restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person.

         10.11. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other
Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement


                                       49

<PAGE>

and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking
action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         10.12. Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be
effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent
has been appointed, forty-five days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its
intention to resign. The Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause
by written notice received by the Agent from the Required Lenders, such removal
to be effective on the date specified by the Required Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, on
behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Agent. If no successor Agent
shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty days after
the resigning Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the
resigning Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a
successor Agent. Notwithstanding the two immediately preceding sentences: (x)
subject to clause (y) of this sentence, the consent of the Borrower shall be
required prior to the appointment of a successor Agent unless such successor
Agent is a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, provided that the consent of the
Borrower shall not be required if a Default has occurred and is continuing; and
(y) the Agent may at any time without the consent of the Borrower or any Lender,
appoint any of its Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor Agent
hereunder. If the Agent has resigned or been removed and no successor Agent has
been appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Agent hereunder
and the Borrower shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations to the
applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the
Lenders. No successor Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such
successor Agent has accepted the appointment. Any such successor Agent shall be
a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent,
such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Agent. Upon
the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Agent, the resigning or
removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and
under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation or removal
of an Agent, the provisions of this Article 10 shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents. In the event that there is a successor to the Agent by merger, or the
Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this
Section 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used in this Agreement shall mean
the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new Agent.

         10.13. Agent and Arranger Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent
and the Arranger, for their respective accounts, the fees agreed to by the
Borrower, the Agent and the Arranger pursuant to that certain letter agreement
dated May 20, 2002, or as otherwise agreed from time to time.

         10.14. Delegation to Affiliates. The Borrower and the Lenders agree
that the Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates. Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents
and employees) which performs duties in connection


                                       50

<PAGE>

with this Agreement shall be entitled to the same benefits of the
indemnification, waiver and other protective provisions to which the Agent is
entitled under Articles 9 and 10.


                                   ARTICLE 11

                            SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS
                            ------------------------

         11.1. Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of
the Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all account
balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or
any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may
be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations and Rate Management
Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the Obligations or Rate
Management Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due.

         11.2. Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise,
has payment made to it upon its Outstanding Credit Exposure (other than payments
received pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than
that received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to
purchase a portion of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure held by the
other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its Pro Rata
Share of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure ratable proportion of Loans.
If any Lender, whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be
subject to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its
Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees,
promptly upon demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share
in the benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their respective Pro
Rata Shares of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure. In case any such
payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further
adjustments shall be made.


                                   ARTICLE 12

                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

         12.1. Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the
Lenders and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except
that (a) the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or
obligations under the Loan Documents without the prior written consent of each
Lender, (b) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section
12.3, and (c) any transfer by Participation must be made in compliance with
Section 12.2. Any attempted assignment or transfer by any party not made in
compliance with this Section 12.1 shall be null and void, unless such attempted
assignment or transfer is treated as a participation in accordance with Section
12.3(c). The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (b) of this
Section 12.1 relates only to absolute assignments and this Section 12.1 does not
prohibit assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation,
(x) any pledge or assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement and any Note


                                       51

<PAGE>

to a Federal Reserve Bank or (y) in the case of a Lender which is a fund, any
pledge or assignment of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement
and any Note to its trustee in support of its obligations to its trustee;
provided, however, that no such pledge or assignment creating a security
interest shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder
unless and until the parties thereto have complied with the provisions of
Section 12.3. The Agent may treat the Person which made any Loan or which holds
any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until such
Person complies with Section 12.3; provided, however, that the Agent may in its
discretion (but shall not be required to) follow instructions from the Person
which made any Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments relating to such
Loan or Note to another Person. Any assignee of the rights to any Loan or any
Note agrees by acceptance of such assignment to be bound by all the terms and
provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any
Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or
consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been
issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent
holder or assignee of the rights to such Loan.

         12.2. Participations

                  (a) Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in the
         ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law,
         at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities
         ("Participants") participating interests in any Outstanding Credit
         Exposure of such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment
         of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan
         Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating
         interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan
         Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely
         responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
         obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Outstanding
         Credit Exposure and the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence
         thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable
         by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if such
         Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrower and
         the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
         in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan
         Documents.

                  (b) Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to
         approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment,
         modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other
         than any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Credit
         Extension or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which
         would require consent of all of the Lenders pursuant to the terms of
         Section 8.2 or of any other Loan Document.

                  (c) Benefit of Certain Provisions. The Borrower agrees that
         each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided
         in Section 11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts
         owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of
         its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under
         the Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of
         setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of
         participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to
         share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the


                                       52

<PAGE>

         right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each
         Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of
         setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if
         each Participant were a Lender. The Borrower further agrees that each
         Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4
         and 3.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its
         interest by assignment pursuant to Section 12.3, provided that (i) a
         Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
         Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 than the Lender who sold the participating
         interest to such Participant would have received had it retained such
         interest for its own account, unless the sale of such interest to such
         Participant is made with the prior written consent of the Borrower, and
         (ii) any Participant not incorporated under the laws of the United
         States of America or any State thereof agrees to comply with the
         provisions of Section 3.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender.

         12.3. Assignments.

                  (a) Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may at any time assign
         to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any part
         of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. Such assignment
         shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit C or in such other form
         as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. Each such assignment with
         respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a
         Lender or an Approved Fund shall either be in an amount equal to the
         entire applicable Commitment and Loans of the assigning Lender (unless
         each of the Borrower, the LC Issuer and the Agent otherwise consents)
         be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000. The amount of the
         assignment shall be based on the Commitment or outstanding Loans (if
         the Commitment has been terminated) subject to the assignment,
         determined as of the date of such assignment or as of the "Trade Date,"
         if the "Trade Date" is specified in the assignment.

                  (b) Consents. The consent of the Borrower shall be required
         prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a
         Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, provided that the
         consent of the Borrower shall not be required if a Default has occurred
         and is continuing. The consent of the Agent shall be required prior to
         an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an
         Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund. The consent of the LC Issuer
         shall be required prior to an assignment of a Commitment becoming
         effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender with a Commitment. Any
         consent required under this Section 12.3(b) shall not be unreasonably
         withheld or delayed.

                  (c) Effect; Effective Date. Upon (i) delivery to the Agent of
         an assignment, together with any consents required by Sections 12.3(a)
         and 12.3(b), and (ii) payment of a $3,000 fee to the Agent for
         processing such assignment (unless such fee is waived by the Agent),
         such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified
         in such assignment. The assignment shall contain a representation by
         the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make
         the purchase of the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure under
         the applicable assignment agreement constitutes "plan assets" as
         defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser
         in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA.
         On and after the


                                       53

<PAGE>

         effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all
         purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan
         Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the
         rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the
         same extent as if it were an original party thereto, and the transferor
         Lender shall be released with respect to the Commitment and Outstanding
         Credit Exposure assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent
         or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent. In the case of an
         assignment covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and
         obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
         Lender hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of,
         and subject to, those provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan
         Documents which survive payment of the Obligations and termination of
         the applicable agreement. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
         rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with
         this Section 12.3 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a
         sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations
         in accordance with Section 12.2. Upon the consummation of any
         assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3(c), the
         transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower shall, if the transferor
         Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes,
         make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate,
         replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes
         or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in
         each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments,
         as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.

                  (d) Register. The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an
         agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Chicago,
         Illinois a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a
         register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders,
         and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to,
         each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
         "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the
         Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
         recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
         hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to
         the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the
         Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time
         upon reasonable prior notice.

         12.4. Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes each Lender
to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an
interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any
prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including
without limitation any information contained in any Reports; provided that each
Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.11 of this
Agreement.

         12.5. Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is
transferred to any Transferee which is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such
Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with
the provisions of Section 3.5(d).

         For the purposes of this Schedule, the following terms have the
following meanings, subject to the final paragraph of this Schedule:

         "Financials" means the annual or quarterly financial statements of the
Borrower delivered pursuant to Section 6.1(a) or (b).

         "Level I Status" exists at any date if, as of the last day of the
fiscal quarter of the Borrower referred to in the most recent Financials, the
Leverage Ratio is less than 1.25 to 1.00.

         "Level II Status" exists at any date, as of the last day of the fiscal
quarter of the Borrower referred to in the most recent Financials, if the
Borrower has not qualified for Level I Status.

         "Status" means either Level I Status or Level II Status.

         The Applicable Margin and Applicable Fee Rate shall be determined in
accordance with the foregoing table based on the Borrower's Status as reflected
in the then most recent Financials. Adjustments, if any, to the Applicable
Margin or Applicable Fee Rate shall be effective five Business Days after the
Agent has received the applicable Financials. If the Borrower fails to deliver
the Financials to the Agent at the time required pursuant to Section 6.1, then
the Applicable Margin and Applicable Fee Rate shall be the highest Applicable
Margin and Applicable Fee Rate set forth in the foregoing table until five days
after such Financials are so delivered.
