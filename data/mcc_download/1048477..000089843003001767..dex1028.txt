upon the following term and conditions: Lessee shall give Lessor written notice

Rent for the second option period shall be determined as follows:

Rent shall be adjusted to the then fair market value for the Premises (the "Fair
Market Value"). Fair Market Value is defined as the rent for Comparable Space

within the previous six(6) months of the exercise of any given option (the
"Comparable Leases"). If there have been no leases signed within such time
period, then Fair Market Value shall be defined as the rent quoted for
Comparable Space (the "Quoted Rent"). The definition of Fair Market Value shall
include annual rent adjustments in the Comparable Leases or Quoted Rent. In no
event shall the rent for any option period be less than the rent paid by Lessee
during the year immediately preceding such option period.

All other terms and conditions of the lease shall remain the same unless as
indicated herein.
