(&#147;Agreement&#148;) is entered into effective as of December 18, 2002, by and between VARIAN, INC., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;)</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1" COLOR="#000000"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT><FONT

stockholders for the Company to agree to pay Employee termination compensation in the event Employee should leave the employ of the Company under the circumstances described below. The Board recognizes that the possibility of a proposal from a third
person, whether or not solicited by the Company, concerning a possible &#147;Change in Control&#148; of the Company (as such language is defined in Section 3(d)) will be unsettling to Employee. Therefore, the arrangements set forth in this Agreement
are being made to help assure a continuing dedication by Employee to Employee&#146;s duties to the Company notwithstanding the proposal or occurrence of a Change in Control. The Board believes it imperative, should the Company receive any proposal
from a third party, that Employee, without being influenced by the uncertainties of Employee&#146;s own situation, be able to assess and advise the Board whether such proposals are in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders, and to
enable Employee to take action regarding such proposals as the Board might determine to be appropriate. The Board also wishes to demonstrate to key personnel that the Company desires to enhance management relations and its ability to retain and, if
needed, to attract new management, and intends to ensure that loyal and dedicated management personnel are treated fairly. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P
