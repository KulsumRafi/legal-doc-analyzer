stock freely tradeable on the NASDAQ market either at the time of or following a Series C Closing, and SMC must agree to enter into the price protection mechanism acceptable to the Company.&nbsp; A price protection mechanism shall be acceptable to the Company if (I)
the Company is assured of realizing net proceeds from the sale of the SMC common stock received by the Company (during the five (5) consecutive trading day period after the time such stock is freely tradable [i.e., without any volume or other restrictions] on the
NASDAQ market) in an amount at least equal to the deemed value of such SMC common stock at the time of the Series C Closing, and (II) the five (5) trading-day period described in the preceding clause (I) shall only commence at such time as SMC has delivered to the
Company written notification, which notification may be delivered concurrently with the delivery to the Company of the SMC common stock constituting a portion of the purchase price for the Series C Shares, that such SMC common stock is, as of the date of such notice,
freely tradable.&nbsp; Any price protection mechanism will terminate at the close of trading on the fifth (5<sup>th</sup>) trading day after the time the SMC common stock issued to THP is freely tradable (as described above) on the NASDAQ market.&nbsp; In the event
that SMC is unable to agree with the Company on an acceptable price protection mechanism, then SMC shall pay the entire purchase price for the Series C Shares in cash or other immediately available funds.&nbsp; The foregoing notwithstanding, a price protection
mechanism shall not be deemed unacceptable by the Company for the sole reason that such mechanism reserves the right to SMC to receive any net proceeds resulting from the sale of the SMC common stock which would cause total proceeds received by the Company to be in
excess of the amount which would otherwise have been payable to the Company in cash for the Series C Shares.</font></p>
