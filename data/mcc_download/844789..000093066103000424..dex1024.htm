circumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to Borrower shall toll the statute of limitations as to Guarantor, (b) any right to cause a marshalling of Borrower&#146;s assets, (c) all exemptions and homestead laws, and (d) all

repayment of the Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantor specifically acknowledges that Lender&#146;s obtaining any such guaranty agreements or collateral is not a condition to the enforcement of this Guaranty. If Lender should simultaneously or hereafter
elect to attempt to take additional guaranty agreements or collateral to secure repayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and if its efforts to do so should fail in any respect including, without limitation, a determination that the agreement

extent necessary for that purpose, all of Guarantor&#146;s rights to any such payments or distributions to which Guarantor would otherwise be entitled. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create a duty in Lender to take any action

contingency, whether by reason of demand or acceleration of the final maturity of the Loan or otherwise, shall the interest contracted for, charged, received, paid or agreed to be paid to Lender under or in connection with the Loan exceed the
maximum amount permissible under applicable law. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to Lender shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full period (including any renewal or
extension) until payment in full of the principal balance of the Loan so that the interest hereon for such full period shall not exceed the maximum amount permissible under applicable law. Lender expressly disavows any intent to contract for, charge
or receive interest in an amount which exceeds the maximum amount permissible under applicable law. This paragraph shall control all agreements between Guarantor and Lender. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV
