the Code (or any successor provision thereto), or to any similar tax imposed by

state or local law, or any interest or penalties with respect to such taxes,

then such payments and benefits to be paid or provided shall be reduced to an

amount (but not below zero) that would result in the maximum possible net after

tax receipts to you from all such payments or distributions (determined by

reference to the present value determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4)

of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) of all such payments net of

all such taxes, or any interest or penalties with respect to such taxes,

determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section&nbsp;1 of the

Code (or any successor provision thereto) that applied to your taxable income

for the immediately preceding taxable year) (the &#147;Reduced Amount&#148;).&#160; The fact that your payments or benefits may

be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this paragraph will not of

itself limit or otherwise affect any of your other rights other than pursuant

to this Agreement.&#160; If it is determined

that you should receive a Reduced Amount, FTD will provide you notice to that

effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof.&#160; You will then be entitled to designate the

payments or benefits to be so reduced in order to give effect to this

paragraph.&#160; In the event that you fail

to make such designation within ten business days of notification of the

reduction in payments or benefits is required pursuant to this paragraph, FTD

may effect such reduction in any manner it deems appropriate.</font></p>

laws of the State of Illinois, excluding the conflicts-of-law principles

thereof.&#160; You and FTD consent to

jurisdiction and venue in any federal or state court in the City of Chicago.&#160; This Agreement and the accompanying <u>Exhibit&nbsp;A</u>

state our entire agreement and understanding regarding your employment with

FTD.&#160; This agreement may be amended only

by a written document signed by both you and FTD.&#160; No delay or failure to exercise any right under this Agreement

waives such rights under the Agreement.&#160;

If any provision of this Agreement is partially or completely invalid or

unenforceable, then that provision shall only be ineffective to such extent of

its invalidity or unenforceability, and the validity or enforceability of any

other provision of this Agreement shall not be affected.&#160; Any controversy relating to this Agreement

shall be settled by arbitration in Chicago, Illinois in accordance with the

Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, except as

otherwise provided in the Confidentiality and Non-Competition agreement

attached hereto as <u>Exhibit&nbsp;A</u>.&#160;

In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and any
