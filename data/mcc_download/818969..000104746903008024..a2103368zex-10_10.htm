<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT is made by and between Provident Bank of Maryland, a Maryland corporation ("Provident") and Gary N. Geisel ("Executive"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Agreement's purpose is to provide certain supplemental retirement and death benefits to Executive and his surviving spouse in consideration of his services to
Provident. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Agreement has been approved on Provident's behalf by resolution of the Compensation Committee of Provident's Board of Directors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, Provident and Executive agree as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><U>Retirement Income</U>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning at Executive's Termination Date, Provident shall
pay to Executive a monthly benefit (the "Supplemental Benefit") for Executive's life equal to 70% of Executive's Final Salary, reduced by both his Social Security Benefit and his highest monthly age
65 benefit accrued under the Provident Pension Plan. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
the end of the fifth year after Executive incurs a disability (as described in the Provident Pension Plan), his employment will be terminated and he will receive benefits under this
Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
monthly Supplemental Benefit payment (whether payable before or after his Normal Retirement Date) is to be reduced by 3% for each full year (with proportionate reduction for any
partial year) by which Executive's Termination Date precedes his Normal Retirement Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive
may make an irrevocable election, on a form provided by Provident, to receive a lump sum benefit equal to the actuarial present value (as described in the Provident Pension
Plan) of benefits due under this Agreement if such benefits become due following a "Change in Control." </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><U>Spouse's Death Benefit</U>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Executive dies after his 45th birthday and before he
has received 180&nbsp;monthly Supplemental Benefit payments, Provident shall pay to his surviving spouse a monthly Spouse's Benefit beginning at Executive's death and continuing until the earlier of
the surviving spouse's death or until the combined number of monthly payments under this Agreement received by Executive and his spouse equals 180. Each monthly Spouse's Benefit payment shall equal
the Supplemental Benefit payment that Executive would have received if he were still living at the date the spouse's payment is to be made and, if Executive dies without having received any
Supplemental Benefits, determined as if his Supplemental Benefits began on the date of his death. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><U>Funding</U>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provident's obligations under this Agreement shall not be secured in
any manner. No asset of Provident shall be physically or legally segregated for the benefit of Executive or his spouse, and the eventual payment of the payments described in this Agreement to
Executive, his spouse or any other person shall not be secured to him or them by the issuance of any negotiable instrument or other evidence of indebtedness of Provident. Neither Executive, his
spouse, nor any other person shall be deemed to have any property interest, legal or equitable, in any specific asset of Provident, and, to the extent that any person acquires any right to receive
payments under this Agreement, that right shall be no greater than, nor shall it have any preference or priority over, the rights of any unsecured general creditor of Provident. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><U>Assignment</U>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No payments, benefits or rights under this Agreement shall be
subject in any manner to anticipation, sale, transfer, assignment, mortgage, pledge, encumbrance, charge or alienation </FONT></P>

by Executive, his spouse or any other person who could or might possibly receive payments under this Agreement. In the event of any attempted assignment, alienation, encumbrance or transfer,
Provident shall have no further liability under this Agreement. If benefits due under this plan are wrongfully denied following a Change of Control, Provident or its successor shall pay to Executive
or his beneficiary an amount equal to the court costs and Executive's reasonable attorney's fees expended to recover such benefits. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><U>Amendment and Termination</U>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement may be amended or terminated at any
time and in any respect by the written agreement of Provident and Executive. Provident's Board of Directors may amend or terminate this Agreement at any time without Executive's consent by advance
written notice delivered to Executive, provided that the Board of Directors may not unilaterally: (i)&nbsp;reduce or modify Executive's accrued benefit, determined as of the date written notice of
the amendment or termination is received by Executive or (ii)&nbsp;amend or terminate this Agreement in any respect after a Change in Control has occurred. Executive's accrued benefit as of any date
is the vested Supplemental Benefit (and spouse's death benefit) that he and his spouse would receive under this Agreement if that date were his Termination Date (but the Supplemental Benefit payments
are to be deferred until his actual Termination Date occurs, without actuarial increase). </FONT></P>

benefits under this Agreement (including any benefits payable to his spouse) shall be fully vested unless his employment by Provident is terminated by Provident for Cause. If Executive is terminated
for Cause, all benefits under this Agreement shall be forfeited. Termination of Executive's employment by Provident for "Cause" means termination upon: </FONT></P>

willful and continued failure by Executive to substantially perform his duties with Provident (other than any such failure resulting from his incapacity due to
physical or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to Executive by Provident's Board of Directors, which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the
Board of Directors believes that Executive has not substantially performed his duties, or </FONT></P>

willful engaging by Executive in conduct that is demonstrably and materially injurious to Provident, monetarily or otherwise. </FONT></P>

adopted prior to this Agreement that provides retirement benefits to Executive, except (i)&nbsp;any retirement or other deferred compensation plan intended to qualify under Section&nbsp;401 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, (ii)&nbsp;any plan or agreement that expressly provides that its benefits are not to be superseded by this Agreement and (iii)&nbsp;any nonqualified plan or
agreement to which Executive has made contributions directly or by salary reduction. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><U>Construction</U>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall be construed according to the laws of
Maryland, except where superseded by Federal law. Use of the masculine gender includes the feminine gender, use of the singular case includes the plural, and vice versa. The invalidity of any portion
of this Agreement shall not invalidate the remainder of the Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect. The Supplemental Benefits and the Spouse's Benefits are to be payable in the same
manner as salary payments are made by Provident to its executives. All payments are subject to applicable withholding and other taxes required by law. </FONT></P>
