      PART 1.     AMENDMENT OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT.

      From and after the execution of this Amendment, as of the Effective Date,
the Loan Agreement is amended as follows:


            A.
TEMPORARY OVERADVANCE FACILITY. Through the close of business on Friday,
February 14, 2003, Availability under the Revolving Credit shall be equal to the
sum of (i)


                                       1
<Page>

Availability as currently defined in the Loan Agreement, and (ii) $1,165,000.00.
                  1.
      The figure "$1,165,000.00" set forth above shall be amended and the
      temporary overadvance facility shall be increased by $500,000.00 to
      $1,665,000.00 upon receipt by the Lender of a standby letter of credit in
      the amount of $500,000.00 naming the Lender as beneficiary, issued by a
      commercial bank acceptable to the Lender and otherwise in form and
      substance acceptable to the Lender, in the Lender's sole discretion. In
      lieu of obtaining a standby letter of credit, the Borrowers may deliver to
      the Lender $500,000.00 in additional cash collateral (the "CASH
      COLLATERAL").
                  a.    If the Borrowers:
                        (1)   Obtain and deliver a standby letter of credit, it
                              shall be a so-called "CLEAN L/C" which permits the
                              Lender to draw thereon at any time upon
                              presentation of an appropriate sight draft,
                              without certification by the Lender of any kind;
                        (2)   Deliver the Cash Collateral to the Lender, the
                              Cash Collateral shall be maintained on deposit in
                              an account in the Lender's name, and may be
                              applied, offset, and otherwise liquidated by the
                              Lender at any time, without further notice to the
                              Borrowers.
                  b.    In either case, the proceeds of any drawing under the
                        standby letter of credit or the Cash Collateral may be
                        applied in reduction of the Liabilities in such manner
                        as the Lender, in its sole discretion, may determine.

                  c.    The Borrowers shall execute and deliver to the Lender,
                        or cause to be executed and delivered to the Lender,
                        whatever additional documents, instruments, and
                        agreements that the Lender may require in order to
                        effect, perfect, or vest the standby letter of credit or
                        the Cash Collateral more securely in the Lender.
                  2.
      In consideration of the Lender's granting a temporary overadvance
      facility, the Borrowers shall pay to the Lender a fee in the amount of
      $10,000.00 upon the execution of this Amendment. Further, so long as no
      further Event of Default occurs, the temporary overadvance facility may be
      extended by the Borrower for up to an additional three weeks, in one week
      increments to the close of business on the following Friday, upon payment
      to the Lender of an additional fee in the amount of $10,000.00 for each
      weekly extension.
                  a.    The weekly extension fee shall be paid on or before
                        5:00 P.M. Boston time on Friday of each week in
                        exchange for the extension through Friday of the
                        succeeding week;
                  b.    The temporary overadvance facility shall
                        automatically


                                       2
<Page>

                        expire:
                        (1)   If no such extension fee is paid for any week;
                              and
                        (2)   In all events, at the latest as of the close of
                              business on Friday, February 28, 2003.

      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the $10,000
      fee payable by the Borrowers to the Lender upon the execution of this
      Amendment shall be deemed to be the fee due for the week during which such
      execution occurs and shall be the only fee owed by the Borrowers to the
      Lender for the period from the Effective Date through the Execution Date.
                  3.
      All amounts outstanding under the temporary overadvance facility shall
      accrue interest at a fixed rate equal to 15% per annum. Interest on the
      temporary overadvance facility shall be payable at the times, and in the
      manner that interest is otherwise payable by the Borrowers on the
      Revolving Credit.
                  4.
      During the period that the temporary overadvance facility is in effect,
      the Effective Advance Rate financial performance covenant implemented in
      Part 2, Paragraph VI(A) of the Third Amendment shall be tested without
      regard to amounts outstanding under the temporary overadvance facility.
                  5.
      Upon the earlier of (i) expiration of the temporary overadvance facility,
      or (ii) the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Borrowers immediately
      shall pay to the Lender the amount by which the outstanding balance of the
      Loan Account exceeds Availability, without further demand, notice, or
      protest, all of which are expressly WAIVED.
            B.
INVENTORY LEVEL. The Borrowers shall at all times, tested daily upon receipt by
the Lender of the daily Borrowing Base Certificate, maintain gross Inventory in
aggregate amounts (measured at Cost on a rolling three-week average basis) not
(A) less than the greater of (i) 85% of the amounts shown on the Business Plan,

otherwise; nor is there any claim, counterclaim, offset, or defense (or other
right, remedy, or basis having a similar effect) available to any of the
Borrowers or to any Guarantor with regard thereto; nor is there any basis on

other than as stated on the written instruments which evidence such Liabilities.
      IV..
The Borrowers and each Guarantor, by executing this Amendment where indicated
below, hereby acknowledge and agree that they have no offsets, defenses, claims,
or counterclaims against the Lender or the Lender's officers, directors,
