                                                                   EXHIBIT 10.37

                     THE BNS CO. SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLAN

                                 Amendment No. 1

         WHEREAS the BNS Co. Savings and Retirement Plan (the "Plan") was
amended to include "good faith EGTRRA plan amendments" within the meaning of
Notice 2001-57, but did not incorporate the recent changes described in Revenue
Ruling 2002-27;

         NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to Section 12.1 of the Plan, the Board of
Directors of BNS Co. hereby amend the Plan as follows, effective January 1,
1998:

         Section 2.41 is hereby amended by adding the following sentence to the
end thereof:

     "For purposes of this Section, amounts under Code Section 125 include any
     amounts not available to a Participant in cash in lieu of group health
     coverage because the Participant is unable to certify that he or she has
     other health coverage. To the extent required by applicable law or IRS
     guidance, an amount will be treated as an amount under Code Section 125
     pursuant to this Section only if the Employer does not request or collect
     information regarding the Participant's other health coverage as part of
     the enrollment process for the health plan."

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, BNS Co. has caused this amendment to be executed by
its duly authorized officer this 20th day of December, 2002.

                                              BNS Co.
