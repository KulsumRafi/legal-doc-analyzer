IMPORTANT NOTICES

This Program Description provides an overview of the MetLife Deferred
Compensation Plan for Outside Directors (the "Plan"). It is also the official
plan document that legally governs the Plan. This plan document will govern in
every respect and instance.

MetLife, Inc. will have the obligation to pay amounts deferred under the Plan
from and after January 1, 2003. MetLife, Inc.'s obligations have been registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Since this is an unfunded plan,
your rights or claims against assets or property are no greater than those of a
general creditor (see "Liability" on page 7).

The Plan does not constitute a contract for services as a director or otherwise.

This Program Description may be updated from time to time to implement changes
in the Plan. Fund performance data will be updated periodically. These updates
will constitute part of the Prospectus distributed with respect to the Plan.

The Plan Administrator may amend, alter or terminate the Plan in accordance with
its terms at any time and for any reason.

       This document constitutes part of a prospectus covering securities
     that have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
                 The date of this Prospectus is December, 2002.

METLIFE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR OUTSIDE DIRECTORS

The MetLife Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Directors (the "Plan") allows
eligible directors to defer receiving a portion of their fees for services as
director payable in cash to a later date, thereby deferring payment of federal
and most state income taxes. Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary.

ELIGIBILITY

Members of the Board of Directors of MetLife, Inc. who are not employees of
MetLife, Inc. or any of its affiliates are eligible to participate. In this
Program Description, "you" refers to a director who is eligible to participate
in the Plan.

HOW THE PLAN WORKS

Prior to the year in which your cash fees would have been payable, you may
designate all or a portion of those fees for deferral. If you become eligible to
participate in the Plan prior to October 1 of a given year, you may designate
all or a portion of your cash fees payable in that calendar year by submitting a
deferral election before the earlier of (1) the first meeting for which you earn
fees that you attend; or (2) the thirtieth day after you become eligible to
participate in the Plan. All deferrals are subject to the terms of the Plan,
which are contained in this document.
                                        ----------------------------------------

         your deferred compensation account;

-        A future distribution date; and

-        The number of distribution payments.

The form must be submitted within the enrollment period.

Before making your elections, you may wish to consult a tax or personal
financial advisor.

                                                                          Page 4

TAXES

Deferred compensation is not subject to current taxation under federal and most
state income tax laws.

DEFERRAL AMOUNTS

You may elect to defer all or a portion of your fees payable in cash for
services as a director of MetLife, Inc., including retainer fees, meeting fees,
and committee chairperson fees. If you choose to defer any of your cash fees,
you must defer at least $10,000.

Once you elect your deferral amount, you may not change it except in cases of
extreme hardship as provided in the Plan.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION ACCOUNT

A deferred cash account in your name will be established for record-keeping
purposes. You will receive account statements quarterly.

Your account will be credited at the end of the month in which your deferred
cash fees would otherwise have been paid.

INVESTMENT TRACKING FUNDS

Investment tracking funds are used as a device for adjusting the value of your
account based on fund performance.

Each investment tracking fund reflects the investment returns of the actual fund
or index, which are measured on a daily basis. Gains or losses will be credited
or debited from your account, in effect "mirroring" the performance of the
specified fund or index. Your deferrals will not actually be invested in the
funds. If the aggregate performance of the funds mirrored by the investment
tracking funds you choose is positive, the value of your account will increase;
if it is negative, the value of your account will decrease.

The Plan may be amended in accordance with its terms to eliminate or replace any
investment tracking fund at any time.

You can select for your account one or more of 12 investment tracking funds,
each of which mirrors the performance of one of the following actual funds or
indexes.

                                                                          Page 5

Fund allocations must be made in multiples of 5%.

You may change your investment tracking funds - either with regard to future
deferrals or existing account - at any time during the year by contacting Sandra
Lukowsky of Nonqualified Plan Services at (phone) (877) 855-6777, ext. 1, (fax)
(314) 444-0428, or (e-mail) slukowsky@genam.com; however, you may make no more
than six changes per year. You will receive confirmation of your changes shortly
after they are made.

See page 9 for information about the investment tracking funds.

THE DISTRIBUTION DATE

You may choose to have your account paid to you either (1) on a specific date no
less than three years after the year of deferral (for 2003, the date you choose
may not be earlier than 2007), or (2) upon the termination of your service as a
director of MetLife, Inc. eligible under the Plan. If you choose to receive your
account on a specific date, your account will be paid to you at the earlier of
(a) the date you selected, and (b) within 60 days following the termination of
your service as a director.

Once you have designated a distribution date, you cannot change it except as
described below under "Changing the Distribution Date And/Or Number of
Payments."

NUMBER OF PAYMENTS

You may elect to receive your account in either a lump-sum payment or up to 15
annual installments. Each annual installment will be a fraction of the account
balance with one being the numerator and the number of payments remaining being
the denominator. For example, if you elect to receive 10 annual payments, the
first payment is equal to 1/10th of the account balance; the second payment is
equal to 1/9th of the account balance; and so on until final payment is made.
Annual installments will be made during the month of the anniversary of the
event that initiated the first payment.

Payments are subject to deductions in accordance with federal, state and local
tax laws and regulations. Rollover to an IRA, qualified plan or non-qualified
plan is not permitted.

                                                                          Page 6

<PAGE>

CHANGING THE DISTRIBUTION DATE AND/OR NUMBER OF PAYMENTS

You may change either or both of (1) the date you have selected to receive
payment of your deferred compensation, and (2) the number of payments you have
chosen to receive. If you make any such change(s), they must be made at the same
time. You have only one opportunity to make these changes. Any such change(s)
must be made by you at least 12 months before the original date you selected for
payment. If you select a new date for payment, that date must be later than the
date you originally selected.

OTHER PLAN FEATURES

PAYMENT TO BENEFICIARIES

If you die before commencement or completion of distributions, the balance in
your account will be paid as a single lump sum to your beneficiary. If you have
not designated a beneficiary, or your beneficiary dies before you do, your
account will be paid to your surviving spouse or, if you are not married at the
time, to your estate. A domestic partner is not considered a surviving spouse
under the Plan.

You may designate an individual, a trustee or your estate as your beneficiary,
and you may change your beneficiary at any time. Your beneficiary designation
will apply to current and all prior year deferrals under the Plan.

LOANS

No loans may be taken from your account.

HARDSHIP EXCEPTIONS

In cases of extreme hardship, the Plan Administrator may suspend deferrals or
make payments to you, reducing the value of your account. However, the total
amount suspended and advanced cannot exceed the amount required to satisfy the
financial consequences of the hardship and tax withholding requirements.

ACCELERATED DISTRIBUTION

You may take a lump-sum distribution of your account at any time. However, you
will be charged a 10% penalty.

LIABILITY

Deferrals under the Plan are obligations of MetLife, Inc. A Rabbi Trust will
support the deferred compensation accounts under the Plan. The existence of the
trust will not change the unfunded, unsecured nature of the obligations under
the Plan or give you any right or security interest in any assets other than as
a general creditor of MetLife, Inc.

                                                                          Page 7

<PAGE>

ASSIGNMENT

No assignment or pledge of the right to receive the payment of amounts deferred
or any other rights under the Plan may be made.

CHANGE OF CONTROL PROTECTION

You may elect in advance to have your deferred compensation account paid to you
if you end your service as a director within two years after a Change of Control
of MetLife, Inc. For these purposes, the definition of Change of Control in the
MetLife Deferred Compensation Plan for Officers will apply. You will receive a
form to make this election.

PLAN ADMINISTRATOR

The Plan is administered by a Plan Administrator who may establish, amend or
rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan. The Plan Administrator of
this Plan is also the Plan Administrator of the Metropolitan Life Retirement
Plan for U.S. Employees. The Employee Benefits Committee of the Metropolitan
Life Insurance Company appoints the Plan Administrator of the Retirement Plan,
who serves until such time as the Committee appoints a new Plan Administrator.

The Plan Administrator may amend, modify, suspend, or terminate the Plan at any
time and for any reason, except as otherwise required by law. The Plan
Administrator, however, may not amend, modify or terminate the Plan in a way
that will reduce the amount that has been accrued in your deferred compensation
account prior to the effective date of the amendment, modification or
termination.

The determinations and interpretations of the Plan made by the Plan
Administrator shall be final, binding, and conclusive for all purposes under the
Plan. The Plan Administrator may prescribe forms for participants to take action
authorized or allowed under the Plan and may appoint agents and consult legal
counsel and other professionals to assist in administration of the Plan. The
Plan Administrator may, in his or her sole discretion, adjust the value of a
deferred compensation account on a basis other than as prescribed in deferral or
reallocation elections, including but not limited to the use of investment
tracking funds other than those selected by the participant.

-----------------------
(1) Lower rated high-yield, high-risk securities generally involve more credit
risk. These securities also may be subject to greater market price fluctuations
than lower yielding higher rated debt.

(2) Investments in small capitalization and emerging growth companies involve
greater than average risk. Such securities may have limited marketability and
the issues may have limited product lines, markets and financial resources. The
value of such investments may fluctuate more widely than investments in larger,
more established companies.

(3) International stocks contain additional risks that are not associated with
U.S. domestic issues, such as changes in currency exchange rates, different
governmental regulations, economic conditions and accounting standards.

(4) This index is comprised to a significant degree in technology issues. The
technology industry can be significantly affected by obsolescence, short product
cycles, falling profits and prices, and competition from new market
participants. A choice that is weighted in one sector is more volatile than
those that diversify across many industry sectors.
