<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS DISCRETIONARY LOAN, SECURITY AND PLEDGE AGREEMENT (&#147;Agreement&#148;) is
made as of March&nbsp;17, 2003, by and between ANTEX BIOLOGICS INC., a Delaware
corporation (&#147;Antex&#148;) and ANTEX PHARMA INC., a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Antex (the &#147;Subsidiary&#148;), and BIOPORT CORPORATION, a

</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antex and Lender have entered into a Letter of Intent, dated as of
February&nbsp;28, 2003 (the &#147;Letter of Intent&#148;). The Letter of Intent relates to a
proposed acquisition by Lender of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Borrowers and the provision of a discretionary loan in an amount not to exceed
$1,000,000 to Borrowers from Lender. The proceeds of the loan are to be used
by Borrowers to maintain their operations until the closing of the acquisition
described above.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lender is willing to make such loan to Borrowers on the terms and
conditions set forth herein.
</FONT>
<P align="center"><FONT size="2"><u>AGREEMENT</u>
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants set
forth herein, the parties agree as follows:
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loan to Borrowers</B>.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Loan and Note</u>. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
Lender will make cash advances (each an &#147;Advance&#148; and collectively, the
&#147;Advances&#148;) to Borrowers as a loan in an amount not to exceed ONE MILLION
DOLLARS ($1,000,000) (the &#147;Loan&#148;), the proceeds of which shall be used by
Borrowers exclusively to cover payroll, rent, utilities and other uses approved
in advance and in writing by Lender. The Loan shall consist of a discretionary
installment loan facility, with an initial advance of Two Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($200,000) to be disbursed to Borrowers upon execution hereof (the
&#147;Initial Advance&#148;). If, on March&nbsp;25, 2003, Lender determines in its sole
discretion that the Borrowers are negotiating the terms of the Definitive
Agreements in good faith and that there has been substantial progress toward
finalizing the Definitive Agreements, then Lender would make another Advance
(the &#147;Second Advance&#148;) of One Hundred and Eighty Thousand Dollars ($180,000).
Other than the Initial Advance, which shall be made on the date of execution
hereof, and the Second Advance, which would be made on or before March&nbsp;27,
2003, Lender shall inform Borrowers as to whether or not it will make future
Advances (&#147;Additional Advances&#148;) within two (2)&nbsp;days after receipt of a written
request by a Borrower. Lender shall determine, in its sole and absolute
discretion, whether or not to make Additional Advances and, if Lender
determines to make an Additional Advance, the amount and timing of such
Additional Advance and any conditions to

<P><FONT size="2">such Advance that are consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Each
Advance shall be evidenced by a promissory note of even date herewith, executed
by each Borrower in favor of Lender, in substantially the form of Exhibit&nbsp;A
hereto (a &#147;Note&#148;) that is to be repaid in accordance with the terms thereof.
Borrowers may prepay any Note, in whole or in part, at any time without premium
or penalty. Principal and interest on the Loan shall be due and payable on the
earlier of (x)&nbsp;April&nbsp;30, 2003, if the Definitive Agreements (as defined in the
Letter of Intent) have not been executed and delivered by the parties on or
prior to such date and (y)&nbsp;on the date that the Definitive Agreements are
terminated other than by reason of a material breach by Lender or its
affiliates. Borrowers obligation to repay principal and to pay interest on the
Loan shall be forgiven upon the consummation of the acquisition by Lender or
its affiliates of all or substantially all of the assets of Borrowers or upon
the consummation of a business combination of Antex with the Lender or its
affiliates.

loan proceeds, acceleration or maturity of the Note, or otherwise, shall the

irrespective of the Maturity Date specified herein, immediately due and payable
in full. In such case, Lender or other holder of this Note may exercise any

Documents and as granted by law. If an Event of Default has occurred, the
failure of Lender or the holder hereof to promptly exercise its rights to
declare the indebtedness remaining unpaid hereunder to be immediately due and
payable shall not constitute a waiver of such rights while such Event of
Default continues nor a waiver of such right in connection with any future
Event of Default.

governed by the commercial laws of the State of Maryland, as applicable, in
order to give effect to the Lender&#146;s security interest in the Collateral. If
any paragraph, clause or provision of this Note or any of the other Loan
Documents is construed or interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction to
