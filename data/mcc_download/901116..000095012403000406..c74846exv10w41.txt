                  (a)   On or prior to March 28, 2003, 2003, the Borrower shall
         engage (the "Engagement") a financial consultant (the "Consultant") to
         provide the Borrower with the services set forth in Schedule 5.17 (the
         "Services"). The Consultant (including any replacement thereof) shall
         be selected by the Borrower from the list of Persons provided by the
         Administrative Agent. After completion of the Services and delivery to
         the Administrative Agent of all reports and results received by the
         Borrower from the Consultant in connection with the Services, the
         Borrower shall be permitted to terminate the Engagement on the earlier
         of (x) the date that Holdings satisfies its obligations under Sections
         5.01(c) and 5.01(i) for three consecutive four-week fiscal periods
         following February 10, 2003; (y) the date that the aggregate fees paid
         by the Borrower to the Consultant (including any replacement thereof)
         in connection with the Services exceeds the Consultant Fee Cap and (z)
         such date as agreed to by the Administrative Agent. As used herein,
         "Consultant Fee Cap" shall mean an amount jointly determined by the
         Borrower and the Administrative Agent (each acting in good faith) to be
         a reasonable estimate of the aggregate fees to be paid to the
         Consultant to perform the Services. The Consultant Fee Cap shall be set
         forth in a writing acknowledged by the Borrower and the Administrative
         Agent within 10 days following the Engagement.

                 (b)    Each assignment given by the Borrower to the Consultant
         in connection with the performance of the Services must be approved by
         the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may request
         additional assignments to be conducted by the Consultant, provided that
         such assignments are within the scope of the Services and the Services
         (as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent) have not been
         completed.

                  (c)   The Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent with
         copies of the work product of the Consultant delivered to the Borrower
         pursuant to the terms of the Engagement within five days following
         receipt thereof by the Borrower. The Administrative Agent may
         communicate with the Consultant at any time during the Engagement
         without the consent of any Loan Party provided that one or more
         representatives of the Borrower are entitled to participate in such
         communications to the extent that such communications involve the scope
         of the Services (including any new assignments thereof) or any
         conclusions reached by the Consultant in connection with the Services.
         The Borrower shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
         Consultant to complete the Services and deliver the work product
         related thereto on a timely basis.

                  (d)   All fees and expenses of the Consultant incurred in
         connection with the Engagement shall be paid by the Borrower, and
         neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any
         obligation to pay any fees or expenses of the Consultant for the
         Services.

                  (c)   No material consent, approval, authorization or order
         of, or filing, registration or qualification with, any court or

                  (e)   The execution and delivery of this Amendment and the
         performance of the transactions contemplated hereby (a) do not require

         action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been
         obtained or made and are in full force and effect or, if not obtained
         or made, would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
         likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; (b) will not violate any
         applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other
         organizational documents of Holdings, the Borrower or any of the
         Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority, except, with
         respect to any violation of applicable law or regulation or any order
         of any Governmental Authority, to the extent any such violation would
         not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
         Material Adverse Effect; and (c) will not violate or result in a
         default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon
         Holdings, the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or its assets, or
         give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by
         Holdings, the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, except to the extent
         any such violation, default or right would not, individually or in the
         aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (f)   The Net Proceeds obtained from the sale of the real
         property identified on Schedule I hereto were used to fund expenditures
         for other assets used in the same line of business or in a Related
         Business prior to the date that was 18 months after the receipt of such
         Net Proceeds. The information in Schedule I is true and correct.

         4.4      General Release. In consideration of the Lenders entering into
this Amendment, the Loan Parties hereby release the Administrative Agent, the
Lenders, and the Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' respective officers,
employees, representatives, agents, counsel and directors from any and all
actions, causes of action, claims, demands, damages and liabilities of whatever
kind or nature, in law or in equity, now known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected to the extent that any of the foregoing arises from any action or
failure to act under the Credit Agreement on or prior to the date hereof.

         4.5      Counterparts/Telecopy. This Amendment may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Delivery of executed counterparts by telecopy shall be effective as an original
and shall constitute a representation that an original will be delivered if
requested.

         4.6      Further Assurances. The Borrower agrees to promptly take such
action, upon the reasonable request of the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders, as is reasonably necessary to carry out the intent of this Amendment,
the Security Documents and the Loan Documents, including, but not limited to,
such actions as are necessary to ensure that the Lenders have a perfected
security interest in the Collateral subject to no Liens other than the Liens
permitted by Section 6.02 of the Credit Agreement.

         4.7      GOVERNING LAW. THIS AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN
