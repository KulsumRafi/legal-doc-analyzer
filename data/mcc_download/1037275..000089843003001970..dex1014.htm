amount of each such payment.&#160; Borrower must have sufficient collected balances in its demand deposit account with CNB in order that each such payment will be available when due.&#160; CNB is authorized to note the date, amount and interest rate
of each Loan and each payment of principal and interest on CNB&#146;s books and records, which notations will constitute presumptive evidence of the accuracy of the information noted.&#160; Any Loan will be conclusively presumed to have been made to
or for the benefit of Borrower when CNB, in its sole discretion, believes that the request therefor has been made by authorized persons (whether in fact that is the case), or when the Loan is deposited to the credit of Borrower&#146;s account with
CNB, regardless of whether any Person other than Borrower may have authority to draw against such account.&#160; </font></p> <p><font size=2 face="Times New Roman">2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Default Interest Rate.</b>&#160; From and after

rate equal to three percent (3.0%) per annum higher than the interest rate stated in Section 2.1.1 until the Event of Default has been cured or waived; provided, however, for purposes of this Section, a LIBOR Loan will be treated as a Prime Loan
upon the termination of the Interest Period.&#160; All interest provided for in this Section will be compounded monthly and payable on demand. </font></p> <p><font size=2 face="Times New Roman">2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Up-Front

to the order of <b>City National Bank,</b> a national banking association (&#147;CNB&#148;), at its Office located at Sherman Oaks, CA, the principal amount of <b>Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00)</b> or so much thereof as may be advanced and
be outstanding, with interest thereon to be computed on each Revolving Credit Loan from the date of its disbursement at a rate computed on the basis of a 360-day year, actual days elapsed, at the rates, times and in accordance with the terms of that
certain Credit Agreement between Borrower and CNB, dated as of October 25, 2002, as it may be amended from time to time (the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;).&#160; Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings given them in that certain
Credit Agreement.&#160; </font></p> <p><font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All or any portion of the principal of this Revolving Credit Note (&#147;Note&#148;) may be borrowed, repaid and
reborrowed from time to time prior to the Termination Date, provided at the time of any borrowing no default exists under this Note and no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default exists under the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement
and provided, further that the total borrowings outstanding at any one time shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment less the amount of Letters of Credit issued and outstanding under the Credit Agreement.&#160; Each borrowing and repayment
of a Revolving Credit Loan shall be noted in the books and records of CNB.&#160; The excess of borrowings over repayments as noted on such books and records shall constitute presumptive evidence of the principal balance due hereon from time to time
and at any time.</font></p> <p><font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If payment on this Note becomes due and payable on a non-business day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next
business day and, with respect to payments of principal or interest thereon shall be payable during such extension at the then applicable rate.&#160; Upon the occurrence of one or more of the Events of Default specified in the Credit Agreement, all
amounts remaining unpaid on this Note may become or be declared to be immediately payable as provided in the Credit Agreement, without presentment, demand or notice of dishonor, all of which are expressly waived.&#160; Borrower agrees to pay all
costs of collection of this Note and reasonable attorneys&#146; fees (including attorneys&#146; fees allocable to CNB&#146;s in-house counsel) in connection therewith, irrespective of whether suit is brought thereon.</font></p> <p><font size=2

shall bear additional interest from the date of such notice at the rate of three percent (3.0%) per annum higher than the interest rate as determined and computed above, and continuing thereafter until the Event of Default is cured.</font></p>
