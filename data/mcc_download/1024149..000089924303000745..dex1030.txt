         WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to amend the Agreement of
Employment in the manner set forth below.

                                   AGREEMENTS

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and for other good
and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows:

         Section 1.    Effective immediately, the last paragraph in Section 5(a)
of the Agreement of Employment is hereby replaced and amended to read as
follows:

                       "If, during the Employment Period the Executive shall
                  terminate employment for Good Reason as defined in Section
                  4(c)(vi) then the Executive shall not be entitled to receive
                  those benefits as set forth in Section 5(a)(i)B, but shall
                  receive in addition to the benefits set forth in Sections
                  5(a)(i)A and 5(a)(ii)-5(a)(vi) hereof, a lump sum in cash
                  within 30 days after the Date of Termination equal to the
                  product of (x) 2 and (y) the product of (I) Annual Base Salary
                  and (II) fifty percent (50%)."

         Section 2.

         (a)      This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts,
each of which will be deemed an original but which together will constitute one
and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
of this Amendment by facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of
a manually executed counterpart of this Amendment.

         (b)      All references to Sections in this Amendment refer to Sections
of this Amendment, unless otherwise expressly provided for.

         (c)      All other provisions of the Agreement of Employment not
amended hereby will remain in full force and effect.
