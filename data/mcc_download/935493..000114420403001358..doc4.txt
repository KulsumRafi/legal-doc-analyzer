                                                           Campbell, California

     FOR  VALUE  RECEIVED  and  intending  to  be  legally  bound  hereby,   the
undersigned, P-Com, Inc, a Delaware corporation("Maker"), promises to pay to the
order of BBT FUND LP, a Grand Cayman limited liability partnership ("Payee") the
promised  sum  of  TWO  HUNDRED  0NE  THOUSAND   EIGHT   HUNDRED   SEVENTY  FIVE
DOLLARS(201,875.00),  or such  lesser  amount  as may,  at the time of  maturity
hereof, be outstanding  hereunder,  together with interest thereon from the date
hereof until  maturity on the principal sum remaining  from time to time unpaid,
at a rate equal to seven  percent  (7.0%) per annum,  payable in lawful money of
the United States,

     Maker shall pay all unpaid principal and accrued interest  hereunder on May
1,2003.  Interest  on this Note will  accrue  from  November 1, 2002 and will be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 3O-day months.

     After maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, interest shall accrue
at  the  rate  of nine percent (9.0%) per annum until all sums due hereunder are
paid.

     Maker  reserves  the right to prepay in whole or in part the  principal  of
this Note at any time or from  time to time  without  premium  or  penalty.  Any
payment hereunder ,shall be applied first to accrued interest,  and the balance,
if any, to principal.

     No prepayment shall obligate the holder hereof to make additional advances.
The  undersigned,  as Maker,  and all others who are or who shall become parties
primarily or secondarily liable on this Note,  whether as endorsers,  guarantors
or otherwise hereby agree to waive presentment,  demand for payment, protest and
notice of  nonpayment or &honor and agree that failure of the holder to exercise
any of its  rights  hereunder  in any  instance  shall not  constitute  a waiver
thereof in that or any other instance.

     In case suit shall be brought on this  Note,  Maker  agrees to pay  Payee's
reasonable attorney's fees and court costs.

     Conditioned  solely upon receipt of consent of Silicon  Valley  Bank,  this
Note is secured by a lien on such assets of Maker as are included on  Attachment
A or  suitable  replacement  items in the event of their  approved  sales in the
normal  course of business  and as may be covered by a security  agreement to be
dated as of the date hereof between Maker and Payee.

     The obligations of Maker hereunder shall  constitute  indebtedness  that is
senior to the Maker's existing 3-year Notes  outstanding  dated November 1,2002,
but shall be junior in right of payment to Maker's obligations to Silicon Valley
Bank  pursuant  to (i) that  certain  Loan and  Security  Agreement  dated as of
September  20,2002  among the Maker,  P-Com  Network  Services,  Inc and Silicon
Valley Bank or (ii) that  certain  Loan and Security  Agreement  (EXIM  Program)
dated as of September 20,20Q2 among the Maker, P-Corn Network Services, Inc. and
