              hereunder) for his use and that of his spouse (if any) during the
              continuance of his employment in respect of which the Company

              car for his use during the continuance of his employment, together
              with reimbursement of all business and reasonable private petrol

       may in its discretion decide.

       discretion to withdraw the use of the car provided pursuant to this
       Clause in circumstances reasonably provided for in the Company's car
       policy in force from time to time.

       month of service in the holiday year in which his employment terminates
       and the appropriate amount shall be paid to the Executive in addition to

       the Company's permanent health insurance scheme or such greater sum (if
       any) as the Board may in its absolute discretion decide.

11.3   If any incapacity of the Executive shall be or appear to be caused by any
       alleged action or wrong of a third party and the Executive shall decide
       to claim damages in respect thereof, then the Executive shall use all
       reasonable endeavours to recover damages for loss of earnings over the
       period for which salary has been or will be paid to him by the Company
       under Clause 11.1, and shall account to the Company for any such damages

       agrees to assign to the Company all of the Executive's right, title and
       interest (including without limitation all IPRs) in the Works.

12.4   The Executive hereby irrevocably authorises the Company to be his
       attorney, and to make use of his name and to sign and execute any
       documents and/or perform any act on his behalf, for the purpose of giving
       to the Company the full benefit of the provisions of this Clause 12 and,
       where permissible, to obtain patent or other protection in respect of any
       of the Works in the name of the Company or the Company's nominee.

12.5   The Executive shall from time to time, both during his employment under
       this Agreement and thereafter, at the request and expense of the Company,
       promptly do all things and execute all documents necessary or desirable
       to give effect to the provisions of this Clause 12 including, without
       limitation, all things necessary to obtain and/or maintain patent or
       other protection in respect of any Works in any part of the world and to
       vest such rights (including, without limitation, all IPRs) in and to the
       Works in the Company or the Company's nominee.

12.6   For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Clause 12 shall apply
       to any rights (including, without limitation, any IPRs) in the Works
       arising in any jurisdiction, and the provisions of this Clause 12 shall
       apply in respect of any jurisdiction to the extent permitted by the
       directives, statutes, regulations and other laws of any such
       jurisdiction.

13.    Confidentiality

13.1   The Executive shall not (other than in the proper performance of his
       duties or without the prior written consent of the Board or unless
       ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction) at any time either during
       the continuance of his employment hereunder or after its termination
       disclose or communicate to any person or use for his own benefit or the
       benefit of any person other than the Company or any Associated Company
       any confidential information which may come to his knowledge in the
       course of his employment hereunder concerning the business or finances of
       any member of the Group or of any of its suppliers, agents, distributors
       or customers and the Executive shall during the continuance of his
       employment hereunder use his best endeavours (and following any
       termination thereof his reasonable endeavours) to prevent the
       unauthorised publication or misuse of any confidential information
       provided that such restrictions shall cease to apply to any confidential
       information which may enter the public domain other than through the
       default of the Executive but in any event the restrictions in this Clause
       13.1 shall remain in full force and effect for so long as the Executive
       is in a position to utilise such information more readily than persons
       who have not been employed by the Company or its Associated Companies.

13.2   All notes and memoranda of any trade secret or confidential information
       concerning the business of the Company or the Associated Companies or any
       of its or their suppliers, agents, distributors, customers or others
       which shall have been acquired, received or made by the Executive during
       the course of his employment shall be the property of the Company and
       shall be surrendered by the Executive to someone duly

<PAGE>
                                       10


       authorised in that behalf at the termination of his employment or at the
       request of the Board at any time during the course of his employment.

13.3   Without prejudice to the generality of Clause 13.1 the following is, for
       the avoidance of doubt, a non-exhaustive list of matters which in
       relation to the Company and the Associated Companies are considered
       confidential and must be treated as such by the Executive (for the
       purposes of this Agreement):

       (a)    any trade secrets of the Company or any Associated Company;

       (b)    any information in respect of which the Company or any Associated

              manual or other manufacturing or trade secrets of the Group and/or

13.4   The Executive shall comply with any reasonable policy produced by the
       Company concerning the Executive's ability to either directly or

       television transmission or communicate with any representative of the
       media or any third party relating to the business or affairs of the
       Company or any Associated Company or to any of its or their officers,
       employees, customers/clients, suppliers, distributors, agents or
       shareholders or to the development or exploitation of Works or IPRs (as
       defined in Clauses 12.1 and 12.2). For the purpose of this Clause "media"

              include but without limitation notes, memoranda, correspondence,
              drawings, sketches, plans, designs and any other material upon
              which data or information is recorded or stored) relating to the
              business or affairs of the Company or any Associated Company or
              any of their clients/customers, shareholders, employees, officers,

              the event of his failure to do so the Company is hereby
              irrevocably authorised to appoint some person in his name and on
              his behalf to sign and deliver such resignations to the Board
              and/or to each such Associated Company;

       (c)    shall not at any time thereafter make any untrue or misleading

<PAGE>
                                       12


              communicating with prospective employers or complying with any
              applicable statutory requirements);

       (d)    shall not at any time thereafter use the name "Shire" or any name

              any such debts or loans.

14.4   If the employment of the Executive under this Agreement is terminated by
       reason of the liquidation of the Company for the purpose of
       reconstruction or amalgamation or as part of any arrangement for the
       amalgamation or reconstruction of the Company not involving insolvency
       and the Executive is offered employment with any concern or undertaking
       resulting from the reconstruction or amalgamation on terms and conditions
       which taken as a whole are not less favourable than the terms of this
       Agreement then the Executive shall have no claim against the Company in
       respect of such termination.

15.    Executive's Covenants

15.1   The Executive acknowledges that during the course of his employment with
       the Company he will receive and have access to confidential information
       of the Company and its Associated Companies (including without limitation
       those matters specified in Clause 13.3 of this Agreement) and he will
       also receive and have access to detailed client/customer lists and
       information relating to the operations and business requirements of those
       clients/customers and accordingly he is willing to enter into the
       covenants described in this Clause 15 in order to provide the Company and
       its Associated Companies with what he considers to be reasonable
       protection for those interests.

15.2   In this Clause 15:

       (a)    "Restricted Business" means the Business of the Company and its
              Associated Companies at the time of the termination of the
              Executive's employment with which the Executive was involved to a
              material extent at any time during the period of 12 (twelve)
              months ending on the Restriction Date and for the purposes of this
              Clause the term "Business" shall mean the research, development,
              marketing, sale or supply of pharmaceuticals for administration to
              humans;

       (b)    "Restricted Customer" means any firm, company or other person who,
              at any time during the period of 12 (twelve) months ending on the
              Restriction Date, was a customer of or in the habit of dealing
              with the Company or any Associated Company and with whom the
              Executive dealt to a material extent or for whom or which the
              Executive was responsible on behalf of the

<PAGE>
                                       13


              Company or any Associated Company during that period and in
              respect of such customer material damage to the interests of the
              Company or any Associated Company could occur if such customer
              ceased or reduced its business with the Company or any Associated
              Company;

       (c)    "Restricted Employee" means any person who, at the Restriction
              Date was employed by the Company or any Associated Company at a
              senior level and who could materially damage the interests of the
              Company or any Associated Company if he became employed in any
              business concern in competition with the Restricted Business and
              with whom the Executive worked closely or about whom the Executive
              obtained material detailed information, in either case at any time
              during the period of 12 (twelve) months ending on the Restriction
              Date; and

       (d)    "Restriction Date" means the date of termination of this
              Agreement.

15.3   The Executive will not, for a period of 12 (twelve) months after the
       Restriction Date, solicit or endeavour to entice away from the Company or
       any Associated Company the business or custom of a Restricted Customer
       with a view to providing or receiving goods or services to or from that
       Restricted Customer in competition with any Restricted Business.

15.4   The Executive will not, for a period of 12 (twelve) months after the
       Restriction Date, provide goods or services to or otherwise have any
       business dealings with any Restricted Customer in the course of any
       business concern which is in competition with any Restricted Business.

15.5   The Executive will not, for a period of 12 (twelve) months after the
       Restriction Date, in the course of any business concern which is in
       competition with any Restricted Business offer employment to or otherwise
       endeavour to entice away from the Company or any Associated Company any
       Restricted Employee.

15.6   The Executive will not, without the prior written consent of the Board,
       for a period of 6 (six) months after the Restriction Date, be engaged in
       or concerned in any capacity in any business concern which is or might
       reasonably be expected to be in competition with any Restricted Business.
       This Clause shall not restrain the Executive from being engaged or
       concerned in any business concern in so far as the Executive's duties or
       work shall relate solely:

       (a)    to geographical areas where the business concern is not in
              competition with the Restricted Business; or

       (b)    to services or activities of a kind with which the Executive was
              not concerned to a material extent during the period of 12
              (twelve) months ending on the Restriction Date.

<PAGE>
                                       14


15.7   The obligations imposed on the Executive by this Clause 15 extend to him
       acting not only on his own account but also on behalf of any other firm,
       company or other person and shall apply whether he acts directly or
       indirectly.

15.8   The Executive hereby agrees that he will at the request and expense of
       the Company enter into a direct agreement or undertaking with any
       Associated Company whereby he will accept restrictions and provisions
       corresponding to the restrictions and provisions in this Clause 15 (or
       such of them as may be appropriate in the circumstances) in relation to
       such activities and such area and for such a period not exceeding 12
       (twelve) months as such Associated Company may reasonably require for the
       protection of its legitimate business interests.

15.9   It is agreed between the parties that whilst the restrictions set out in
       this Clause 15 are considered fair and reasonable for the protection of
       the Company's business and trade secrets, if it should be found that any
       of the restrictions be void as going beyond what is fair and reasonable
       in all the circumstances and if by deleting part of the wording or
       substituting a shorter period of time or different geographical limit or
       a more restricted range of activities for any of the period of time,
       geographical limits or ranges or activities set out in this Clause 15 it
       would not be void then there shall be substituted such next less
       extensive period and/or limit and/or activity or such deletions shall be
       made as shall render this Clause 15 valid and enforceable.

16.    Change of Control

16.1   For the purposes of this Clause 16:

       (a)    "Relevant Event" means either:

              (i)    the termination by the Company of the Executive's
                     employment (other than for cause in accordance with Clause
                     14 of this Agreement); or

              (ii)   the Executive's resignation where such resignation is as a
                     consequence of a repudiatory breach of contract by the
                     Company and amounts to a constructive dismissal,

              within the period of 12 (twelve) months following the date of a
              Change of Control.

       (b)    Subject to Clause 16.6 below "Change of Control" means where any
              person either alone or together with any person acting in concert
              with him obtains control of the Company as defined in section 840
              of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.

16.2   If a Relevant Event occurs the Company shall pay to the Executive within
       14 (fourteen) days of that Relevant Event a sum equal to the aggregate
       of:

       (a)    the value of his then current rate of basic salary for the period
              of 2 (two) years; and

<PAGE>
                                       15



       (b)    an additional amount equal to 2 (two) times the annual bonus to
              which the Executive would have been entitled pursuant to Clause 4
              based on an assumed 100% on target achievement of group and
              personal objectives in the year of the termination of his
              employment.

16.3   Subject to any rights accrued at the date of termination of the
       Executive's employment under the provisions of any pension scheme of the
       Company, any payment by the Company pursuant to this Clause 16 shall be
       made in full and final settlement of all and any claims arising from or
       in connection with the Executive's employment or its termination or his
       office as Group Finance Director and its loss in each case in respect of
       the Company or any Associated Companies.

16.4   All payments to be made pursuant to this Clause 16 shall be paid less any
       necessary withholdings.

16.5   The Executive hereby agrees that he shall not, following a payment under
       this Clause 16, bring any claim before any court or employment tribunal
       relating to unfair dismissal.

16.6   This Clause shall not apply where in connection with a scheme of
       reconstruction or amalgamation or reorganisation of the Company and one
       or more of its Associated Companies the Executive refuses an offer of
       employment on terms identical in all material respects to those hereunder
       by the company which following such reconstruction or reorganisation
       replaces the Company or the relevant Associated Companies.

17.    Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures

17.1   The Executive shall be expected to maintain the highest standard of
       integrity and behaviour. For the purpose of disciplinary and grievance
       procedures the Executive's supervisor is the Company's Chief Executive.

17.2   If the Executive is not satisfied with any disciplinary decision taken in
       relation to him he may apply in writing within 14 (fourteen) days of that
       decision to the Board whose decision shall be final.

17.3   If the Executive has any grievance in relation to his employment he may
       raise it in writing with the Board whose decision shall be final.

17.4   If the Executive is not satisfied with any decision taken by the Chief

Board:

       (a)    voluntarily resign as a director of the Company:

       (b)    do or fail to do anything which causes him to be prohibited by law
              from continuing to act as a director; or

       (c)    voluntarily do or refrain from doing any act whereby his office as
              a director of the Company is or becomes liable to be vacated.

       The removal of the Executive from office as a director of the Company or
       the failure of the Company in general meeting to re-elect the Executive
       as a director of the Company (if he shall be obliged to retire by
       rotation or otherwise pursuant to the Articles of Association) shall
       terminate the Executive's employment under this Agreement and such
       termination shall be without prejudice to any claim which the Executive
       may have for damages for breach of this Agreement provided that the
       Company was not entitled at the time of such removal or failure to
       re-elect to terminate his employment pursuant to Clause 14.1.

19.    Data Protection

       The Executive consents to the Company or any Associated Company holding
       and processing both electronically and manually the data it collects
       which relates to the Executive for the purposes of the administration and
       management of its employees and its business and for compliance with
       applicable procedures, laws and regulations. The Executive also consents
       to the transfer of such personal information to other offices the Company
       may have or to an Associated Company or to other third parties whether or
       not outside the European Economic Area for administration purposes and
       other purposes in connection with the Executive's employment where it is
       necessary or desirable for the Company to do so.

20.    Notices

       Company's registered office for the time being or the Executive's address
       as set out in this Agreement (or such other address as shall be notified
       to the Company in accordance with this Clause) as the case may be.

20.2   Any notice sent by post shall be deemed (in the absence of evidence of
       earlier receipt) to be received 2 (two) days after posting (6 (six) if
       sent by air mail) and in proving the time such notice was sent and shall
       be sufficient to show that the envelope containing it was properly
