                          MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT

            THIS MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made
effective the 1st day of January, 2003, by and between ORBIT/FR, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, ("Orbit") and Zeev Stein Properties, LTD (the "Management
Company"), an Israeli corporation wholly owned by Zeev Stein ("Stein").

                                   BACKGROUND

            Stein has provided management services (the "Management Services")
to Orbit since December 31, 1998 in the capacity as Chairman. Effective
September 5, 2001, Stein and Orbit entered into an employment agreement (the
"Employment Agreement") providing for the continuing services of Stein, in the
capacity as employee, under the terms of the Employment Agreement. The parties
desire to discontinue the direct employment relationship, and instead provide
for the delivery of the Management Services by Stein as an employee of the
Management Company.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained
herein and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

      1. Engagement. Orbit hereby engages the Management Company to provide the
Management Services. The parties acknowledge that the scope of the Management
Services to be provided hereunder shall be consistent with the Management
Services provided by Stein under the Employment Agreement.

      2. Performance by Stein. The Management Company shall not perform the
Management Services by any person other than Stein without the prior approval of
Orbit.

      3. Management Fees. In consideration for its delivery of the Management
Services, pursuant to this Agreement, Orbit shall pay the Management Company a
fee (the "Management Fees") at an annual rate of $133,000, plus applicable VAT.
The Management Fees shall be paid by Orbit during the term hereof in equal
monthly installments, against invoices, in the amount of $11,083.33 plus VAT
each.

      4. Expense Reimbursement. Orbit shall further arrange for, or reimburse
the Management Company for, all normal items of travel (business class) and
entertainment and miscellaneous expenses reasonably incurred by Stein or the
Management Company on behalf of Orbit in the course of performing the Management
Services, provided that such expenses are documented and submitted to Orbit.

      5. Confidentiality. The Management Company recognizes and acknowledges
that it will obtain Proprietary Information (as hereinafter defined) of Orbit
and its affiliates in the course of the delivery of the Management Services. The
Management Company further recognizes and acknowledges that the Proprietary
Information is a valuable, special and unique

<PAGE>

asset of Orbit. As a result, the Management Company shall not, and shall cause
Stein not to, without the prior written consent of Orbit, for any reason either
directly or indirectly divulge to any third-party or use for its or his own
benefit, or for any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of Orbit, any
confidential, proprietary, business and technical information or trade secrets
(the "Proprietary Information") of Orbit revealed, obtained or developed in the
course of the delivery of the Management Services. Nothing contained herein
shall restrict the Management Company's or Stein's ability to make such
disclosures during the course of the delivery of the Management Services as may
be necessary or appropriate to the effective and efficient discharge of the
duties required by or appropriate for the Management Services or as such
disclosures may be required by law. Furthermore, nothing contained herein shall
restrict the Management Company or Stein from divulging or using for his or its
own benefit or for any other purpose any Proprietary Information that is readily
available to the general public so long as such information did not become
available to the general public as a direct or indirect result of the Management
Company's or Stein's breach of this Section 5.

      6. Non-Compete. To further induce Orbit to enter into this Agreement, the
Management Company covenants that it shall not, and it shall cause Stein not to,
during the term hereof and for a period of six (6) months after termination
hereof for any reason whatsoever (the "Restricted Period"), do any of the
following directly or indirectly without the prior written consent of Orbit's
board of directors:

            6.1. engage in any business activity competitive with the business
of Orbit (the "Business") as conducted during the term hereof; or

            6.2. become interested (as owner, stockholder, lender, partner,
co-venturer, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or otherwise) in any
person, firm, corporation, association or other entity engaged in any business
that is competitive with the Business as conducted during the term hereof
(notwithstanding the foregoing, the Management Company and Stein may each hold
not more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding securities of any class of
any publicly-traded securities of a company that is engaged in activities
competitive with the Business as conducted during the term hereof). Provided,
that nothing set forth herein shall be deemed to restrict the right of the
Management Company or Stein to own any interest whatsoever in Orbit or any of
its affiliates.

      7. Termination.

            7.1 Orbit may terminate this Agreement upon twelve (12) months prior

termination shall be referred to herein as the "Termination Period"). During the
Termination Period, the Management Company shall cause Stein to assist Orbit in
good faith in the orderly transition of its duties hereunder to such person
designated by Orbit's board of directors.

            7.2. Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in Section 7.1 above,
either party may terminate this Agreement without notice in the event of a
breach of this Agreement by the other party and the breaching party continues
such breach for a period of, or fails to cure the

results of such breach within, 30 days after written notice from the
non-breaching party to the breaching party.

            7.3. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.1 above, Orbit may,
at its discretion, discontinue the delivery of Management Services hereunder
during the Termination Period (or any part thereof), and pay the Management
Company, in a lump sum, within thirty (30) days thereafter, any remaining
Management Fees through the end of the Termination Period.

            7.4. In further consideration for the Management Company's covenants
not to compete and confidentiality set forth in Sections 5 and 6 hereof, the
Management Company shall be entitled to continue receiving the Management Fees
applicable during the Termination Period, for an additional period of six (6)
months following the Termination Period; provided, that upon written request by
the Management Company, Orbit shall pay the Management Company in a lump sum,
within thirty (30) days of such request, any remaining Management Fees due the
Management Company under this Section 7.4.

      8. No Employment Relationship. The parties hereto acknowledge that the
legal relation between Orbit, on the one hand, and the Management Company and
Stein on the other hand, is limited in the manner expressly provided herein.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that neither shall be deemed to be an employee, partner or
a joint venturer of the other.

operate for the benefit of the parties and their estates, successors and legal
representatives.

      11. Counterpart. This Agreement may be executed in any number of

all counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

      12. Governing Law. This Agreement and all rights and duties of the parties
hereunder shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware (without regard to any conflict of laws rules of the State
of Delaware).

      13. Termination of Employment Agreement. Upon the effective time of this
Agreement, the Employment Agreement shall be deemed terminated and neither party
thereto shall have any further rights thereunder, except that Orbit shall remain

due Stein thereunder on account of his employment through the effective time of
this Agreement.
