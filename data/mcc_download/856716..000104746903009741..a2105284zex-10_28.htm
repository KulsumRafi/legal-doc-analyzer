of 1986 (a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Foreign Lender</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") shall deliver to the Agent, prior to receipt of any payment subject to withholding under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(or after accepting an assignment of an interest herein), two duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form&nbsp;W-8BEN or any successor thereto (relating to such Person and entitling
it to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to be made to such Person by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS Form&nbsp;W-8ECI or any successor
thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such Person by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent that such Person is entitled
to an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding tax. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Person shall (a)&nbsp;promptly submit to the Agent such additional duly completed and signed
copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then current United States
laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent of any available exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding taxes in respect of all
payments to be made to such Person by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, (b)&nbsp;promptly notify the Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed
exemption or reduction, and (c)&nbsp;take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the
re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that the Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Person. If such
Person fails to deliver the above forms or other documentation, then the Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Person an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax imposed by
Sections&nbsp;1441 and 1442 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, without reduction. If any governmental authority asserts that the Agent did not properly withhold any tax or other amount from
payments made in respect of such Person, such Person shall indemnify the Agent therefor, including all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Agent
under this Section, and costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) of the Agent. The obligation of the Lenders under this Section&nbsp;shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the
resignation or replacement of the Agent." </FONT></P>
