         guarantees to the Trustee, as agent, nominee and bailee for the Series
         C2002-1 Debtholders: (i) the full and prompt payment and performance of

                                        2

         the Sale and Servicing Agreement to purchase or repurchase Receivables
         pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement. The

   (b)   The Guarantor shall have no obligation to (i) guarantee any obligations
         of the Obligors under the Receivables, (ii) to guarantee the
         performance of any obligations other than the Obligations, or (iii) to

         is an Affiliate of the Guarantor.

3.1      UNCONDITIONALITY; IRREVOCABILITY

   (a)   This is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guarantee of payment
         and performance of all Obligations, and the Guarantor agrees that its
         obligations under this Guarantee shall be irrevocable. The dissolution,
         insolvency or adjudication of bankruptcy of the Guarantor shall not
         revoke this Guarantee.

   (b)   Upon and after any failure by AmeriCredit Canada (or any applicable
         Affiliate of the Guarantor) to pay or perform any of the Obligations,
         the Trustee will be entitled to make demand upon the Guarantor for the
         payment or performance of any such Obligations which have not been paid
         or performed, and after any such demand is made upon the Guarantor, the
         Guarantor will promptly pay or perform, as applicable, any such
         Obligations which have not been paid or performed.

   (c)   No act or thing need occur to establish the liability or obligation of
         the Guarantor hereunder, and no act or thing, except full payment,
         discharge and performance of all Obligations, shall in any way
         exonerate the Guarantor hereunder or modify, reduce, limit or release
         the liability of Guarantor hereunder. The Guarantor waives all
         presentments, demands for performance, notices of dishonor and notices
         of acceptance of this Guarantee. The Trustee shall not be required
         first to resort to performance or payment of the Obligations by
         AmeriCredit Canada, the Servicer or other Person, or their properties,
         before enforcing this Guarantee. Until payment in full of the
         Obligations, the Obligations of the Guarantor under this Guarantee
         shall not be affected, modified or impaired upon the happening from
         time to time of any event, including, without limitation, the events
         described in Section 4.1 herein, whether or not with notice to or the
         consent of the Guarantor.

   (d)   The Guarantor further agrees that, if any payment applied hereunder to
         the Obligations is thereafter set aside, recovered, rescinded or
         required to be returned for any reason (including, without limitation,
         the bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or liquidation of
         AmeriCredit Canada or the Servicer) or declared to be fraudulent or
         preferential, the Obligations to which such payment was applied shall
         for the purpose of this Guarantee be deemed to have continued in
         existence, notwithstanding such payment, and this Guarantee shall be
         enforceable as to such Obligations as fully as if such payment had

<PAGE>

                                       3

         never been made. The provisions of this Section 3.1(d) hereof shall
         survive any termination of this Guarantee.

4.1      CONTINUATION AND VALIDITY OF OBLIGATIONS

The liability of the Guarantor shall not be affected or impaired by any of the
following events: (a) the validity, enforceability, discharge, disaffirmance,
settlement or compromise (by any Person, including any trustee in bankruptcy or
other similar official) of the Obligations or of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, (b) the absence of any attempt to collect the Obligations from
AmeriCredit Canada or the Servicer or any guarantor or other Person, (c) the

settlement with, or agreement not to sue, AmeriCredit Canada or the Servicer or

judicata, statute of frauds, anti-deficiency statute, fraud, usury, illegality

related transaction and (h) any duty of the Trustee to advise the Guarantor of
any information known to the Trustee regarding the financial condition of
AmeriCredit Canada or the Servicer or any other circumstance, it being agreed
that the Guarantor assumes responsibility for being and keeping informed of such
condition or any such circumstance. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Guarantor
specifically waives all defenses the Guarantor may have based upon any election
of remedies by the Trustee which destroys the Guarantor's rights to proceed
against AmeriCredit Canada, the Servicer or any other obligor, guarantor or
Person for reimbursement, contribution or otherwise, including any loss of
rights that it may suffer by reason of any rights, powers, remedies or defenses
of AmeriCredit Canada or the Servicer in connection with any laws limiting,

8.1      SIGNIFICANCE OF WAIVERS

The Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth
herein are made with the Guarantor's full knowledge of its significance and
consequences, with the understanding that events giving rise to any defense
waived may diminish, destroy or otherwise adversely affect rights which the
Guarantor otherwise may have against AmeriCredit Canada, the Servicer or any
other obligor, guarantor or Person, or against collateral, and that under the
circumstances the waivers are reasonable.

9.1      PAYMENT

         Obligations owing or payable at that time upon demand for payment
         therefore by the Trustee to the Guarantor.

               taxes, duties, charges to tax, fees, deductions, withholdings and
               any conditions or restrictions resulting in charges to tax and
