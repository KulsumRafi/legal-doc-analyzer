Overdraft Facility.

2.   Amount & Availability

2.1  Subject to the terms hereof the Facilities  shall remain  available  until,
     and may be drawn on any Business Day prior to, the  Commitment  Termination
     Date provided that no drawing may be effected on any  particular day if the
     amount thereof would otherwise cause the Total  Outstandings on that day to
     exceed the Facility Limit.

     If at any time the Bank shall determine that the Total Outstandings  exceed
     the Facility Limit by more than 10% then the Bank shall notify the Borrower
     in writing  that the  Facility  Limit has been  exceeded and by what amount
     (the  "Exceeding  Amount")  and the  Borrower  shall  repay to the Bank the
     Exceeding  Amount within 5 Business  Days in one or more of the  currencies
     (as the Bank and Borrower shall agree) in which drawings are outstanding at
     such time an amount equivalent to the Exceeding Amount.

2.2  The proceeds of each drawing  under the LIBOR  Facility in sterling will be
     credited to the Current Account unless prior to the date of payment of such

     received written notice from the Borrower to the contrary.  The proceeds of
     each  drawing  under the LIBOR  Facility in an Optional  Currency  shall be

     Termination  Date shall be repaid by the  Borrower in the currency in which
     they are  outstanding  on or before the Expiry  Date.  No  Interest  Period
     selected shall continue after the Expiry Date. Any amount of the Facilities
     undrawn on the Commitment Termination Date shall be cancelled forthwith.

2.4    The Facilities shall be in substitution for the Old Facilities. With
       effect from the date that the preconditions set out in Clause 7.1 hereof
       are completed to the Bank's satisfaction no further utilisation may be
       made of the Old Facilities and all amounts then outstanding under the Old
       Facilities shall be deemed to be outstanding hereunder, following which
       the Old Facilities shall be cancelled and the Borrower shall be released
       from obligations thereunder.

     Termination  Date  for a period  of one  year.  The Bank  shall be under no
     obligation  to agree to any such  request,  but if it agrees in  writing to
     such request the Commitment Termination Date shall be extended for a period
     of one  year.  The  Borrower  may  make  such  applications  prior  to each
     anniversary of date of this letter except that the  Commitment  Termination
     Date shall not be extended beyond the Expiry Date.

3.   Terms of Operation

(A)   Prior to the Commitment Termination Date:
      -----------------------------------------

3.1  The LIBOR Facility

     The Borrower may make drawings from time to time  hereunder in sterling and
     Optional  Currencies,  subject to  receipt  by the Bank of notice  from the
     Borrower  by 10 a.m.  on the  Notification  Date  therefor  specifying  the
     amount,  currency and the term of the Interest Period required.  The amount
     or Equivalent Amount of each drawing shall be at least (pound)250,000 and a
     multiple of 50,000 units of the currency of the drawing. Each drawing shall
     be in one currency  only and,  prior to the  Commitment  Termination  Date,
     shall be repaid in the currency in which it is  outstanding on the last day
     of its Interest Period.

     Each drawing shall bear  interest at the aggregate of 1.25% per annum,  the
     Offered Rate and the Associated Costs Rate. The Borrower shall pay interest
     on each  drawing in arrears in the  currency of the drawing on the last day
     of its Interest  Period and where such period exceeds 3 months at 3 monthly
     intervals from the first day thereof.

3.2  The Overdraft Facility

     The Borrower may overdraw the Current Account and/or any Optional  Currency
     account  it  maintains  with the Bank from time to time on any day prior to
     the Commitment  Termination Date. Any amount  outstanding on the Commitment
     Termination  Date will be repaid or refinanced  under the LIBOR Facility on
     that date. Any drawing may be repaid in whole or in part by the Borrower on
     any  Business  Day prior to the  Commitment  Termination  Date  subject  to
     receipt  by the Bank of notice of such  repayment  prior to 10 a.m.  on the
     date of repayment.

     Interest  will be charged in the case of  sterling,  on the  cleared  daily
     balance at 1.25% per annum over the Bank's  Base Rate from time to time and
     in the case of each Optional Currency, on the cleared daily balance thereof
     at 1% per annum over the Bank's  short term offered rate from time to time.
     Interest will be paid by the Borrower on such quarterly  dates in each year
     as the Bank may from time to time require and additionally on the date upon
     which the Overdraft Facility ceases to be available.

(B)   After the Commitment Termination Date:
      --------------------------------------

3.3  After the  Commitment  Termination  Date only the LIBOR  Facility  shall be
     available.  At any time after the Commitment  Termination Date the Borrower
     may by notice (an  "Election  Notice")  to be received by the Bank no later
     than 10.00 a.m.  on the  Notification  Date  pertaining  to any Review Date
     elect that the  relevant  drawing or any part  thereof at the expiry of the
     Current Interest Period be renewed in sterling or an Optional Currency (the
     "new currency)  other than that in which it is then  outstanding  (the "old
     currency").  Such drawing  shall be converted  into the new currency at the
     Bank's spot selling  rate for the old currency  against the new currency at
     or about 11 a.m. on the Notification Date applicable to that Review Date.

     If no such Election  Notice is received by the Bank by the  specified  time
     such drawing shall be renewed in accordance with the terms contained herein
     in the currency in which the drawing is then outstanding.

     If at any relevant time because of changes  affecting the London  interbank
     market  adequate and fair means did not exist for making any  determination
     of the interest  rate  applicable  to the Loan or the relevant part thereof

<PAGE>
                                        5

     pursuant  to this  clause  3.3 the  Bank may give  written  notice  of such
     determination to the Borrower (a "Suspension Notice").

     At any time  after  any  Suspension  Notice  has  been  given  and  until a
     substitute basis has been agreed:-

     (i)  the Bank shall be under no obligation to advance funds pursuant to any
          drawdown  notice  (whenever  given) and any such notice shall cease to
          have effect; and

     (ii) with effect from the end of each then  current  Interest  Period,  the
          rate of interest  applicable to each drawing  outstanding shall be the
          rate  conclusively  determined  by the Bank to be the aggregate of the
          Offered Rate,  1.25% per annum and the  Associated  Costs Rate and the
          cost to the Bank  (expressed as an annual  percentage)  of funding the
          Loan from other  sources  and in such manner as the bank may select If
          the  Borrower  and the Bank  fail to agree  on such  Substitute  Basis
          within  such 30 day period  then the  Borrower  may on giving not less
          than two Business Days' written notice to the Bank prepay each drawing
          without penalty

4.   Cancellation

4.1  The Borrower  may by not less than 5 Business  Days' prior  written  notice
     cancel  any part of the  Facility  Limit  which will be  unutilised  at the
     expiration  of the  said  notice  in an  amount  of  (pound)250,000  or any
     multiple  thereof.  Such notice shall specify the date of cancellation  and
     the amount by which the Facility Limit is to be reduced.

4.2  No part of the Facility Limit which has been cancelled may be re-instated.

5.   Commitment Interest

5.1  The  Borrower  shall  from  the   Acceptance   Date  until  the  Commitment
     Termination  Date (or such other date on which the Facilities are cancelled
     in full) pay to the Bank  commitment  interest  in  sterling at the rate of
     0.25% per annum on the amount by which the Facility Limit exceeds the Total
     Outstandings from day to day.

5.2  Commitment  interest  shall be  calculated  quarterly in arrears and on the
     last  day of  availability  of the  Facilities  (each  such  date  being  a
     "Calculation  Date")  and  shall be paid  within 14 days of the date of the
     Bank's claim therefor.

     For the  purposes of this clause  only the  Equivalent  Amount of a drawing
     outstanding  in an  Optional  Currency  under the LIBOR  Facility  shall be
     determined on each  Notification  Date applicable to the LIBOR Facility and
     on each  Calculation  Date and shall remain constant until the next date on
     which such a determination falls to be made and in respect of the Overdraft
     Facility  the level of  utilisation  as at any  Calculation  Date  shall be
     deemed to be the aggregate  Equivalent  Amount on that  Calculation Date of
     the average daily debit balance of each currency outstanding since the last
     Calculation Date.

6.   Additional Costs & Changes in Circumstances

6.1  If after the Acceptance  Date the  application of or introduction of or any
     change in any applicable law, regulation, requirement, directive or request
     or any change in the  interpretation  thereof by any governmental,  fiscal,
     monetary or other authority charged with the  administration  thereof or by
     any self-regulating organisation or court of competent jurisdiction (in any
     case whether or not having the force of law) shall  subject the Bank or any
     holding  company of the Bank to any tax,  duty or other charge with respect
     hereto or change the basis of taxation  on any amounts  payable to the Bank
     hereunder  (except in respect of tax on the  overall net income of the Bank
     or  any  such  holding  company)  or  impose,  modify  or  deem  applicable
     requirements  in respect of any liquid  asset,  special or other deposit or
     prudential or cash ratio or other requirements  against,  or the allocation
     by the Bank or any  holding  company of the Bank of capital in support  of,
     any assets or liabilities or contingent  liabilities  of,  deposits with or
     for the account of, or advances or  commitments  made by the Bank, and this
     shall  increase the cost (to the Bank or any such  holding  company) of the
     Bank  maintaining the Facilities or shall reduce the amount of principal or
     interest receivable by the Bank or shall otherwise reduce the return to the
     Bank  hereunder  by an amount which the Bank deems  material,  the Borrower

<PAGE>

                                        6

     shall pay to the Bank upon demand such additional  amounts as are necessary
     to compensate for such increased cost or reduction  incurred by the Bank or
     any such holding company of the Bank.

     If the  Borrower  makes any  payment to any party  under this clause 6.1 in
     respect of any tax, duty or charge as above, such party shall reimburse the
     Borrower,  following  receipt  by it of such  proportion  of any  available
     credit against,  or remission for, any tax, duty or charge as that party in
     its sole discretion shall have determined to be attributable to this letter
     and the proportion which will leave the relevant party (after reimbursement
     to the  Borrower),  in no worse position than it would have been in had the
     relevant  withholding or deduction  never been required.  This clause shall
     not impose any obligation on the Bank:

     (a)  to manage its tax or other affairs in any particular manner; or

     (b)  to claim any credit against,  or remission for, tax payable on amounts
          received by it under this letter in priority to any other tax release,
          or reliance for tax borne by it on any such amount; or

     (c)  to disclose any information concerning its tax affairs to the Borrower
          or to any other person.

     Any   reimbursement   to  the  Borrower   should  be  made  promptly  after
     certification  by the  Bank  of any  amounts  due  to  the  Borrower  which
     certification should be made as soon as practicable after any determination
     by the relevant party that such amount is so due and shall be conclusive in
     the absence of manifest error.

6.2  If at any time after the  Acceptance  Date the currency in which any amount
     outstanding  or owing in connection  with the  Facilities is denominated is
     due to be or has been converted into the euro or into any other currency as
     a  result  of a  change  in law or by  agreement  between  the Bank and the
     Borrower then:

     (a)  the Bank may in its sole  discretion  determine and shall give written
          notice (the "Notice") to the Borrower of the currency or currency unit
          in which all or any amounts  payable under or in connection  with this
          letter  shall be paid when due.  After the expiry of 7  Business  Days
          from the date of such Notice all such  payments when due shall be made
          in such currency or currency unit; and

     (b)  the Bank may by giving  not less than 21 days'  written  notice to the
          Borrower  change any of the terms  applying to the Facilities but only
          to the  extent  that the Bank  reasonably  considers  any such  change
          necessary  to take  account of  differences  in market  practice or to
          compensate  for  increases or allow for decreases in costs to the Bank
          or to any holding  company of the Bank arising from or related to such
          conversion or arising from or related to the introduction of or to the
          extension of monetary union within the European Union. Any such change
          shall  amend the terms of this  letter  upon  expiry of such period of
          notice.

6.3  All reasonable  out-of-pocket legal, valuation and other costs and expenses
     including  any stamp  and  other  duties  and  registration  fees on a full
     indemnity  basis and value  added tax  thereon  incurred by the Bank in the
     preparation  of this letter and any  guarantee or security  given  pursuant
     hereto  and  in  connection  with  the  enforcement,   administration   and
     preservation  of its rights  under the  Facilities  shall be payable by the
     Borrower on receipt of a written demand.

7.   Conditions Precedent & Security

          adverse effect on the Borrower and its Subsidiary  Undertakings  taken
          as a whole;

     (c)  there has been no material  adverse change in the financial  condition

          or commercial effect similar to that of secured indebtedness;

     (d)  part with, sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole, or

          single transaction or a number of transactions whether related or not)
          other than for market  value on an arm's  length  basis  (save that no
          such parting with, sale, transfer, lease or other disposal may be made

     (b)  the Borrower shall at all times maintain the Consolidated Net Worth at
          not less than(pound)50,000,000.

          This  covenant  will be tested  against each  Financial  Statement and
          against  each of the  Borrower's  half-yearly  unaudited  consolidated

          agreed between the Borrower and the Bank, from time to time) copies of
          its  Financial  Statement  and the accounts of such of its  Subsidiary
          Undertakings as the Bank may from time to time reasonably  require for
          that financial year;

     (b)  as soon as practicable (and in any event within 150 days of the end of
          each of its  financial  half-years,  or such  longer  period as may be
          agreed  between  the  Borrower  and the Bank  from  time to time)  the
          unaudited  consolidated  accounts of the Borrower  for that  half-year
          certified by a director of the Borrower;

     (c)  as soon as practicable  (and in any event within 45 days of the end of

          outstanding  order book for the Borrower and Timet UK Export  Limited,
          such accounts to be in form,  substance and content  acceptable to the

     notice of the occurrence of any Event of Default.

10.  Events of Default

10.1 In the event that:

     (a)  the Borrower fails to pay any sum due hereunder on its due date or, if

          the control of the Borrower within 3 Business Days of the due date;

     (b)  the Borrower  defaults in the due  performance  or  observance  of any
          obligation  accepted  or  undertaking  given  by it to the Bank or any
          representation  warranty  or  statement  made  or  deemed  made by the
          Borrower  herein  or  pursuant  hereto  or in  any  of  the  documents
          constituting  the Security proves to be incorrect or misleading in any
          material  respect at the time made unless any of the foregoing are not
          rectified within 5 Business Days after written notice from the Bank to
          the Borrower;

     (c)  any other indebtedness of the Borrower becomes due or capable of being
          declared due after the expiry of any grace periods prior to the stated
          due date for payment  thereof or the Borrower  defaults in the payment
          when due of any indebtedness or defaults in paying on the due date any
          sum  payable  by  it  under  any   guarantee,   indemnity  or  similar
          undertaking given by it or steps are taken to enforce any security for
          any liability of the Borrower  present or future provided  however the
          amount of any of the foregoing exceeds (pound)250,000 in aggregate;

     (d)  an encumbrancer  takes possession or a receiver or similar official is
          appointed  of any of the assets or  undertaking  of the  Borrower or a
          petition is presented for the making of an administration order or any
          judgment made against the Borrower in excess of  (pound)250,000 is not
          paid out, stayed or discharged within 30 days;

     (e)  proceedings  are  commenced  or a  petition  is  presented  other than
          proceedings  or  petitions  which are  frivolous  or  vexatious or are
          dismissed  within  30  days  or an  order  is  made  or  an  effective
          resolution is passed for the winding up of the Borrower except for the
          purpose of a reconstruction or an amalgamation whilst solvent on terms
          previously  approved  by  the  Bank  or  the  Borrower  is or  becomes
          insolvent or stops or threatens to stop payment of its debts generally
          or is deemed  unable to pay its debts  (whether  within the meaning of
          Section 123 of the  Insolvency Act 1986 or otherwise) or the directors
          of the  Borrower  become  obliged  to  convene a meeting  pursuant  to
          Section 142 of the  Companies  Act 1985 or an  application  is made in
          connection with a proposal to creditors for a voluntary arrangement or
          the Borrower  makes or seeks to make any  arrangement  or  composition
          with its creditors (whether under Part I of the Insolvency Act 1986 or
          otherwise);

     (f)  any material  guarantee,  or other security relied upon by the Bank in
          connection  with the Facilities  ceases in any material  respect to be
          continuing  or ceases to remain in full  force and effect or notice of
          continuance  is received by the Bank or in the Bank's  opinion  acting
          reasonably  becomes  in any  material  respect in  jeopardy  or if any
          material  provision  thereof  is not  complied  with  for  any  reason
          whatsoever  within 5 Business Days after written  notice from the Bank
          to the Borrower;

     (g)  the Borrower  ceases or threatens to cease to carry on its business in
          the normal  course or fails to maintain  or  materially  breaches  any
          franchise,  licence or right  necessary  to conduct  its  business  or
          materially   breaches  any  legislation   relating  to  its  business,
          including without limitation any applicable  environmental  protection

                                       10

          laws  and the  result  of any of the  foregoing  would  reasonably  be
          expected to have a material  adverse  effect on the  Borrower  and its
          Subsidiary Undertakings, taken as a whole;

     (h)  the  Borrower  ceases to be  directly  or  indirectly  a wholly  owned
          Subsidiary  Undertaking  of the Parent,  or the Parent  ceases to have
          control directly or indirectly of the Borrower  ("control"  having the
          meaning  ascribed to it in Section  840 of the Income and  Corporation
          Taxes Act 1988) or direct  voting  control of the Borrower is acquired
          by any person, or company or group of connected persons (as defined in
          Section 839 of the Income and  Corporation  Taxes Act 1988) other than
          the Parent or any other of the Parent's Subsidiary Undertakings; or

     (i)  any  of  the  above  events  mutatis  mutandis  occur  or  proceedings
          analogous or equivalent  thereto which could reasonably be expected to
          have a material  adverse  effect on the  Borrower  and its  Subsidiary
          Undertakings  taken as a whole arise in  relation  to the Parent,  any
          Subsidiary  Undertaking  of  the  Borrower  or  any  guarantor  of the
          Facilities,

     then  the Bank  shall  have the  right at any time or times  thereafter  by
     written  notice  to the  Borrower  to  declare  its  commitments  hereunder
     cancelled and/or all amounts then outstanding  hereunder payable on demand,
     whereupon such commitments  shall be so cancelled and/or such  outstandings
     shall be so payable,  and/or to declare the Facilities  immediately due and
     payable,  whereupon the Borrower shall pay to the Bank the total  principal
     amount   outstanding   hereunder  in  the  currency(ies)  in  which  it  is
     outstanding  together with accrued  interest  thereon and any other amounts
     payable hereunder.

10.2 The Bank shall have the right at the time of making  such  demand or at any
     time thereafter to convert all amounts then due and payable hereunder in an
     Optional  Currency  into  sterling at the Bank's spot selling rate for such
     Optional Currency against sterling at that time.

10.3 If any amount is not paid when due hereunder  (including under this clause)
     the Borrower shall pay to the Bank on written  demand  interest on such sum
     (whether  before or after  judgment)  at 2.25% per annum  above  either the
     Bank's Base Rate from time to time, or, if the Bank shall so determine, the
     cost to the Bank as certified by the Bank of funding such sum on the London
     interbank market for such period or consecutive  periods as the Bank in its
     sole  discretion may select,  in either  respect,  running from the date of
     such  default  to the  date of  receipt  of such  sum in full by the  Bank.
     Interest,  if unpaid,  shall be added to the sum in default on the last day
     of each such period or at 3 monthly intervals whichever is more frequent.

11.  Indemnities

11.1 The Borrower  shall  indemnify  the Bank,  without  prejudice to any of the
     Bank's other rights hereunder, against any reasonable out-of-pocket loss or
     expense as certified by the Bank acting reasonably  including out of pocket
     legal expenses  reasonably and properly  incurred on a full indemnity basis
     and loss of profit  and loss  arising  from the  funding by the Bank of the
     Facilities  which the Bank may incur or sustain as a consequence of (a) the
     occurrence  of any Event of Default or any  failure by the  Borrower to pay
     any sum demanded by the Bank as a result thereof,  (b) any repayment of any
     drawing under the LIBOR  Facility or part thereof being made otherwise than
     on the last day of an applicable Interest Period, or (c) any amount payable
     to the  Bank  hereunder  in  one  currency  being  converted  into  another
     currency, whether pursuant to any judgement or order or otherwise.

12.  Notices

12.1 All communications from the Borrower in respect of the Facilities:

     (a)  shall be irrevocable  and shall,  unless  otherwise  specified in this
          letter, be sent to the Bank at Loans Administration  Department,  Bank
          House, Wine Street,  Bristol,  BS1 2AN or to such other address as the
          Bank may notify in writing to the Borrower from time to time; and

     (b)  unless required by the terms of this letter to be a written notice (in
          which case the communication must be given by letter), may be given to

          communications  shall be  confirmed by letter  within 3 Business  Days

<PAGE>
                                       11

          but,  whether  or not any  such  confirmation  is  received,  any such
          communication  received  by the  Bank  purporting  to be  given  by an
          authorised  officer of the  Borrower  and  believed  by the Bank to be
          genuine shall have the same  validity as a written  notice duly signed
          by an authorised signatory.

12.2 Any notice or demand to be given by the Bank shall be given in writing  and
     without prejudice to any other effective mode of service shall be deemed to

     the terms of this  letter  and  undertakes  to ensure  that  there  will be
     sufficient   cleared   funds   available  on  that  account  or  sufficient
     availability  under the Facility by 12 noon on any  relevant  date to cover
     all such payments falling due on that date.

13.3 Except as provided in Clause 13.2  hereof,  each sum due from the  Borrower
     hereunder  in a  currency  other  than  sterling  shall  be paid in  freely
     transferable and immediately  available same day funds to such bank account
     in the  relevant  financial  centre  as the Bank  shall  from  time to time
     require by such hour local time as may be necessary  to ensure  payment for
     value the due date.

14.  Assignment

14.1 This  letter  shall be binding  upon and shall  inure to the benefit of the
     Bank and the Borrower and their respective successors and assigns, provided
     that except as  provided  for in Clause  14.2  hereof  neither  party shall
     assign  any of its  rights or  transfer  any of its  obligations  hereunder
     without the prior written consent of the other party.  For the avoidance of
     doubt,  the Bank and the  Borrower  do not intend  that any of the terms of
     this letter  should  otherwise be  enforceable,  by virtue of the Contracts
     (Rights  of Third  Parties)  Act 1999,  by any person who is not a party to
     this letter.

14.2 The  Borrower  agrees that the Bank may at any time or times  transfer  the
     Facilities to any other office of the Bank or assign and/or transfer all or
     any  part  of  its  rights  and/or  obligations   hereunder  or  grant  any
     participation in any such rights and/or  obligations to any other member of
     the  Lloyds TSB group  which  would  have the same  withholding  tax status
     without any further  consent from the Borrower  and/or to any other bank or
     financial institution subject to (ii) below provided that:

     (a)  no transfer of the Bank's  obligations  shall be effective  until such
          time  as the  transferee  shall  have  delivered  to the  Borrower  an
          undertaking to be bound by the terms of this letter as if named as the
          lender hereunder  (following  receipt of which the Borrower shall only
          look to the  transferee  in  respect  of that  portion  of the  Bank's
          obligations assumed by the transferee); and

     (b)  unless to another member of the Lloyds TSB group, which would have the
          same  withholding  tax status no transfer of  obligations  may be made
          without the prior written consent of the Borrower, such consent not to
          be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

14.3 The Bank may disclose to a potential assignee or transferee or to any other
     bank or  financial  institution  with which the Bank is  proposing to enter
     into,  or has  entered  into,  any  agreement  pursuant to this clause such
     information  about the Borrower or its Subsidiary  Undertakings as the Bank
     shall consider  appropriate  provided  however such  potential  assignee or
     transferee  shall  have  executed  a  confidentiality   agreement  in  form
     satisfactory to the Borrower prior to any disclosure.

15.  Miscellaneous

15.1 No failure or delay on the part of the Bank to  exercise  its rights  shall
     operate as a waiver  thereof  nor shall any single  exercise or any partial
     exercise or waiver of any such right exclude any other or further  exercise
     thereof.

<PAGE>
                                       12


15.2 Except as provided for in Clause 13.2 hereof the Bank may at any time after
     the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default without
     notice to the  Borrower  apply any  moneys  standing  to the  credit of the
     Borrower on any  account  and whether  subject to notice or not and whether
     denominated in sterling or in any other currency in or towards satisfaction
     of any liabilities of the Borrower under this letter.

15.3 If the due date for any  payment  or the  last day of any  Interest  Period
     would otherwise fall on a non-Business Day, the effective date shall be the
     next succeeding Business Day.

15.4 All calculations in respect of interest (including commitment interest) due
     to the Bank under the Facilities shall be on the basis of the actual number
     of days  elapsed and a 365 day year or a 360 day year (as in the opinion of
     the Bank is market practice for the calculation of interest in the relevant
     currency).

     mean and to include a reference to any modification or re-enactment thereof
     for the time being in force, (b) the London  interbank  offered rate or the
     Bank's Base Rate shall mean and include any rate  replacing  that rate from
     time to  time,  and  (c) the  Bank of  England  or the  Financial  Services
     Authority shall include any successor to that institution or authority.

     of England and Wales.

     regarding  the Borrower  and its  Subsidiary  Undertakings  received by the
     Bank.
