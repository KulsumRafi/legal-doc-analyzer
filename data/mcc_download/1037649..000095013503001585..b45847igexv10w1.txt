            ARTICLE 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

            The Company hereby represents and warrants to Investor that, except
as set forth on the Disclosure Schedules hereto:


                                       3
<PAGE>
      3.1 ORGANIZATION, GOOD STANDING AND QUALIFICATION. Each of the Company and
its subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has
all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now
conducted and own its properties. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or
leasing of property makes such qualification or licensing necessary unless the
failure to so qualify could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company's subsidiaries, all of which are
wholly owned, are reflected on SCHEDULE 3.1. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE
3.1, the Company does not own or control, directly or indirectly, any equity
interest in any other Person.

      3.2 AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABILITY. Each of the representations and
warranties contained in this Section 3.2 is qualified by the disclosure set
forth on on SCHEDULE 3.2. The Company has full power and authority and has taken
all requisite action on the part of the Company, its officers, directors and
stockholders necessary for (a) the authorization, execution and delivery of the
Agreements, (b) authorization of the performance of all obligations of the
Company hereunder or thereunder, and (c) the authorization, issuance (or
reservation for issuance) and delivery of the Preferred Stock and, upon
conversion pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designation to the extent
there were sufficient shares of Common Stock authorized but not issued or
reserved for issuance, the Conversion Shares. On or before the date of this
Agreement, the Company's board of directors, at a meeting duly called and held,
has (a) determined that the Agreements and the Contemplated Transactions are
fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the stockholders
of the Company, (b) approved the Agreements and Contemplated Transactions, and
(c) acted with due care and satisfied its fiduciary duties to the Company.
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law does not apply to this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions. No other state takeover,
antitakeover, moratorium, fair price, interested stockholder, business
combination or similar statute or rule is applicable to the Contemplated
Transactions. The Agreements constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
The Company has duly and validly authorized and reserved 22,262,404 shares of
Common Stock for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, which number
is insufficient to permit the conversion of all of the Preferred Stock, and the
Conversion Shares so issuable in accordance with the Certificate of Designation
will, upon such conversion and issuance, be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable. The relative rights, preferences and other terms relating to the
Preferred Stock are as set forth in the Certificate of Designation and such
rights and preferences are valid and enforceable under Delaware law.

      3.3 CAPITALIZATION. Set forth on SCHEDULE 3.3 is (a) the amount of the
authorized capital stock of the Company; (b) the number of shares of capital
stock issued and outstanding; (c) the number of shares of capital stock issuable
pursuant to the Company's stock plans; (d) the number of shares of capital stock
issuable and reserved for issuance pursuant to securities exercisable for, or
convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of Preferred Stock, Common
Stock, or other stock; and (e) the name of each holder of options and warrants
for capital stock, the term of such agreement or instrument, the number of
shares for which such options and warrants are exercisable with respect to each
holder, along with the applicable vesting schedule, if any, and the exercise
price. All of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company's capital stock
have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 3.3, there are no
contractual or statutory preemptive rights, rights of first refusal, put or call
rights or obligations or anti-dilution rights with respect to the issuance, sale
or redemption of the Company's capital stock, other than rights set forth herein
or in the Certificate or the Registration Rights Agreement. The Company has no
obligation to purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire any of its capital stock or
any interests therein. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 3.3 or as contemplated by
this Agreement, there are no outstanding warrants, options, convertible
securities or other rights, agreements or arrangements of any character under
which the


                                       4
<PAGE>
Company or any of its subsidiaries is or may be obligated to issue any equity
securities of any kind and except as contemplated by this Agreement, neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries is currently in negotiations for the
issuance of any equity securities of any kind. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE
3.3, the Company has no knowledge of any voting agreements, buy-sell agreements,
option or right of first purchase agreements or other agreements of any kind
among any of the security holders of the Company relating to the securities of
the Company held by them. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 3.3 (which Schedule

      3.9 TAX MATTERS. The Company has timely prepared and filed all tax returns
required to have been filed by the Company with all appropriate governmental
agencies and timely paid all taxes owed by it. The charges, accruals and
reserves on the books of the Company in respect of taxes for all fiscal periods

such as which are not material. All material taxes and other assessments and

      the Company from utilizing its Intellectual Property as presently used. To
      the Company's knowledge, no Intellectual Property of the Company is
      infringed or has been challenged or, to the Company's knowledge,
      threatened in any way. None of the products manufactured and sold, nor any

      precautions to protect the secrecy, confidentiality, and value of its
      Trade Secrets. The Company has good title and an absolute (but not

      knowledge, have not been used, divulged, or appropriated either for the

the environment or human exposure to hazardous or toxic substances
(collectively, "ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS"), does not own or operate any real property
contaminated with any substance that is subject to any Environmental Laws, is
not liable for any off-site disposal or contamination pursuant to any
Environmental Laws, and is not subject to any claim relating to any
Environmental Laws, which violation, contamination, liability or claim would
individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect; and the Company
is not aware of any pending investigation that might lead to such a claim. For
the purposes of this Section, the "Company" includes the Company and its
subsidiaries.

involving or (to the Company's knowledge) threatened by or against the Company
in the past five years, along with the resolution of such matter. There are no
pending actions, suits or proceedings against or affecting the Company, its
subsidiaries or any of its or their properties and to the Company's knowledge,
no such actions, suits or proceedings are threatened or contemplated.

      3.16 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The financial statements and related notes
included in each SEC Filing present fairly and accurately in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company as of the dates
shown and its consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods
shown, and such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis, except

accrued, contingent or otherwise) incurred in the ordinary course of business
and consistent with past practice since the date of such SEC Filing, the Company

on a balance sheet of the Company or in the notes thereto. The Company has not
created any entities or entered into any transactions or created any liabilities
or obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
for the purpose of avoiding disclosure required by GAAP.

      3.17 INSURANCE COVERAGE. The Company maintains in full force and effect
insurance coverage that is customary for comparably situated companies for the
business being conducted and properties owned or leased by the Company, and the
Company reasonably believes such insurance coverage to be adequate against all
liabilities, claims and risks against which it is customary for comparably
situated companies to insure. The Company has previously provided to Investor a
true and complete copy of such policy.

      3.19 REGULATION D. The offer, issuance, sale and delivery of the Shares
and Conversion Shares are or will be exempt from the registration requirements
of the 1933 Act and the qualification or registration provisions of applicable
state securities laws. Neither the Company nor its authorized agents have taken
or will take any action that would cause the loss of such exemption. Neither the
Company nor any Person acting on its behalf has conducted any general
solicitation or general advertising (as those terms are used in Regulation D) in
connection with the offer or sale of any of the Preferred Stock. Neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates, nor any Person acting on its or their behalf
has, directly or indirectly, made any offers or sales of any security or
solicited any offers to buy any security, under circumstances that would
adversely affect reliance by the Company on Section 4(2) for the exemption from
registration for the Contemplated Transactions or would require registration of
the Preferred Stock or the Conversion Shares under the 1933 Act.

      3.20 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS. Except for inventors who have assigned
their patent rights to the Company and which assignments have been filed with
the United States Patent and Trademark Office, to the Company's knowledge, no
officer or director of the Company has any interest in any property, real or
personal, tangible or intangible, including any invention, patent, trademark or
trade name, used in or pertaining to the business of the Company. SCHEDULE 3.20
sets forth a true, complete and correct list of any transaction, arrangement or
relationship involving an amount of $50,000 or more not previously disclosed in
the Company's SEC Filings that any director, officer or other affiliate of the
Company has or has had in the last three years, directly or indirectly relating
to, (i) an economic interest in, or the right to receive an economic benefit
from, any person that has furnished or sold, or furnishes or sells, services or
products that the Company furnishes or sells, or proposes to furnish or sell, or
(ii) an economic interest in, or the right to receive an economic benefit from,
any person that purchases from or sells or furnishes to, the Company, any goods
or services; provided, however, that ownership of no more than 1% of the
outstanding voting stock of a publicly traded corporation shall not be deemed an
"economic interest in, or the right to receive an economic benefit from, any
person" for purposes of this Section.

              ARTICLE 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF INVESTOR

            Investor hereby represents and warrants to the Company that:

      4.1 ORGANIZATION AND EXISTENCE. Investor is a validly existing corporation
and has all requisite corporate power and authority to invest in the Preferred
Stock pursuant to this Agreement and each Affiliate of Investor signing one or
more of the Agreements (each an "Affiliate Party") is a validly existing
corporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
perform the agreement that it is signing.

      4.2 AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery and performance by Investor and
each Affiliate Party of the Agreements have been duly authorized and the
Agreements each constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of Investor
and each Affiliate Party, enforceable against Investor and each Affiliate Party
in accordance with their terms.

      4.3 PURCHASE ENTIRELY FOR OWN ACCOUNT. The Preferred Stock to be received
by Investor hereunder will be acquired for Investor's own account, not as
nominee or agent, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part
thereof, and Investor has no present intention of selling, granting any
participation in, or otherwise distributing the same. The Investor is not a
registered broker dealer or an entity engaged in the business of being a broker
dealer.

      4.4 INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE. Investor acknowledges that it can bear the
economic risk and complete loss of its investment in the Preferred Stock and has
such knowledge and experience in financial


                                       9
<PAGE>
or business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the
investment contemplated hereby.

      4.5 DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION. Investor has had an opportunity to receive
documents related to the Company and to ask questions of and receive answers
from the Company regarding the Company, its business and the terms and
conditions of the offering of the Preferred Stock. Investor acknowledges receipt
of the SEC Filings and any other filings which it requested be made by the
Company with the SEC. Neither such inquiries nor any other due diligence
investigation conducted by Investor shall modify, amend or affect Investor's
right to rely on the Company's representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement.

      4.6 RESTRICTED SECURITIES. Investor understands that the Preferred Stock
and Conversion Shares are characterized as "restricted securities" under the
U.S. federal securities laws inasmuch as they are being acquired from the
Company in a transaction not involving a public offering and that under such
laws and applicable regulations such securities may be resold without
registration under the 1933 Act only in certain limited circumstances.

      4.7 LEGENDS. It is understood that, until any sale of Preferred Stock or
Conversion Shares pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 1933
Act, or such time as such shares become eligible for resale under Rule 144(k),
certificates evidencing the Preferred Stock and Conversion Shares, as the case
may be, will bear one or more restrictive legends, substantially as follows:

      "The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under
      the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and may not
      be transferred (i) without the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the
      corporation that such transfer may lawfully be made without registration
      under the Securities Act or (ii) pursuant to an effective registration
      statement under the Securities Act, in each case in accordance with
      applicable securities laws of any state of the United States."

      "The Corporation is authorized to issue more than one class or series of
      stock. The Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who
      so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative,
      participating, optional, or other special rights of each class of stock or
      series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such
      preferences and/or rights."

      "The shares represented by this Certificate are subject to restrictions on
      transfer as set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of March 5,
      2003 by and between the Corporation and Pyxis Innovations Inc. A copy of
      such Stock Purchase Agreement is available for inspection at the offices
      of the Corporation and will be provided to the holder upon request."

If required by the authorities of any state in connection with the issuance or
sale of the Preferred Stock and Conversion Shares, then the certificate(s)
representing such shares shall bear the legend required by such state authority.
Upon resale pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement or upon Rule 144(k)
becoming available, the Company shall promptly cause certificates evidencing the
Preferred Stock and Conversion Shares, as the case may be, to be replaced with
certificates that do not bear such restrictive legends.

      4.8 REGULATION D. Investor is an accredited investor as defined in Rule
501(a) of Regulation D, as amended, under the 1933 Act. Investor did not learn
of the investment in the Preferred Stock as a result of any public advertising
or general solicitation.


                                       10
<PAGE>
      4.9 BROKERS AND FINDERS. Investor has made no commitment for payment of
any commissions or finders' fees to any third party in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                              ARTICLE 5. COVENANTS

      5.1 INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED SHARES. In preparation for and at the Company's
next annual meeting of stockholders, or upon the request of Inventor, the
Company will take all such corporate actions as may be necessary to increase its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number as shall be
sufficient to fully reserve that number of shares of Common Stock, solely for
the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock to the Conversion
Shares and the amended and restated Notes referred to in Section 2.6, including
engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any
necessary amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation.

      5.2 RESTRICTION ON TRANSFER. In addition to restrictions imposed upon
Investor under the Registration Rights Agreement, for a period of two years
following the date of the Closing, Investor will not sell or otherwise transfer
its Preferred Stock or any Conversion Shares to any Person who is not an
Affiliate of Investor.

      5.3 RIGHT OF INVESTOR TO PARTICIPATE IN FUTURE TRANSACTIONS. Until such
time as Investor and its Affiliates own less than 20% of the outstanding capital
stock of the Company (on an as-converted basis), Investor will have a right to
participate in future capital raising transactions, excluding an Exempt
Issuance, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section. During such
period, the Company shall give ten (10) business days advance written notice to
Investor prior to any non-public offer or sale of any of the Company's equity
securities or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
such securities by providing to Investor a comprehensive term sheet containing
all significant business terms of such a proposed transaction. Investor shall
have the right to purchase up to the percentage of such offered securities as
Investor shall have owned of the Company's outstanding Common Stock immediately
prior to such offering (calculated on an as-converted basis, assuming exercise
or conversion of all outstanding convertible securities and assuming the
issuance of all common stock reserved for issuance upon option authorized for
grant), for the same consideration and on the same terms and conditions as
contemplated for such third-party sale. Investor's rights hereunder must be
exercised in writing within five business days following receipt of the notice
from the Company. If, subsequent to the Company giving notice to Investor but
prior to Investor exercising its right to participate (or the expiration of the
five-day period without response from Investor), the terms and conditions of the
proposed third-party sale are changed in any material respect from that
disclosed in the comprehensive term sheet provided to Investor, the Company
shall be required to provide a new notice to Investor and Investor shall have
the right, which right must be exercised within five business days of such new
notice, to exercise their rights to purchase the securities on such changed
terms and conditions as provided hereunder. If Investor does not exercise its
rights hereunder, or affirmatively decline to engage in the proposed transaction
with the Company, then the Company may proceed with such proposed transaction on
the same terms and conditions as noticed to Investor. For the purposes of this
Section, "EXEMPT ISSUANCES" means (i) sales of shares of Common Stock by the
Company upon conversion or exercise of any convertible securities, options or
warrants outstanding prior to the date hereof; (ii) securities issued to
employees, officers or directors of the Company pursuant to any stock option,
stock purchase or stock bonus plan, agreement or arrangement as existing on date
hereof; (iii) securities issued to the stockholders of an unrelated third-party
in connection with the acquisition of such entity; or (iv) a firm underwriting
public offering with gross proceeds to the Company of greater than $30.0
million.

      5.4 REPORTS. For so long as Investor beneficially owns at least 5% of the
Preferred Stock purchased hereunder or Conversion Shares in an amount equal to
5% of the shares of Common Stock


                                       11
<PAGE>
issued and/or issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock purchased
hereunder, the Company will furnish promptly to Investor the following reports,

      indicated in the notes to the financial statements or (iii) as may be
      permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act.

      SEC.

            5.4.5 OTHER INFORMATION. Such other information relating to the
      Company as from time to time may reasonably be requested by Investor
      provided the Company produces such information in its ordinary course of
      business, and further provided that the Company, solely in its own
      discretion, determines that such information is not confidential in nature
      and disclosure to Investor would not be materially harmful to the Company.

            5.4.6 CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT. The Investor agrees to maintain in
      confidence non-public information provided to Investor or its Affiliates
      pursuant to Section 5.4.1 and 5.4.5 hereof or otherwise so that any
      disclosures by the Company to Investor or its Affiliates comply with Rule
      100(b)(2)(ii) of Regulation FD promulgated by the SEC.

      5.5 PRESS RELEASES. Any press release concerning this Agreement shall be
submitted to Investor for comment at least two business days prior to issuance,

into any agreement or make any commitment that would conflict or interfere in
any material respect with the obligations to Investor under the Agreements.

      5.7 INSURANCE. So long as Investor beneficially owns at least 5% of the
Preferred Stock purchased hereunder or Conversion Shares in an amount equal to
5% of the shares of Common Stock issued and/or issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock purchased hereunder, (i) unless approved by a unanimous vote of
the Board of Directors, the Company shall not materially reduce the insurance
coverages from the coverages it currently maintains under its director and
officer liability insurance, and (ii) the Company shall maintain for a period of
six (6) years following the date hereof director and officer liability insurance
covering (subject to the terms of such policy) claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or prior to the resignation of the directors of the

of the Company to take or authorize any employee or agent to take, any of the
following actions without the prior written consent of Investor: (i) purchase
any asset (tangible or intangible) at a price or for other consideration in

                         ARTICLE 6. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

            During any period in which Investor has the right to elect the
Series A Directors:

      6.1 BOARD OF DIRECTORS. Subject to this Article and as otherwise provided
by law, the fundamental strategic direction of the Company shall be determined
by its Board of Directors as provided in this Article. The Board of Directors
shall consist of five members. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Board of Directors of the Company (or committee thereof) shall not nominate
any individual who is an officer, director, partner or principal stockholder of
any competitor of the Company


                                       13
<PAGE>
or any of its subsidiaries or any competitor of Investor or any of its
subsidiaries (other than the Company).

      6.2 COMMITTEES. Subject to the general oversight and authority of the full
Board of Directors, the Board of Directors shall establish, empower and maintain
committees of the Board of Directors consistent with this Section. Except as
provided by law or for those committees formed to address conflicts of interest,
which shall be constituted at the discretion of the Board of Directors, a
majority of the members of any committee of the Board of Directors shall consist
of the directors nominated and/or elected by Investor (the "SERIES A
DIRECTORS"). In addition to such other committees as the Board of Directors
deems necessary or desirable, including the standing Audit Committee and
Compensation Committee, a Strategic Planning Committee shall be established,
empowered and maintained by the Board of Directors at all times during the term
of this Article. A quorum of the Strategic Planning Committee required for any
action thereby shall require the attendance of the majority of members thereof
but no fewer than two of the Series A Directors, and the Strategic Planning
Committee shall act by majority vote of the Strategic Planning Committee.

      6.3 STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS.

            6.3.1 PRESENTATION OF STRATEGIC PLAN. Management of the Company
      shall prepare and propose to the Board of Directors a three-year Strategic
      Plan, beginning with the period April 2003. The Strategic Plan for the
      Company will be proposed to the Board of Directors within two months of
      the Closing, and a Strategic Plan for each subsequent period will be
      proposed not later than two months before the beginning of the first
      fiscal year covered by such Plan. The goals of each Strategic Plan shall
      be aggressive but reasonable and achievable. In connection with the
      preparation of each Strategic Plan, management of the Company shall confer
      on a reasonable basis with the Series A Directors.

            6.3.2 STRATEGIC REVIEW. From time to time at the request of
      management of the Company or the Series A Directors, and at least once a
      year during the second and third fiscal years of a Strategic Plan and
      prior to the budgeting process for the following year, management of the
      Company will hold a Strategic Review with the Strategic Planning Committee
      and, in light of such review, management or any director, may propose to
      such Committee revisions or updates to the Strategic Plan in light of
      changed circumstances. The Strategic Planning Committee shall consider and
      vote upon any proposed new Strategic Plan or any revisions or updates to
      an existing Strategic Plan. The approval of at least 66% of the directors
      on such Committee will be required to revise the Strategic Plan.

      6.4 OPERATING PLANNING PROCESSES. The management of the Company will, on
an annual basis, prepare and recommend to the Strategic Planning Committee an
operating Plan for each fiscal year that is consistent with the then applicable
Strategic Plan. Management will submit an Operating Plan for each fiscal year
not later than one month before the beginning of such fiscal year. The financial
and operating performance goals in each Operating Plan shall be aggressive but
reasonable and achievable and the budgets shall be reasonably designed to
achieve such goals. The Operating Plan will be subject to the approval of the
Strategic Planning Committee.

      6.5 MEASUREMENT STANDARDS. In connection with its review and approval of
the Operating Plan for each fiscal year, the Strategic Planning Committee also
shall set and approve Measurement Standards for that fiscal year. The
Measurement Standards will be set with a view such that failure to meet such
Measurement Standards taken as a whole (and taking into account, to the extent
the directors judge to be appropriate, any qualitative standards included in
such goals) would represent an unreasonably low rate of accretion in the overall
valuation of the Company compared to the expectations


                                       14
<PAGE>
underlying the then effective Strategic Plan. While the Measurement Standards
will be derived from the financial and operating performance goals in the
applicable Operating Plan and Strategic Plan, if, as anticipated, the goals of
those Plans are aggressive (but reasonable and achievable), the Measurement
Standards would be expected to be lower than those goals. If during a fiscal
year, events for which management should not reasonably be held accountable or
which management would not reasonably be expected to anticipate to occur that
significantly adversely impact the Company's ability to fulfill applicable
Measurement Standards, the Strategic Planning Committee shall in good faith
discuss whether revisions to the Measurement Standards are appropriate. If,
after taking into account the considerations contemplated by the previous
sentence, the Measurement Standards are not met for two or more measurement
periods, then the Strategic Planning Committee shall consider appropriate
remedial actions, including (but not limited to): (i) the suspension of granting
of stock options and other equity rights to some or all officers of the Company;
(ii) a review of the compensation or continued employment of any officer; (iii)
the suspension of initiating any new collaboration or entering into any new
material licenses of technology with any entity; (iv) the suspension of any new
material capital projects; or (v) the suspension of the incurrence or issuance
of any indebtedness by the Company other than in the ordinary course of
business.

      6.6 ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. A majority of the directors shall have
full and complete authority on behalf of the Company to enforce the terms of
this Agreement. The Company and Investor shall take or cause to be taken all
lawful action necessary to ensure at all times that the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws are not at any time inconsistent with the provisions
of this Agreement. At Investor's request, the Board of Directors shall adopt
(and if necessary, submit and recommend for approval by stockholders) amendments
to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws reasonably necessary to
implement the provisions of this Article.

      6.7 ADVISORS. The Series A Directors shall be entitled to retain, at the
cost and expense of the Company, the services of an investment banking firm of
national reputation of their choice and one law firm of their choice to advise
them in their capacity as directors with respect to any matter on which the
directors, as a group, are required or permitted to act hereunder.

      6.8. CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY POLICY. The Board of Directors of the Company
has adopted this Section 6.8 in accordance with Section 122(17) of the Delaware
General Corporate Law in order to regulate and define the conduct of certain
affairs of the Company as they may involve the Majority Stockholder and its
Affiliates (each as defined below), and the powers, rights, duties and
liabilities of the Company and its officers, directors and stockholders in
connection therewith. Nothing in this Section 6.8 will regulate or define the
conduct of the Majority Stockholder or an Affiliate with respect to affairs not
involving a corporate opportunity (as defined below). Moreover, nothing in this
Section 6.8 will prohibit the Company from entering into contractual
arrangements with the Majority Stockholder or an Affiliate that restrict the
Majority Stockholder or the Affiliate from engaging in activities otherwise
allowed by this Section 6.8, and the following provisions shall be subject to
any such contractual obligation of the Company.

      6.8.1 DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Section 6.8 only:

      a. A director of the Company who is Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board
of Directors of the Company or of a committee thereof shall not be deemed to be
an officer of the Company by reason of holding such position (without regard to
whether such position is deemed an officer of the Company under the bylaws of
the Company), unless such person is a full-time employee of the Company.

      b. The term "MAJORITY STOCKHOLDER" shall mean (i) the Investor; (ii) any
subsidiary of Investor; (iii) any person or entity directly or indirectly owning
50% or more interest in the outstanding voting


                                       15
<PAGE>
stock of Investor; (iv) any successors, by way of merger, consolidation or sale
of all or substantially all of the assets or stock, of Investor or an entity
described in clause (ii) or (iii) above; and (v) any assignees or other
transferee of all of the equity interest of Investor or an entity described in
clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) above.

      c. The term "AFFILIATE" shall mean a director, officer, or employee of the
Majority Stockholder. No person shall be deemed to be an Affiliate solely by
reason of his or her employment by or affiliation or relationship with the
Company.

      d. The term "CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY" shall consist of a business
opportunity that (i) the Company is financially able to undertake, (ii) is, from
its nature, in the line or lines of the Company's existing or prospective
business and is of practical advantage to it, and (iii) is one in which the
Company could, but for the provisions of this Section 6.8, have an interest or
reasonable expectancy.

      6.8.2 CONDUCT OF MAJORITY STOCKHOLDER

      a. Except as the Majority Stockholder may otherwise agree in writing, the
Majority Stockholder shall have the right to engage, and shall have no duty to
refrain from engaging, in the same or similar activities or lines of business or
have an interest in the same classes or categories of corporate opportunities as
the Company.

      b. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Majority Stockholder shall
not be liable to the Company or its other stockholders for breach of any
fiduciary duty by reason of any activities identified in paragraph 6.8.2.a above
of the Majority Stockholder or its Affiliates, or the participation in such
activities by the Majority Stockholder or its Affiliates.

      c. If the Majority Stockholder acquires knowledge of a potential
transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for both the Majority
Stockholder and the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
Majority Stockholder shall not (a) have a duty to communicate or present such
corporate opportunity to the Company, or (b) be liable to the Company or its
other stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty as a stockholder of the
Company by reason of the fact that the Majority Stockholder pursues or acquires
such corporate opportunity for itself, directs such corporate opportunity to
another person or entity, or does not communicate information regarding such
corporate opportunity to the Company.

      6.8.3 CONDUCT OF AFFILIATES. If a director or officer of the Company who
is also an Affiliate, acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter
that may be a corporate opportunity for both the Company and the Majority
Stockholder or any of its Affiliates then, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, such director or officer of the Company: (a) shall be deemed to have fully
satisfied and fulfilled the fiduciary duty of such director or officer to the
Company and its stockholders with respect to such corporate opportunity, (b)
shall not be liable to the Company or its other stockholders for breach of any
fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that the Majority Stockholder or any of its
Affiliates pursues or acquires such corporate opportunity for itself, himself,
or herself, or directs such corporate opportunity to the Majority Stockholder or
any Affiliate or does not communicate information regarding such corporate
opportunity to the Company, and (c) shall be deemed not to have breached his or
her duty of loyalty to the Company or its stockholders and not to have derived
an improper personal benefit therefrom; provided that such director or officer
acts in a manner consistent with the following:

      a. A corporate opportunity offered to any person who is an officer of the
Company (whether or not a director), and who is also a director but not an
officer or employee of the Majority Stockholder, shall belong to the Company,
unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person in writing solely


                                       16
<PAGE>
in his or her capacity as a director of Majority Stockholder, in which case such
opportunity shall belong to the Majority Stockholder.

      b. A corporate opportunity offered to any person who is a director but not
an officer of the Company, and who is also an officer (whether or not a
director) or employee of the Majority Stockholder, shall belong to the Company
only if such opportunity is expressly offered to such person in writing solely
in his or her capacity as a director of the Company, and otherwise shall belong
to the Majority Stockholder.

      c. A corporate opportunity offered to any person who is an officer or
director of both the Company and the Majority Stockholder, shall belong to the
Company only if such opportunity is expressly offered to such person in writing
solely in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the Company, and
otherwise shall belong to the Majority Stockholder.

      6.8.4 GENERAL. Any corporate opportunity that belongs to the Majority
Stockholder or an Affiliate, on the one hand, or to the Company, on the other
hand, pursuant to the foregoing provisions of Section 6.8 shall not be pursued
by the other, unless and until the party to whom the opportunity belongs
determines not to pursue the opportunity and so informs the other party in
writing. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the party to whom the
corporate opportunity belongs does not, within one year of receipt of notice of
the corporate opportunity, begin to pursue, or thereafter continue to pursue,
such opportunity diligently and in good faith, the other party may then pursue
such opportunity or direct it to another person.

      Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in
equity securities of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of and to have
consented to the provisions of this Section 6.8. Neither the alteration,
amendment or repeal of this Section 6.8 nor the adoption of any provision of the
Company's Bylaws or Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Section
6.8 shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Section 6.8 in respect of any
matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this
Section 6.8, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, repeal
or adoption.

      Anything in this Section 6.8 to the contrary notwithstanding, the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.8 shall terminate, expire and have no
further force and effect on the date that no person who is a director, officer
or employee of the Company is also a director, officer, or employee of the
Majority Stockholder.
