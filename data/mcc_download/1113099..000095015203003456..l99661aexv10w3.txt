         The Parties may desire to expand the total members of directors on the

                                   AGREEMENT

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and covenants set forth
in this Second Amendment and the Stockholder Agreement, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto agree to amend
the Stockholder Agreement as follows:

1.       The text of Sections 4.1 and 4.3 of the Stockholder Agreement shall be
         deleted in their entirety and replaced by the following text:

                  4.1      Board Composition. The Stockholders and the Company
                           shall take all actions necessary to cause the Board
                           of Directors to be comprised of eleven (11) members,
                           three of whom shall be designees of Eastman (the

                           designees of Danisco (the "Danisco Designees," and

                           Designees"), one of whom shall be the Chief Executive
                           Officer of the Company (the "CEO"), one of whom shall
                           be the last persons who are not otherwise affiliates
                           (as defined under the Securities Act and the
                           regulations thereunder) of the Company, Eastman or
                           Danisco (the "Independent Directors").

                  4.3      Voting and Other Actions. The Company and the
                           Stockholder agree to take such actions as are
                           necessary to effectuate the provisions of Sections
                           4.1 and 4.2 both with respect to the time period
                           specified in the first sentence of Section 4.1 and
                           all subsequent elections and appointments of members
                           of the Board. Without limiting the foregoing, the
                           authorized number of members of the Board of
                           Directors shall be no greater than 11 without a
                           further amendment of this agreement in accordance
                           with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition
                           the Company and Stockholders shall also take such

                           action as is necessary to ensure that the composition

                           requirements of the Nasdaq National Market.

2.       Except as expressly amended hereby, the provisions of the Stockholder
         Agreement remain unchanged and in full force and effect and this Second
         Amendment does not and shall not be deemed to waive, modify or amend
         any other provision or terms of the Stockholder Agreement.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties' authorized representatives have
executed this Second Amendment as of the day and year first above written.
