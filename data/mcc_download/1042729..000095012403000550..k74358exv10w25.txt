ARTICLE 5 PAYMENTS

     5.1 PROGRESS PAYMENTS

     5.1.1 Based upon Applications for Payment submitted to the Architect by
     the Contractor and Certificates for Payment issued by the Architect, the
     Owner shall make progress payments on account of the Contract Sum to the
     Contractor as provided below and elsewhere in the Contract Documents.

     5.1.2 The period covered by each Application for Payment shall be one
     calendar month ending on the last day of the month, or as follows:

     5.1.3 Provided that an Application for Payment is received by the Architect
     not later than the thirtieth day of a month, the Owner shall make payment
     to the Contractor not later than the thirtieth day of the following month.
     If an Application for Payment is received by the Architect after the
     application date fixed above, payment shall be made by the Owner not later
     than thirty (30) days after the Architect receives the Application for
     Payment.

     5.1.4 Each Application for Payment shall be based on the most recent
     schedule of values submitted by the Contractor in accordance with the
     Contract Documents. The schedule of values shall allocate the entire
     Contract Sum among the various portions of the Work. The schedule of values
     shall be prepared in such form and supported by such data to substantiate

     to by the Architect, shall be used as a basis for reviewing the
     Contractor's Applications for Payment.

     5.1.5 Applications for Payment shall indicate the percentage of completion
     of each portion of the Work as of the end of the period covered by the
     Application for Payment.

     5.1.6 Subject to other provisions of the Contract Documents, the amount of
     each progress payment shall be computed as follows:

          .1 Take that portion of the Contract Sum properly allocable to
          completed Work as determined by multiplying the percentage completion
          of each portion of the Work by the share of the Contract Sum allocated
          to that portion of the Work in the schedule of values, less retainage
          of five percent (5%). Pending final determination of cost to the Owner
          of changes in the Work, amounts not in dispute shall be included as
          provided in Subparagraph 7.3.8 of AIA Document A201-1997;

          .2 Add that portion of the Contract Sum properly allocable to
          materials and equipment delivered and suitably stored at the site for
          subsequent incorporation in the completed construction (or, if
          approved in advance by the Owner, suitably stored off the site at a
          location agreed upon in writing), less retainage of five percent(5%);

          .3 Subtract the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner; and

          .4 Subtract amounts, if any, for which the Architect has withheld or
          nullified a Certificate for Payment as provided in Paragraph 9.5 of
          AIA Document A201-1997.

     5.1.7 The progress payment amount determined in accordance with
     Subparagraph 5.1.6 shall be further modified under the following
     circumstances:

          .1 Add, upon Substantial Completion of the Work, a sum sufficient to
          increase the total payments to the full amount of the Contract Sum,
          less such amounts as the Architect shall determine for incomplete
          Work, retainage applicable to such work and unsettled claims; and
          (Subparagraph 9.8.5 of AIA Document A201-1997 requires release of
          applicable retainage upon Substantial Completion of Work with consent
          of surety, if any.)

          .2 Add, if final completion of the Work is thereafter materially
          delayed through no fault of the Contractor, any additional amounts
          payable in accordance with Subparagraph 9.10.3 of AIA Document
          A201-1997.

     5.1.8 Reduction or limitation of retainage, if any, shall be as follows:
     (If it is intended, prior to Substantial Completion of the entire Work, to
     reduce or limit the retainage resulting from the percentages inserted in
     Clauses 5.1.6.1 and 5.1.6.2 above, and this is not explained elsewhere in
     the Contract Documents, insert here provisions for such reduction or
     limitation.)







     5.1.9 Except with the Owners prior approval, the Contractor shall not make
     advance payments to suppliers for materials or equipment which have not
     been delivered and stored at the site.


     5.2 FINAL PAYMENT

     5.2.1 Final payment, constituting the entire unpaid balance of the Contract
     Sum, shall be made by the Owner to the Contractor when:

     .1 the Contractor has fully performed the Contract except for the
     Contractor's responsibility to correct Work as provided in Subparagraph
     12.2.2 of AIA Document A201-1997, and to satisfy other requirements, if
     any, which extend beyond final payment; and


     .2 a final Certificate for Payment has been issued by the Architect.
