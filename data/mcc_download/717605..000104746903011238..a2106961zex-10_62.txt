     with respect to a proposed adjustment of the Company's or any of its
     subsidiaries' Federal, state, or other taxes is pending or, to the best of

     its Subsidiaries that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of

     that the subsequent recordation of the trademark security agreement, patent
     security agreement and the copyright security agreement in the U.S. Patent
     and Trademark Office and U.S. Copyright Office, as applicable, may be
     necessary to perfect the security interest of the Joint Collateral Agent in
     issued registrations and applications for other United States Intellectual
     Property that are acquired by the Company and any Grantor after the date
     hereof; the registration of unregistered copyrights in the U.S. Copyright

     the captions "Taxation," "Description of Material Debt," Equity
     Transactions," and under the caption "Plan of Distribution," insofar as
     they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred
     to therein, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects;

          (xv)     Assuming (i) the accuracy of the representations and
     warranties of the Company and of you set forth in the Purchase Agreement,
     (ii) the due performance by the Company of the covenants and agreements set
     forth in the Purchase Agreement and the due performance by you of the
     covenants and agreements set forth in the Purchase Agreement, (iii) your
     compliance with the offering and transfer procedures and restrictions
     described in the Offering Circular, (iv) the accuracy of the
     representations and warranties made in accordance with the Purchase
     Agreement and the Offering Circular by purchasers to whom you initially
     resell the Securities and (v) that reasonable steps have been taken to
     ensure that purchasers to whom the Purchasers initially resell the
     Securities have been informed that the Purchasers may be relying on the
     exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided
     by Rule 144A in connection with such sales the offer, sale and delivery of
     the Securities to you in the manner contemplated by the Purchase Agreement
     and the Offering Circular and the initial resale of the Securities by you
     in the manner contemplated in the Offering Memorandum and the Purchase
     Agreement, do not require registration under the Securities Act, and the
     Indenture does not require qualification under the Trust Indenture Act, it
     being understood that we do not express any opinion as to any subsequent
     reoffer or resale of any Security;

          (xvi)    The Company is not an "investment company," as such term is
     defined in the Investment Company Act;

          (xvii)   The shares of capital stock of each of the Guarantors shown
     by the stock record books of the Guarantors as being issued and outstanding
     immediately prior to the date hereof are owned of record by the Company.
     Such shares have been duly authorized and are fully paid and nonassessable,
     and free and clear of any preemptive rights or any similar rights arising
     under such Guarantor's Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or
     Applicable Law.

          (xviii)  Under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of
     New York (without regard to laws referenced in Section 9-201 thereof, the
     "New York UCC"), the provisions of the Security Agreement are effective to
     create a valid security interest in each of the Company's and each
     Guarantor's rights in the Collateral (as defined in the Security Agreement)
     to the extent the New York UCC governs a security interest in such
     collateral, in favor of the Joint

                                       15
<Page>

     Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Trustee to secure the Secured
     Obligations (as defined in the Security Agreement);

          (xix)    To the extent the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the
     State of Delaware (without regard to laws referenced in Section 9-201
     thereof, the "Delaware UCC"), is applicable to the authorization of the
     Company's financing statement, pursuant to the provisions of the Security
     Agreement the Company has authorized the filing of the Company's financing
     statement for purposes of Section 9-509 of the Delaware UCC;

          (xx)     To the extent the Delaware UCC is applicable to the
     authorization of each Guarantor's financing statement, pursuant to the
     provisions of the Security Agreement, each Guarantor has authorized the
     filing of its respective financing statement for purposes of Section 9-509
     of the Delaware UCC;

          (xxi)    To the extent the Delaware UCC is applicable, the Company's
     financing statement includes not only all of the types of information
     required by Section 9-502(a) of the Delaware UCC but also the types of
     information without which the office of the Secretary of State of the State
     of Delaware (the "Filing Office"), may refuse to accept the Company's
     financing statement pursuant to Section 9-516 of the Delaware UCC;

          (xxii)   To the extent the Delaware UCC is applicable, each
     Guarantor's financing statement includes not only all of the types of
     information required by Section 9-502(a) of the Delaware UCC but also the
     types of information without which the Filing Office may refuse to accept
     such Guarantor's financing statement pursuant to Section 9-516 of the
     Delaware UCC;

          (xxiii)  To the extent the Delaware UCC is applicable, the security
     interest in favor of the Joint Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
     Trustee will be perfected in each of the Company's and each Guarantor's
     rights in all Collateral to the extent the Delaware UCC governs a security
     interest in such collateral, upon the later of the attachment of the
     security interest and the filing of each of the Company's financing
     statement and each Guarantor's financing statement in the Filing Office;
     provided, however, we express no opinion with respect to (i) money, (ii)
     deposit accounts, (iii) letter of credit rights, (iv) goods covered by a
     certificate of title statute, (v) as-extracted collateral, timber to be cut
     or (vi) any property subject to a statute, regulation or treaty of the
     United States whose requirements for a security interest's obtaining
     priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the property
     preempt Section 9-310(a) of the Delaware UCC;

          (xxiv)   You will have asked whether the Company and each Guarantor
     are "registered organizations" as such term is defined in Section
     9-102(a)(70) of the Delaware UCC. Pursuant to Section 9-102(a)(70) of the
     Delaware UCC, a "registered organization" must be (i) organized solely
     under the laws of a single State (or the United States) and (ii) the State
     (or the United States) must maintain a public record showing the
     organization to have been organized. Pursuant to Section 103(c)(6) of the
     DGCL, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware is required to
     maintain a public record showing the Company and each Guarantor have been
     organized. Based on our review of (i) a certified copy of a certificate of
     incorporation of the Company from the Secretary of State of the State of
     Delaware as to Company's existence in such state and (ii) a certified copy
     of a certificate of incorporation of each Guarantor from the Secretary of
     State of the State of Delaware as to each Guarantor's existence in such
     state and to the extent the Delaware UCC is applicable, the Company and
     each Guarantor are "registered organizations" under Section 9-102(a)(70) of
     the Delaware UCC and the DGCL. We will have assumed that neither the
     Company nor any Guarantor has

                                       16
<Page>

     filed a certificate of incorporation or any similar document under the laws
     of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware and that the internal
     affairs of the Company and each Guarantor are not otherwise subject to the
     laws of any other jurisdiction. We will call to your attention that to the
     extent that the internal affairs of the Company or any Guarantor are
     subject to regulation under the laws of another state, the State of
     Delaware may recognize such authority. See, e.g., McDermott Inc. v. Lewis,
     531 A.2d 206 (Del. 1987). Further, we will have assumed that neither the
     Company nor each Guarantor has or will file (A) any certificates of
     transfer, continuance or domestication, or any similar certificates in the
     State of Delaware pursuant to Sections 390(a) and 388(b)(1) of the DGCL or
     (B) any similar certificates in any jurisdiction other than the State of
     Delaware;

          (xxv)    To the extent that the federal trademark laws of the United
     States of America are applicable to security interests in trademarks, the
     provisions of the Intellectual Property Security Agreement together with
     the recordation of the Intellectual Property Security Agreement in the
     United States Patent and Trademark Office (the "PTO") against the U.S.
     registered trademarks and trademark applications set forth on the schedules
     thereto the "Trademarks") within three (3) months of the date thereof is
     effective to create a valid security interest in the Company's and each
     Guarantor's rights in such Trademarks in favor of the Joint Collateral
     Agent for the benefit of the Trustee to secure the Secured Obligations that
     is effective against subsequent purchasers of such Trademarks;

          (xxvi)   To the extent that the federal patent laws of the United
     States of America are applicable to security interests in patents, the
     provisions of the Intellectual Property Security Agreement together with
     the recordation of the Intellectual Property Security Agreement in the PTO
     against the U.S. patents and patent applications set forth on the schedules
     thereto (the "Patents") within three (3) months of the date thereof is
     effective to create a valid security interest in the Company's and each
     Guarantor's rights in such Patents in favor of the Joint Collateral Agent
     for the benefit of the Trustee to secure the Secured Obligations that is
     effective against subsequent purchasers and mortgagees of such Patents;

          (xxvii)  To the extent that the federal copyright laws of the United
     States of America are applicable to security interests in copyrights, the
     provisions of the Intellectual Property Security Agreement together with
     the recordation of the Intellectual Property Security Agreement in the
     United States Copyright Office against the U.S. registered copyrights set
     forth on the schedules thereto (the "Copyrights") within one (1) month of
     the date thereof is effective to create a valid security interest in the
     Company's and each Guarantor's rights in such Copyrights in favor of the
     Joint Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Trustee to secure the Secured
     Obligations that is effective against subsequent transferees of such
     Copyrights.

          (xxviii) The New Senior Credit Facility has been duly authorized by
     the Company and, when executed and delivered by the Company and the
     subsidiaries of the Company that are obligors thereunder, the New Senior
     Credit Facility will constitute a valid and binding agreement of the
     Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
     subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and
     other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors'
     rights and to general equity principles; and

          In addition, Skadden will state that it has participated in
     conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, counsel
     for the Company, representatives of the independent accountants of the
     Company and you and your counsel at which the contents of

                                       17
<Page>

     the Offering Circular and related matters were discussed. Although we are
     not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy,
     completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Offering
     Circular and have made no independent check or verification thereof, on the
     basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to our attention that have led
     us to believe that the Offering Circular, as of its date and as of the date
     hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or
     omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
     statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
     made, not misleading, except that we express no opinion or belief with
     respect to the financial statements, schedules and other financial data
     included. For purposes of the foregoing, Skadden will note that the
     Offering Circular has been prepared in the context of a Rule 144A
     transaction and not as part of a registration statement under the
     Securities Act and does not contain all of the information that would be
     required in a registration statement under the Securities Act.

          For purposes of this Section 7, (A) "Governmental Approval" means any
     consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing,
     qualification or registration with, any Governmental Authority required to
     be made or obtained by the Company pursuant to Applicable Laws, other than
     any consent, approval, license, authorization, validation, filing,
     qualification or registration which may have become applicable as a result
     of the involvement of any other party (other than the Company) in the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Indenture, the
     Registration Rights Agreement, the Financing Transactions and the Security
     Documents or because of such parties' legal or regulatory status or because
     of any other facts specifically pertaining to such parties; (B)
     "Governmental Authorities" means any court, regulatory body, administrative
     agency or governmental body of the State of New York, the State of Delaware
     or the United States of America having jurisdiction over the Company under
     any laws of the State of New York, the Federal laws of the United States
     and the DGCL; and (C) "Applicable Laws" means the DGCL, those laws, rules
     and regulations of any court or governmental agency or body having
     jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
     properties of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United
     States of America, in each case, which, in our experience, are normally
     applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement, the
     Indenture, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Financing Transactions
     and the Security Documents (other than the United States federal securities
     laws, state and foreign securities or blue sky laws, antifraud laws, the
     New York UCC (as defined below) and the rules and regulations of the
     National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.) without our having made
     any special investigation as to the applicability of any other law, rule or
     regulation.

     (c)  Ira Krakower, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary for
the Company, shall have furnished to you his written opinion, dated the Time of
Delivery, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to you, to the effect
that:

          (i)      The Company and each of the Guarantors has power and
     authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its
     business as described in the Offering Circular;

          (ii)     The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in
     the Offering Circular, and all of the issued shares capital stock of the
     Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid
     and non-assessable;

          (iii)    All of the issued shares of capital stock of each Guarantor
     have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and
     non-assessable, and (except for directors' qualifying shares and except as
     otherwise set forth in the Offering Circular) are owned directly

                                       18
<Page>

     or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances or
     claims, except for creditor's rights in general to assert claims against
     the assets of the holder of such shares (such counsel being entitled to
     rely in respect of the opinion in this clause upon opinions of local
     counsel and in respect of matters of fact upon certificates of officers of
     the Company or each Guarantor, PROVIDED that such counsel shall state that
     they believe that both you and they are justified in relying upon such
     opinions and certificates);

          (iv)     The Company and each of the Guarantors has been duly
     qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is
     in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns
     or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such
     qualification, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good
     standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect (such counsel being
     entitled to rely in respect of the opinion in this clause upon opinions of
     local counsel and in respect of matters of fact upon certificates of
     officers of the Company and each of the Guarantors, PROVIDED that such
     counsel shall state that he believes that both you and he are justified in
     relying upon such opinions and certificates);

          (v)      To the best of such counsel's knowledge and other than as set
     forth in the Offering Circular, there are no legal or governmental
     proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
     party or of which any property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
     the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a Material
     Adverse Effect on the current or future consolidated financial position,
     stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries; and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such
     proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or
     threatened by others;

          (vi)     To the best of such counsel's knowledge, neither the Company
     nor any of its subsidiaries is (i) in violation of its Certificate of
     Incorporation, Certificate of Formation, Partnership Agreement or By-laws
     or other organizational documents or (ii) in default in the performance or
     observance of any obligation, covenant or condition contained in any
     indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other
     agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
     properties may be bound;

          (vii)    All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the
     Subsidiaries are owned of record by the Company. Such shares are also owned
     beneficially by the Company and are free and clear of all adverse claims,
     limitations on voting rights, options, and other encumbrances (other than
     those created pursuant to the Security Documents) and are duly authorized,
     validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, except, where applicable, as
     provided by Section 630 of the New York Business Corporation Law as to the
     subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of New York;

          (vii)    Any and all documents filed by the Company since January 1,
     2002 with the Commission under the Exchange Act (other than the financial
     statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need
     express no opinion), when they were filed with the Commission, complied as
     to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act,
     and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and such
     counsel has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they were
     so filed, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
     state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
     the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such
     documents were so filed, not misleading; and

                                       19
<Page>

          (viii)   Such counsel shall also state that, in the course of
     preparing the Offering Circular, he has considered the information set
     forth therein, and has participated in conferences with representatives and
     officers of the Company, including its independent public accountants,
     during the course of which the contents of the Offering Circular and
     related matters were discussed; and that, as a result of such consideration
     and participation, nothing has come to his attention which causes him to
     believe that the Offering Circular and any further amendments or
     supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery
     (other than the financial statements, financial data and supporting
     schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion)
     contained as of its date or contains as of the Time of Delivery an untrue
     statement of a material fact or omitted or omits, as the case may be, to
     state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
     light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

     (d)  On the date of the Offering Circular prior to the execution of this
Agreement and also at the Time of Delivery, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall
have furnished to you a letter or letters, dated the respective dates of
delivery thereof, in form and substance satisfactory to you;

     (e)  (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have
sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included in
the Offering Circular any loss or interference with its business from fire,
explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from
any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise
than as set forth or contemplated in the Offering Circular, and (ii) since the
respective dates as of which information is given in the Offering Circular there
shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a
prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial
position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Offering
Circular, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii),
is in the judgment of the Purchasers so material and adverse as to make it
impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the
Securities being issued at the Time of Delivery on the terms and in the manner
contemplated in this Agreement and in the Offering Circular;

     (f)  On or after the date hereof (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in
the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized
statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for
purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall
have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible
negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities;

     (g)  On or after the date hereof there shall not have occurred any of the
following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities
generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material
limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock
Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared
by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in
commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United
States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United
States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war;
or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in
financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere,
if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment
of the Purchasers makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the
public offering or the delivery of the Securities being issued at the Time of
Delivery on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Offering Circular;

     (h)  The Securities have been designated for trading on PORTAL;

     Company or any Guarantor (under its present name and any previous names) as
     the debtor, together with copies of such financing statements (none of
     which shall cover any collateral described in the Security Documents, other
     than any such financing statement which evidences a Permitted Prior Lien or

     referred to in clause (ii) above has been delivered to the Trustee or the
     Joint Collateral Agent;

          (iv)     such other approvals, opinions, or documents as the Trustee
     may reasonably request in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the

     binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
     accordance with its terms except as (x) the enforceability thereof may be
     limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors'
     rights generally and (y) rights of acceleration and the availability of
     equitable remedies may be limited by equitable principles of general
     applicability; and

            (ii)     in respect of each Owned real property or leasehold real
     property contemplated to be mortgaged a mortgagee's title insurance policy
     (or policies) or marked up unconditional binder for such insurance. Each
     such policy shall (A) be in an amount not less than the outstanding
     principal amount of the indebtedness secured by such Mortgage that is
     reasonably allocable to such real property; (B) be issued at ordinary
     rates; (C) insure that the Mortgage insured thereby creates a valid first
     Lien on, and security interest in, such Owned real property or leasehold
     property contemplated to be mortgaged free and clear of all defects and
     encumbrances, except as disclosed therein; (D) name you and the Trustee for
     the benefit of the Secured Parties as the insured thereunder; (E) be in the
     form of ALTA Loan Policy - 1970 Form B (Amended October 17, 1970 and
     October 17, 1984) (or equivalent policies), if available; (F) contain such
     endorsements and affirmative coverage as you and the Trustee may reasonably
     request in form and substance acceptable to you and the Trustee, including,
     without limitation (to the extent applicable with respect to such Owned
     real property or leasehold property contemplated to be mortgaged and
     available in the jurisdiction in which such Owned real property or
     leasehold property contemplated to be mortgaged is located), the following:
     variable rate endorsement; survey endorsement; comprehensive endorsement;
     zoning; first loss, last dollar and tie-in endorsement; access coverage;
     separate tax parcel coverage; usury; doing business; subdivision; CLTA
     119.2 and CLTA 119.3 (for leased Real Estate, only); contiguity coverage;
     and such other endorsements as you and the Trustee shall reasonably require
     in order to provide insurance against specific risks identified by you and
     the Trustee in connection with such Owned real property or leasehold
     property, and (G) be issued by title companies reasonably satisfactory to
     you and the Trustee (including any such title companies acting as
     co-insurers or reinsurers, at the option of you and the Trustee). You and
     the Trustee shall have received evidence satisfactory to it that all
     premiums in respect of each such policy, all charges for mortgage recording
     tax, and all related expenses, if any, have been paid;

                                       22

     (q)  You and the Trustee shall have received from the Company its existing
policies of flood insurance that cover parcels of improved real property that
are encumbered by any Mortgage and have improvements which are located in a
flood zone;

     (r)  You and the Trustee shall have received a copy of all recorded
documents referred to, or listed as exceptions to title in, the title policy or
policies referred to in clause (ii) above and a copy of all other material
documents affecting the Owned real property or leasehold property contemplated
to be mortgaged; and

     (s)  For a period of 180 days from the date of the Offering Circular, the
Company and its Subsidiaries will not, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to
sell, contract to sell, grant any option to purchase, issue any instrument
convertible into or exchangeable for, or otherwise transfer or dispose of (or
enter into any transaction or device which is designed to, or could be expected
to, result in the disposition in the future of), any debt securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in either the capital markets or the bank
loan markets, except (i) in exchange for the Exchange Securities in connection
with the Exchange Offer or (ii) with the prior consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co.

     8.   (a)      The Company and each Guarantor will, jointly and severally,
indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser against any losses, claims, damages
or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Purchaser may become subject,
under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Preliminary Offering Circular or the Offering Circular, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Purchaser for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such Purchaser in connection with investigating
or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that neither the Company nor any Guarantor shall be liable in any such
case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of
or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission made in any Preliminary Offering Circular or the Offering
Circular or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information furnished to the Company by any Purchaser through
Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein;

     (b)  Each Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the
Guarantors against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the
Company and any Guarantor may become subject, under the Act or otherwise,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Offering Circular or
the Offering Circular, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of
or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to
the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Offering
Circular or the Offering Circular or any such amendment or supplement in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by such Purchaser through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use
therein; and will reimburse the Company and the Guarantors for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company and the Guarantors in
connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such
expenses are incurred;

     (c)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or
(b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party
shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying
party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of

                                       23
<Page>

the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party
shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified
party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be
brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party
of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any
other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with
counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the
consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and,
after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its
election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be
liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent
of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or
claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought
hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party
to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i)
includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability
arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to,
or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of
any indemnified party;

     (d)  If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable
to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or
(b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions
in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received
by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Purchasers on the
other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided
by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if
the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c)
above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the
Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other in
connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the
Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other shall
be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the
offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors
bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the
Purchasers, in each case as set forth in the Offering Circular. The relative
fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company
and the Guarantors on the one hand or the Purchasers on the other and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantors and
the Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if
the Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other
method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an
indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be
deemed to

                                       24
<Page>

include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Purchaser shall be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total
price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to investors
were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Purchaser
has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission. The Purchasers' obligations in this
subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective
underwriting obligations and not joint; and

     (e)  The obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under this Section 8
shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Guarantors may
otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each
person, if any, who controls any Purchaser within the meaning of the Act; and
the obligations of the Purchasers under this Section 8 shall be in addition to
any liability which the respective Purchasers may otherwise have and shall
extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the
Company or any Guarantor and to each person, if any, who controls the Company or
any Guarantor within the meaning of the Act.

     9.   (a) If any Purchaser shall default in its obligation to purchase the
Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion
arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on
the terms contained herein. If within 36 hours after such default by any
Purchaser you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the
Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to
procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such
Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed
periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of
such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the
purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone
the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to
effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Offering Circular,
or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to prepare
promptly any amendments to the Offering Circular which in your opinion may
thereby be made necessary. The term "Purchaser" as used in this Agreement shall
include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such
person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such
Securities; and

     (b)  If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
Securities of a defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers by you and the Company as
provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such
Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the
aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have
the right to require each non-defaulting Purchaser to purchase the principal
amount of Securities which such Purchaser agreed to purchase hereunder and, in
addition, to require each non-defaulting Purchaser to purchase its pro rata
share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Purchaser agreed
to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Purchaser or
Purchasers for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein
shall relieve a defaulting Purchaser from liability for its default;

     (c)  If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
Securities of a defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers by you and the Company as
provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities
which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount
of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described
in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Purchasers to purchase
Securities of a defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers, then this Agreement shall
thereupon terminate, without liability on

                                       25
<Page>

the part of any non-defaulting Purchaser or the Company, except for the expenses
to be borne by the Company and the Purchasers as provided in Section 6 hereof
and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing
herein shall relieve a defaulting Purchaser from liability for its default.

     10.  The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties
and other statements of the Company, the Guarantors and the several Purchasers,
as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively,
pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of
any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on
behalf of any Purchaser or any controlling person of any Purchaser, or the
Company, the Guarantors or any officer or director or controlling person of the
Company or a Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the
Securities.

     11.  If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof,
the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Purchaser except as
provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the
Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein,
the Company will reimburse the Purchasers through you for all out-of-pocket
expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of
counsel, reasonably incurred by the Purchasers in making preparations for the
purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be
under no further liability to any Purchaser except as provided in Sections 6 and
8 hereof.

     12.  In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the
Purchasers, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any
statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Purchaser made or given
by you jointly or by Goldman, Sachs & Co. on behalf of you as the
representatives.

     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in
writing, and if to the Purchasers shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or
facsimile transmission to you as the representatives in care of Goldman, Sachs &
Co., 85 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration
Department; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or
facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Offering
Circular, Attention: Secretary; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any notice to a
Purchaser pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail,
telex or facsimile transmission to such Purchaser at its address set forth in
its Purchasers' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which
address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such
statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt
thereof.

     13.  This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit
of, the Purchasers, the Company, the Guarantors and, to the extent provided in
Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and the
Guarantors and each person who controls the Company, any Guarantor or any
Purchaser, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and
assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue
of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Purchaser
shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.

     14.  Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.

     15.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                                       26

     16.  This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties
hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and
the same instrument.

     17.  The Company is authorized, subject to applicable law, to disclose any
and all aspects of this potential transaction that are necessary to support any
U.S. Federal income tax benefits expected to be claimed with respect to such
transaction, and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax
analyses) related to those benefits, without the Purchasers imposing any
limitation of any kind.

                                       27

     If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and
return to us five counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on
behalf of each of the Purchasers, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall
constitute a binding agreement between each of the Purchasers, the Company and
the Guarantors. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf
of each of the Purchasers is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of
Agreement among Purchasers, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company
for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the
