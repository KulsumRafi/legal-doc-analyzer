     POOLING AND SERVICING AGREEMENT, dated as of December 1, 2002, by and
among CWABS, INC., a Delaware corporation, as depositor (the "Depositor"),
COUNTRYWIDE HOME LOANS, INC., a New York corporation, as seller (the
"Seller"), COUNTRYWIDE HOME LOANS SERVICING LP, a Texas limited partnership,
as master servicer (the "Master Servicer"), THE BANK OF NEW YORK, a New York
banking corporation, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and BNY WESTERN TRUST
COMPANY, a California banking corporation, as co-trustee (the "Co-Trustee").

                             PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

     The Depositor is the owner of the Trust Fund that is hereby conveyed to
the Trustee in return for the Certificates. As provided herein, the Trustee
will elect that the Trust Fund (except for each Cap Contract, the Carryover
Reserve Fund, and the Pre-Funding Account) be treated for federal income tax
purposes as comprising two real estate mortgage investment conduits (each a
"REMIC" or, in the alternative, the "Lower Tier REMIC" and the "Upper Tier
REMIC", respectively). The Lower Tier REMIC will hold as assets all property
of the Trust Fund (other than the Cap Contracts, the Carryover Reserve Fund,
and the Pre-Funding Account) and will be evidenced by (i) the Lower Tier REMIC
Regular Interests, which will be uncertificated and will represent the "REMIC
regular interests" in the Lower Tier REMIC, and (ii) the Class LT-A-R
Interest, which will represent the "REMIC residual interest" in the Lower Tier
REMIC. The Upper Tier REMIC will hold as assets the Lower Tier REMIC Regular
Interests and will be evidenced by the Certificates, each of which (other than
the Class A-R Certificate) will represent ownership of one or more "REMIC
regular interests" in the Upper Tier REMIC. The Class A-R Certificate will
represent ownership of the sole class of "REMIC residual interest" in each of
the Lower Tier REMIC and the Upper Tier REMIC. The latest possible maturity
date of all REMIC regular interests created herein shall be the Latest
Possible Maturity Date.

     The following table specifies the class designation, interest rate, and
principal amount for each class of Lower Tier REMIC Interest:

         Interest, Class LT-AF-3 Interest, Class LT-AF-4 Interest, Class
         LT-AF-5 Interest, Class LT-AF-6 Interest, Class LT-M-1 Interest,
         Class LT-M-2 Interest, Class LT-B Interest and Class LT-$100 Interest
         (each such class hereafter referred to as an "Accretion Directed
         Class") each have a principal balance that is initially equal to 50%
         of its corresponding Certificate Class issued by the Upper Tier
         REMIC. Principal payments, both scheduled and prepaid, Realized
         Losses, and interest accruing on the Class LT-Accrual Interest will
         be allocated to each of the foregoing classes to maintain each Class'
         size relative to its Corresponding Certificate Class (i.e., 50%) with
         any excess payments of principal and Realized Losses being allocated
         to the Class LT-Accrual Interest in such manner as to cause the
         principal balance of the Class LT-Accrual Interest to have a
         principal balance equal to (a) 50% of the Group 1 and Group 2
         principal balances plus (b) 50% of the excess of the Group 1 and
         Group 2 principal balances over the sum of the principal balances of
         the Class AV-1, Class AF-1, Class AF-2, Class AF-3, Class AF-4, Class
         AF-5, Class AF-6, Class M-1, Class M-2, Class B and Class A-R
         Certificates for such Distribution Date.

(2)      The interest rate with respect to any Distribution Date (and the
         related Accrual Period) for this Lower Tier REMIC Interest is a per
         annum rate equal to the Class AV-1 Net Rate Cap, with respect to the
         Class AV-1 Certificates, the Class AF Net Rate Cap, with respect to
         the Class AF Certificates, or the Subordinate Net Rate Cap, with
         respect to the Subordinate Certificates.

(3)      The principal balance of the Class LT-Accrual Interest initially
         equals the excess of the principal balance of the Group 1 and Group 2
         Mortgage Loans over the aggregate principal balance of the Class
         LT-AV-1 Interest, Class AF-1 Interest, Class AF-2 Interest, Class
         AF-3 Interest, Class AF-4 Interest, Class AF-5 Interest, Class AF-6
         Interest, Class LT-M-1 Interest, Class LT-M-2 Interest, Class LT-B
         Interest and Class LT-$100 Interest.

(4)      The interest rate with respect to any Distribution Date (and the
         related Accrual Period) for the Class LT-Accrual Interest is a per
         annum rate (hereafter referred to as the "Pool WAC Rate") equal to
         the weighted average of the Adjusted Net Mortgage Rates of each of
         the Mortgage Loans.

(5)      The LT-$100 Interest does not pay any interest.

(6)      The Class LT-AR Interest is the sole class of residual interest in
         the Lower Tier REMIC. It does not have an interest rate or a
         principal balance.

     On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall allocate the losses on, and
distribute the interest and principal on the Mortgage Loans in Group 1 and
Group 2 to the Lower Tier REMIC Interests in the same manner that such items
are allocated to or distributed among the Corresponding Classes of
Certificates or Interests. On each Distribution Date all Prepayment Charges
collected during the related Due Period shall be allocated among the Lower
Tier REMIC Interests in proportion to their outstanding principal balances.

identified in this Agreement.

(2)      The Class C Certificates do not have a principal balance.

(3)      For each Interest Accrual Period the Class C Certificates are
         entitled to a specified portion of the interest on the Group 1 and

         the product of two and the weighted average of the Lower Tier REMIC
         Regular Interests with the Lower Tier Accretion Directed Interests
         subject to a cap equal to the Pass-Through Rate of the corresponding
         Certificate Class and the LT-Accrual Class subject to a cap of 0.00%.
         The Pass-Through Rate of the Class C Certificates shall be a rate
         sufficient to entitle it to all interest accrued on the Mortgage
         Loans less the interest accrued on the other interests issued by the
         Upper Tier REMIC.

Deposit as provided in this Agreement, other than principal due on such
Subsequent Mortgage Loans on or prior to the related Subsequent Cut-off Date
and interest accruing prior to the related Subsequent Cut-off Date.

          Immediately upon the conveyance of the Subsequent Mortgage Loans

(b).

          (d) On any Business Day during the Funding Period designated by the

          to the Rating Agencies as with respect to the sale of the Subsequent

          the Closing Date to the Rating Agencies with respect to the sale of
          the Initial Mortgage Loans on the Closing Date), to be delivered as
          provided in Section 2.01(f);

               (ii) the execution and delivery of such Subsequent Transfer
          Agreement or conveyance of the related Subsequent Mortgage Loans
          does not result in a reduction or withdrawal of the any ratings

               (iii) the Depositor shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer's
          Certificate confirming the satisfaction of each of the conditions
          set forth in this Section 2.01(e) required to be satisfied by such
          Subsequent Transfer Date;

               (iv) each Subsequent Mortgage Loan conveyed on such Subsequent
          Transfer Date satisfies the representations and warranties
          applicable to it under this Agreement, provided, however, that with
          respect to a breach of a representation and warranty with respect to
          a Subsequent Mortgage Loan set forth in this clause (iv), the
          obligation under Section 2.03(e) of this Agreement of the Seller to
          cure, repurchase or replace such Subsequent Mortgage Loan shall
          constitute the sole remedy against the Seller respecting such breach

               (v) the Subsequent Mortgage Loans conveyed on such Subsequent
          Transfer Date were selected in a manner reasonably believed not to
          be adverse to the interests of the Certificateholders;

          secured by Mortgaged Properties located in the State of California,
          which will not exceed 50% of the Mortgage Pool) from the
          characteristics listed below; provided that for the purpose of
          making such calculations, the characteristics for any Initial
          Mortgage Loan made will be taken as of the Initial Cut-off Date and
          the characteristics for any Subsequent Mortgage Loans will be taken
          as of the Subsequent Cut-off Date;

          that such purchase of Subsequent Mortgage Loans will not (i) result
          in the imposition of the tax on "prohibited transactions" on the
          Trust Fund or contributions after the Startup Date, as defined in
          Sections 860F(a)(2) and 860G(d) of the Code, respectively or (ii)

Amount shall be re-invested by the Trustee in the Pre-Funding Account.

          The Trustee shall not be required to investigate or otherwise verify
compliance with the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph, except
for its own receipt of documents specified above, and shall be entitled to

assignment or assignments with evidence of recording indicated thereon upon
receipt thereof from the public recording official, or a copy thereof,
certified, if appropriate, by the relevant recording office, but in no event
shall any such delivery be made later than 270 days following the Closing
Date; provided that in the event that by such date the Seller is unable to
deliver or cause to be delivered each such Mortgage and each interim
assignment by reason of the fact that any such documents have not been
returned by the appropriate recording office, or, in the case of each interim
assignment, because the related Mortgage has not been returned by the
appropriate recording office, the Seller shall deliver or cause to be
delivered such documents to the Co-Trustee as promptly as possible upon
receipt thereof. If the public recording office in which a Mortgage or interim
assignment thereof is recorded retains the original of such Mortgage or
assignment, a copy of the original Mortgage or assignment so retained, with
evidence of recording thereon, certified to be true and complete by such
recording office, shall satisfy the Seller's obligations in Section 2.01. If
any document submitted for recording pursuant to this Agreement is (x) lost
prior to recording or rejected by the applicable recording office, the Seller
shall immediately prepare or cause to be prepared a substitute and submit it
for recording, and shall deliver copies and originals thereof in accordance
with the foregoing or (y) lost after recording, the Seller shall deliver to
the Co-Trustee a copy of such document certified by the applicable public
recording office to be a true and complete copy of the original recorded
document. The Seller shall promptly forward or cause to be forwarded to the
Co-Trustee (x) from time to time additional original documents evidencing an
assumption or modification of a Mortgage Loan and (y) any other documents
required to be delivered by the Depositor or the Master Servicer to the
Trustee within the time periods specified in this Section 2.01.

          With respect to each Mortgage Loan other than a MERS Mortgage Loan
as to which the related Mortgaged Property and Mortgage File are located in
(a) the State of California or (b) any other jurisdiction under the laws of
which the recordation of the assignment specified in clause (iii) above is not
necessary to protect the Trustee's and the Certificateholders, interest in the
related Mortgage Loan, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, delivered by the Seller to the Trustee and a copy
to the Rating Agencies, in lieu of recording the assignment specified in
clause (iii) above, the Seller may deliver an unrecorded assignment in blank,
in form otherwise suitable for recording to the Co-Trustee; provided that if
the related Mortgage has not been returned from the applicable public
recording office, such assignment, or any copy thereof, of the Mortgage may
exclude the information to be provided by the recording office. As to any
Mortgage Loan other than a MERS Mortgage Loan, the procedures of the preceding
sentence shall be applicable only so long as the related Mortgage File is
maintained in the possession of the Co-Trustee in the State or jurisdiction
described in such sentence. In the event that with respect to Mortgage Loans
other than MERS Mortgage Loans (i) the Seller, the Depositor or the Master
Servicer gives written notice to the Trustee that recording is required to
protect the right, title and interest of the Trustee on behalf of the
Certificateholders in and to any Mortgage Loan, (ii) a court recharacterizes
the sale of the Mortgage Loans as a financing, or (iii) as a result of any
change in or amendment to the laws of the State or jurisdiction described in
the first sentence of this paragraph or any applicable political subdivision
thereof, or any change in official position regarding application or
interpretation of such laws, including a holding by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such recording is so required, the Co-Trustee shall complete the
assignment in the manner specified in


                                      50
<PAGE>


clause (iii) of the second paragraph of this Section 2.01 and the Seller shall
submit or cause to be submitted for recording as specified above or, should
the Seller fail to perform such obligations, the Trustee shall cause the
Master Servicer, at the Master Servicer's expense, to cause each such
previously unrecorded assignment to be submitted for recording as specified
above. In the event a Mortgage File is released to the Master Servicer as a
result of the Master Servicer's having completed a Request for Release in the
form of Exhibit M, the Trustee shall complete the assignment of the related
Mortgage in the manner specified in clause (iii) of the second paragraph of
this Section 2.01.

          So long as the Co-Trustee or its agent maintains an office in the
State of California, the Co-Trustee or its agent shall maintain possession of
and not remove or attempt to remove from the State of California any of the
Mortgage Files as to which the related Mortgaged Property is located in such
State. In the event that the Seller fails to record an assignment of a
Mortgage Loan as herein provided within 90 days of notice of an event set
forth in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the above paragraph, the Master Servicer
shall prepare and, if required hereunder, file such assignments for
recordation in the appropriate real property or other records office. The
Seller hereby appoints the Master Servicer (and any successor servicer
hereunder) as its attorney-in-fact with full power and authority acting in its
stead for the purpose of such preparation, execution and filing.

          In the case of Mortgage Loans that become the subject of a Principal
Prepayment between the Closing Date (in the case of Initial Mortgage Loans) or
Subsequent Transfer Date (in the case of Subsequent Mortgage Loans) and the
Cut-off Date, the Seller shall deposit or cause to be deposited in the
Certificate Account the amount required to be deposited therein with respect
to such payment pursuant to Section 3.05 hereof.

          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, within
thirty days after the Closing Date (in the case of Initial Mortgage Loans) or
Subsequent Transfer Date (in the case of Subsequent Mortgage Loans), the
Seller shall either (i) deliver to the Co-Trustee the Mortgage File as
required pursuant to this Section 2.01 for each Delay Delivery Mortgage Loan
or (ii) (A) repurchase the Delay Delivery Mortgage Loan or (B) substitute the
Delay Delivery Mortgage Loan for a Replacement Mortgage Loan, which repurchase
or substitution shall be accomplished in the manner and subject to the
conditions set forth in Section 2.03, provided that if the Seller fails to
deliver a Mortgage File for any Delay Delivery Mortgage Loan within the period
provided in the prior sentence, the cure period provided for in Section 2.02
or in Section 2.03 shall not apply to the initial delivery of the Mortgage
File for such Delay Delivery Mortgage Loan, but rather the Seller shall have
five (5) Business Days to cure such failure to deliver. The Seller shall
promptly provide each Rating Agency with written notice of any cure,
repurchase or substitution made pursuant to the proviso of the preceding
sentence. On or before the thirtieth (30th) day (or if such thirtieth day is
not a Business Day, the succeeding Business Day) after the Closing Date (in
the case of Initial Mortgage Loans) or Subsequent Transfer Date (in the case
of Subsequent Mortgage Loans), the Trustee shall, in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.02, send a Delay Delivery Certification substantially
in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit G-3 (with any applicable exceptions
noted thereon) for all Delay Delivery Mortgage Loans delivered within thirty
(30) days after such date. The Trustee will promptly send a copy of such Delay
Delivery Certification to each Rating Agency.

          Section 2.02 Acceptance by Trustee of the Mortgage Loans.

          (a) The Co-Trustee acknowledges receipt, subject to the limitations
contained in and any exceptions noted in the Initial Certification in the form
annexed hereto as Exhibit G-1 and in the list of exceptions attached thereto,
of the documents referred to in clauses (i) and (iii) of Section 2.01(g) above
with respect to the Initial Mortgage Loans and all other assets included in
the Trust Fund and declares that it holds and will hold such documents and the
other documents delivered to it constituting the Mortgage Files, and that it
holds or will hold such other assets included in the Trust Fund, in trust for
the exclusive use and benefit of all present and future Certificateholders.

          The Trustee agrees to execute and deliver on the Closing Date to the
Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Seller an Initial Certification
substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit G-1 to the effect that, as
to each Initial Mortgage Loan listed in the Mortgage Loan Schedule (other than
any Initial Mortgage Loan paid in full or any Initial Mortgage Loan
specifically identified in such certification as not covered by such
certification), the documents described in Section 2.01(g)(i) and, in the case
of each Mortgage Loan that is not a MERS Mortgage Loan, the documents
described in Section 2.01(g)(iii) with respect to such Initial Mortgage Loans
as are in the Co-Trustee's possession and based on its review and examination
and only as to the foregoing documents, such documents appear regular on their
face and relate to such Initial Mortgage Loan. The Trustee agrees to execute
and deliver within 30 days after the Closing Date to the Depositor, the Master
Servicer and the Seller an Interim Certification substantially in the form
annexed hereto as Exhibit G-2 to the effect that, as to each Initial Mortgage
Loan listed in the Mortgage Loan Schedule (other than any Initial Mortgage
Loan paid in full or any Initial Mortgage Loan specifically identified in such
certification as not covered by such certification) all documents required to

Initial Mortgage Loans are in its possession (except those documents described
in Section 2.01(g)(vi)) and based on its review and examination and only as to
the foregoing documents, (i) such documents appear regular on their face and
relate to such Initial Mortgage Loan, and (ii) the information set forth in
items (i), (iv), (v), (vi), (viii), (xi) and (xiv) of the definition of the
"Mortgage Loan Schedule" accurately reflects information set forth in the

the Trustee shall deliver to the Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Seller
a Delay Delivery Certification with respect to the Initial Mortgage Loans
substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit G-3, with any applicable
exceptions noted thereon. The Co-Trustee or the Trustee, as applicable, shall
be under no duty or obligation to inspect, review or examine such documents,
instruments, certificates or other papers to determine that the same are
genuine, enforceable or appropriate for the represented purpose or that they
have actually been recorded in the real estate records or that they are other
than what they purport to be on their face.

          Not later than 180 days after the Closing Date, the Trustee shall
deliver to the Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Seller (and to any
Certificateholder that so requests) a Final Certification with respect to the
Initial Mortgage Loans substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit H,
with any applicable exceptions noted thereon.


                                      52
<PAGE>


          In connection with the Trustee's completion and delivery of such
Final Certification, the Co-Trustee, at the Trustee's direction, shall review
each Mortgage File with respect to the Initial Mortgage Loans to determine
that such Mortgage File contains the following documents:

               (i) the original Mortgage Note, endorsed by the Seller or the
          originator of such Mortgage Loan, without recourse, in the following
          form: "Pay to the order of ________________ without recourse", with
          all intervening endorsements that show a complete chain of
          endorsement from the originator to the Seller, or, if the original
          Mortgage Note has been lost or destroyed and not replaced, an
          original lost note affidavit from the Seller, stating that the
          original Mortgage Note was lost or destroyed, together with a copy
          of the related Mortgage Note;

               (ii) in the case of each Initial Mortgage Loan that is not a
          MERS Mortgage Loan, the original recorded Mortgage, and in the case
          of each Initial Mortgage Loan that is a MERS Mortgage Loan, the
          original Mortgage, noting the presence of the MIN of the Initial
          Mortgage Loan and language indicating that the Initial Mortgage Loan
          is a MOM Loan if the Initial Mortgage Loan is a MOM Loan, with
          evidence of recording indicated thereon, or a copy of the Mortgage
          certified by the public recording office in which Mortgage has been
          recorded;

               (iii) in the case of each Initial Mortgage Loan that is not a
          MERS Mortgage Loan, a duly executed assignment of the Mortgage in
          the form permitted by Section 2.01;

               (iv) the original recorded assignment or assignments of the
          Mortgage together with all interim recorded assignments of such
          Mortgage (noting the presence of a MIN in the case of each MERS
          Mortgage Loan);

               (v) the original or copies of each assumption, modification,
          written assurance or substitution agreement, if any; and

               (vi) the original or duplicate original lender's title policy
          or a printout of the electronic equivalent and all riders thereto.

                  If, in the course of such review, the Co-Trustee finds any
document or documents constituting a part of such Mortgage File that do not
meet the requirements of clauses (i)-(iv) and (vi) above, the Trustee shall
include such exceptions in such Final Certification (and the Trustee shall
state in such Final Certification whether any Mortgage File does not then
include the original or duplicate original lender's title policy or a printout
of the electronic equivalent and all riders thereto). If the public recording
office in which a Mortgage or assignment thereof is recorded retains the
original of such Mortgage or assignment, a copy of the original Mortgage or
assignment so retained, with evidence of recording thereon, certified to be
true and complete by such recording office, shall be deemed to satisfy the
requirements of clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, as applicable. The Seller
shall promptly correct or cure such defect referred to above within 90 days
from the date it was so notified of such defect and, if the Seller does not
correct or cure such defect within such period, the Seller shall either (A) if
the time to cure such defect


                                      53
<PAGE>


expires prior to the end of the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
substitute for the related Initial Mortgage Loan a Replacement Mortgage Loan,
which substitution shall be accomplished in the manner and subject to the
conditions set forth in Section 2.03, or (B) purchase such Initial Mortgage
Loan from the Trust Fund within 90 days from the date the Seller was notified
of such defect in writing at the Purchase Price of such Mortgage Loan;
provided that any such substitution pursuant to (A) above or repurchase
pursuant to (B) above shall not be effected prior to the delivery to the
Trustee of the Opinion of Counsel required by Section 2.05 hereof and any
substitution pursuant to (A) above shall not be effected prior to the
additional delivery to the Co-Trustee of a Request for Release substantially
in the form of Exhibit N. No substitution will be made in any calendar month
after the Determination Date for such month. The Purchase Price for any such
Initial Mortgage Loan shall be deposited by the Seller in the Certificate
Account and, upon receipt of such deposit and certification with respect
thereto in the form of Exhibit N hereto, the Co-Trustee shall release the
related Mortgage File to the Seller and shall execute and deliver at the
Seller's request such instruments of transfer or assignment as the Seller has
prepared, in each case without recourse, as shall be necessary to vest in the
Seller, or a designee, the Trustee's interest in any Mortgage Loan released
pursuant hereto. If pursuant to the foregoing provisions the Seller
repurchases an Initial Mortgage Loan that is a MERS Mortgage Loan, the Master
Servicer shall cause MERS to execute and deliver an assignment of the Mortgage
in recordable form to transfer the Mortgage from MERS to the Seller and shall
cause such Mortgage to be removed from registration on the MERS(R) System in
accordance with MERS' rules and regulations.

          The Co-Trustee shall retain possession and custody of each Mortgage
File in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein. The Seller shall promptly deliver to the Co-Trustee, upon the
execution or receipt thereof, the originals of such other documents or
instruments constituting the Mortgage File that come into the possession of
the Seller from time to time.

          It is understood and agreed that the obligation of the Seller to
substitute for or to purchase any Mortgage Loan that does not meet the
requirements of Section 2.02(a)(A) or (B) above shall constitute the sole
remedy respecting such defect available to the Trustee, the Co-Trustee, the
Depositor and any Certificateholder against the Seller.

          (b) The Trustee agrees to execute and deliver on the Subsequent
Transfer Date to the Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Seller an Initial
Certification substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit G-4 to the
effect that, as to each Subsequent Mortgage Loan listed in the Mortgage Loan
Schedule (other than any Subsequent Mortgage Loan paid in full or any
Subsequent Mortgage Loan specifically identified in such certification as not
covered by such certification), the documents described in Section 2.01(g)(i)
and, in the case of each Mortgage Loan that is not a MERS Mortgage Loan, the
documents described in Section 2.01(g)(iii), with respect to such Subsequent
Mortgage Loan are in its possession, and based on its review and examination
and only as to the foregoing documents, such documents appear regular on their
face and relate to such Subsequent Mortgage Loan.

          The Trustee agrees to execute and deliver within 30 days after the
Subsequent Transfer Date to the Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Seller
an Interim Certification substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit
G-2 to the effect that, as to each Subsequent


                                      54
<PAGE>


Mortgage Loan listed in the Mortgage Loan Schedule (other than any Subsequent
Mortgage Loan paid in full or any Subsequent Mortgage Loan specifically
identified in such certification as not covered by such certification), all
documents required to be delivered to it pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such Subsequent Mortgage Loan are in its possession (except those
described in Section 2.01(g)(vi)) and based on its review and examination and
only as to the foregoing documents, (i) such documents appear regular on their
face and relate to such Subsequent Mortgage Loan, and (ii) the information set
forth in items (i), (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) and (xiv) of the definition of the
"Mortgage Loan Schedule" accurately reflects information set forth in the
Mortgage File. On or before the thirtieth (30th) day after the Subsequent
Transfer Date (or if such thirtieth day is not a Business Day, the succeeding
Business Day), the Trustee shall deliver to the Depositor, the Master Servicer
and the Seller a Delay Delivery Certification with respect to the Subsequent
Mortgage Loans substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit G-3, with
any applicable exceptions noted thereon, together with a Subsequent
Certification substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit G-4. The
Trustee shall be under no duty or obligation to inspect, review or examine
such documents, instruments, certificates or other papers to determine that
the same are genuine, enforceable or appropriate for the represented purpose
or that they have actually been recorded in the real estate records or that
they are other than what they purport to be on their face.

          Not later than 180 days after the Subsequent Transfer Date, the
Trustee shall deliver to the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Seller and to
any Certificateholder that so requests a Final Certification with respect to
the Subsequent Mortgage Loans substantially in the form annexed hereto as
Exhibit H, with any applicable exceptions noted thereon.

          In connection with the Trustee's completion and delivery of such
Final Certification, the Co-Trustee shall review each Mortgage File with
respect to the Subsequent Mortgage Loans to determine that such Mortgage File
contains the following documents:

               (i) the original Mortgage Note, endorsed by the Seller or the
     originator of such Mortgage Loan, without recourse, in the following
     form: "Pay to the order of ________________ without recourse", with all
     intervening endorsements that show a complete chain of endorsement from
     the originator to the Seller, or, if the original Mortgage Note has been
     lost or destroyed and not replaced, an original lost note affidavit from
     the Seller, stating that the original Mortgage Note was lost or
     destroyed, together with a copy of the related Mortgage Note;

               (ii) in the case of each Subsequent Mortgage Loan that is not a
     MERS Mortgage Loan, the original recorded Mortgage, and in the case of
     each Subsequent Mortgage Loan that is a MERS Mortgage Loan, the original
     Mortgage, noting the presence of the MIN of the Subsequent Mortgage Loan
     and language indicating that the Subsequent Mortgage Loan is a MOM Loan
     if the Subsequent Mortgage Loan is a MOM Loan, with evidence of recording
     indicated thereon, or a copy of the Mortgage certified by the public
     recording office in which Mortgage has been recorded;


                                      55
<PAGE>


               (iii) in the case of each Subsequent Mortgage Loan that is not
     a MERS Mortgage Loan, a duly executed assignment of the Mortgage in the
     form permitted by Section 2.01;

               (iv) the original recorded assignment or assignments of the
     Mortgage together with all interim recorded assignments of such Mortgage
     (noting the presence of a MIN in the case of each MERS Mortgage Loan);

               (v) the original or copies of each assumption, modification,
     written assurance or substitution agreement, if any; and

               (vi) the original or duplicate original lender's title policy
     or a printout of the electronic equivalent and all riders thereto.

          If, in the course of such review, the Co-Trustee finds any document
or documents constituting a part of such Mortgage File that do not meet the
requirements of clauses (i)-(iv) and (vi) above, the Trustee shall include
such exceptions in such Final Certification (and the Trustee shall state in
such Final Certification whether any Mortgage File does not then include the
original or duplicate original lender's title policy or a printout of the
electronic equivalent and all riders thereto). If the public recording office
in which a Mortgage or assignment thereof is recorded retains the original of
such Mortgage or assignment, a copy of the original Mortgage or assignment so
retained, with evidence of recording thereon, certified to be true and
complete by such recording office, shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements
of clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, as applicable. The Seller shall promptly
correct or cure such defect referred to above within 90 days from the date it
was so notified of such defect and, if the Seller does not correct or cure
such defect within such period, the Seller shall either (A) if the time to
cure such defect expires prior to the end of the second anniversary of the
Closing Date, substitute for the related Subsequent Mortgage Loan a
Replacement Mortgage Loan, which substitution shall be accomplished in the
manner and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2.03, or (B)
purchase such Subsequent Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund within 90 days from
the date the Seller was notified of such defect in writing at the Purchase
Price of such Subsequent Mortgage Loan; provided that any such substitution
pursuant to (A) above or repurchase pursuant to (B) above shall not be
effected prior to the delivery to the Trustee of the Opinion of Counsel
required by Section 2.05 hereof and any substitution pursuant to (A) above
shall not be effected prior to the additional delivery to the Trustee of a
Request for Release substantially in the form of Exhibit N. No substitution
will be made in any calendar month after the Determination Date for such
month. The Purchase Price for any such Subsequent Mortgage Loan shall be
deposited by the Seller in the Certificate Account and, upon receipt of such
deposit and certification with respect thereto in the form of Exhibit N
hereto, the Trustee shall release the related Mortgage File to the Seller and
shall execute and deliver at the Seller's request such instruments of transfer
or assignment as the Seller has prepared, in each case without recourse, as
shall be necessary to vest in the Seller, or a designee, the Trustee's
interest in any Mortgage Loan released pursuant hereto. If pursuant to the
foregoing provisions the Seller repurchases a Subsequent Mortgage Loan that is
a MERS Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall cause MERS to execute and
deliver an assignment of the Mortgage in recordable form to transfer the
Mortgage from MERS to the Seller and shall cause such Mortgage to be removed
from registration on the MERS(R) System in accordance with MERS' rules and
regulations.

          The Co-Trustee shall retain possession and custody of each Mortgage
File in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein. The Seller shall promptly deliver to the Co-Trustee, upon the
execution or receipt thereof, the originals of such other documents or
instruments constituting the Mortgage File that come into the possession of
the Seller from time to time.

          It is understood and agreed that the obligation of the Seller to
substitute for or to purchase, pursuant to Section 2.02(b)(A) or (B)
respectively, any Mortgage Loan whose Mortgage File contains any document or
documents that does not meet the requirements of clauses (i)-(iv) and (vi)
above and which defect is not corrected or cured by the Seller within 90 days
from the date it was notified of such defect, shall constitute the sole remedy
respecting such defect available to the Trustee, the Co-Trustee, the Depositor
and any Certificateholder against the Seller.

          Section 2.03 Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Master
                       Servicer and the Seller.


          (a) The Master Servicer hereby represents and warrants to the
Depositor and the Trustee as follows, as of the date hereof with respect to
the Initial Mortgage Loans, and the related Subsequent Transfer Date with
respect to the Subsequent Mortgage Loans:

               (i) The Master Servicer is duly organized as a Texas limited
          partnership and is validly existing and in good standing under the
          laws of the State of Texas and is duly authorized and qualified to
          transact any and all business contemplated by this Agreement to be
          conducted by the Master Servicer in any state in which a Mortgaged
          Property is located or is otherwise not required under applicable
          law to effect such qualification and, in any event, is in compliance
          with the doing business laws of any such state, to the extent
          necessary to ensure its ability to enforce each Mortgage Loan, to
          service the Mortgage Loans in accordance with the terms of this
          Agreement and to perform any of its other obligations under this
          Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof.

               (ii) The Master Servicer has the full partnership power and
          authority to sell and service each Mortgage Loan, and to execute,
          deliver and perform, and to enter into and consummate the
          transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has duly authorized
          by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Master Servicer
          the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement; and this
          Agreement, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
          hereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and
          binding obligation of the Master Servicer, enforceable against the
          Master Servicer in accordance with its terms, except that (a) the
          enforceability hereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
          moratorium, receivership and other similar laws relating to
          creditors' rights generally and (b) the remedy of specific
          performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may
          be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court
          before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

               (iii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
          Master Servicer, the servicing of the Mortgage Loans by the Master
          Servicer under this Agreement, the consummation of any other of the
          transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the fulfillment of
          or compliance with the terms hereof are in the ordinary course of
          business of the Master Servicer and will not (A) result in a
          material breach of any term or provision of the certificate of
          limited partnership, partnership agreement or other organizational
          document of the Master Servicer or (B) materially conflict with,
          result in a material breach, violation or acceleration of, or result
          in a material default under, the terms of any other material
          agreement or instrument to which the Master Servicer is a party or
          by which it may be bound, or (C) constitute a material violation of
          any statute, order or regulation applicable to the Master Servicer

          Appraised Value of the Mortgaged Property lie wholly within the
          boundaries and building restriction lines of such property, and no
          improvements on adjoining properties encroach upon the Mortgaged
          Property.

               (xxii) To the best of the Seller's knowledge, no improvement

          brought. To the best of the Seller's knowledge, all parties to the
          Mortgage Note and the Mortgage had legal capacity to execute the
          Mortgage Note and the Mortgage and each Mortgage Note and Mortgage
          have been duly and properly executed by such parties.

               (xxiv) The proceeds of the Mortgage Loan have been fully
          disbursed, there is no requirement for future advances thereunder,
          and any and all requirements as to completion of any on-site or
          off-site improvements and as to disbursements of any escrow funds
          therefor have been complied with. All costs, fees and expenses
          incurred in making, or closing or recording the Mortgage Loans were
          paid.

          designated as a deed of trust, by trustee's sale, and (ii) otherwise
          by judicial foreclosure.

          trust, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as
          such, has been properly designated and currently so serves and is
          named in such Mortgage, and no fees or expenses are or will become
          payable by the Certificateholders to the trustee under the deed of
          trust, except in connection with a trustee's sale after default by
          the Mortgagor.

          Note.

          policy shall be sufficient to prevent the Mortgagor and/or the
          mortgagee from becoming a co-insurer. If the Mortgaged Property is a
          condominium unit, it is included under the coverage afforded by a
          blanket policy for the condominium unit. All such individual
          insurance policies and all flood policies referred to in item
          (xliii) below contain a standard mortgagee clause naming the Seller
          or the original mortgagee, and its successors


                                      64
<PAGE>


          in interest, as mortgagee, and the Seller has received no notice
          that any premiums due and payable thereon have not been paid; the
          Mortgage obligates the Mortgagor thereunder to maintain all such
          insurance, including flood insurance, at the Mortgagor's cost and
          expense, and upon the Mortgagor's failure to do so, authorizes the
          holder of the Mortgage to obtain and maintain such insurance at the
          Mortgagor's cost and expense and to seek reimbursement therefor from
          the Mortgagor.

               (xliii) If the Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in
          the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as
          having special flood hazards, a flood insurance policy in a form
          meeting the requirements of the current guidelines of the Flood
          Insurance Administration is in effect with respect to such Mortgaged
          Property with a generally acceptable carrier in an amount
          representing coverage not less than the least of (A) the original
          outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, (B) the minimum
          amount required to compensate for damage or loss on a replacement
          cost basis, or (C) the maximum amount of insurance that is available
          under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended.

               (xliv) To the best of the Seller's knowledge, there is no
          proceeding occurring, pending or threatened for the total or partial
          condemnation of the Mortgaged Property.

               (xlv) There is no material monetary default existing under any
          Mortgage or the related Mortgage Note and, to the best of the
          Seller's knowledge, there is no material event that, with the
          passage of time or with notice and the expiration of any grace or
          cure period, would constitute a default, breach, violation or event
          of acceleration under the Mortgage or the related Mortgage Note; and
          the Seller has not waived any default, breach, violation or event of
          acceleration.

               (xlvi) Each Mortgaged Property is improved by a one- to
          four-family residential dwelling, including condominium units and
          dwelling units in PUDs. To the best of the Seller's knowledge, no
          improvement to a Mortgaged Property includes a cooperative or a
          mobile home or constitutes other than real property under state law.

               (xlvii) Each Mortgage Loan is being serviced by the Master
          Servicer.

               (xlviii) Any future advances made prior to the Cut-off Date
          have been consolidated with the outstanding principal amount secured
          by the Mortgage, and the secured principal amount, as consolidated,
          bears a single interest rate and single repayment term reflected on
          the Mortgage Loan Schedule. The consolidated principal amount does
          not exceed the original principal amount of the Mortgage Loan. The
          Mortgage Note does not permit or obligate the Master Servicer to
          make future advances to the Mortgagor at the option of the
          Mortgagor.

               (xlix) All taxes, governmental assessments, insurance premiums,
          water, sewer and municipal charges, leasehold payments or ground
          rents that previously became due and owing have been paid, or an
          escrow of funds has been established in an amount sufficient to pay
          for every such item that remains unpaid and that has been


                                       65
<PAGE>


          assessed, but is not yet due and payable. Except for (A) payments in
          the nature of escrow payments, and (B) interest accruing from the
          date of the Mortgage Note or date of disbursement of the Mortgage
          proceeds, whichever is later, to the day that precedes by one month
          the Due Date of the first installment of principal and interest,
          including without limitation, taxes and insurance payments, the
          Master Servicer has not advanced funds, or induced, solicited or
          knowingly received any advance of funds by a party other than the
          Mortgagor, directly or indirectly, for the payment of any amount
          required by the Mortgage.

               (l) The Mortgage Loans originated by the Seller were
          underwritten in all material respects in accordance with the
          Seller's underwriting guidelines for credit blemished quality
          mortgage loans or, with respect to Mortgage Loans purchased by the
          Seller were underwritten in all material respects in accordance with
          customary and prudent underwriting guidelines generally used by
          originators of credit blemished quality mortgage loans.

               (li) Prior to the approval of the Mortgage Loan application, an
          appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property was obtained from a
          qualified appraiser, duly appointed by the originator, who had no
          interest, direct or indirect, in the Mortgaged Property or in any
          loan made on the security thereof, and whose compensation is not
          affected by the approval or disapproval of the Mortgage Loan; such
          appraisal is in a form acceptable to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

               (lii) None of the Mortgage Loans is a graduated payment
          mortgage loan or a growing equity mortgage loan, and no Mortgage
          Loan is subject to a buydown or similar arrangement.

               (liii) The Mortgage Rates borne by the Initial Mortgage Loans
          in Loan Group 1 as of the Cut-off Date ranged from 5.50% per annum
          to 17.38% per annum and the weighted average Mortgage Rate as of the
          Cut-off Date was 7.52% per annum. The Mortgage Rates borne by the
          Initial Mortgage Loans in Loan Group 2 as of the Cut-off Date ranged
          from 5.25% per annum to 15.88% per annum and the weighted average
          Mortgage Rate as of the Cut-off Date was 7.55% per annum.

               (liv) [Reserved]

               (lv) The Mortgage Loans were selected from among the
          outstanding one- to four-family mortgage loans in the Master
          Servicer's portfolio at the Closing Date as to which the
          representations and warranties made as to the Mortgage Loans set
          forth in this Section 2.03(b) can be made. No selection was made in
          a manner that would adversely affect the interests of
          Certificateholders.

               (lvi) The Gross Margins on the Adjustable Rate Initial Mortgage
          Loans in Loan Group 1 range from approximately 3.875% to 12.500%,
          and the weighted average Gross Margin was approximately 6.557%.

               (lvii) Except for 875 Initial Mortgage Loans in Loan Group 1
          representing approximately 69.23% (by Stated Principal Balance) of
          the Group 1


                                      66
<PAGE>


          Mortgage Loans, each Initial Mortgage Loan has a Due Date on or
          before the last day of the first Due Period. Except for 363 Initial
          Mortgage Loan in Loan Group 2 representing approximately 63.95% (by
          Stated Principal Balance) of the Group 2 Mortgage Loans, each
          Initial Mortgage Loan has a Due Date on or before the last day of
          the first Due Period.

               (lviii) The Mortgage Loans, individually and in the aggregate,
          conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the
          Prospectus Supplement.

               (lix) [Reserved]

               (lx) There is no obligation on the part of the Seller under the
          terms of the Mortgage or related Mortgage Note to make payments in
          addition to those made by the Mortgagor.

               (lxi) Any leasehold estate securing a Mortgage Loan has a term
          of not less than five years in excess of the term of the related
          Mortgage Loan.

               (lxii) [Reserved]

               (lxiii) Each Mortgage Loan represents a "qualified mortgage"
          within the meaning of section 860(a)(3) of the Code (but without
          regard to the rule in Treasury Regulation ss. 1.860G-2(f)(2) that
          treats a defective obligation as a qualified mortgage, or any
          substantially similar successor provision) and applicable Treasury
          regulations promulgated thereunder.

               (lxiv) No Mortgage Loan was either a "consumer credit contract"
          or a "purchase money loan" as such terms are defined in 16 C.F.R.
          ss. 433 nor is any Mortgage Loan a "mortgage" as defined in 15
          U.S.C. ss. 1602(aa). (lxv) [Reserved]

               (lxvi) To the extent required under applicable law, each
          originator and subsequent mortgagee or servicer of the Mortgage Loan
          complied with all licensing requirements and was authorized to
          transact and do business in the jurisdiction in which the related
          Mortgaged Property is located at all times when it held or serviced
          the Mortgage Loan. Any and all requirements of any federal, state or
          local laws or regulations, including, without limitation, usury,
          truth-in-lending, real estate settlement procedures, consumer credit
          protection, anti-predatory lending, fair credit reporting, unfair
          collection practice, equal credit opportunity, fair housing and
          disclosure laws and regulations, applicable to the solicitation,
          origination, collection and servicing of such Mortgage Loan have
          been complied with in all material respects; and any obligations of
          the holder of the Mortgage Note, Mortgage and other loan documents
          have been complied with in all material respects; servicing of each
          Mortgage Loan has been in accordance with prudent mortgage servicing
          standards, any applicable laws, rules and regulations and in
          accordance with the terms of the Mortgage Notes, Mortgage and other
          loan documents, whether such origination and servicing was done by
          Seller, its affiliates,


                                      67
<PAGE>


          or any third party which originated the Mortgage Loan on behalf of,
          or sold the Mortgage Loan to, any of them, or any servicing agent of
          any of the foregoing;

               (lxvii) No borrower was encouraged or required to select a
          Mortgage Loan product offered by the Mortgage Loan's originator
          which is a higher cost product designed for less creditworthy
          borrowers, unless at the time of the Mortgage Loan's origination,
          such borrower did not qualify taking into account credit history and
          debt-to-income ratios for a lower-cost credit product then offered
          by the Mortgage Loan's originator or any affiliate of the Mortgage
          Loan's originator. If, at the time of loan application, the borrower
          may have qualified for a for a lower-cost credit product then
          offered by any mortgage lending affiliate of the Mortgage Loan's
          originator, the Mortgage Loan's originator referred the borrower's
          application to such affiliate for underwriting consideration;

               (lxviii) The methodology used in underwriting the extension of
          credit for the each Mortgage Loan employs objective mathematical
          principles which relate the borrower's income, assets and
          liabilities to the proposed payment and such underwriting
          methodology does not rely on the extent of the borrower's equity in
          the collateral as the principal determining factor in approving such
          credit extension. Such underwriting methodology confirmed that at
          the time of origination (application/approval) the borrower had a
          reasonable ability to make timely payments on the Mortgage Loan;

               (lxix) With respect to any Mortgage Loan that contains a
          provision permitting imposition of a premium upon a prepayment prior
          to maturity: (i) prior to the loan's origination, the borrower
          agreed to such premium in exchange for a monetary benefit, including
          but not limited to a rate or fee reduction, (ii) prior to the loan's
          origination, the borrower was offered the choice of another mortgage
          product that did not require payment of such a premium, (iii) the
          prepayment premium is disclosed to the borrower in the loan
          documents pursuant to applicable state and federal law, and (iv)
          notwithstanding any state or federal law to the contrary, Servicer
          shall not impose such prepayment premium in any instance when the
          mortgage debt is accelerated as the result of the borrower's default
          in making the loan payments;

               (lxx) No borrower was required to purchase any credit life,
          disability, accident or health insurance product as a condition of
          obtaining the extension of credit. No borrower obtained a prepaid
          single-premium credit life, disability, accident or health insurance
          policy in connection with the origination of the Mortgage Loan;

               (lxxi) No Mortgage Loan is subject to the Home Ownership and
          Equity Protection Act of 1994 (15 USC ss. 1602(aa)), Regulation Z
          (12 CFR 226.32) or any similar state law or regulation including
          those relating to "high cost mortgages" and "high LTV mortgages";

               (lxxii) All points and fees related to each Mortgage Loan were
          disclosed in writing to the borrower in accordance with applicable
          state and federal law. Except in the case of a Mortgage Loan in an
          original principal amount of less than $60,000 which would have
          resulted in an unprofitable origination, no borrower was


                                      68
<PAGE>


          charged "points and fees" (whether or not financed) in an amount
          greater than 5% of the principal amount of such loan; and

               (lxxiii) All fees and charges (including finance charges) and
          whether or not financed, assessed, collected or to be collected in
          connection with the origination and servicing of each Mortgage Loan
          has been disclosed in writing to the borrower in accordance with
          applicable state and federal law and regulation.

               (lxxiv) No Mortgage Loan is subject to the City of Oakland
          Anti-Predatory Lending Ordinance (i.e. the Oakland Residential
          Lending Ordinance No. 12361 C.M.S., the amendment No. 12362 C.M.S.
          to Oakland's Linked Banking Services Ordinance and Resolution 01-62
          of the Oakland Redevelopment Agency, collectively the "Oakland
          Ordinance") except as identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule. Any
          Mortgage Loan subject to the Oakland Ordinance is in compliance with
          the provisions of the Oakland Ordinance.

               (lxxv) No predatory or deceptive lending practices, including
          but not limited to, the extension of credit to the Mortgagor without
          regard for the Mortgagor's ability to repay the Mortgage Loan and
          the extension of credit to the Mortgagor which has no apparent
          benefit to the Mortgagor, were employed by the originator of the
          Mortgage Loan in connection with the origination of the Mortgage
          Loan.

               (lxxvi) If the Mortgage Loan provides that the interest rate on
          the principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan may be adjusted,
          all of the terms of the related Mortgage pertaining to interest rate
          adjustments, payment adjustments and adjustments of the outstanding
          principal balance have been made in accordance with the terms of the
          related Mortgage Note and applicable law and are enforceable and
          such adjustments will not affect the priority of the Mortgage lien.

               (lxxvii) The Mortgaged Property complies with all applicable
          laws, rules and regulations relating to environmental matters,
          including but not limited to those relating to radon, asbestos and
          lead paint and neither the Seller nor, to the Seller's knowledge,
          the Mortgagor, has received any notice of any violation or potential
          violation of such law.

               (lxxviii)There is no action, suit or proceeding pending, or to
          the best of Seller's knowledge, threatened or likely to be asserted
          with respect to the Mortgage Loan against or affecting Seller before
          or by any court, administrative agency, arbitrator or governmental
          body.

               (lxxix) No action, inaction, or event has occurred and no state
          of fact exists or has existed that has resulted or will result in
          the exclusion from, denial of, or defense to coverage under any
          applicable hazard insurance policy, irrespective of the cause of
          such failure of coverage. In connection with the placement of any
          such insurance, no commission, fee, or other compensation has been
          or will be received by Seller or any designee of Seller or any
          corporation in which Seller or any officer, director, or employee
          had a financial interest at the time of placement of such insurance.

               (lxxx) Each Mortgage Loan has a fully assignable life of loan
          tax service contract which may be assigned without the payment of
          any fee.

               (lxxxi) No Mortgagor has notified the Seller, and the Seller
          has no knowledge, of any relief requested or allowed to a Mortgagor
          under the Relief Act.

               (lxxxii) No Mortgage Loan is a "high cost home loan" as defined
          in the Georgia Fair Lending Act, as amended (the "Georgia Act"), and
          all of the Mortgage Loans that are subject to the Georgia Act comply
          with the requirements of such act.

In addition to the foregoing representations and warranties, the Seller hereby
represents and warrants to the Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Trustee
that as of the Closing Date, each Mortgage Loan is in compliance with
applicable federal and state laws and regulations.

          (c) Upon discovery by any of the parties hereto of a breach of a
representation or warranty set forth in Section 2.03(a) or (b) that materially
and adversely affects the interests of the Certificateholders in any Mortgage
Loan, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt notice thereof to
the other parties and the NIM Insurer. Each of the Master Servicer and the
Seller (each, a "Representing Party") hereby covenants with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.03(a) and (b) that
within 90 days of the earlier of the discovery by such Representing Party or
receipt of written notice by such Representing Party from any party of a
breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein made that materially
and adversely affects the interests of the Certificateholders in any Mortgage
Loan, it shall cure such breach in all material respects and, if such breach
is not so cured, shall, (i) if such 90-day period expires prior to the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, remove such Mortgage Loan (a "Deleted
Mortgage Loan") from the Trust Fund and substitute in its place a Replacement
Mortgage Loan, in the manner and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Section; or (ii) repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan or Mortgage Loans from
the Trustee at the Purchase Price in the manner set forth below; provided that
any such substitution pursuant to (i) above or repurchase pursuant to (ii)
above shall not be effected prior to the delivery to the Trustee of the
Opinion of Counsel required by Section 2.05 hereof and any such substitution
pursuant to (i) above shall not be effected prior to the additional delivery
to the Trustee of a Request for Release substantially in the form of Exhibit
M. Any Representing Party liable for a breach under this Section 2.03 shall
promptly reimburse the Master Servicer or the Trustee for any expenses
reasonably incurred by the Master Servicer or the Trustee in respect of
enforcing the remedies for such breach. To enable the Master Servicer to amend
the Mortgage Loan Schedule, any Representing Party liable for a breach under
this Section 2.03 shall, unless it cures such breach in a timely fashion
pursuant to this Section 2.03, promptly notify the Master Servicer whether
such Representing Party intends either to repurchase, or to substitute for,
the Mortgage Loan affected by such breach. With respect to the representations
and warranties described in this Section that are made to the best of the
Representing Party's knowledge, if it is discovered by any of the Depositor,
the Master Servicer, the Seller or the Trustee that the substance of such
representation and warranty is inaccurate and such inaccuracy materially and
adversely affects the value of the related Mortgage Loan, notwithstanding the
Representing Party's lack of knowledge with respect to the substance of such
representation or warranty, such inaccuracy shall be deemed a breach of the
applicable representation or warranty.

          With respect to any Replacement Mortgage Loan or Loans, the Seller
delivering such Replacement Mortgage Loan shall deliver to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Certificateholders the related Mortgage Note, Mortgage and
assignment of the Mortgage, and such other documents and agreements as are
required by Section 2.01, with the Mortgage Note endorsed and the Mortgage
assigned as required by Section 2.01. No substitution will be made in any
calendar month after the Determination Date for such month. Scheduled Payments
due with respect to Replacement Mortgage Loans in the Due Period related to
the Distribution Date on which such proceeds are to be distributed shall not
be part of the Trust Fund and will be retained by the Seller delivering such
Replacement Loan on such Distribution Date. For the month of substitution,
distributions to Certificateholders will include the Scheduled Payment due on
any Deleted Mortgage Loan for the related Due Period and thereafter the Seller
shall be entitled to retain all amounts received in respect of such Deleted
Mortgage Loan. The Master Servicer shall amend the Mortgage Loan Schedule for
the benefit of the Certificateholders to reflect the removal of such Deleted
Mortgage Loan and the substitution of the Replacement Mortgage Loan or Loans
and the Master Servicer shall deliver the amended Mortgage Loan Schedule to
the Trustee. Upon such substitution, the Replacement Mortgage Loan or Loans
shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement in all respects, and the
Seller delivering such Replacement Mortgage Loan shall be deemed to have made
with respect to such Replacement Mortgage Loan or Loans, as of the date of
substitution, the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.03(b)
with respect to such Mortgage Loan. Upon any such substitution and the deposit
to the Certificate Account of the amount required to be deposited therein in
connection with such substitution as described in the following paragraph, the
Co-Trustee shall release to the Representing Party the Mortgage File relating
to such Deleted Mortgage Loan and held for the benefit of the
Certificateholders and shall execute and deliver at the Master Servicer's
direction such instruments of transfer or assignment as have been prepared by
the Master Servicer, in each case without recourse, as shall be necessary to
vest in the Seller, or its respective designee, title to the Trustee's
interest in any Deleted Mortgage Loan substituted for pursuant to this Section
2.03.

          For any month in which the Seller substitutes one or more
Replacement Mortgage Loans for one or more Deleted Mortgage Loans, the Master
Servicer will determine the amount (if any) by which the aggregate principal
balance of all such Replacement Mortgage Loans as of the date of substitution
is less than the Stated Principal Balance (after application of the principal
portion of the Scheduled Payment due (in the case of Actuarial Mortgage Loans)
in the month of substitution) of all such Deleted Mortgage Loans. An amount
equal to the aggregate of the deficiencies described in the preceding sentence
(such amount, the "Substitution Adjustment Amount") shall be forwarded by the
Seller to the Master Servicer and deposited by the Master Servicer into the
Certificate Account not later than the Determination Date for the Distribution
Date relating to the Prepayment Period during which the related Mortgage Loan
became required to be purchased or replaced hereunder.

          In the event that a Seller shall have repurchased a Mortgage Loan,
the Purchase Price therefor shall be deposited in the Certificate Account
pursuant to Section 3.05 on the Determination Date for the Distribution Date
in the month following the month during which such Seller became obligated to
repurchase or replace such Mortgage Loan and upon such deposit of the Purchase
Price, the delivery of the Opinion of Counsel required by Section 2.05, if
any, and the receipt of a Request for Release in the form of Exhibit N hereto,
the Co-Trustee


                                      71
<PAGE>


shall release the related Mortgage File held for the benefit of the
Certificateholders to such Seller, and the Trustee shall execute and deliver
at such Person's direction the related instruments of transfer or assignment
prepared by such Seller, in each case without recourse, as shall be necessary
to transfer title from the Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders
and transfer the Trustee's interest to such Seller to any Mortgage Loan
purchased pursuant to this Section 2.03. It is understood and agreed that the
obligation under this Agreement of the Seller to cure, repurchase or replace
any Mortgage Loan as to which a breach has occurred and is continuing shall
constitute the sole remedy against the Seller respecting such breach available
to Certificateholders, the Depositor or the Trustee.

          (d) The representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.03
hereof shall survive delivery of the respective Mortgage Files to the
Co-Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders.

          Section 2.04 Representations and Warranties of the Depositor.

          The Depositor hereby represents and warrants to the Master Servicer
and the Trustee as follows, as of the date hereof and as of each Subsequent
Transfer Date:

               (i) The Depositor is duly organized and is validly existing as
          a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of
          Delaware and has full power and authority (corporate and other)
          necessary to own or hold its properties and to conduct its business
          as now conducted by it and to enter into and perform its obligations
          under this Agreement and each Subsequent Transfer Agreement.

               (ii) The Depositor has the full corporate power and authority
          to execute, deliver and perform, and to enter into and consummate
          the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement and each Subsequent
          Transfer Agreement and has duly authorized, by all necessary
          corporate action on its part, the execution, delivery and
          performance of this Agreement and each Subsequent Transfer
          Agreement; and this Agreement and each Subsequent Transfer
          Agreement, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
          hereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and
          binding obligation of the Depositor, enforceable against the
          Depositor in accordance with its terms, subject, as to
          enforceability, to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
          moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights
          generally and (ii) general principles of equity, regardless of
          whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law.

               (iii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and each
          Subsequent Transfer Agreement by the Depositor, the consummation of
          the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Subsequent
          Transfer Agreement, and the fulfillment of or compliance with the
          terms hereof and thereof are in the ordinary course of business of
          the Depositor and will not (A) result in a material breach of any
          term or provision of the charter or by-laws of the Depositor or (B)
          materially conflict with, result in a material breach, violation or
          acceleration of, or result in a material default under, the terms of
          any other material agreement or instrument to which the Depositor is
          a party or by which it may be bound or (C) constitute a material
          violation of any statute, order or


                                      72
<PAGE>


          regulation applicable to the Depositor of any court, regulatory
          body, administrative agency or governmental body having jurisdiction
          over the Depositor; and the Depositor is not in breach or violation
          of any material indenture or other material agreement or instrument,
          or in violation of any statute, order or regulation of any court,
          regulatory body, administrative agency or governmental body having
          jurisdiction over it which breach or violation may materially impair
          the Depositor's ability to perform or meet any of its obligations
          under this Agreement and each Subsequent Transfer Agreement.

               (iv) No litigation is pending, or, to the best of the
          Depositor's knowledge, threatened, against the Depositor that would
          materially and adversely affect the execution, delivery or
          enforceability of this Agreement or any Subsequent Transfer
          Agreement or the ability of the Depositor to perform its obligations
          under this Agreement or any Subsequent Transfer Agreement in
          accordance with the terms hereof.

               (v) No consent, approval, authorization or order of any court
          or governmental agency or body is required for the execution,
          delivery and performance by the Depositor of, or compliance by the
          Depositor with, this Agreement or any Subsequent Tranfer Agreement
          or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or if
          any such consent, approval, authorization or order is required, the
          Depositor has obtained the same.

          The Depositor hereby represents and warrants to the Trustee with
respect to each Mortgage Loan as of the Closing Date or the related Subsequent
Transfer Date, as applicable, and following the transfer of the Mortgage Loans
to it by the Seller, the Depositor had good title to the Initial Mortgage
Loans or related Subsequent Mortgage Loans, as applicable, and the related
Mortgage Notes were subject to no offsets, claims, defenses or counterclaims.

          It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties
set forth in the two immediately preceding paragraphs shall survive delivery
of the Mortgage Files to the Co-Trustee. Upon discovery by the Depositor or
the Trustee of a breach of any of the foregoing representations and warranties
set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph (referred to herein as a
"breach"), which breach materially and adversely affects the interest of the
Certificateholders, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt
written notice to the others and to the NIM Insurer and each Rating Agency.
The Depositor hereby covenants with respect to the representations and
warranties made by it in this Section 2.04 that within 90 days of the earlier
of the discovery it or receipt of written notice by it from any party of a
breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein made that materially
and adversely affects the interests of the Certificateholders in any Mortgage
Loan, it shall cure such breach in all material respects and, if such breach
is not so cured, shall repurchase or replace the affected Mortgage Loan or
Loans in accordance with the procedure set forth in Section 2.03(c).

          Section 2.05 Delivery of Opinion of Counsel in Connection with
                       Substitutions and Repurchases.

          (a) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, with
respect to any Mortgage Loan that is not in default or as to which default is
not imminent, no repurchase or substitution pursuant to Sections 2.02, 2.03 or
2.04 shall be made unless the Representing Party


                                      73
<PAGE>


making such repurchase or substitution delivers to the Trustee, an Opinion of
Counsel, addressed to the Trustee, to the effect that such repurchase or
substitution would not (i) result in the imposition of the tax on "prohibited
transactions" of the Trust Fund or contributions after the Closing Date, as
defined in sections 860F(a)(2) and 860G(d) of the Code, respectively or (ii)
cause the any REMIC formed hereunder to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time
that any Certificates are outstanding. Any Mortgage Loan as to which
repurchase or substitution was delayed pursuant to this paragraph shall be
repurchased or the substitution therefor shall occur (subject to compliance
with Sections 2.02, 2.03 or 2.04) upon the earlier of (a) the occurrence of a
default or imminent default with respect to such loan and (b) receipt by the
Trustee, of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such repurchase or
substitution, as applicable, will not result in the events described in clause
(i) or clause (ii) of the preceding sentence.

          (b) Upon discovery by the Depositor, the Seller, the Master Servicer
or the Trustee that any Mortgage Loan does not constitute a "qualified
mortgage" within the meaning of section 860G(a)(3) of the Code, the party
discovering such fact shall promptly (and in any event within 5 Business Days
of discovery) give written notice thereof to the other parties and the NIM
Insurer. In connection therewith, the Trustee shall require the Seller, at the
Seller's option, to either (i) substitute, if the conditions in Section
2.03(c) with respect to substitutions are satisfied, a Replacement Mortgage
Loan for the affected Mortgage Loan, or (ii) repurchase the affected Mortgage
Loan within 90 days of such discovery in the same manner as it would a
Mortgage Loan for a breach of representation or warranty contained in Section
2.03. The Trustee shall reconvey to the Seller the Mortgage Loan to be
released pursuant hereto in the same manner, and on the same terms and
conditions, as it would a Mortgage Loan repurchased for breach of a
representation or warranty contained in Section 2.03.

          Section 2.06 Authentication and Delivery of Certificates.

          The Trustee acknowledges the transfer and assignment to it of the
Trust Fund and, concurrently with such transfer and assignment, has executed,
authenticated and delivered, to or upon the order of the Depositor, the
Certificates in authorized denominations evidencing the entire ownership of
the Trust Fund. The Trustee agrees to hold the Trust Fund and exercise the
rights referred to above for the benefit of all present and future Holders of
the Certificates and to perform the duties set forth in this Agreement to the
best of its ability, to the end that the interests of the Holders of the
Certificates may be adequately and effectively protected.

          Section 2.07 Covenants of the Master Servicer.

          The Master Servicer hereby covenants to the Depositor and the
Trustee as follows:

          (a) the Master Servicer shall comply in the performance of its
obligations under this Agreement with all reasonable rules and requirements of
the insurer under each Required Insurance Policy; and

          (b) no written information, certificate of an officer, statement
furnished in writing or written report delivered to the Depositor, any
affiliate of the Depositor or the Trustee and prepared by the Master Servicer
pursuant to this Agreement will contain any untrue


                                      74
<PAGE>


statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the information, certificate, statement or report not misleading.

          Section 2.08 [Reserved]

                                 ARTICLE III.
                ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF MORTGAGE LOANS

          Section 3.01 Master Servicer to Service Mortgage Loans.

          For and on behalf of the Certificateholders, the Master Servicer
shall service and administer the Mortgage Loans in accordance with customary
and usual standards of practice of prudent mortgage loan lenders in the
respective states in which the Mortgaged Properties are located, including
taking all required and appropriate actions under the Mortgage Insurance
Policy on behalf of the Co-Trustee, other than the payment of the Mortgage
Insurance Premium and obtaining the approval of the Mortgage Insurer with
respect to the appointment of a successor servicer. In connection with such
servicing and administration, the Master Servicer shall have full power and
authority, acting alone and/or through subservicers as provided in Section
3.02 hereof, subject to the terms hereof (i) to execute and deliver, on behalf
of the Certificateholders and the Trustee, customary consents or waivers and
other instruments and documents, (ii) to consent to transfers of any Mortgaged
Property and assumptions of the Mortgage Notes and related Mortgages (but only
in the manner provided in this Agreement), (iii) to collect any Insurance
Proceeds and other Liquidation Proceeds, and (iv) subject to Section 3.12(a),
to effectuate foreclosure or other conversion of the ownership of the
Mortgaged Property securing any Mortgage Loan; provided that the Master
Servicer shall take no action that is inconsistent with or prejudices the
interests of the Trustee or the Certificateholders in any Mortgage Loan or the
rights and interests of the Depositor and the Trustee under this Agreement.
The Master Servicer shall represent and protect the interest of the Trustee in
the same manner as it currently protects its own interest in mortgage loans in
its own portfolio in any claim, proceeding or litigation regarding a Mortgage
Loan and shall not make or permit any modification, waiver or amendment of any
term of any Mortgage Loan which would (i) cause any REMIC formed hereunder to
fail to qualify as a REMIC, (ii) result in the imposition of any tax under
section 860(a) or 860(d) of the Code or (iii) cause any Covered Mortgage Loan
to not be covered by the Mortgage Insurance Policy unless the Loan-to-Value
Ratio is 60% or less, but in any case the Master Servicer shall not act in any
manner that is a lesser standard than that provided in the first sentence of
this Section 3.01. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Master Servicer, in its own name or in the name of the Depositor and the
Trustee, is hereby authorized and empowered by the Depositor and the Trustee,
when the Master Servicer believes it appropriate in its reasonable judgment,
to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Trustee, the Depositor, the
Certificateholders or any of them, any and all instruments of satisfaction or
cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge and all other
comparable instruments, with respect to the Mortgage Loans, and with respect
to the Mortgaged Properties held for the benefit of the Certificateholders.
The Master Servicer shall prepare and deliver to the Depositor and/or the
Trustee such documents requiring execution and delivery by any or all of them
as are necessary or appropriate to enable the Master Servicer to service and
administer the Mortgage Loans. Upon receipt of such documents, the Depositor
and/or the Trustee shall execute such documents and deliver them to the Master
Servicer. The Master Servicer further is


                                      75
<PAGE>


authorized and empowered by the Trustee, on behalf of the Certificateholders
and the Trustee, in its own name or in the name of the Subservicer, when the
Master Servicer or the Subservicer, as the case may be, believes it
appropriate in its best judgment to register any Mortgage Loan on the MERS(R)
System, or cause the removal from the registration of any Mortgage Loan on the
MERS(R) System, to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Trustee and the
Certificateholders or any of them, any and all instruments of assignment and
other comparable instruments with respect to such assignment or re-recording
of a Mortgage in the name of MERS, solely as nominee for the Trustee and its
successors and assigns.

          In accordance with the standards of the preceding paragraph, the
Master Servicer shall advance or cause to be advanced funds as necessary for
the purpose of effecting the payment of taxes and assessments on the Mortgaged
Properties, which advances shall be reimbursable in the first instance from
related collections from the Mortgagors pursuant to Section 3.06, and further
as provided in Section 3.08. All costs incurred by the Master Servicer, if
any, in effecting the timely payments of taxes and assessments on the
Mortgaged Properties and related insurance premiums shall not, for the purpose
of calculating monthly distributions to the Certificateholders, be added to
the Stated Principal Balance under the related Mortgage Loans, notwithstanding
that the terms of such Mortgage Loans so permit.

          The Master Servicer shall deliver a list of Servicing Officers to
the Trustee by the Closing Date.

          In addition, the Master Servicer shall administer the Mortgage
Insurance Policy on behalf of itself, the Seller, the Depositor, and the
Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders, when it is necessary to
make claims and receive payments under the Mortgage Insurance Policy. In
connection with its activities as Master Servicer of the Mortgage Loans, the
Master Servicer agrees to present, on behalf of itself, the Trustee and the
Certificateholders, claims to the insurer under any primary insurance policies
and, in this regard, to take any reasonable action necessary to permit
recovery under any primary insurance policies respecting defaulted Mortgage
Loans. Any amounts collected by the Master Servicer under any primary
insurance policies shall be deposited in the Certificate Account.

          In the event that a shortfall in any collection on or liability with
respect to any Mortgage Loan results from or is attributable to adjustments to
Mortgage Rates, Monthly Payments or Stated Principal Balances that were made
by the Master Servicer in a manner not consistent with the terms of the
related Mortgage Note and this Agreement, the Master Servicer, upon discovery
or receipt of notice thereof, immediately shall deliver to the Trustee for
deposit in the Distribution Account from its own funds the amount of any such
shortfall and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trust Fund, the Trustee,
the Depositor and any successor master servicer in respect of any such
liability. Such indemnities shall survive the termination or discharge of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 3.01 shall not limit
the ability of the Master Servicer to seek recovery of any such amounts from
the related Mortgagor under the terms of the related Mortgage Note, as
permitted by law and shall not be an expense of the Trust.

          Section 3.02 Subservicing; Enforcement of the Obligations of Master
                       Servicer.

          (a) The Master Servicer may arrange for the subservicing of any
Mortgage Loan by a subservicer (each, a "Subservicer") pursuant to a
subservicing agreement (each, a "Subservicing Agreement"); provided that (i)
such subservicing arrangement and the terms of the related subservicing
agreement must provide for the servicing of such Mortgage Loans in a manner
consistent with the servicing arrangements contemplated hereunder and (ii)
that such subservicing agreements would not result in a withdrawal or a
downgrading by any Rating Agency of the ratings on any Class of Certificates,
as evidenced by a letter to that effect delivered by each Rating Agency to the
Depositor and the NIM Insurer and (iii) the NIM Insurer shall have consented
to such subservicing agreements (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) with Subservicers, for the servicing and administration of the
Mortgage Loans. The Master Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee copies of all
Sub-Servicing Agreements, and any amendments or modifications thereof,
promptly upon the Master Servicer's execution and delivery of such
instruments. The Master Servicer shall be entitled to terminate any
Subservicing Agreement and the rights and obligations of any Subservicer
pursuant to any Subservicing Agreement in accordance with the terms and
conditions of such Subservicing Agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of
any subservicing agreement, any of the provisions of this Agreement relating
to agreements or arrangements between the Master Servicer or a subservicer or
reference to actions taken through a Master Servicer or otherwise, the Master
Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to the Depositor, the Trustee and
the Certificateholders for the servicing and administration of the Mortgage
Loans in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement without diminution
of such obligation or liability by virtue of such subservicing agreements or
arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from the subservicer and to the
same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Master Servicer
alone were servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans. Every subservicing
agreement entered into by the Master Servicer shall contain a provision giving
the successor Master Servicer the option to terminate such agreement in the
event a successor Master Servicer is appointed. All actions of each
subservicer performed pursuant to the related subservicing agreement shall be
performed as an agent of the Master Servicer with the same force and effect as
if performed directly by the Master Servicer.

          (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the Master Servicer shall be
deemed to have received any collections, recoveries or payments with respect
to the Mortgage Loans that are received by a subservicer regardless of whether
such payments are remitted by the subservicer to the Master Servicer.

          (c) Any subservicing arrangement that may be entered into and any
other transactions or services relating to the Mortgage Loans involving a
Subservicer in its capacity as such shall be deemed to be solely between the
Subservicer and the Master Servicer alone, and the Trustee and
Certificateholders shall not be deemed parties thereto and shall have no
claims, rights, obligations, duties, or liabilities with respect to the
Subservicer in its capacity as such except as stated in Section 3.04.

          (d) [Reserved]

          Section 3.03 Rights of the Depositor, the Seller, the
                       Certificateholders, the NIM Insurer and the Trustee in
                       Respect of the Master Servicer.

          None of the Trustee, the Seller, the Certificateholders, the NIM
Insurer or the Depositor shall have any responsibility or liability for any
action or failure to act by the Master Servicer, and none of them is obligated
to supervise the performance of the Master Servicer hereunder or otherwise.
The Master Servicer shall afford (and any Subservicing Agreement shall provide
that each Subservicer shall afford) the Depositor, the NIM Insurer and the
Trustee, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours, access to all
records maintained by the Master Servicer (and any such Subservicer) in
respect of the Master Servicer's rights and obligations hereunder and access
to officers of the Master Servicer (and those of any such Subservicer)
responsible for such obligations. Upon request, the Master Servicer shall
furnish to the Depositor, the NIM Insurer and the Trustee its (and any such
Subservicer's) most recent financial statements and such other information
relating to the Master Servicer's capacity to perform its obligations under
this Agreement that it possesses. To the extent such information is not
otherwise available to the public, the Depositor, the NIM Insurer and the
Trustee shall not disseminate any information obtained pursuant to the
preceding two sentences without the Masters Servicer's (or any such
Subservicer's) written consent, except as required pursuant to this Agreement
or to the extent that it is necessary to do so (i) in working with legal
counsel, auditors, taxing authorities or other governmental agencies, rating
agencies or reinsurers or (ii) pursuant to any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental authority
having jurisdiction over the Depositor, the Trustee, the NIM Insurer or the
Trust Fund, and in either case, the Depositor, the NIM Insurer or the Trustee,
as the case may be, shall use its best efforts to assure the confidentiality
of any such disseminated non-public information. The Depositor may, but is not
obligated to, enforce the obligations of the Master Servicer under this
Agreement and may, but is not obligated to, perform, or cause a designee to
perform, any defaulted obligation of the Master Servicer under this Agreement
or exercise the rights of the Master Servicer under this Agreement; provided
by virtue of such performance by the Depositor of its designee. The Depositor
shall not have any responsibility or liability for any action or failure to
act by the Master Servicer and is not obligated to supervise the performance
of the Master Servicer under this Agreement or otherwise.

          Section 3.04 Trustee to Act as Master Servicer.

          In the event that the Master Servicer shall for any reason no longer
be the Master Servicer hereunder (including by reason of an Event of Default),
the Trustee or its designee shall thereupon assume all of the rights and
obligations of the Master Servicer hereunder arising thereafter (except that
the Trustee shall not be (i) liable for losses of the Master Servicer pursuant
to Section 3.10 hereof or any acts or omissions of the predecessor Master
Servicer hereunder, (ii) obligated to make Advances if it is prohibited from
doing so by applicable law, (iii) obligated to effectuate repurchases or
substitutions of Mortgage Loans hereunder, including pursuant to Section 2.02
or 2.03 hereof, (iv) responsible for expenses of the Master Servicer pursuant
to Section 2.03 or (v) deemed to have made any representations and warranties
hereunder, including pursuant to Section 2.03 or the first paragraph of
Section 6.02 hereof). If the Master Servicer shall for any reason no longer be
the Master Servicer (including by reason of any Event of Default), the Trustee
(or any other successor servicer) may, at its option, succeed to any rights
and obligations of the Master Servicer under any subservicing agreement in
accordance with the


                                      78
<PAGE>


terms thereof; provided that the Trustee (or any other successor servicer)
shall not incur any liability or have any obligations in its capacity as
servicer under a subservicing agreement arising prior to the date of such
succession unless it expressly elects to succeed to the rights and obligations
of the Master Servicer thereunder; and the Master Servicer shall not thereby
be relieved of any liability or obligations under the subservicing agreement
arising prior to the date of such succession.

          The Master Servicer shall, upon request of the Trustee, but at the
expense of the Master Servicer, deliver to the assuming party all documents
and records relating to each subservicing agreement and the Mortgage Loans
then being serviced thereunder and an accounting of amounts collected held by
it and otherwise use its best efforts to effect the orderly and efficient
transfer of the subservicing agreement to the assuming party.

                       Account; Distribution Account; Pre-Funding Account;
                       Seller Shortfall Interest Requirement.

          (a) The Master Servicer shall make reasonable efforts in accordance
with customary and usual standards of practice of prudent mortgage lenders in
the respective states in which the Mortgaged Properties are located to collect
all payments called for under the terms and provisions of the Mortgage Loans
to the extent such procedures shall be consistent with this Agreement and the
terms and provisions of any related Required Insurance Policy. Consistent with
the foregoing, the Master Servicer may in its discretion (i) waive any late
payment charge or, subject to Section 3.20, any Prepayment Charge or penalty
interest in connection with the prepayment of a Mortgage Loan and (ii) extend
the due dates for payments due on a Mortgage Note for a period not greater
than 270 days. In the event of any such arrangement, the Master Servicer shall
make Advances on the related Mortgage Loan during the scheduled period in
accordance with the amortization schedule of such Mortgage Loan without
modification thereof by reason of such arrangements. In addition, the NIM
Insurer's prior written consent shall be required for any waiver of Prepayment
Charges or for the extension of the due dates for payments due on a Mortgage
Note, if the aggregate number of outstanding Mortgage Loans that have been
granted such waivers or extensions exceeds 5% of the aggregate number of
Initial Mortgage Loans and Subsequent Mortgage Loans. The Master Servicer
shall not be required to institute or join in litigation with respect to
collection of any payment (whether under a Mortgage, Mortgage Note or
otherwise or against any public or governmental authority with respect to a
taking or condemnation) if it reasonably believes that enforcing the provision
of the Mortgage or other instrument pursuant to which such payment is required
is prohibited by applicable law.

          (b) The Master Servicer shall establish and maintain a Certificate
Account into which the Master Servicer shall deposit or cause to be deposited
on a daily basis within two Business Days of receipt, except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, the following payments and collections remitted
by Subservicers or received by it in respect of Mortgage Loans subsequent to
the Cut-off Date (other than in respect of principal and interest due on the
Mortgage Loans before the Cut-off Date) and the following amounts required to
be deposited hereunder:


                                      79
<PAGE>


               (i) all payments on account of principal, including Principal
          Prepayments, on the Mortgage Loans;

               (ii) all payments on account of interest on the Mortgage Loans
          net of the related Servicing Fee permitted under Section 3.15 to the
          extent not previously paid to or withheld by the Master Servicer,
          other than interest accrued on the Mortgage Loans prior to the
          Cut-off Date, the Initial Certificate Account Deposit and any
          Subsequent Certificate Account Deposit;

               (iii) all Liquidation Proceeds, other than proceeds to be
          applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property or
          released to the Mortgagor in accordance with the Master Servicer's
          normal servicing procedures;

               (iv) all Compensating Interest;

               (v) any amount required to be deposited by the Master Servicer
          pursuant to Section 3.05(f) in connection with any losses on

               (x) any other amounts required to be deposited hereunder.

          The foregoing requirements for remittance by the Master Servicer
into the Certificate Account shall be exclusive, it being understood and
agreed that, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, payments in the
nature of late payment charges or assumption fees, if collected, need not be
remitted by the Master Servicer. In the event that the Master Servicer shall
remit any amount not required to be remitted and not otherwise subject to
withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.08 hereof, it may at any time withdraw or
direct the institution maintaining the Certificate Account, to withdraw such
amount from the Certificate Account, any provision herein to the contrary
notwithstanding. Such withdrawal or direction may be accomplished by

Certificate Account, that describes the amounts deposited in error in the
Certificate Account. The Master Servicer shall maintain adequate records with
respect to all withdrawals made pursuant to this Section. All funds deposited
in the Certificate Account shall be held in trust for the Certificateholders

          pursuant to the second paragraph of Section 3.08(a); and

               (ii) any amount required to be deposited by the Master Servicer
          pursuant to Section 3.05(f) in connection with any losses on
          Permitted Investments.

          The foregoing requirements for remittance by the Master Servicer and
deposit by the Trustee into the Distribution Account shall be exclusive. In
the event that the Master Servicer shall remit any amount not required to be
remitted and not otherwise subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.08
hereof, it may at any time direct the Trustee to withdraw such amount from the
Distribution Account, any provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
Such direction may be accomplished by delivering a written notice to the
Trustee that describes the amounts deposited in error in the Distribution
Account. All funds deposited in the Distribution Account shall be held by the
Trustee in trust for the Certificateholders until disbursed in accordance with
this Agreement or withdrawn in accordance with Section 3.08. In no event shall
the Trustee incur liability for withdrawals from the Distribution Account at
the direction of the Master Servicer.

          (d) The Trustee shall establish and maintain, on behalf of the
Certificateholders, the Pre-Funding Account. On the Closing Date the Seller

Pre-Funding Account.

          On the Business Day before the Distribution Date following the end
of the Funding Period, the Trustee shall (i) withdraw the amount on deposit in
the Pre-Funding Account (net of investment income), (ii) promptly deposit such
amount in the Distribution Account, and (iii) distribute each amount to the
Certificates on the Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.04.

          No later than 1:00 p.m. Pacific time on the Business Day prior to
the Master Servicer Advance Date in January, February, March and April 2003,
the Seller shall remit to the Master Servicer, and the Master Servicer shall
deposit in the Certificate Account, the Seller Shortfall Interest Requirement
(if any) for such Master Servicer Advance Date.

          (e) Each institution that maintains the Certificate Account, the
Distribution Account or the Pre-Funding Account shall invest the funds in each
such account, as directed by the Master Servicer, in Permitted Investments,
which shall mature not later than (x) in the case of the Certificate Account,
the second Business Day next preceding the related Distribution Account
Deposit Date (except that if such Permitted Investment is an obligation of the
institution that maintains such Certificate Account, then such Permitted
Investment shall mature not later than the Business Day next preceding such
Distribution Account Deposit Date) and (y) in the case of the Distribution
Account and the Pre-Funding Account, the Business Day immediately preceding
the first Distribution Date that follows the date of such investment (except
that if such Permitted Investment is an obligation of the institution that
maintains such Distribution Account or Pre-Funding Account, then such
Permitted Investment shall mature not later than such Distribution Date), in
each case, shall not be sold or disposed of prior to its maturity. All such
Permitted Investments shall be made in the name of the Trustee, for the
benefit of the Certificateholders. In the case of (i) the Certificate Account
and the Distribution Account, all


                                      81
<PAGE>


income and gain net of any losses realized from any such investment shall be
for the benefit of the Master Servicer as servicing compensation and shall be
remitted to it monthly as provided herein and (ii) the Pre-Funding Account,
all income and gain net of any losses realized from any such investment shall
be for the benefit of the Seller and shall be remitted to the Seller as
provided herein. The amount of any losses incurred in the Certificate Account
or the Distribution Account in respect of any such investments shall be
deposited by the Master Servicer in the Certificate Account or paid to the
Trustee for deposit into the Distribution Account out of the Master Servicer's
own funds immediately as realized. The amount of any losses incurred in the
Pre-Funding Account in respect of any such investments shall be paid by the
Seller to the Trustee for deposit into the Pre-Funding Account out of the
Seller's own funds immediately as realized. The Trustee shall not be liable
for the amount of any loss incurred in respect of any investment or lack of
investment of funds held in the Certificate Account, the Distribution Account
or the Pre-Funding Account and made in accordance with this Section 3.05.

          (f) The Master Servicer shall give at least 30 days advance notice
to the Trustee, the Seller, each Rating Agency and the Depositor of any
proposed change of location of the Certificate Account prior to any change
thereof. The Trustee shall give at least 30 days advance notice to the Master
Servicer, the Seller, each Rating Agency and the Depositor of any proposed
change of the location of the Distribution Account, the Pre-Funding Account or
the Carryover Reserve Fund prior to any change thereof.

          (g) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, if any
default occurs under any Permitted Investment, the Trustee may and, subject to
Section 8.01 and 8.02(iv), at the request of the Holders of Certificates
representing more than 50% of the Voting Rights or the NIM Insurer, shall take
any action appropriate to enforce payment or performance, including the
institution and prosecution of appropriate proceedings.

          Section 3.06 Collection of Taxes, Assessments and Similar Items;
                       Escrow Accounts.

          To the extent required by the related Mortgage Note, the Master
Servicer shall establish and maintain one or more accounts (each, an "Escrow
Account") and deposit and retain therein all collections from the Mortgagors
(or advances by the Master Servicer) for the payment of taxes, assessments,
hazard insurance premiums or comparable items for the account of the
Mortgagors. Nothing herein shall require the Master Servicer to compel a
Mortgagor to establish an Escrow Account in violation of applicable law.

          Withdrawals of amounts so collected from the Escrow Accounts may be
made only to effect timely payment of taxes, assessments, hazard insurance
premiums, condominium or PUD association dues, or comparable items, to
reimburse the Master Servicer out of related collections for any payments made
pursuant to Sections 3.01 hereof (with respect to taxes and assessments and
insurance premiums) and 3.10 hereof (with respect to hazard insurance), to
refund to any Mortgagors any sums as may be determined to be overages, to pay
interest, if required by law or the terms of the related Mortgage or Mortgage
Note, to Mortgagors on balances in the Escrow Account or to clear and
terminate the Escrow Account at the termination


                                      82
<PAGE>


of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01 hereof. The Escrow Accounts
shall not be a part of the Trust Fund.

          Section 3.07 Access to Certain Documentation and Information
                       Regarding the Mortgage Loans.

          The Master Servicer shall afford the Depositor, the NIM Insurer and
the Trustee reasonable access to all records and documentation regarding the
Mortgage Loans and all accounts, insurance policies and other matters relating
to this Agreement, such access being afforded without charge, but only upon
reasonable request and during normal business hours at the offices of the
Master Servicer designated by it. Upon request, the Master Servicer shall
furnish to the Trustee and the NIM Insurer its most recent publicly available
financial statements and any other information relating to its capacity to
perform its obligations under this Agreement reasonably requested by the NIM
Insurer.

          Upon reasonable advance notice in writing if required by federal
regulation, the Master Servicer will provide to each Certificateholder that is
a savings and loan association, bank or insurance company certain reports and
reasonable access to information and documentation regarding the Mortgage
Loans sufficient to permit such Certificateholder to comply with applicable
regulations of the OTS or other regulatory authorities with respect to
investment in the Certificates; provided that the Master Servicer shall be
entitled to be reimbursed by each such Certificateholder for actual expenses
incurred by the Master Servicer in providing such reports and access.

          Section 3.08 Permitted Withdrawals from the Certificate Account,
                       Distribution Account and the Carryover Reserve Fund.

          (a) The Master Servicer may from time to time make withdrawals from
the Certificate Account for the following purposes:

               (i) to pay to the Master Servicer (to the extent not previously
          paid to or withheld by the Master Servicer), as servicing
          compensation in accordance with Section 3.15, that portion of any
          payment of interest that equals the Servicing Fee for the period
          with respect to which such interest payment was made, and, as
          additional servicing compensation to the Master Servicer, those
          other amounts set forth in Section 3.15;

               (ii) to reimburse the Master Servicer for Advances made by it
          with respect to the Mortgage Loans, such right of reimbursement
          pursuant to this subclause (ii) being limited to amounts received on
          particular Mortgage Loan(s) (including, for this purpose,
          Liquidation Proceeds) that represent late recoveries of payments of
          principal and/or interest on such particular Mortgage Loan(s) in
          respect of which any such Advance was made;

               (iii) to pay to the Seller any Credit Comeback Excess Amount;

               (iv) to reimburse the Master Servicer for any Nonrecoverable
          Advance previously made;


                                      83
<PAGE>


               (v) to reimburse the Master Servicer from Insurance Proceeds
          for Insured Expenses covered by the related Insurance Policy;

               (vi) to pay the Master Servicer any unpaid Servicing Fees and
          to reimburse it for any unreimbursed Servicing Advances, the Master
          Servicer's right to reimbursement of Servicing Advances pursuant to
          this subclause (vi) with respect to any Mortgage Loan being limited
          to amounts received on particular Mortgage Loan(s) (including, for
          this purpose, Liquidation Proceeds and purchase and repurchase
          proceeds) that represent late recoveries of the payments for which
          such advances were made pursuant to Section 3.01 or Section 3.06;

               (vii) to pay to the Seller, the Depositor or the Master
          Servicer, as applicable, with respect to each Mortgage Loan or
          property acquired in respect thereof that has been purchased
          pursuant to Section 2.02, 2.03 or 3.12, all amounts received thereon
          and not taken into account in determining the related Stated
          Principal Balance of such repurchased Mortgage Loan;

               (viii) to reimburse the Seller, the Master Servicer, the NIM
          Insurer or the Depositor for expenses incurred by any of them in
          connection with the Mortgage Loans or Certificates and reimbursable
          pursuant to Section 6.03 hereof; provided that such amount shall
          only be withdrawn following the withdrawal from the Certificate
          Account for deposit into the Distribution Account pursuant to the
          following paragraph;

               (ix) to withdraw pursuant to Section 3.05 any amount deposited

          and

               (x) to clear and terminate the Certificate Account upon
          termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01 hereof.

          In addition, no later than 1:00 p.m. Pacific time on the
Distribution Account Deposit Date, the Master Servicer shall withdraw from the
Certificate Account and remit to the Trustee the Interest Remittance Amount
and Principal Remittance Amount for each Loan Group, and the Trustee shall
deposit such amount in the Distribution Account.

          The Master Servicer shall keep and maintain separate accounting, on
a Mortgage Loan by Mortgage Loan basis, for the purpose of justifying any
withdrawal from the Certificate Account pursuant to subclauses (i), (ii),
(iv), (v) and (vi) above. Prior to making any withdrawal from the Certificate
Account pursuant to subclause (iii), the Master Servicer shall deliver to the
Trustee an Officer's Certificate of a Servicing Officer indicating the amount
of any previous Advance determined by the Master Servicer to be a
Nonrecoverable Advance and identifying the related Mortgage Loan(s), and their
respective portions of such Nonrecoverable Advance.

          (b) The Trustee shall withdraw funds from the Distribution Account
for distribution to the Certificateholders in the manner specified in this
Agreement (and to withhold from the amounts so withdrawn, the amount of any
taxes that it is authorized to retain pursuant to the last paragraph of
Section 8.11). In addition, the Trustee may from time to time make withdrawals
from the Distribution Account for the following purposes:


                                      84
<PAGE>


               (i) to pay the Trustee the Trustee Fee on each Distribution
          Date;

               (ii) to pay to the Master Servicer, as additional servicing
          compensation, earnings on or investment income with respect to funds
          in or credited to the Distribution Account;

               (iii) to pay to the Co-Trustee, for payment to the Mortgage
          Insurer as provided below, the Mortgage Insurance Premium;

               (iv) to withdraw pursuant to Section 3.05 any amount deposited
          in the Distribution Account and not required to be deposited
          therein; and

               (v) to clear and terminate the Distribution Account upon
          termination of the Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01 hereof.

          The Co-Trustee shall pay the Mortgage Insurance Premium to the
Mortgage Insurer in accordance with the following wiring instructions: PMI
Mortgage Insurance Co., Account #12334-08489, Bank of America, Concord, CA
94520, ABA #121-00035-8, Txt: Attention: Policy, Servicing, CWABS 2002-6.

          (c) The Trustee shall withdraw funds from the Carryover Reserve Fund
for distribution to the Certificateholders in the manner specified in this
Agreement (and to withhold from the amounts so withdrawn, the amount of any
taxes that it is authorized to retain pursuant to the last paragraph of

from the Carryover Reserve Fund for the following purposes:

               (i) to withdraw pursuant to Section 3.05 any amount deposited
          in the Carryover Reserve Fund and not required to be deposited
          therein; and

               (ii) to clear and terminate the Carryover Reserve Fund upon
          termination of the Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01 hereof.

          Section 3.09 [Reserved]

          Section 3.10 Maintenance of Hazard Insurance.

          The Master Servicer shall cause to be maintained, for each Mortgage
Loan, hazard insurance with extended coverage in an amount that is at least
equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum insurable value of the improvements
securing such Mortgage Loan and (ii) the greater of (a) the outstanding
principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and (b) an amount such that the
proceeds of such policy shall be sufficient to prevent the related Mortgagor
and/or mortgagee from becoming a co-insurer. Each such policy of standard
hazard insurance shall contain, or have an accompanying endorsement that
contains, a standard mortgagee clause. The Master Servicer shall also cause
flood insurance to be maintained on property acquired upon foreclosure or deed
in lieu of foreclosure of any Mortgage Loan, to the extent described below.
Pursuant to Section 3.05 hereof, any amounts collected by the Master Servicer
under any such policies (other than the amounts to be applied to the
restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged Property or property thus
acquired or amounts released to the Mortgagor in accordance with the Master


                                      85
<PAGE>


Servicer's normal servicing procedures) shall be deposited in the Certificate
Account. Any cost incurred by the Master Servicer in maintaining any such
insurance shall not, for the purpose of calculating monthly distributions to
the Certificateholders or remittances to the Trustee for their benefit, be
added to the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, notwithstanding that the
terms of the Mortgage Loan so permit. Such costs shall be recoverable by the
Master Servicer out of late payments by the related Mortgagor or out of
Liquidation Proceeds to the extent permitted by Section 3.08 hereof. It is
understood and agreed that no earthquake or other additional insurance is to
be required of any Mortgagor or maintained on property acquired in respect of
a Mortgage other than pursuant to such applicable laws and regulations as
shall at any time be in force and as shall require such additional insurance.
If the Mortgaged Property is located at the time of origination of the
Mortgage Loan in a federally designated special flood hazard area and such
area is participating in the national flood insurance program, the Master
Servicer shall cause flood insurance to be maintained with respect to such
Mortgage Loan. Such flood insurance shall be in an amount equal to the lesser
of (i) the original principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan, (ii) the
replacement value of the improvements that are part of such Mortgaged
Property, or (iii) the maximum amount of such insurance available for the
related Mortgaged Property under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as
amended.

          Section 3.11 Enforcement of Due-On-Sale Clauses; Assumption
Agreements.

          (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.11(a), when any
property subject to a Mortgage has been or is about to be conveyed by the
Mortgagor, the Master Servicer shall to the extent that it has knowledge of
such conveyance, enforce any due-on-sale clause contained in any Mortgage Note
or Mortgage, to the extent permitted under applicable law and governmental
regulations, but only to the extent that such enforcement will not adversely
affect or jeopardize coverage under any Required Insurance Policy.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Master Servicer is not required to exercise
such rights with respect to a Mortgage Loan if the Person to whom the related
Mortgaged Property has been conveyed or is proposed to be conveyed satisfies
the terms and conditions contained in the Mortgage Note and Mortgage related
thereto and the consent of the mortgagee under such Mortgage Note or Mortgage
is not otherwise so required under such Mortgage Note or Mortgage as a
condition to such transfer. In the event that the Master Servicer is
prohibited by law from enforcing any such due-on-sale clause, or if coverage
under any Required Insurance Policy would be adversely affected, or if
nonenforcement is otherwise permitted hereunder, the Master Servicer is
authorized, subject to Section 3.11(b), to take or enter into an assumption
and modification agreement from or with the person to whom such property has
been or is about to be conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable
under the Mortgage Note and, unless prohibited by applicable state law, the
Mortgagor remains liable thereon, provided that the Mortgage Loan shall
continue to be covered (if so covered before the Master Servicer enters such
agreement) by the applicable Required Insurance Policies. The Master Servicer,
subject to Section 3.11(b), is also authorized with the prior approval of the
insurers under any Required Insurance Policies to enter into a substitution of
liability agreement with such Person, pursuant to which the original Mortgagor
is released from liability and such Person is substituted as Mortgagor and
becomes liable under the Mortgage Note. The Master Servicer shall notify the
Trustee that any such substitution, modification or assumption agreement has
been completed by forwarding to the Co-Trustee the executed original of such
substitution or assumption agreement, which document shall be added to the
related Mortgage File and shall, for all purposes, be considered a part of
such Mortgage


                                      86
<PAGE>


File to the same extent as all other documents and instruments constituting a
part thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Master Servicer shall not be
deemed to be in default under this Section 3.11(a) by reason of any transfer
or assumption that the Master Servicer reasonably believes it is restricted by
law from preventing.

          (b) Subject to the Master Servicer's duty to enforce any due-on-sale
clause to the extent set forth in Section 3.11(a) hereof, in any case in which
a Mortgaged Property has been conveyed to a Person by a Mortgagor, and such
Person is to enter into an assumption agreement or modification agreement or
supplement to the Mortgage Note or Mortgage that requires the signature of the
Trustee, or if an instrument of release signed by the Trustee is required
releasing the Mortgagor from liability on the Mortgage Loan, the Master
Servicer shall prepare and deliver or cause to be prepared and delivered to
the Trustee for signature and shall direct, in writing, the Trustee to execute
the assumption agreement with the Person to whom the Mortgaged Property is to
be conveyed and such modification agreement or supplement to the Mortgage Note
or Mortgage or other instruments as are reasonable or necessary to carry out
the terms of the Mortgage Note or Mortgage or otherwise to comply with any
applicable laws regarding assumptions or the transfer of the Mortgaged
Property to such Person. In connection with any such assumption, no material
term of the Mortgage Note (including, but not limited to, the Mortgage Rate,
the amount of the Scheduled Payment, the Maximum Mortgage Rate, the Minimum
Mortgage Rate, the Gross Margin, the Periodic Rate Cap, the Adjustment Date
and any other term affecting the amount or timing of payment on the Mortgage
Loan) may be changed. In addition, the substitute Mortgagor and the Mortgaged
Property must be acceptable to the Master Servicer in accordance with its
underwriting standards as then in effect. The Master Servicer shall notify the
Trustee that any such substitution or assumption agreement has been completed
by forwarding to the Co-Trustee the original of such substitution or
assumption agreement, which in the case of the original shall be added to the
related Mortgage File and shall, for all purposes, be considered a part of
such Mortgage File to the same extent as all other documents and instruments
constituting a part thereof. Any fee collected by the Master Servicer for
entering into an assumption or substitution of liability agreement will be
retained by the Master Servicer as additional servicing compensation.

          Section 3.12 Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans;
                       Determination of Excess Proceeds and Realized
                       Losses; Repurchase of Certain Mortgage Loans.

          (a) The Master Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to foreclose
upon or otherwise comparably convert the ownership of properties securing such
of the Mortgage Loans as come into and continue in default and as to which no
satisfactory arrangements can be made for collection of delinquent payments.
In connection with such foreclosure or other conversion, the Master Servicer
shall follow such practices and procedures as it shall deem necessary or
advisable and as shall be normal and usual in its general mortgage servicing
activities and the requirements of the insurer under any Required Insurance
Policy; provided that the Master Servicer shall not be required to expend its
own funds in connection with any foreclosure or towards the restoration of any
property unless it shall determine (i) that such restoration and/or
foreclosure will increase the proceeds of liquidation of the Mortgage Loan
after reimbursement to itself of such expenses and (ii) that such expenses
will be recoverable to it through Liquidation Proceeds (respecting which it
shall have priority for purposes of withdrawals from the Certificate


                                      87
<PAGE>


Account pursuant to Section 3.08 hereof). The Master Servicer shall be
responsible for all other costs and expenses incurred by it in any such
proceedings; provided that it shall be entitled to reimbursement thereof from
the proceeds of liquidation of the related Mortgaged Property, as contemplated
in Section 3.08 hereof. If the Master Servicer has knowledge that a Mortgaged
Property that the Master Servicer is contemplating acquiring in foreclosure or
by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is located within a one-mile radius of any site
with environmental or hazardous waste risks known to the Master Servicer, the
Master Servicer will, prior to acquiring the Mortgaged Property, consider such
risks and only take action in accordance with its established environmental
review procedures.

          With respect to any REO Property, the deed or certificate of sale
shall be taken in the name of the Trustee for the benefit of the
Certificateholders (or the Trustee's nominee on behalf of the
Certificateholders). The Trustee's name shall be placed on the title to such
REO Property solely as the Trustee hereunder and not in its individual
capacity. The Master Servicer shall ensure that the title to such REO Property
references this Agreement and the Trustee's capacity thereunder. Pursuant to
its efforts to sell such REO Property, the Master Servicer shall either itself
or through an agent selected by the Master Servicer protect and conserve such
REO Property in the same manner and to such extent as is customary in the
locality where such REO Property is located and may, incident to its
conservation and protection of the interests of the Certificateholders, rent
the same, or any part thereof, as the Master Servicer deems to be in the best
interest of the Master Servicer and the Certificateholders for the period
prior to the sale of such REO Property. The Master Servicer shall prepare for
and deliver to the Trustee a statement with respect to each REO Property that
has been rented showing the aggregate rental income received and all expenses
incurred in connection with the management and maintenance of such REO
Property at such times as is necessary to enable the Trustee to comply with
the reporting requirements of the REMIC Provisions. The net monthly rental
income, if any, from such REO Property shall be deposited in the Certificate
Account no later than the close of business on each Determination Date. The
Master Servicer shall perform the tax reporting and withholding related to
foreclosures, abandonments and cancellation of indebtedness income as
specified by sections 1445, 6050J and 6050P of the Code by preparing and
filing such tax and information returns, as may be required.

          In the event that the Trust Fund acquires any Mortgaged Property as
aforesaid or otherwise in connection with a default or imminent default on a
Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall dispose of such Mortgaged Property as
soon as practicable in a manner that maximizes the Liquidation Proceeds, but
in no event later than three years after its acquisition by the Trust Fund or,
at the expense of the Trust Fund, the Master Servicer shall request, more than
60 days prior to the day on which such three-year period would otherwise
expire, an extension of the three-year grace period. In the event the Trustee
shall have been supplied with an Opinion of Counsel (such opinion not to be an
expense of the Trustee) to the effect that the holding by the Trust Fund of
such Mortgaged Property subsequent to such three-year period will not result
in the imposition of taxes on "prohibited transactions" of the Trust Fund as
defined in section 860F of the Code or cause any REMIC formed hereunder to
fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificates are outstanding,
and the Trust Fund may continue to hold such Mortgaged Property (subject to
any conditions contained in such Opinion of Counsel) after the expiration of
such three-year period. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
no Mortgaged Property acquired by the Trust Fund shall be rented (or allowed
to continue to be rented) or


                                      88
<PAGE>


otherwise used for the production of income by or on behalf of the Trust Fund
in such a manner or pursuant to any terms that would (i) cause such Mortgaged
Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of
section 860G(a)(8) of the Code or (ii) subject the Trust Fund to the
imposition of any federal, state or local income taxes on the income earned
from such Mortgaged Property under section 860G(c) of the Code or otherwise,
unless the Master Servicer has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust
Fund with respect to the imposition of any such taxes.

          The decision of the Master Servicer to foreclose on a defaulted
Mortgage Loan shall be subject to a determination by the Master Servicer that
the proceeds of such foreclosure would exceed the costs and expenses of
bringing such a proceeding. The income earned from the management of any
Mortgaged Properties acquired through foreclosure or other judicial
proceeding, net of reimbursement to the Master Servicer for expenses incurred
(including any property or other taxes) in connection with such management and
net of unreimbursed Servicing Fees, Advances, Servicing Advances and any
management fee paid or to be paid with respect to the management of such
Mortgaged Property, shall be applied to the payment of principal of, and
interest on, the related defaulted Mortgage Loans (with interest accruing as
though such Mortgage Loans were still current) and all such income shall be
deemed, for all purposes in this Agreement, to be payments on account of
principal and interest on the related Mortgage Notes and shall be deposited
into the Certificate Account. To the extent the income received during a
Prepayment Period is in excess of the amount attributable to amortizing
principal and accrued interest at the related Mortgage Rate on the related
Mortgage Loan, such excess shall be considered to be a partial Principal
Prepayment for all purposes hereof.

          The Liquidation Proceeds from any liquidation of a Mortgage Loan,
net of any payment to the Master Servicer as provided above, shall be
deposited in the Certificate Account on the next succeeding Determination Date
following receipt thereof for distribution on the related Distribution Date,
except that any Excess Proceeds shall be retained by the Master Servicer as
additional servicing compensation.

          The proceeds of any Liquidated Loan, as well as any recovery
resulting from a partial collection of Liquidation Proceeds or any income from
an REO Property, will be applied in the following order of priority: first, to
reimburse the Master Servicer for any related unreimbursed Servicing Advances
and Servicing Fees, pursuant to Section 3.08(a)(vi) or this Section 3.12;
second, to reimburse the Master Servicer for any unreimbursed Advances,
pursuant to Section 3.08(a)(ii) or this Section 3.12; third, to accrued and
unpaid interest (to the extent no Advance has been made for such amount) on
the Mortgage Loan or related REO Property, at the Net Mortgage Rate to the Due
Date occurring in the month in which such amounts are required to be
distributed; and fourth, as a recovery of principal of the Mortgage Loan.

          (b) [Reserved]

          (c) The Master Servicer, in its sole discretion, shall have the
right to elect (by written notice sent to the Trustee) to purchase for its own
account from the Trust Fund any Mortgage Loan that is 150 days or more
delinquent at a price equal to the Purchase Price; provided, however, that the
Master Servicer may only exercise this right on or before the last day of the
calendar month in which such Mortgage Loan became 150 days delinquent (such
month,


                                      89
<PAGE>


the "Eligible Repurchase Month"); provided further, that any such Mortgage
Loan which becomes current but thereafter becomes delinquent may be purchased
by the Master Servicer pursuant to this Section in any ensuing Eligible
Repurchase Month. The Purchase Price for any Mortgage Loan purchased hereunder
shall be deposited in the Certificate Account. Any purchase of a Mortgage Loan
pursuant to this Section 3.12(c) shall be accomplished by remittance to the
Master Servicer for deposit in the Certificate Account of the Purchase Price.
The Trustee, upon receipt of certification from the Master Servicer of such
deposit and a Request for Release from the Master Servicer in the form of
Exhibit N hereto, shall release or cause to be released to the purchaser of
such Mortgage Loan the related Mortgage File and shall execute and deliver
such instruments of transfer or assignment prepared by the purchaser of such
Mortgage Loan, in each case without recourse, as shall be necessary to vest in
the purchaser of such Mortgage Loan any Mortgage Loan released pursuant hereto
and the purchaser of such Mortgage Loan shall succeed to all the Trustee's
right, title and interest in and to such Mortgage Loan and all security and
documents related thereto. Such assignment shall be an assignment outright and
not for security. The purchaser of such Mortgage Loan shall thereupon own such
Mortgage Loan, and all security and documents, free of any further obligation
to the Trustee or the Certificateholders with respect thereto.

          Section 3.13 Co-Trustee to Cooperate; Release of Mortgage Files.

          Upon the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, or the receipt by the
Master Servicer of a notification that payment in full will be escrowed in a
manner customary for such purposes, the Master Servicer will promptly notify
the Co-Trustee by delivering a Request for Release substantially in the form
of Exhibit N. Upon receipt of such request, the Co-Trustee shall promptly
release the related Mortgage File to the Master Servicer, and the Co-Trustee
shall at the Master Servicer's direction execute and deliver to the Master
Servicer the request for reconveyance, deed of reconveyance or release or
satisfaction of mortgage or such instrument releasing the lien of the Mortgage
in each case provided by the Master Servicer, together with the Mortgage Note
with written evidence of cancellation thereon. The Master Servicer is
authorized to cause the removal from the registration on the MERS(R) System of
such Mortgage and to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Trust Fund and the
Certificateholders or any of them, any and all instruments of satisfaction or
cancellation or of partial or full release. No expenses incurred in connection
with any instrument of satisfaction or deed of reconveyance shall be
chargeable to the Certificate Account, the Distribution Account, the Carryover
Reserve Fund or the related subservicing account. From time to time and as
shall be appropriate for the servicing or foreclosure of any Mortgage Loan,
including for such purpose, collection under any policy of flood insurance any
fidelity bond or errors or omissions policy, or for the purposes of effecting
a partial release of any Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage or
the making of any corrections to the Mortgage Note or the Mortgage or any of
the other documents included in the Mortgage File, the Co-Trustee shall, upon
delivery to the Co-Trustee of a Request for Release in the form of Exhibit M
signed by a Servicing Officer, release the Mortgage File to the Master
Servicer. Subject to the further limitations set forth below, the Master
Servicer shall cause the Mortgage File or documents so released to be returned
to the Co-Trustee when the need therefor by the Master Servicer no longer
exists, unless the Mortgage Loan is liquidated and the proceeds thereof are
deposited in the Certificate Account, in which case the Co-Trustee shall
deliver the Request for Release to the Master Servicer.


                                      90
<PAGE>


          If the Master Servicer at any time seeks to initiate a foreclosure
proceeding in respect of any Mortgaged Property as authorized by this
Agreement, the Master Servicer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Trustee, for signature, as appropriate, any court pleadings, requests for
trustee's sale or other documents necessary to effectuate such foreclosure or
any legal action brought to obtain judgment against the Mortgagor on the
Mortgage Note or the Mortgage or to obtain a deficiency judgment or to enforce
any other remedies or rights provided by the Mortgage Note or the Mortgage or
otherwise available at law or in equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Master Servicer shall cause possession of any Mortgage File or of the
documents therein that shall have been released by the Co-Trustee to be
returned to the Co-Trustee within 21 calendar days after possession thereof
shall have been released by the Co-Trustee unless (i) the Mortgage Loan has
been liquidated and the Liquidation Proceeds relating to the Mortgage Loan
have been deposited in the Certificate Account, and the Master Servicer shall
have delivered to the Co-Trustee a Request for Release in the form of Exhibit
N or (ii) the Mortgage File or document shall have been delivered to an
attorney or to a public trustee or other public official as required by law
for purposes of initiating or pursuing legal action or other proceedings for
the foreclosure of the Mortgaged Property and the Master Servicer shall have
delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate of a Servicing Officer
certifying as to the name and address of the Person to which the Mortgage File
or the documents therein were delivered and the purpose or purposes of such
delivery.

          Section 3.14 Documents, Records and Funds in Possession of Master
                       Servicer to be Held for the Trustee.

          Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the Master
Servicer shall transmit to the Co-Trustee as required by this Agreement all
documents and instruments in respect of a Mortgage Loan coming into the
possession of the Master Servicer from time to time and shall account fully to
the Trustee for any funds received by the Master Servicer or that otherwise
are collected by the Master Servicer as Liquidation Proceeds or Insurance
Proceeds in respect of any Mortgage Loan. All Mortgage Files and funds
collected or held by, or under the control of, the Master Servicer in respect
of any Mortgage Loans, whether from the collection of principal and interest
payments or from Liquidation Proceeds, including but not limited to, any funds
on deposit in the Certificate Account, shall be held by the Master Servicer
for and on behalf of the Trust Fund and shall be and remain the sole and
exclusive property of the Trust Fund, subject to the applicable provisions of
this Agreement. The Master Servicer also agrees that it shall not create,
incur or subject any Mortgage File or any funds that are deposited in the
Certificate Account, the Distribution Account, the Carryover Reserve Fund or
in any Escrow Account (as defined in Section 3.06), or any funds that
otherwise are or may become due or payable to the Trustee for the benefit of
the Certificateholders, to any claim, lien, security interest, judgment, levy,
writ of attachment or other encumbrance, or assert by legal action or
otherwise any claim or right of set off against any Mortgage File or any funds
collected on, or in connection with, a Mortgage Loan, except, however, that
the Master Servicer shall be entitled to set off against and deduct from any
such funds any amounts that are properly due and payable to the Master
Servicer under this Agreement.

          Section 3.15 Servicing Compensation.

          As compensation for its activities hereunder, the Master Servicer
shall be entitled to retain or withdraw from the Certificate Account out of
each payment of interest on a Mortgage Loan included in the Trust Fund an
amount equal to interest at the applicable Servicing Fee Rate on the Stated
Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan for the period covered by such
interest payment.

          Additional servicing compensation in the form of any Excess
Proceeds, assumption fees, late payment charges, Prepayment Interest Excess,
and all income and gain net of any losses realized from Permitted Investments
shall be retained by the Master Servicer to the extent not required to be
deposited in the Certificate Account pursuant to Section 3.05 or 3.12(a)
hereof. The Master Servicer shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by
it in connection with its servicing activities hereunder (including payment of
any premiums for hazard insurance, as required by Section 3.10 hereof and
maintenance of the other forms of insurance coverage required by Section 3.10
hereof) and shall not be entitled to reimbursement therefor except as
specifically provided in Sections 3.08 and 3.12 hereof.

          Section 3.16 Access to Certain Documentation.

          The Master Servicer shall provide to the OTS and the FDIC and to
comparable regulatory authorities supervising Holders of the Certificates and
the examiners and supervisory agents of the OTS, the FDIC and such other
authorities, access to the documentation regarding the Mortgage Loans required
by applicable regulations of the OTS and the FDIC. Such access shall be
afforded without charge, but only upon reasonable and prior written request
and during normal business hours at the offices of the Master Servicer
designated by it. Nothing in this Section shall limit the obligation of the
Master Servicer to observe any applicable law prohibiting disclosure of
information regarding the Mortgagors and the failure of the Master Servicer to
provide access as provided in this Section as a result of such obligation
shall not constitute a breach of this Section.

          Section 3.17 Annual Statement as to Compliance.

          The Master Servicer shall deliver to the Depositor and the Trustee
on or before the 120th day after the end of the Master Servicer's fiscal year,
commencing with its 2003 fiscal year, an Officer's Certificate stating, as to
the signer thereof, that (i) a review of the activities of the Master Servicer
during the preceding calendar year and of the performance of the Master
Servicer under this Agreement has been made under such officer's supervision
and (ii) to the best of such officer's knowledge, based on such review, the
Master Servicer has fulfilled all its obligations under this Agreement
throughout such year, or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of
any such obligation, specifying each such default known to such officer and
the nature and status thereof and (iii) to the best of such officer's
knowledge, each Subservicer has fulfilled all its obligations under its
Subservicing Agreement throughout such year, or, if there has been a default
in the fulfillment of any such obligation specifying each such default known
to such officer and the nature and status thereof. The Trustee shall forward a
copy of each such statement to each Rating Agency. Copies of such statement
shall be provided by the Trustee to


                                      92
<PAGE>


any Certificateholder upon request at the Master Servicer's expense, provided
such statement is delivered by the Master Servicer to the Trustee.

          Section 3.18 Annual Independent Public Accountants' Servicing
                       Statement; Financial Statements.

          On or before the later of (i) the 120th day after the end of the
Master Servicer's fiscal year, commencing with its 2003 fiscal year or (ii)
within 30 days of the issuance of the annual audited financial statements
beginning with the audit for the period ending in 2003, the Master Servicer at
its expense shall cause a nationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants (who may also render other services to the Master Servicer, the
Seller or any affiliate thereof) that is a member of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants to furnish a report to the Trustee, the Depositor
and the Seller in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation Program for
Mortgage Bankers. Copies of such report shall be provided by the Trustee to
any Certificateholder upon request at the Master Servicer's expense, provided
such report is delivered by the Master Servicer to the Trustee. Upon written
request, the Master Servicer shall provide to the Certificateholders its
publicly available annual financial statements (or the Master Servicer's
parent company's publicly available annual financial statements, as
applicable), if any, promptly after they become available.

          Section 3.19 The Cap Contracts.

          The Seller shall assign all of its right, title and interest in and
to the interest rate cap transactions evidenced by the Cap Contracts to, and
shall cause all of its obligations in respect of such transactions to be
assumed by, the Trustee on behalf of the Trust Fund, on the terms and
conditions set forth in each Cap Contract Assignment Agreement. The Cap
Contracts will be assets of the Trust Fund but will not be an asset of any
REMIC. The Master Servicer, on behalf of the Trustee, shall deposit any
amounts received from time to time with respect to any Cap Contract into the
Carryover Reserve Fund.

          The Master Servicer, on behalf of the Trustee, shall prepare and
deliver any notices required to be delivered under a Cap Contract.

          The Master Servicer, on behalf of the Trustee, shall act as
calculation agent and/or shall terminate a Cap Contract, in each case upon the
occurrence of certain events of default or termination events to the extent
specified thereunder. Upon any such termination, the Cap Contract Counterparty
will be obligated to pay the Trustee or the Master Servicer for the benefit of
the Trust Fund an amount in respect of such termination. Any amounts received
by the Trustee or the Master Servicer for the benefit of the Trust Fund, as
the case may be, in respect of such termination shall be deposited and held in
the Carryover Reserve Fund to pay Net Rate Carryover for the applicable
Classes of Certificates as provided in Section 4.04(b) on the Distribution
Dates following such termination to and including the applicable Cap Contract
Termination Date, but shall not be available for distribution to the Class C
Certificates pursuant to Section 4.08(c) or to the Seller pursuant to Section
4.08(c) until such applicable Cap Contract Termination Date. On the Cap
Contract Termination Date for the Class AV-1 Cap Contract and the Subordinate
Cap Contract, after all other distributions on such date, if any such amounts
in respect of early termination of the Class AV-1 Cap Contract or the
Subordinate Cap Contract


                                      93
<PAGE>


remain in the Carryover Reserve Fund, such amounts shall be distributed by the
Trustee to the Class C Certificates.

          Section 3.20 Prepayment Charges.

          (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
the event of a Principal Prepayment in full or in part of a Mortgage Loan, the
Master Servicer may not waive any Prepayment Charge or portion thereof
required by the terms of the related Mortgage Note unless (i) the Master
Servicer determines that such waiver would maximize recovery of Liquidation
Proceeds for such Mortgage Loan, taking into account the value of such
Prepayment Charge, or (ii) (A) the enforceability thereof is limited (1) by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, receivership, or other similar law
relating to creditors' rights generally or (2) due to acceleration in
connection with a foreclosure or other involuntary payment, or (B) the
enforceability is otherwise limited or prohibited by applicable law. In the
event of a Principal Prepayment in full or in part with respect to any
Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer's
Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit T no later than the third
Business Day following the immediately succeeding Determination Date with a
copy to the Class P Certificateholders. If the Master Servicer has waived or
does not collect all or a portion of a Prepayment Charge relating to a
Principal Prepayment in full or in part due to any action or omission of the
Master Servicer, other than as provided above, the Master Servicer shall
deliver to the Trustee, together with the Principal Prepayment in full or in
part, the amount of such Prepayment Charge (or such portion thereof as had
been waived) for deposit into the Certificate Account (not later than the
immediately succeeding Master Servicer Advance Date, in the case of such
Prepayment Charge) for distribution in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

          (b) Upon discovery by the Master Servicer or a Responsible Officer
of the Trustee of a breach of the foregoing subsection (a), the party
discovering the breach shall give prompt written notice to the other parties.

          (c) The Seller represents and warrants to the Depositor and the
Trustee, as of the Closing Date, that the information in the Prepayment Charge
Schedule (including the attached prepayment charge summary) is complete and
accurate in all material respects at the dates as of which the information is
furnished and each Prepayment Charge is permissible and enforceable in
accordance with its terms under applicable state law, except as the
enforceability thereof is limited due to acceleration in connection with a
foreclosure or other involuntary payment.

          (d) Upon discovery by the Master Servicer or a Responsible Officer
of the Trustee of a breach of the foregoing clause (c) that materially and
adversely affects right of the Holders of the Class P Certificates to any
Prepayment Charge, the party discovering the breach shall give prompt written
notice to the other parties. Within 60 days of the earlier of discovery by the
Master Servicer or receipt of notice by the Master Servicer of breach, the
Master Servicer shall cure the breach in all material respects or shall pay
into the Certificate Account the amount of the Prepayment Charge that would
otherwise be due from the Mortgagor, less any amount representing such
Prepayment Charge previously collected and paid by the Master Servicer into
the Certificate Account.

          Section 4.01 Advances; Remittance Reports.

          (a) Subject to the conditions of this Article IV, the Master
Servicer, as required below, shall make an Advance and deposit such Advance in
the Certificate Account. Each such Advance shall be remitted to the
Certificate Account no later than 1:00 p.m. Pacific time on the Master
Servicer Advance Date in immediately available funds. The Master Servicer
shall be obligated to make any such Advance only to the extent that such
advance would not be a Nonrecoverable Advance. If the Master Servicer shall
have determined that it has made a Nonrecoverable Advance or that a proposed
Advance or a lesser portion of such Advance would constitute a Nonrecoverable
Advance, the Master Servicer shall deliver (i) to the Trustee for the benefit
of the Certificateholders funds constituting the remaining portion of such
Advance, if applicable, and (ii) to the Depositor, each Rating Agency and the
Trustee an Officer's Certificate setting forth the basis for such
determination.

          (b) In lieu of making all or a portion of such Advance from its own
funds, the Master Servicer may (i) cause to be made an appropriate entry in
its records relating to the Certificate Account that any Amount Held for
Future Distributions has been used by the Master Servicer in discharge of its
obligation to make any such Advance and (ii) transfer such funds from the
Certificate Account to the Distribution Account. Any funds so applied and
transferred shall be replaced by the Master Servicer by deposit in the
Certificate Account no later than the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Distribution Date on which such funds are required
to be distributed pursuant to this Agreement. The Master Servicer shall be
entitled to be reimbursed from the Certificate Account for all Advances of its
own funds made pursuant to this Section as provided in Section 3.08. The
obligation to make Advances with respect to any Mortgage Loan shall continue

related REO Property has been liquidated or until the purchase or repurchase
thereof (or substitution therefor) from the Trustee pursuant to any applicable
provision of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this Section

          In the event that any Mortgage Loan is the subject of a Prepayment
Interest Shortfall, the Master Servicer shall remit any related Compensating
Interest as part of the related Interest Remittance Amount as provided in this
Agreement. The Master Servicer shall not be entitled to any recovery or
reimbursement for Compensating Interest from the Depositor, the Trustee, the
Seller, the Trust Fund or the Certificateholders.

                   Certificates, until the Certificate Principal Balance
                   thereof is reduced to zero; and (ii) from the Principal
                   Distribution Amount for Loan Group 2, sequentially to the
                   Class A-R Certificates until the Certificate Principal
                   Balance thereof is reduced to zero, then to the Class AF

                   until the Certificate Principal Balances thereof are

                   Certificate Principal Balance of the Class AV-1
                   Certificates has been reduced to zero, the Principal
                   Distribution Amount from both Loan Groups will be applied

               (ii) The projected remaining principal and interest cash flows
          as of the end of any calendar quarter with respect to each related

               (iii) The applicable Prepayment Assumption and any interest
          rate assumptions used in determining the projected principal and
          interest cash flows described above;

               (iv) The original issue discount (or, in the case of the
          Mortgage Loans, market discount) or premium accrued or amortized
          through the end of such calendar quarter with respect to each

          to the Mortgage Loans, together with each constant yield to maturity

          deductions claimed with respect to the Mortgage Loans;

               (vi) The amount and timing of any non-interest expenses of the
          related REMIC; and

               (vii) Any taxes (including penalties and interest) imposed on
          the related REMIC, including, without limitation, taxes on
          "prohibited transactions," "contributions" or "net income from
          foreclosure property" or state or local income or franchise taxes.

          Section 4.08 Carryover Reserve Fund.

          (a) On the Closing Date, the Trustee shall establish and maintain in
its name, in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Certificates, the
Carryover Reserve Fund and shall deposit $10,000 therein. The Carryover
Reserve Fund shall be an Eligible Account, and funds on deposit therein shall
be held separate and apart from, and shall not be commingled with, any other
moneys, including without limitation, other moneys held by the Trustee
pursuant to this Agreement.

          (b) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall deposit all amounts
received pursuant to the Cap Contracts in the Carryover Reserve Fund. The
Trustee shall make withdrawals from the Carryover Reserve Fund to make
distributions pursuant to Section 4.04(b) hereof. Funds withdrawn from the
Carryover Reserve Fund may not be applied pursuant to any other subsection of
Section 4.04 other than as expressly provided for in this Section 4.08(b).

          (c) Any amounts received on the Class AV-1 Cap Contract and the
Subordinate Cap Contract with respect to a Distribution Date and remaining
after the distributions required pursuant to Section 4.04(b)(i) and (ii),
first, shall be used to make any Required Secondary Carryover Reserve Fund
Deposit (after all other deposits and withdrawals from the Carryover Reserve
Fund on such Distribution Date, including the use of any available Excess
Cashflow to make such Required Secondary Carryover Reserve Fund Deposit), and
second, shall be distributed to the Class C Certificates; provided, however,
that if the Class AV-1 Cap Contract or Subordinate Cap Contract is subject to
early termination, early termination payments received on such Cap Contract
shall be deposited by the Trustee in the Carryover Reserve Fund and withdrawn
from the Carryover Reserve Fund to pay any Net Rate Carryover for the
applicable Classes of Certificates as provided in Section 4.04(b)(i) and (ii)
on the Distribution Dates following such termination to and including the
applicable Cap Contract Termination Date, but such early termination payments
shall not be available for distribution to the Class C Certificates on future
Distribution Dates until the applicable Cap Contract Termination Date.

          (d) Funds in the Carryover Reserve Fund may be invested in Permitted
Investments at the direction of the Majority Holder of the Class C
Certificates, which Permitted Investments shall mature not late than the
Business Day immediately preceding the first Distribution Date that follows
the date of such investment (except that if such Permitted Investment is an
obligation of the institution that maintains the Carryover Reserve Fund, then
such Permitted Investment shall mature not later than such Distribution Date)
and shall not be sold or disposed of prior to maturity. All such Permitted
Investments shall be made in the name of the Trustee, for the benefit of the
Certificateholders. In the absence of such written direction, all funds in the
Carryover Reserve Fund shall be invested by the Trustee in The Bank of New


                                     105
<PAGE>


York cash reserves. Any net investment earnings on such amounts shall be
payable to the Holders of the Class C Certificates in accordance with their
Percentage Interests. Any losses incurred in the Carryover Reserve Fund in
respect of any such investments shall be charged against amounts on deposit in
the Carryover Reserve Fund (or such investments) immediately as realized. The
Trustee shall not be liable for the amount of any loss incurred in respect of
any investment or lack of investment of funds held in the Carryover Reserve
Fund and made in accordance with this Section 4.08.

          The Certificates shall be executed by manual or facsimile signature
on behalf of the Trustee by an authorized officer. Certificates bearing the
manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were, at the time when such
signatures were affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of the Trustee shall
bind the Trustee, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have
ceased to be so authorized prior to the authentication and delivery of such
Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of such authentication
and delivery. No Certificate shall be entitled to any benefit under this
Agreement, or be valid for any purpose, unless there appears on such
Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially in the form set
forth as attached hereto executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such
certificate of authentication upon


                                     106
<PAGE>


any Certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such
Certificate has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All
Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication. On the Closing
Date, the Trustee shall authenticate the Certificates to be issued at the
written direction of the Depositor, or any affiliate thereof.

          The Depositor shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the Trustee
on a continuous basis, an adequate inventory of Certificates to facilitate
transfers.

          Section 5.02 Certificate Register; Registration of Transfer and
Exchange of Certificates.

          (a) The Trustee shall maintain a Certificate Register for the Trust
Fund in which, subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) below and
to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Trustee shall provide
for the registration of Certificates and of Transfers and exchanges of
Certificates as herein provided. Upon surrender for registration of Transfer
of any Certificate, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of
the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Certificates of the
same Class and of like aggregate Percentage Interest.

          At the option of a Certificateholder, Certificates may be exchanged
for other Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations and
evidencing the same aggregate Percentage Interest upon surrender of the
Certificates to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Trustee. Whenever
any Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Trustee shall execute,
authenticate, and deliver the Certificates that the Certificateholder making
the exchange is entitled to receive. Every Certificate presented or
surrendered for registration of Transfer or exchange shall be accompanied by a
written instrument of Transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee duly
executed by the holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

          No service charge to the Certificateholders shall be made for any
registration of Transfer or exchange of Certificates, but payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in
connection with any Transfer or exchange of Certificates may be required.

          All Certificates surrendered for registration of Transfer or
exchange shall be canceled and subsequently destroyed by the Trustee in
accordance with the Trustee's customary procedures.

          (b) No Transfer of a Private Certificate shall be made unless such
Transfer is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws or is exempt from the
registration requirements under the Securities Act and such state securities
laws. In the event that a transfer is to be made in reliance upon an exemption
from the Securities Act and such state securities laws, in order to assure
compliance with the Securities Act and such state securities laws, the
Certificateholder desiring to effect such Transfer and such
Certificateholder's prospective transferee shall each certify to the Trustee
in writing the facts surrounding the Transfer in substantially the forms set
forth in Exhibit J (the "Transferor Certificate") and (i) deliver a letter in
substantially the form of either Exhibit K (the "Investment Letter") or
Exhibit L (the "Rule 144A Letter") or (ii) there shall be delivered to the


                                     107
<PAGE>


Trustee at the expense of the Certificateholder desiring to effect such
transfer an Opinion of Counsel that such Transfer may be made pursuant to an
exemption from the Securities Act. The Depositor shall provide to any Holder
of a Private Certificate and any prospective transferee designated by any such
Holder, information regarding the related Certificates and the Mortgage Loans
and such other information as shall be necessary to satisfy the condition to
eligibility set forth in Rule 144A(d)(4) for transfer of any such Certificate
without registration thereof under the Securities Act pursuant to the
registration exemption provided by Rule 144A. The Trustee, the Co-Trustee and
the Master Servicer shall cooperate with the Depositor in providing the Rule
144A information referenced in the preceding sentence, including providing to
the Depositor such information regarding the Certificates, the Mortgage Loans
and other matters regarding the Trust Fund as the Depositor shall reasonably
request to meet its obligation under the preceding sentence. Each Holder of a
Private Certificate desiring to effect such Transfer shall, and does hereby
agree to, indemnify the Trustee, the Co-Trustee, the Depositor, the Seller and
the Master Servicer against any liability that may result if the Transfer is
not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws.

          No Transfer of an ERISA-Restricted Certificate shall be made unless
the Trustee shall have received either (i) a representation from the
transferee of such Certificate acceptable to and in form and substance
satisfactory to the Trustee (in the event such Certificate is a Private
Certificate, such requirement is satisfied only by the Trustee's receipt of a
representation letter from the transferee substantially in the form of Exhibit
K or Exhibit L, or in the event such Certificate is a Residual Certificate,
such requirement is satisfied only by the Trustee's receipt of a
representation letter from the transferee substantially in the form of Exhibit
I-1), to the effect that such transferee is not an employee benefit plan or
arrangement subject to Section 406 of ERISA or a plan or arrangement subject
to Section 4975 of the Code, or a Person acting on behalf of any such plan or
arrangement or using the assets of any such plan or arrangement, or (ii) in
the case of an ERISA-Restricted Certificate that has been the subject of an
ERISA-Qualifying Underwriting, if the purchaser is an insurance company, a
representation that the purchaser is an insurance company which is purchasing
such Certificates with funds contained in an "insurance company general
account" (as such term is defined in section V(e) of Prohibited Transaction
Class Exemption 95-60 ("PTCE 95-60")) and that the purchase and holding of
such Certificates are covered under Sections I and III of PTCE 95-60 or (iii)
in the case of any ERISA-Restricted Certificate presented for registration in
the name of an employee benefit plan or arrangement subject to ERISA, or a
plan or arrangement subject to Section 4975 of the Code (or comparable
provisions of any subsequent enactments), or a trustee of any such plan or
arrangement or any other person acting on behalf of any such plan or
arrangement, an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to the Trustee and the Master
Servicer to the effect that the purchase or holding of such ERISA-Restricted
Certificate will not result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA
or the Code and will not subject the Trustee or the Master Servicer to any
obligation in addition to those expressly undertaken in this Agreement, which
Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Trustee or the Master
Servicer. For purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence, such
representation shall be deemed to have been made to the Trustee by the
transferee's acceptance of an ERISA-Restricted Certificate (or the acceptance
by a Certificate Owner of the beneficial interest in any such Class of
ERISA-Restricted Certificates) that is a Book-Entry Certificate unless the
Trustee shall have received from the transferee an alternative representation
acceptable in form and substance to the Master Servicer and the Depositor.
Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, any purported transfer


                                     108
<PAGE>


of an ERISA-Restricted Certificate to or on behalf of an employee benefit plan
or arrangement subject to Section 406 of ERISA or a plan or arrangement
subject to Section 4975 of the Code without the delivery to the Trustee and
the Master Servicer of an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to the Trustee and
the Master Servicer as described above shall be void and of no effect,
provided that the restriction set forth in this sentence shall not be
applicable if there has been delivered to the Trustee and the Master Servicer
an Opinion of Counsel meeting the requirements of clause (iii) of the first
sentence of this paragraph. The Trustee shall be under no liability to any
Person for any registration of transfer of any ERISA-Restricted Certificate
that is in fact not permitted by this Section 5.02(b) or for making any
payments due on such Certificate to the Holder thereof or taking any other
action with respect to such Holder under the provisions of this Agreement so
long as the Trustee, with respect to the transfer of such Classes of
Certificates, required delivery of such certificates and other documentation
or evidence as are expressly required by the terms of this Agreement and
examined such certificates and other documentation or evidence to determine
compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof. The Trustee shall
be entitled, but not obligated, to recover from any Holder of any
ERISA-Restricted Certificate that was in fact an employee benefit plan or
arrangement subject to Section 406 of ERISA or a plan or arrangement subject
to Section 4975 of the Code or a Person acting on behalf of any such plan or
arrangement at the time it became a Holder or, at such subsequent time as it
became such a plan or arrangement or Person acting on behalf of such a plan or
arrangement, all payments made on such ERISA-Restricted Certificate at and
after either such time. Any such payments so recovered by the Trustee shall be
paid and delivered by the Trustee to the last preceding Holder of such
Certificate that is not such a plan or arrangement or Person acting on behalf
of a plan or arrangement.

          (c) Each Person who has or who acquires any Ownership Interest in a
Class A-R Certificate shall be deemed by the acceptance or acquisition of such
Ownership Interest to have agreed to be bound by the following provisions, and
the rights of each Person acquiring any Ownership Interest in a Class A-R
Certificate are expressly subject to the following provisions:

               (i) Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in
          a Class A-R Certificate shall be a Permitted Transferee and shall
          promptly notify the Trustee of any change or impending change in its
          status as a Permitted Transferee.

               (ii) No Ownership Interest in a Class A-R Certificate may be
          registered on the Closing Date or thereafter transferred, and the
          Trustee shall not register the Transfer of any Class A-R Certificate
          unless, the Trustee shall have been furnished with an affidavit (a
          "Transfer Affidavit") of the initial owner or the proposed
          transferee in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I-1 or Exhibit
          I-2, respectively.

               (iii) Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest
          in a Class A-R Certificate shall agree (A) to obtain a Transfer
          Affidavit from any other Person to whom such Person attempts to
          Transfer its Ownership Interest in a Class A-R Certificate, (B) to
          obtain a Transfer Affidavit from any Person for whom such Person is
          acting as nominee, trustee or agent in connection with any Transfer
          of a Class A-R Certificate and (C) not to Transfer its Ownership
          Interest in a Class A-R Certificate, or to cause the Transfer of an
          Ownership Interest in a Class A-R Certificate to any other Person,
          if it has actual knowledge that such Person is not a Permitted
          Transferee.


                                     109
<PAGE>


               (iv) Any attempted or purported Transfer of any Ownership
          Interest in a Class A-R Certificate in violation of the provisions
          of this Section 5.02(c) shall be absolutely null and void and shall
          vest no rights in the purported Transferee. If any purported
          transferee shall become a Holder of a Class A-R Certificate in
          violation of the provisions of this Section 5.02(c), then the last
          preceding Permitted Transferee shall be restored to all rights as
          Holder thereof retroactive to the date of registration of Transfer
          of such Class A-R Certificate. The Trustee shall be under no
          liability to any Person for any registration of Transfer of a Class
          A-R Certificate that is in fact not permitted by Section 5.02(b) and
          this Section 5.02(c) or for making any payments due on such
          Certificate to the Holder thereof or taking any other action with
          respect to such Holder under the provisions of this Agreement so
          long as the Transfer was registered after receipt of the related
          Transfer Affidavit and Transferor Certificate. The Trustee shall be
          entitled but not obligated to recover from any Holder of a Class A-R
          Certificate that was in fact not a Permitted Transferee at the time
          it became a Holder or, at such subsequent time as it became other
          than a Permitted Transferee, all payments made on such Class A-R
          Certificate at and after either such time. Any such payments so
          recovered by the Trustee shall be paid and delivered by the Trustee
          to the last preceding Permitted Transferee of such Certificate.

               (v) The Master Servicer shall use its best efforts to make
          available, upon receipt of written request from the Trustee, all
          information necessary to compute any tax imposed under section
          860E(e) of the Code as a result of a Transfer of an Ownership
          Interest in a Class A-R Certificate to any Holder who is not a
          Permitted Transferee.

          The restrictions on Transfers of a Class A-R Certificate set forth
in this section 5.02(c) shall cease to apply (and the applicable portions of
the legend on a Class A-R Certificate may be deleted) with respect to
Transfers occurring after delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel,
which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Trustee, the Seller or
the Master Servicer to the effect that the elimination of such restrictions
will not cause any REMIC formed hereunder to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any
time that the Certificates are outstanding or result in the imposition of any
tax on the Trust Fund, a Certificateholder or another Person. Each Person
holding or acquiring any ownership Interest in a Class A-R Certificate hereby
consents to any amendment of this Agreement that, based on an Opinion of
Counsel furnished to the Trustee, is reasonably necessary (a) to ensure that
the record ownership of, or any beneficial interest in, a Class A-R
Certificate is not transferred, directly or indirectly, to a Person that is
not a Permitted Transferee and (b) to provide for a means to compel the
Transfer of a Class A-R Certificate that is held by a Person that is not a
Permitted Transferee to a Holder that is a Permitted Transferee.

          (d) The preparation and delivery of all affidavits, certifications
and opinions referred to above in this section 5.02 shall not be an expense of
the Trust Fund, the Trustee, the Depositor, the Seller or the Master Servicer.

          Section 5.03 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.

          If (a) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Trustee, or
the Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or
theft of any Certificate and of the ownership thereof and (b) there is
delivered to the Master Servicer and the Trustee such security or indemnity as
may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of
notice to the Trustee that such Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide
purchaser, the Trustee shall execute, authenticate and deliver, in exchange
for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a
new Certificate of like Class, tenor and Percentage Interest. In connection
with the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 5.03, the Trustee
may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other
expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Any replacement Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 5.03 shall
constitute complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership in the Trust Fund,
as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate shall be found at any time. All Certificates surrendered to the
Trustee under the terms of this Section 5.03 shall be canceled and destroyed
by the Trustee in accordance with its standard procedures without liability on
its part.

          Section 5.04 Persons Deemed Owners.

          The Master Servicer, the Trustee and any agent of the Master
Servicer or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name any Certificate is
registered as the owner of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving
distributions as provided in this Agreement and for all other purposes
whatsoever, and none of the Master Servicer, the Trustee or the NIM Insurer or
any agent of the Master Servicer, the Trustee or the NIM Insurer shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary.

          Section 5.05 Access to List of Certificateholders' Names and
Addresses.

          If three or more Certificateholders (a) request such information in
writing from the Trustee, (b) state that such Certificateholders desire to
communicate with other Certificateholders with respect to their rights under
this Agreement or under the Certificates, and (c) provide a copy of the
communication that such Certificateholders propose to transmit or if the
Depositor or Master Servicer shall request such information in writing from
the Trustee, then the Trustee shall, within ten Business Days after the
receipt of such request, provide the Depositor, the Master Servicer or such
Certificateholders at such recipients' expense the most recent list of the
Certificateholders of the Trust Fund held by the Trustee, if any. The
Depositor and every Certificateholder, by receiving and holding a Certificate,
agree that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of the
disclosure of any such information as to the list of the Certificateholders
hereunder, regardless of the source from which such information was derived.

          Section 5.06 Book-Entry Certificates.

          The Book-Entry Certificates, upon original issuance, shall be issued
in the form of one typewritten Certificate (or more than one, if required by
the Depository) for each Class of such Certificates, to be delivered to the
Depository by or on behalf of the Depositor. Such

Certificates shall initially be registered on the Certificate Register in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, and no Certificate Owner of such
Certificates will receive a definitive certificate representing such
Certificate Owner's interest in such Certificates, except as provided in
Section 5.08. Unless and until definitive, fully registered Certificates
("Definitive Certificates") have been issued to the Certificate Owners of such
Certificates pursuant to Section 5.08:

          (a) the provisions of this Section shall be in full force and
effect;

          (b) the Depositor, the Seller, the Master Servicer and the Trustee
may deal with the Depository and the Depository Participants for all purposes
(including the making of distributions) as the authorized representative of
the respective Certificate Owners of such Certificates;

          (c) registration of the Book-Entry Certificates may not be
transferred by the Trustee except to another Depository;

          (d) the rights of the respective Certificate Owners of such
Certificates shall be exercised only through the Depository and the Depository
Participants and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements
between the Owners of such Certificates and the Depository and/or the
Depository Participants. Pursuant to the Depository Agreement, unless and
until Definitive Certificates are issued pursuant to Section 5.08, the
Depository will make book-entry transfers among the Depository Participants
and receive and transmit distributions of principal and interest on the
related Certificates to such Depository Participants;

          (e) the Depository may collect its usual and customary fees, charges
and expenses from its Depository Participants;

          (f) the Trustee may rely and shall be fully protected in relying
upon information furnished by the Depository with respect to its Depository
Participants; and

          (g) to the extent that the provisions of this Section conflict with
any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section shall
control.

          For purposes of any provision of this Agreement requiring or
permitting actions with the consent of, or at the direction of,
Certificateholders evidencing a specified percentage of the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of any Class of Certificates, such direction or consent may
be given by Certificate Owners (acting through the Depository and the
Depository Participants) owning Book-Entry Certificates evidencing the
requisite percentage of principal amount of such Class of Certificates.

          Section 5.07 Notices to Depository.

          Whenever any notice or other communication is required to be given
to Certificateholders of the Class with respect to which Book-Entry
Certificates have been issued, unless and until Definitive Certificates shall
have been issued to the related Certificate Owners, the Trustee shall give all
such notices and communications to the Depository.

          Section 5.08 Definitive Certificates.

          If, after Book-Entry Certificates have been issued with respect to
any Certificates, (a) the Depositor advises the Trustee that the Depository is
no longer willing or able to discharge properly its responsibilities under the
Depository Agreement with respect to such Certificates and the Trustee or the
Depositor is unable to locate a qualified successor, (b) the Depositor, at its
sole option, advises the Trustee that it elects to terminate the book-entry
system with respect to such Certificates through the Depository or (c) after
the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, Certificate Owners of
such Book-Entry Certificates having not less than 51% of the Voting Rights
evidenced by any Class of Book-Entry Certificates advise the Trustee and the
Depository in writing through the Depository Participants that the
continuation of a book-entry system with respect to Certificates of such Class
through the Depository (or its successor) is no longer in the best interests
of the Certificate Owners of such Class, then the Trustee shall notify all
Certificate Owners of such Certificates, through the Depository, of the
occurrence of any such event and of the availability of Definitive
Certificates to Certificate Owners of such Class requesting the same. The
Depositor shall provide the Trustee with an adequate inventory of certificates
to facilitate the issuance and transfer of Definitive Certificates. Upon
surrender to the Trustee of any such Certificates by the Depository,
accompanied by registration instructions from the Depository for registration,
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver such Definitive Certificates.
Neither the Depositor nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay in
delivery of such instructions and each may conclusively rely on, and shall be
protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of such
Definitive Certificates, all references herein to obligations imposed upon or
to be performed by the Depository shall be deemed to be imposed upon and
performed by the Trustee, to the extent applicable with respect to such
Definitive Certificates and the Trustee shall recognize the Holders of such
Definitive Certificates as Certificateholders hereunder.

          Section 5.09 Maintenance of Office or Agency.

          The Trustee will maintain or cause to be maintained at its expense
an office or offices or agency or agencies in New York City where Certificates
may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange. The Trustee
initially designates its offices at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York
10286, Attention: Corporate Trust MBS Administration, as offices for such
purposes. The Trustee will give prompt written notice to the
Certificateholders of any change in such location of any such office or
agency.

                       Servicer and the Seller.

          The Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Seller shall each be
liable in accordance herewith only to the extent of the obligations
specifically and respectively imposed upon and undertaken by them herein.

          Section 6.02 Merger or Consolidation of the Depositor, the Master
                       Servicer or the Seller.

          The Depositor will keep in full effect its existence, rights and
franchises as a corporation under the laws of the United States or under the
laws of one of the states thereof and will each obtain and preserve its
qualification to do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in
which such qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the validity and
enforceability of this Agreement, or any of the Mortgage Loans and to perform
its duties under this Agreement. The Master Servicer will keep in effect its
existence, rights and franchises as a limited partnership under the laws of
the United States or under the laws of one of the states thereof and will
obtain and preserve its qualification or registration to do business as a
foreign partnership in each jurisdiction in which such qualification or
registration is or shall be necessary to protect the validity and
enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Mortgage Loans and to perform
its duties under this Agreement.

          Any Person into which the Depositor, the Master Servicer or the
Seller may be merged or consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger
or consolidation to which the Depositor, the Master Servicer or the Seller
shall be a party, or any person succeeding to the business of the Depositor,
the Master Servicer or the Seller, shall be the successor of the Depositor,
the Master Servicer or the Seller, as the case may be, hereunder, without the
execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the
parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding; provided that
the successor or surviving Person to the Master Servicer shall be qualified to
service mortgage loans on behalf of, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

          Section 6.03 Limitation on Liability of the Depositor, the Seller,
the Master Servicer and Others.

          None of the Depositor, the Seller, the NIM Insurer or the Master
Servicer or any of the directors, officers, employees or agents of the
Depositor, the Seller, the NIM Insurer or the Master Servicer shall be under
any liability to the Trustee (except as provided in Section 8.05), the Trust
Fund or the Certificateholders for any action taken or for refraining from the
taking of any action in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, or for errors
in judgment; provided that this provision shall not protect the Depositor, the
Seller, the Master Servicer or any such Person against any breach of
representations or warranties made by it herein or protect the Depositor, the
Seller, the Master Servicer or any such Person from any liability that would
otherwise be imposed by reasons of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence in the performance of duties or by reason of reckless disregard of
obligations and duties hereunder. The Depositor, the Seller, the NIM Insurer,
the Master Servicer and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Depositor, the Seller, the NIM Insurer or the Master Servicer may rely in good
faith on any document of any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted
by any Person respecting any matters arising hereunder. The Depositor, the
Seller, the NIM Insurer, the Master Servicer and any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Depositor, the Seller, the NIM Insurer or the Master
Servicer shall be indemnified by the Trust Fund and held harmless against any
loss, liability or expense incurred in connection with any audit, controversy
or judicial proceeding relating to a governmental taxing authority or any
legal action relating to this Agreement or the Certificates, other than any
loss, liability or expense related to any specific Mortgage Loan or


                                     114
<PAGE>


Mortgage Loans (except as any such loss, liability or expense shall be
otherwise reimbursable pursuant to this Agreement) and any loss, liability or
expense incurred by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence in the performance of duties hereunder or by reason of reckless
disregard of obligations and duties hereunder. None of the Depositor, the
Seller, the NIM Insurer or the Master Servicer shall be under any obligation
to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action that is not incidental to
its respective duties hereunder and that in its opinion may involve it in any
expense or liability; provided that any of the Depositor, the Seller, the NIM
Insurer or the Master Servicer may, in its discretion undertake any such
action that it may deem necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement
and the rights and duties of the parties hereto and interests of the Trustee
and the Certificateholders hereunder. In such event, the legal expenses and
costs of such action and any liability resulting therefrom shall be, expenses,
costs and liabilities of the Trust Fund, and the Depositor, the Seller, the
NIM Insurer and the Master Servicer shall be entitled to be reimbursed
therefor out of the Certificate Account as provided by Section 3.08 hereof.

          Section 6.04 Limitation on Resignation of Master Servicer.

          The Master Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties
hereby imposed on it except (i) upon determination that its duties hereunder
are no longer permissible under applicable law or (ii) upon appointment of a
successor servicer that is reasonably acceptable to the Trustee and the NIM
Insurer and the written confirmation from each Rating Agency (which
confirmation shall be furnished to the Depositor, the NIM Insurer and the
Trustee) that such resignation will not cause such Rating Agency to reduce the
then current rating of the Certificates. Any such determination pursuant to
clause (i) of the preceding sentence permitting the resignation of the Master
Servicer shall be evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered
to the Trustee. No resignation of the Master Servicer shall become effective
until the Trustee or a successor servicer appointed by the Trustee shall have
assumed the Master Servicer's responsibilities, duties, liabilities (other
than those liabilities arising prior to the appointment of such successor) and
obligations under this Agreement.

          Section 6.05 Errors and Omissions Insurance; Fidelity Bonds.

          The Master Servicer shall, for so long as it acts as servicer under
this Agreement, obtain and maintain in force (a) a policy or policies of
insurance covering errors and omissions in the performance of its obligations
as servicer hereunder, and (b) a fidelity bond in respect of its officers,
employees and agents. Each such policy or policies and bond shall, together,
comply with the requirements from time to time of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac
for persons performing servicing for mortgage loans purchased by Fannie Mae or
Freddie Mac. In the event that any such policy or bond ceases to be in effect,
the Master Servicer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a
comparable replacement policy or bond from an insurer or issuer, meeting the
requirements set forth above as of the date of such replacement.

          The Master Servicer shall provide the Trustee and the NIM Insurer
(upon such party's reasonable request) with copies of any such insurance
policies and fidelity bond. The Master Servicer shall be deemed to have
complied with this provision if an Affiliate of the Master Servicer has such
errors and omissions and fidelity bond coverage and, by the terms of


                                     115
<PAGE>


such insurance policy or fidelity bond, the coverage afforded thereunder
extends to the Master Servicer.

                    DEFAULT; TERMINATION OF MASTER SERVICER

          Section 7.01 Events of Default.

          "Event of Default," wherever used herein, means any one of the
following events:

               (i) any failure by the Master Servicer to deposit in the
          Certificate Account or the Distribution Account or remit to the
          Trustee any payment (excluding a payment required to be made under
          Section 4.01 hereof) required to be made under the terms of this
          Agreement, which failure shall continue unremedied for five calendar
          days and, with respect to a payment required to be made under
          Section 4.01 hereof, for one calendar day, after the date on which
          written notice of such failure shall have been given to the Master
          Servicer by the Trustee, the NIM Insurer or the Depositor, or to the
          Trustee, the NIM Insurer and the Master Servicer by the Holders of
          Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the Voting Rights
          evidenced by the Certificates; or

               (ii) any failure by the Master Servicer to observe or perform
          in any material respect any other of the covenants or agreements on
          the part of the Master Servicer contained in this Agreement or any
          representation or warranty shall prove to be untrue, which failure
          or breach shall continue unremedied for a period of 60 days after
          the date on which written notice of such failure shall have been
          given to the Master Servicer by the Trustee, the NIM Insurer or the
          Depositor, or to the Trustee by the Holders of Certificates
          evidencing not less than 25% of the Voting Rights evidenced by the
          Certificates; provided that the sixty-day cure period shall not
          apply to the initial delivery of the Mortgage File for Delay
          Delivery Mortgage Loans nor the failure to repurchase or substitute
          in lieu thereof; or

               (iii) a decree or order of a court or agency or supervisory
          authority having jurisdiction in the premises for the appointment of
          a receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt,
          marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings, or for
          the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, shall have been
          entered against the Master Servicer and such decree or order shall
          have remained in force undischarged or unstayed for a period of 60
          consecutive days; or

               (iv) the Master Servicer shall consent to the appointment of a
          receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt,
          marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of or
          relating to the Master Servicer or all or substantially all of the
          property of the Master Servicer; or

               (v) the Master Servicer shall admit in writing its inability to
          pay its debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take
          advantage of, or commence a voluntary case under, any applicable
          insolvency or reorganization statute, make an assignment for the
          benefit of its creditors, or voluntarily suspend payment of its
          obligations.


                                     116
<PAGE>


          If an Event of Default shall occur, then, and in each and every such
case, so long as such Event of Default shall not have been remedied, the
Trustee shall, but only at the direction of either the NIM Insurer or the
Holders of Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the Voting Rights
evidenced by the Certificates, by notice in writing to the Master Servicer
(with a copy to each Rating Agency), terminate all of the rights and
obligations of the Master Servicer under this Agreement and in and to the
Mortgage Loans and the proceeds thereof, other than its rights as a
Certificateholder hereunder. On or after the receipt by the Master Servicer of
such written notice, all authority and power of the Master Servicer hereunder,
whether with respect to the Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and be
vested in the Trustee. The Trustee shall thereupon make any Advance described
in Section 4.01 hereof subject to Section 3.04 hereof. The Trustee is hereby
authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Master
Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other
instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or
appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to
complete the transfer and endorsement or assignment of the Mortgage Loans and
related documents, or otherwise. Unless expressly provided in such written
notice, no such termination shall affect any obligation of the Master Servicer
to pay amounts owed pursuant to Article VIII. The Master Servicer agrees to
cooperate with the Trustee in effecting the termination of the Master
Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder, including, without
limitation, the transfer to the Trustee of all cash amounts which shall at the
time be credited to the Certificate Account, or thereafter be received with
respect to the Mortgage Loans. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Rating
Agencies of the occurrence of an Event of Default.

          Notwithstanding any termination of the activities of a Master
Servicer hereunder, such Master Servicer shall be entitled to receive, out of
any late collection of a Scheduled Payment on a Mortgage Loan that was due
prior to the notice terminating such Master Servicer's rights and obligations
as Master Servicer hereunder and received after such notice, that portion
thereof to which such Master Servicer would have been entitled pursuant to
Sections 3.08(a)(i) through (viii), and any other amounts payable to such
Master Servicer hereunder the entitlement to which arose prior to the
termination of its activities hereunder.

          Section 7.02 Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.

          On and after the time the Master Servicer receives a notice of
termination pursuant to Section 7.01 hereof, the Trustee shall, to the extent
provided in Section 3.04, be the successor to the Master Servicer in its
capacity as servicer under this Agreement and the transactions set forth or
provided for herein and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties
and liabilities relating thereto placed on the Master Servicer by the terms
and provisions hereof and applicable law including the obligation to make
advances pursuant to Section 4.01. As compensation therefor, the Trustee shall
be entitled to all fees, costs and expenses relating to the Mortgage Loans
that the Master Servicer would have been entitled to if the Master Servicer
had continued to act hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Trustee
has become the successor to the Master Servicer in accordance with Section
7.01 hereof, the Trustee may, if it shall be unwilling to so act, or shall, if
it is prohibited by applicable law from making Advances pursuant to Section
4.01 hereof or if it is otherwise unable to so act, (i) appoint any
established mortgage loan servicing institution reasonably acceptable to the
NIM Insurer (as evidenced by the prior written consent of the NIM Insurer), or
(ii) petition a court of competent jurisdiction to


                                     117
<PAGE>


appoint any established mortgage loan servicing institution, the appointment
of which does not adversely affect the then current rating of the Certificates
and the NIM Insurer guaranteed notes by each Rating Agency as the successor to
the Master Servicer hereunder in the assumption of all or any part of the
responsibilities, duties or liabilities of the Master Servicer hereunder. Any
successor Master Servicer shall be an institution that is a Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac approved seller/servicer in good standing, that has been approved
by the Mortgage Insurer, that has a net worth of at least $15,000,000 and that
is willing to service the Mortgage Loans and executes and delivers to the
Depositor and the Trustee an agreement accepting such delegation and
assignment, that contains an assumption by such Person of the rights, powers,
duties, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities of the Master Servicer
(other than liabilities and indemnities of the Master Servicer under Section
6.03 hereof incurred prior to termination of the Master Servicer under Section
7.01), with like effect as if originally named as a party to this Agreement;
and provided further that each Rating Agency acknowledges that its rating of
the Certificates in effect immediately prior to such assignment and delegation
will not be qualified or reduced as a result of such assignment and
delegation. No appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer hereunder
shall be effective until the Trustee shall have consented thereto, and written
notice of such proposed appointment shall have been provided by the Trustee to
each Certificateholder. The Trustee shall not resign as servicer until a
successor servicer has been appointed and has accepted such appointment.
Pending appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer hereunder, the
Trustee, unless the Trustee is prohibited by law from so acting, shall,
subject to Section 3.04 hereof, act in such capacity as hereinabove provided.
In connection with such appointment and assumption, the Trustee may make such
arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of payments on
Mortgage Loans as it and such successor shall agree; provided that no such
compensation shall be in excess of that permitted the Master Servicer
hereunder. The Trustee and such successor shall take such action, consistent
with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession.
Neither the Trustee nor any other successor servicer shall be deemed to be in
default hereunder by reason of any failure to make, or any delay in making,
any distribution hereunder or any portion thereof or any failure to perform,
or any delay in performing, any duties or responsibilities hereunder, in
either case caused by the failure of the Master Servicer to deliver or
provide, or any delay in delivering or providing, any cash, information,
documents or records to it.

          Any successor to the Master Servicer as servicer shall give notice
to the NIM Insurer and the Mortgagors of such change of servicer and shall,
during the term of its service as servicer maintain in force the policy or
policies that the Master Servicer is required to maintain pursuant to Section
6.05.

          In connection with the termination or resignation of the Master
Servicer hereunder, either (i) the successor Master Servicer, including the
Trustee if the Trustee is acting as successor Master Servicer, shall represent
and warrant that it is a member of MERS in good standing and shall agree to
comply in all material respects with the rules and procedures of MERS in
connection with the servicing of the Mortgage Loans that are registered with
MERS, or (ii) the predecessor Master Servicer shall cooperate with the
successor Master Servicer in causing MERS to execute and deliver an assignment
of Mortgage in recordable form to transfer the Mortgage from MERS to the
Trustee and to execute and deliver such other notices, documents and other
instruments as may be necessary or desirable to effect a transfer of such
Mortgage Loan or servicing of such Mortgage Loan on the MERS(R) System to the
successor


                                     118
<PAGE>


Master Servicer. The predecessor Master Servicer shall file or cause to be
filed any such assignment in the appropriate recording office. The successor
Master Servicer shall cause such assignment to be delivered to the Co-Trustee
promptly upon receipt of the original with evidence of recording thereon or a
copy certified by the public recording office in which such assignment was
recorded.

          Section 7.03 Notification to Certificateholders.

          (a) Upon any termination of or appointment of a successor to the
Master Servicer, the Trustee shall give prompt written notice thereof to
Certificateholders and to each Rating Agency.

          (b) Within 60 days after the occurrence of any Event of Default, the
Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Certificateholders notice of each such
Event of Default hereunder known to the Trustee, unless such Event of Default
shall have been cured or waived.

                                ARTICLE VIII.
                   CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE AND THE CO-TRUSTEE

          Section 8.01 Duties of Trustee.

          The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and
after the curing of all Events of Default that may have occurred, shall
undertake to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set
forth in this Agreement. In case an Event of Default has occurred and remains
uncured, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it
by this Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise
as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the
conduct of such person's own affairs.

          The Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates,
statements, opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments
furnished to the Trustee (or the Co-Trustee, to the extent provided in this
Agreement) that are specifically required to be furnished pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement shall examine them to determine whether they
conform to the requirements of this Agreement, to the extent provided in this
Agreement. If any such instrument is found not to conform to the requirements
of this Agreement in a material manner, the Trustee shall take action as it
deems appropriate to have the instrument corrected.

          No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own grossly negligent action, its own gross
negligent failure to act or its own misconduct, its grossly negligent failure
to perform its obligations in compliance with this Agreement, or any liability
that would be imposed by reason of its willful misfeasance or bad faith;
provided that:

               (i) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, and after
          the curing of all such Events of Default that may have occurred, the
          duties and obligations of the Trustee shall be determined solely by
          the express provisions of this Agreement, the Trustee shall not be
          liable, individually or as Trustee, except for the performance of
          such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this
          Agreement, no implied


                                     119

          covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against
          the Trustee and the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth
          of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed
          therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee
          and conforming to the requirements of this Agreement that it
          reasonably believed in good faith to be genuine and to have been
          duly executed by the proper authorities respecting any matters
          arising hereunder;

               (ii) the Trustee shall not be liable, individually or as
          Trustee, for an error of judgment made in good faith by a
          Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, unless
          the Trustee was grossly negligent or acted in bad faith or with
          willful misfeasance; and

               (iii) the Trustee shall not be liable, individually or as
          Trustee, with respect to any action taken, suffered or omitted to be
          taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the
          NIM Insurer or the Holders of each Class of Certificates evidencing
          not less than 25% of the Voting Rights of such Class relating to the
          time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
          available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred
          upon the Trustee under this Agreement.

          Section 8.02 Certain Matters Affecting the Trustee.

          (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.01:

               (i) the Trustee may request and rely upon and shall be

          certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
          request, consent, order, appraisal, bond or other paper or document
          believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by
          the proper party or parties;

               (ii) the Trustee may consult with counsel and any Opinion of
          Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in

          in good faith and in accordance with such Opinion of Counsel;

               (iii) the Trustee shall not be liable, individually or as
          Trustee, for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good
          faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion
          or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Agreement;

               (iv) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder
          and after the curing of all Events of Default that may have
          occurred, the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation
          into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate,
          statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent,
          order, approval, bond or other paper or document, unless requested
          in writing so to do by the NIM Insurer or the Holders of each Class
          of Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the Voting Rights of
          such Class; provided, however, that if the payment within a
          reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities
          likely to be incurred by


                                     120
<PAGE>


          it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the
          Trustee not reasonably assured to the Trustee by such
          Certificateholders, the Trustee may require reasonable indemnity
          against such expense, or liability from such Certificateholders as a
          condition to taking any such action;

               (v) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers
          hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or
          through agents, accountants or attorneys;

               (vi) the Trustee shall not be required to expend its own funds
          or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any
          of its duties hereunder if it shall have reasonable grounds for
          believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against
          such liability is not assured to it;

               (vii) the Trustee shall not be liable, individually or as
          Trustee, for any loss on any investment of funds pursuant to this
          Agreement (other than as issuer of the investment security);

               (viii) the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of an
          Event of Default until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall
          have received written notice thereof; and

               (ix) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any
          of the trusts or powers vested in it by this Agreement or to make
          any investigation of matters arising hereunder or to institute,
          conduct or defend any litigation hereunder or in relation hereto at
          the request, order or direction of the NIM Insurer or the
          Certificateholders, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement,
          unless the NIM Insurer or such Certificateholders shall have offered
          to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs,
          expenses and liabilities that may be incurred therein or thereby.

          (b) All rights of action under this Agreement or under any of the
Certificates, enforceable by the Trustee, may be enforced by the Trustee
without the possession of any of the Certificates, or the production thereof
at the trial or other proceeding relating thereto, and any such suit, action
or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its name for the
benefit of all the Holders of the Certificates, subject to the provisions of
this Agreement.

          Section 8.03 Trustee Not Liable for Mortgage Loans.

          The recitals contained herein shall be taken as the statements of
the Depositor or the Master Servicer, as the case may be, and the Trustee
assumes no responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no
representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Agreement or of any
Mortgage Loan or related document or of MERS or the MERS(R) System other than
with respect to the Trustee's execution and authentication of the
Certificates. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application
by the Depositor or the Master Servicer of any funds paid to the Depositor or
the Master Servicer in respect of the Mortgage Loans or deposited in or
withdrawn from the Certificate Account by the Depositor or the Master
Servicer.

          Section 8.04 Trustee May Own Certificates.

          The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the
owner or pledgee of Certificates with the same rights as it would have if it
were not the Trustee.

          Section 8.05 Master Servicer to Pay Trustee's Fees and Expenses.

          The Master Servicer covenants and agrees to pay or reimburse the
Trustee, upon its request, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and
advances incurred or made by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust Fund in
accordance with any of the provisions of this Agreement (including, without
limitation: (A) the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements
of its counsel, but only for representation of the Trustee acting in its
capacity as Trustee hereunder and (B) to the extent that the Trustee must
engage persons not regularly in its employ to perform acts or services on
behalf of the Trust Fund, which acts or services are not in the ordinary
course of the duties of a trustee, paying agent or certificate registrar, in
the absence of a breach or default by any party hereto, the reasonable
compensation, expenses and disbursements of such persons, except any such
expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from its negligence, bad faith
or willful misconduct). The Trustee and any director, officer, employee or
agent of the Trustee shall be indemnified by the Master Servicer and held
harmless against any loss, liability or expense (i) incurred in connection
with any legal action relating to this Agreement or the Certificates, or in
connection with the performance of any of the Trustee's duties hereunder,
other than any loss, liability or expense incurred by reason of willful
misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of any of the
Trustee's duties hereunder or by reason of reckless disregard of the Trustee's
obligations and duties hereunder and (ii) resulting from any error in any tax
or information return prepared by the Master Servicer. Such indemnity shall
survive the termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the
Trustee hereunder.

          Section 8.06 Eligibility Requirements for Trustee.

          The Trustee hereunder shall, at all times, be a corporation or
association organized and doing business under the laws of a state or the
United States of America, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate
trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000,
subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and with a
credit rating that would not cause any of the Rating Agencies to reduce their
respective ratings of any Class of Certificates below the ratings issued on
the Closing Date (or having provided such security from time to time as is
sufficient to avoid such reduction). If such corporation or association
publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the
requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the
purposes of this Section 8.06 the combined capital and surplus of such
corporation or association shall be deemed to be its combined capital and
surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. In
case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 8.06, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the
manner and with the effect specified in Section 8.07 hereof. The corporation
or national banking association serving as Trustee may have normal banking and
trust relationships with the Depositor, the Seller and the Master Servicer and
their respective affiliates; provided that such corporation cannot be an


                                     122
<PAGE>


affiliate of the Master Servicer other than the Trustee in its role as
successor to the Master Servicer.

          Section 8.07 Resignation and Removal of Trustee.

          The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the trusts
hereby created by (1) giving written notice of resignation to the Depositor
and the Master Servicer and by mailing notice of resignation by first class
mail, postage prepaid, to the Certificateholders at their addresses appearing
on the Certificate Register and each Rating Agency, not less than 60 days
before the date specified in such notice when, subject to Section 8.08, such
resignation is to take effect, and (2) acceptance of appointment by a
successor trustee in accordance with Section 8.08 and meeting the
qualifications set forth in Section 8.06. If no successor trustee shall have
been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the
giving of such notice or resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any
court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee.

          If at any time (i) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of Section 8.06 hereof and shall fail to resign
after written request thereto by the NIM Insurer or the Depositor, (ii) the
Trustee shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged as bankrupt or
insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed,
or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its
property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or
liquidation, or (iii)(A) a tax is imposed with respect to the Trust Fund by
any state in which the Trustee or the Trust Fund is located, (B) the
imposition of such tax would be avoided by the appointment of a different
trustee and (C) the Trustee fails to indemnify the Trust Fund against such
tax, then the Depositor, the NIM Insurer or the Master Servicer may remove the
Trustee and appoint a successor trustee, reasonably acceptable to the NIM
Insurer, by written instrument, in triplicate, one copy of which instrument
shall be delivered to the Trustee, one copy of which shall be delivered to the
Master Servicer and one copy of which shall be delivered to the successor
trustee.

          The Holders evidencing at least 51% of the Voting Rights of each
Class of Certificates may at any time remove the Trustee and appoint a
successor trustee by written instrument or instruments, in triplicate, signed
by such Holders or their attorneys-in-fact duly authorized, one complete set
of which instruments shall be delivered by the successor Trustee to the Master
Servicer one complete set to the Trustee so removed and one complete set to
the successor so appointed. Notice of any removal of the Trustee shall be
given to each Rating Agency by the Successor Trustee.

          Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a
successor trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 8.07 shall
become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as
provided in Section 8.08 hereof.

          Section 8.08 Successor Trustee.

          Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 8.07 hereof
shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Depositor, its predecessor
trustee and the Master Servicer an instrument accepting such appointment
hereunder and thereupon the resignation or removal of


                                     123
<PAGE>


the predecessor trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with
all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor hereunder,
with the like effect as if originally named as trustee herein.

          No successor trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this
Section 8.08 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee
shall be eligible under the provisions of Section 8.06 hereof, is reasonably
acceptable to the NIM Insurer and its appointment shall not adversely affect
the then current ratings of the Certificates.

          Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in
this Section 8.08, the Depositor shall mail notice of the succession of such
trustee hereunder to the NIM Insurer and all Holders of Certificates. If the
Depositor fails to mail such notice within ten days after acceptance of
appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such
notice to be mailed at the expense of the Depositor.

          Section 8.09 Merger or Consolidation of Trustee.

          Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or
with which it may be consolidated or any corporation resulting from any
merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or
any corporation succeeding to substantially all of the corporate trust
business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder,
provided that such corporation shall be eligible under the provisions of
Section 8.06 hereof without the execution or filing of any paper or further
act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding.

          Section 8.10 Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.

          Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, at any time,
for the purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which
any part of the Trust Fund or property securing any Mortgage Note may at the
time be located, the Master Servicer and the Trustee acting jointly shall have
the power and shall execute and deliver all instruments to appoint one or more
Persons approved by the Trustee and reasonably acceptable to the NIM Insurer
to act as co-trustee or co-trustees jointly with the Trustee, or separate
trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the Trust Fund, and to
vest in such Person or Persons, in such capacity and for the benefit of the
Certificateholders, such title to the Trust Fund or any part thereof,
whichever is applicable, and, subject to the other provisions of this Section
8.10, such powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Master
Servicer and the Trustee may consider necessary or desirable. If the Master
Servicer shall not have joined in such appointment within 15 days after the
receipt by it of a request to do so, or in the case an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee shall have the power to make such
appointment. No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be required to
meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee under Section 8.06 and no
notice to Certificateholders of the appointment of any co-trustee or separate
trustee shall be required under Section 8.08.

          Every separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted
by law, be appointed and act subject to the following provisions and
conditions:


                                     124
<PAGE>


               (i) All rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or
          imposed upon the Trustee, except for the obligation of the Trustee
          under this Agreement to advance funds on behalf of the Master
          Servicer, shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or
          performed by the Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee
          jointly (it being understood that such separate trustee or
          co-trustee is not authorized to act separately without the Trustee
          joining in such act), except to the extent that under any law of any
          jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed
          (whether as Trustee hereunder or as successor to the Master Servicer
          hereunder), the Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to
          perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties
          and obligations (including the holding of title to the Trust Fund or
          any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and
          performed singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee, but solely
          at the direction of the Trustee;

               (ii) No trustee hereunder shall be held personally liable by
          reason of any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder; and

               (iii) The Trustee may at any time accept the resignation of or
          remove any separate trustee or co-trustee.

          Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee shall be
deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and
co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument
appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement
and the conditions of this Article VIII. Each separate trustee and co-trustee
upon its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates
or property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with
the Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the
provisions of this Agreement, specifically including every provision of this
Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording
protection to, the Trustee. Every such instrument shall be filed with the
Trustee and a copy thereof given to the Master Servicer and the Depositor.

          Any separate trustee or co-trustee may, at any time, constitute the
Trustee its agent or attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority, to the
extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this
Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or co-trustee
shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its
estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be
exercised by the Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the
appointment of a new or successor trustee.

          Section 8.11 Tax Matters.

          It is intended that the Trust Fund shall constitute, and that the
affairs of the Trust Fund shall be conducted so that each of the Upper Tier
REMIC and the Lower Tier REMIC qualifies as, a "real estate mortgage
investment conduit" as defined in and in accordance with the REMIC Provisions.
In furtherance of such intention, the Trustee covenants and agrees that it
shall act as agent (and the Trustee is hereby appointed to act as agent) on
behalf of the Trust Fund and that in such capacity it shall: (a) prepare and
file, or cause to be prepared and filed, in a timely manner, a U.S. Real
Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit Income Tax Returns (Form 1066 or any
successor form adopted by the Internal Revenue Service) and prepare and file
or


                                     125
<PAGE>


cause to be prepared and filed with the Internal Revenue Service and
applicable state or local tax authorities income tax or information returns
for each taxable year with respect to each REMIC created hereunder containing
such information and at the times and in the manner as may be required by the
Code or state or local tax laws, regulations, or rules, and furnish or cause
to be furnished to Certificateholders the schedules, statements or information
at such times and in such manner as may be required thereby; (b) within thirty
days of the Closing Date, furnish or cause to be furnished to the Internal
Revenue Service, on Forms 8811 or as otherwise may be required by the Code,
the name, title, address, and telephone number of the person that the Holders
of the Certificates may contact for tax information relating thereto, together
with such additional information as may be required by such Form, and update
such information at the time or times in the manner required by the Code for
the Trust Fund; (c) make or cause to be made elections, on behalf of each
REMIC created hereunder to be treated as a REMIC on the federal tax return of
each such REMIC for its first taxable year (and, if necessary, under
applicable state law); (d) prepare and forward, or cause to be prepared and
forwarded, to the Certificateholders and to the Internal Revenue Service and,
if necessary, state tax authorities, all information returns and reports as
and when required to be provided to them in accordance with the REMIC
Provisions, including without limitation, the calculation of any original
issue discount using the Prepayment Assumption; (e) provide information
necessary for the computation of tax imposed on the transfer of a Class A-R
Certificate to a Person that is not a Permitted Transferee, or an agent
(including a broker, nominee or other middleman) of a Non-Permitted
Transferee, or a pass-through entity in which a Non-Permitted Transferee is
the record holder of an interest (the reasonable cost of computing and
furnishing such information may be charged to the Person liable for such tax);
(f) to the extent that they are under its control conduct the affairs of the
Trust Fund at all times that any Certificates are outstanding so as to
maintain the status of each REMIC created hereunder as a REMIC under the REMIC
Provisions; (g) not knowingly or intentionally take any action or omit to take
any action that would cause the termination of the REMIC status of any REMIC
created hereunder; (h) pay, from the sources specified in the last paragraph
of this Section 8.11, the amount of any federal, state and local taxes,
including prohibited transaction taxes as described below, imposed on any
REMIC created hereunder prior to the termination of the Trust Fund when and as
the same shall be due and payable (but such obligation shall not prevent the
Trustee or any other appropriate Person from contesting any such tax in
appropriate proceedings and shall not prevent the Trustee from withholding
payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the outcome of such
proceedings); (i) sign or cause to be signed federal, state or local income
tax or information returns; (j) maintain records relating to each REMIC
created hereunder, including but not limited to the income, expenses, assets
and liabilities of each such REMIC, and the fair market value and adjusted
basis of the Trust Fund property determined at such intervals as may be
required by the Code, as may be necessary to prepare the foregoing returns,
schedules, statements or information; and (k) as and when necessary and
appropriate, represent the Trust Fund in any administrative or judicial
proceedings relating to an examination or audit by any governmental taxing
authority, request an administrative adjustment as to any taxable year of any
REMIC created hereunder, enter into settlement agreements with any
governmental taxing agency, extend any statute of limitations relating to any
tax item of the Trust Fund, and otherwise act on behalf of any REMIC created
hereunder in relation to any tax matter involving any such REMIC.


                                     126

          In order to enable the Trustee to perform its duties as set forth
herein, the Depositor shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the Trustee
within 10 days after the Closing Date all information or data that the Trustee
requests in writing and determines to be relevant for tax purposes to the
valuations and offering prices of the Certificates, including, without
limitation, the price, yield, prepayment assumption and projected cash flows
of the Certificates and the Mortgage Loans. Thereafter, the Depositor shall
provide to the Trustee promptly upon written request therefor, any such
additional information or data that the Trustee may, from time to time,
request in order to enable the Trustee to perform its duties as set forth
herein. The Depositor hereby indemnifies the Trustee for any losses,
liabilities, damages, claims or expenses of the Trustee arising from any
errors or miscalculations of the Trustee that result from any failure of the
Depositor to provide, or to cause to be provided, accurate information or data
to the Trustee on a timely basis.

          In the event that any tax is imposed on "prohibited transactions" of
the Trust Fund as defined in section 860F(a)(2) of the Code, on the "net
income from foreclosure property" of the Trust Fund as defined in section
860G(c) of the Code, on any contribution to the Trust Fund after the startup
day pursuant to section 860G(d) of the Code, or any other tax is imposed,
including, without limitation, any federal, state or local tax or minimum tax
imposed upon the Trust Fund pursuant to sections 23153 and 24872 of the
California Revenue and Taxation Code if not paid as otherwise provided for
herein, such tax shall be paid by (i) the Trustee, if any such other tax
arises out of or results from a breach by the Trustee of any of its
obligations under this Agreement, (ii) (x) the Master Servicer, in the case of
any such minimum tax, and (y) any party hereto (other than the Trustee) to the
extent any such other tax arises out of or results from a breach by such other
party of any of its obligations under this Agreement or (iii) in all other
cases, or in the event that any liable party here fails to honor its
obligations under the preceding clauses (i) or (ii), any such tax will be paid
first with amounts otherwise to be distributed to the Class A-R
Certificateholders, and second with amounts otherwise to be distributed to all
other Certificateholders in the following order of priority: first, to the
Class B Certificates (pro rata), second, to the Class M-2 Certificates (pro
rata), third, to the Class M-1 Certificates (pro rata), fourth, to all classes
of Class AF Certificates (pro rata), and fifth to the Class A-R Certificates
and the Class AV-1 Certificates (pro rata). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, to the extent that such tax is payable by the Class
A-R Certificates, the Trustee is hereby authorized to retain on any
Distribution Date, from the Holders of the Class A-R Certificates (and, if
necessary, second, from the Holders of the all other Certificates in the
priority specified in the preceding sentence), funds otherwise distributable
to such Holders in an amount sufficient to pay such tax. The Trustee agrees to
promptly notify in writing the party liable for any such tax of the amount
thereof and the due date for the payment thereof.

          The Trustee shall treat the rights of the Interest Bearing
Certificateholders to receive payments from the Carryover Reserve Fund as
rights in an interest rate cap contract written by the holders of the Class C
Certificates (with respect to the amounts deemed payable from the Class C
Certificateholders and with respect to the Class AV-1 and Subordinate Cap
Contracts). Thus, each Class AV-1, Class AF-1, Class AF-2, Class AF-3, Class
AF-4, Class AF-5, Class AF-6, Class M-1, Class M-2 and Class B Certificate
shall be treated as representing ownership of not only an Upper Tier REMIC
Regular Interest, but also ownership of an interest in such interest rate cap
contract; provided, however, that the Class AF Certificates alone shall have
no rights or ownership interest with respect to that part of the interest rate
cap contract


                                     127
<PAGE>


relating to the Cap Contracts. For purposes of determining the issue price of
the Upper Tier REMIC Regular interests, the Trustee shall assume that the
interest rate cap contracts have a value of $444,500.

          Section 8.12 Co-Trustee.

          (a) The Co-Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates,
statements, opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments
furnished to the Co-Trustee that are specifically required to be furnished
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall examine them to determine
whether they conform to the requirements of this Agreement, to the extent
required by this Agreement. If any such instrument is found not to conform to
the requirements of this Agreement in a material manner, the Co-Trustee shall
take action as it deems appropriate to have the instrument corrected. In
addition, the Co-Trustee shall act as the insured under the Mortgage Insurance
Policy and hereby directs the Master Servicer, on behalf of the Co-Trustee, to
take all actions appropriate or required of the Co-Trustee under the Mortgage
Insurance Policy, other than the payment of the Mortgage Insurance Premium and
obtaining the approval of the Mortgage Insurer with respect to the appointment
of a successor servicer.

          (b) No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to relieve the
Co-Trustee from liability for its own grossly negligent action, its own gross
negligent failure to act or its own misconduct, its grossly negligent failure
to perform its obligations in compliance with this Agreement, or any liability
that would be imposed by reason of its willful misfeasance or bad faith;
provided that:

               (i) the duties and obligations of the Co-Trustee shall be
          determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement with
          the exception of Section 8.10, the Co-Trustee shall not be liable,
          individually or as Co-Trustee, except for the performance of such
          duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this
          Agreement, no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into
          this Agreement against the Co-Trustee and the Co-Trustee may
          conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the
          correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates
          or opinions furnished to the Co-Trustee and conforming to the
          requirements of this Agreement that it reasonably believed in good
          faith to be genuine and to have been duly executed by the proper
          authorities respecting any matters arising hereunder; and

               (ii) the Co-Trustee shall not be liable, individually or as
          Co-Trustee, for an error of judgment made in good faith by a
          Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, unless
          the Co-Trustee was grossly negligent or acted in bad faith or with
          willful misfeasance.

          (c) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) above:

               (i) the Co-Trustee may request and rely upon and shall be
          protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution,
          Officer's Certificate, certificate of auditors or any other
          certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
          request, consent, order, appraisal, bond or other paper or document
          believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by
          the proper party or parties;


                                     128
<PAGE>


               (ii) the Co-Trustee may consult with counsel and any Opinion of
          Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in
          respect of any action taken or suffered or omitted by it hereunder
          in good faith and in accordance with such Opinion of Counsel;

               (iii) the Co-Trustee shall not be liable, individually or as
          Co-Trustee, for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good
          faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion
          or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Agreement;

               (iv) the Co-Trustee shall not be bound to make any
          investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution,
          certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
          request, consent, order, approval, bond or other paper or document;

               (v) the Co-Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers
          hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or
          through agents, accountants or attorneys; and

               (vi) the Co-Trustee shall not be required to expend its own
          funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance
          of any of its duties hereunder if it shall have reasonable grounds
          for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity
          against such liability is not assured to it.

          (d) The recitals contained herein shall be taken as the statements
of the Depositor or the Master Servicer, as the case may be, and the
Co-Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness. The Co-Trustee
makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Agreement
or of any Mortgage Loan or related document or of MERS or the MERS(R) System
other than with respect to the Co-Trustee's execution and authentication of
the Certificates. The Co-Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or
application by the Depositor or the Master Servicer of any funds paid to the
Depositor or the Master Servicer in respect of the Mortgage Loans or deposited
in or withdrawn from the Certificate Account by the Depositor or the Master
Servicer.

          (e) The Co-Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may
become the owner or pledgee of Certificates with the same rights as it would
have if it were not the Co-Trustee.

          (f) The Master Servicer covenants and agrees (i) to pay to the
Co-Trustee from time to time, and the Co-Trustee shall be entitled to, such
compensation as shall be agreed in writing by the Master Servicer and the
Co-Trustee (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to
the compensation of a trustee of an express trust) for all services rendered
by it in the execution of the trusts hereby created and in the exercise and
performance of any of the powers and duties hereunder of the Co-Trustee and
(ii) to pay or reimburse the Co-Trustee, upon its request, for all reasonable
expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Co-Trustee on
behalf of the Trust Fund in accordance with any of the provisions of this
Agreement (including, without limitation: (A) the reasonable compensation and
the


                                     129
<PAGE>


expenses and disbursements of its counsel, but only for representation of the
Co-Trustee acting in its capacity as Co-Trustee hereunder and (B) to the
extent that the Co-Trustee must engage persons not regularly in its employ to
perform acts or services on behalf of the Trust Fund, which acts or services
are not in the ordinary course of the duties of a trustee, paying agent or
certificate registrar, in the absence of a breach or default by any party
hereto, the reasonable compensation, expenses and disbursements of such
persons, except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from
its negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct). The Co-Trustee and any
director, officer, employee or agent of the Co-Trustee shall be indemnified by
the Master Servicer and held harmless against any loss, liability or expense
(i) incurred in connection with any legal action relating to this Agreement or
the Certificates, or in connection with the performance of any of the
Co-Trustee's duties hereunder, other than any loss, liability or expense
incurred by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the
performance of any of the Co-Trustee's duties hereunder or by reason of
reckless disregard of the Co-Trustee's obligations and duties hereunder and
(ii) resulting from any error in any tax or information return prepared by the
Master Servicer. Such indemnity shall survive the termination of this
Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Co-Trustee hereunder.

          (g) The Co-Trustee hereunder shall, at all times, be a corporation
or association organized and doing business under the laws of a state or the
United States of America, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate
trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000,
subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and with a
credit rating that would not cause any of the Rating Agencies to reduce their
respective ratings of any Class of Certificates below the ratings issued on
the Closing Date (or having provided such security from time to time as is
sufficient to avoid such reduction). If such corporation or association
publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the
requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the
purposes of this Section 8.12 the combined capital and surplus of such
corporation or association shall be deemed to be its combined capital and
surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. In
case at any time the Co-Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 8.12, the Co-Trustee shall resign immediately
in the manner and with the effect specified in paragraph (h) below. The
corporation or national banking association serving as Co-Trustee may have
normal banking and trust relationships with the Depositor, the Seller and the
Master Servicer and their respective affiliates; provided that such
corporation cannot be an affiliate of the Master Servicer other than the
Trustee in its role as successor to the Master Servicer.

          (h) The Co-Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the
trusts hereby created by giving 30 days prior written notice of resignation to
the Trustee, the Depositor and the Master Servicer. Upon such resignation the
Trustee (x) may appoint a successor Co-Trustee meeting the requirements in
paragraph (g) above and acceptable to the Master Servicer (in its sole
discretion), so long as such Co-Trustee executes and delivers to the other
parties hereto an instrument agreeing to be bound by the provisions of this
Agreement or (y) may if permitted by the Master Servicer (in its sole
discretion) assume the rights and duties of the resigning Co-Trustee so long
as the Trustee executes and delivers an instrument to that effect.

          Section 8.13 Access to Records of the Trustee.

          The Trustee and any Co-Trustee shall afford the Seller, the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the NIM Insurer and each Certificateholder
upon reasonable notice during normal business hours access to all records
maintained by the Trustee or Co-Trustee in respect of its duties under this
Agreement and access to officers of the Trustee responsible for performing its
duties. Upon request, the Trustee and Co-Trustee shall furnish the Depositor,
the Master Servicer, the NIM Insurer and any requesting Certificateholder with
its most recent financial statements. The Trustee shall cooperate fully with
the Seller, the Master Servicer, the Depositor, the NIM Insurer and the
Certificateholder for review and copying any books, documents, or records
requested with respect to the Trustee's and Co-Trustee's respective duties
under this Agreement. The Seller, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, and the
Certificateholder shall not have any responsibility or liability for any
action for failure to act by the Trustee or the Co-Trustee and are not
obligated to supervise the performance of the Trustee under this Agreement or
otherwise.

          Section 8.14 Suits for Enforcement.

          If an Event of Default or other material default by the Master
Servicer or the Depositor under this Agreement occurs and is continuing, at
the direction of the Certificateholders holding not less than 51% of the
Voting Rights or the NIM Insurer, the Trustee shall proceed to protect and
enforce its rights and the rights of the Certificateholders or the NIM Insurer
under this Agreement by a suit, action, or proceeding in equity or at law or
otherwise, whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or in aid of the execution of any power granted in
this Agreement or for the enforcement of any other legal, equitable, or other
remedy, as the Trustee, being advised by counsel, and subject to the
foregoing, shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of the rights
of the Trustee, the NIM Insurer and the Certificateholders.

                                  ARTICLE IX.
                                  TERMINATION

          Section 9.01 Termination upon Liquidation or Repurchase of all
                       Mortgage Loans.

          Subject to Section 9.03, the Trust Fund shall terminate and the
obligations and responsibilities of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the
Seller and the Trustee created hereby shall terminate upon the earlier of (a)
the purchase on a Distribution Date by the Master Servicer or the NIMs Insurer
of all of the Mortgage Loans (and REO Properties) remaining in the Trust Fund
at the price equal to the sum of (i) 100% of the Stated Principal Balance of
each Mortgage Loan in the Trust Fund (other than in respect of an REO
Property), (ii) accrued interest thereon at the applicable Mortgage Rate (or,
if such repurchase is effected by the Master Servicer, at the applicable Net
Mortgage Rate), (iii) the appraised value of any REO Property in the Trust
Fund (up to the Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan), such
appraisal to be conducted by an appraiser mutually agreed upon by the Master
Servicer and the Trustee and (iv) any unreimbursed Servicing Advances, and the
principal portion of any unreimbursed Advances, made on the Mortgage Loans
prior to the exercise of such repurchase and (b) the later of (i) the


                                     131
<PAGE>


maturity or other liquidation (or any Advance with respect thereto) of the
last Mortgage Loan remaining in the Trust Fund and the disposition of all REO
Property and (ii) the distribution to related Certificateholders of all
amounts required to be distributed to them pursuant to this Agreement, as
applicable. In no event shall the trusts created hereby continue beyond the
earlier of (i) the expiration of 21 years from the death of the last survivor
of the descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy, the late Ambassador of the United
States to the Court of St. James's, living on the date hereof and (ii) the
Latest Possible Maturity Date.

          The right to purchase all Mortgage Loans and REO Properties by the
Master Servicer or the NIMs Insurer (the party exercising such purchase
option, the "Terminator") pursuant to clause (a) above shall be conditioned
upon the Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans, at the time of any
such repurchase, aggregating ten percent (10%) or less of the sum of (x) the
Stated Principal Balance of the Initial Mortgage Loans as of the Initial
Cut-off Date and (y) the Pre-Funded Amount.

          Section 9.02 Final Distribution on the Certificates.

          If on any Determination Date, (i) the Master Servicer determines
that there are no Outstanding Mortgage Loans and no other funds or assets in a
Loan Group other than the funds in the Certificate Account related to such
Loan Group, the Master Servicer shall direct the Trustee to send a final
distribution notice promptly to each related Certificateholder or (ii) the
Trustee determines that a Class of Certificates shall be retired after a final
distribution on such Class, the Trustee shall notify the related
Certificateholders within five (5) Business Days after such Determination Date
that the final distribution in retirement of such Class of Certificates is
scheduled to be made on the immediately following Distribution Date. Any final
distribution made pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence will be made
only upon presentation and surrender of the related Certificates at the
Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. If the Master Servicer elects to
terminate pursuant to clause (a) of Section 9.01, at least 20 days prior to
the date notice is to be mailed to the affected Certificateholders, such
electing party shall notify the Depositor and the Trustee of the date such
electing party intends to terminate and of the applicable repurchase price of
the related Mortgage Loans and REO Properties.

          Notice of any termination, specifying the Distribution Date on which
related Certificateholders may surrender their Certificates for payment of the
final distribution and cancellation, shall be given promptly by the Trustee by
letter to related Certificateholders mailed not earlier than the 10th day and
no later than the 15th day of the month immediately preceding the month of
such final distribution. Any such notice shall specify (a) the Distribution
Date upon which final distribution on related Certificates will be made upon
presentation and surrender of such Certificates at the office therein
designated, (b) the amount of such final distribution, (c) the location of the
office or agency at which such presentation and surrender must be made, and
(d) that the Record Date otherwise applicable to such Distribution Date is not
applicable, distributions being made only upon presentation and surrender of
such Certificates at the office therein specified. The Master Servicer will
give such notice to each Rating Agency at the time such notice is given to the
affected Certificateholders.

          In the event such notice is given, the Master Servicer shall cause
all funds in the Certificate Account to be remitted to the Trustee for deposit
in the Distribution Account on the


                                     132
<PAGE>


Business Day prior to the applicable Distribution Date in an amount equal to
the final distribution in respect of the Certificates. Upon such final deposit
and the receipt by the Trustee of a Request for Release therefor, the
Co-Trustee shall promptly release to the Master Servicer the Mortgage Files
for the Mortgage Loans.

          Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates, the Trustee
shall cause to be distributed to Certificateholders of each affected Class the
amounts allocable to such Certificates held in the Distribution Account (and,
if applicable, the Carryover Reserve Fund) in the order and priority set forth
in Section 4.04 hereof on the final Distribution Date and in proportion to
their respective Percentage Interests.

          In the event that any affected Certificateholders shall not
surrender related Certificates for cancellation within six months after the
date specified in the above mentioned written notice, the Trustee shall give a
second written notice to the remaining Certificateholders to surrender their
related Certificates for cancellation and receive the final distribution with
respect thereto. If within six months after the second notice all the
applicable Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the
Trustee may take appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take
appropriate steps, to contact the remaining Certificateholders concerning
surrender of their Certificates, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the
funds and other assets that remain a part of the Loan Group. If within one
year after the second notice all related Certificates shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, the Class A-R Certificates (in the case of Loan
Group 1 and Loan Group 2) shall be entitled to all unclaimed funds and other
assets of the Loan Group that relate to such Class of Certificates and remain
subject hereto.

          Section 9.03 Additional Termination Requirements.

          (a) In the event the Terminator exercises its purchase option, the
Trust Fund shall be terminated in accordance with the following additional
requirements, unless the Trustee has been supplied with an Opinion of Counsel,
at the expense of the Terminator, to the effect that the failure of the Trust
Fund to comply with the requirements of this Section 9.03 will not (i) result
in the imposition of taxes on "prohibited transactions" of a REMIC, or (ii)
cause any REMIC created hereunder to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time
that any Certificates are outstanding:

               (1) The Master Servicer shall establish a 90-day liquidation
period and notify the Trustee thereof, which shall in turn specify the first
day of such period in a statement attached to the Trust Fund's final Tax
Return pursuant to Treasury Regulation section 1.860F-1. The Master Servicer
shall prepare a plan of complete liquidation and shall otherwise satisfy all
the requirements of a qualified liquidation under section 860F of the Code and
any regulations thereunder, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel delivered to
the Trustee and the Depositor obtained at the expense of the Terminator;

               (2) During such 90-day liquidation period, and at or prior to
the time of making the final payment on the Certificates, the Master Servicer
as agent of the Trustee shall sell all of the assets of the Trust Fund to the
Terminator for cash; and


                                     133
<PAGE>


               (3) At the time of the making of the final payment on the
Certificates, the Trustee shall distribute or credit, or cause to be
distributed or credited, to the Class A-R Certificateholders all cash on hand
(other than cash retained to meet claims) related to such Class of
Certificates, and the Trust Fund shall terminate at that time.

          (b) By their acceptance of the Certificates, the Holders thereof
hereby authorize the Master Servicer to specify the 90-day liquidation period
for the Trust Fund, which authorization shall be binding upon all successor
Certificateholders. The Trustee shall attach a statement to the final federal
income tax return for each of any REMIC created hereunder stating that
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.860F-1, the first day of the 90-day
liquidation period for each the REMIC was the date on which the Trustee sold
the assets of the Trust Fund to the Master Servicer.

          (c) The Trustee as agent for each REMIC created hereunder hereby
agrees to adopt and sign such a plan of complete liquidation upon the written
request of the Master Servicer, and the receipt of the Opinion of Counsel
referred to in Section 9.03(a)(1), and together with the Holders of the Class
A-R Certificates agree to take such other action in connection therewith as
may be reasonably requested by the Terminator.

                                  ARTICLE X.
                           MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

          Section 10.01 Amendment.

          This Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Depositor,
the Master Servicer, the Seller, the Co-Trustee and the Trustee with the
consent of the NIM Insurer, without the consent of any of the
Certificateholders to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any
provisions herein, or to make such other provisions with respect to matters or
questions arising under this Agreement, as shall not be inconsistent with any
other provisions herein if such action shall not, as evidenced by an Opinion
of Counsel, adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any
Certificateholder; provided that any such amendment shall be deemed not to
adversely affect in any material respect the interests of the
Certificateholders and no such Opinion of Counsel shall be required if the
Person requesting such amendment obtains a letter from each Rating Agency
stating that such amendment would not result in the downgrading or withdrawal
of the respective ratings then assigned to the Certificates, it being
understood and agreed that any such letter in and of itself will not represent
a determination as to the materiality of any such amendment and will represent
a determination only as to the credit issues affecting any such rating. Any
amendment described above, made solely to conform this Agreement to the
Prospectus Supplement shall be deemed not to adversely affect in any material
respect the interests of the Certificateholders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no amendment that significantly changes the permitted activities of
the trust created by this Agreement may be made without the consent of
Certificateholders representing not less than 51% of the Voting Rights of each
Class of Certificates affected by such amendment.

          The Trustee, the Co-Trustee, the Depositor, the Master Servicer and
the Seller with the consent of the NIM Insurer may also at any time and from
time to time amend this Agreement, without the consent of the
Certificateholders, to modify, eliminate or add to any of


                                     134
<PAGE>


its provisions to such extent as shall be necessary or appropriate to maintain
the qualification of the Trust Fund as a REMIC under the Code or to avoid or
minimize the risk of the imposition of any tax on the Trust Fund pursuant to
the Code that would be a claim against the Trust Fund at any time prior to the
final redemption of the Certificates, provided that the Trustee have been
provided an Opinion of Counsel, which opinion shall be an expense of the party
requesting such opinion but in any case shall not be an expense of the
Trustee, to the effect that such action is necessary or appropriate to
maintain such qualification or to avoid or minimize the risk of the imposition
of such a tax.

          This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Seller, the Co-Trustee and the Trustee
with the consent of the NIM Insurer and the Holders of each Class of
Certificates affected thereby evidencing not less than 51% of the Voting
Rights of such Class for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing
in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement or of
modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Certificates; provided
that no such amendment shall (i) reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay
the timing of, payments required to be distributed on any Certificate without
the consent of the Holder of such Certificate, (ii) adversely affect in any
material respect the interests of the Holders of any Class of Certificates in
a manner other than as described in (i), without the consent of the Holders of
Certificates of such Class evidencing 66% or more of the Voting Rights of such
Class, or (iii) reduce the aforesaid percentages of Certificates the Holders
of which are required to consent to any such amendment without the consent of
the Holders of all such Certificates then outstanding.

          Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, the
Trustee shall not consent to any amendment to this Agreement unless the
Trustee and the NIM Insurer shall have first received an Opinion of Counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the NIM Insurer, which opinion
shall be an expense of the party requesting such amendment but in any case
shall not be an expense of the Trustee or the NIM Insurer, to the effect that
such amendment will not cause the imposition of any tax on the Trust Fund or
the Certificateholders or cause any REMIC formed hereunder to fail to qualify
as a REMIC at any time that any Certificates are outstanding.

          Promptly after the execution of any amendment to this Agreement
requiring the consent of Certificateholders, the Trustee shall furnish written
notification of the substance of such amendment to each Certificateholder and
each Rating Agency.

          It shall not be necessary for the consent of Certificateholders
under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment,
but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance
thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the
authorization of the execution thereof by Certificateholders shall be subject
to such reasonable regulations as the Trustee may prescribe.

          Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Trustee to enter into an
amendment without receiving an Opinion of Counsel, reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee and the NIM Insurer that (i) such amendment is permitted and is
not prohibited by this Agreement and that all requirements for amending this
Agreement have been complied with; and (ii) either (A) the amendment does not
adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any


                                     135
<PAGE>


Certificateholder or (B) the conclusion set forth in the immediately preceding
clause (A) is not required to be reached pursuant to this Section 10.01.

          Section 10.02 Recordation of Agreement; Counterparts.

          This Agreement is subject to recordation in all appropriate public
offices for real property records in all the counties or other comparable
jurisdictions in which any or all of the properties subject to the Mortgages
are situated, and in any other appropriate public recording office or
elsewhere, such recordation to be effected by the Master Servicer at its
expense.

          For the purpose of facilitating the recordation of this Agreement as
herein provided and for other purposes, this Agreement may be executed
simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which counterparts shall
be deemed to be an original, and such counterparts shall constitute but one
and the same instrument.

          Section 10.03 Governing Law.

          THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY
THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE
AND TO BE PERFORMED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND
REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HERETO AND THE CERTIFICATEHOLDERS SHALL BE DETERMINED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

          Section 10.04 Intention of Parties.

          It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the conveyance
of the Mortgage Notes, Mortgages, assignments of Mortgages, title insurance
policies and any modifications, extensions and/or assumption agreements and
private mortgage insurance policies relating to the Mortgage Loans by the
Depositor to the Trustee be, and be construed as, an absolute sale thereof to
the Trustee. It is, further, not the intention of the parties that such
conveyance be deemed a pledge thereof by the Depositor to the Trustee.
However, in the event that, notwithstanding the intent of the parties, such
assets are held to be the property of the Depositor, or if for any other
reason this Agreement or any Subsequent Transfer Agreement is held or deemed
to create a security interest in such assets, then (i) this Agreement shall be
deemed to be a security agreement (within the meaning of the Uniform
Commercial Code of the State of New York) with respect to all such assets and
security interests and (ii) the conveyance provided for in this Agreement and
any Subsequent Transfer Agreement shall be deemed to be an assignment and a
grant pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by the Depositor to the Trustee,
for the benefit of the Certificateholders, of a security interest in all of
the assets that constitute the Trust Fund, whether now owned or hereafter
acquired.

          The Depositor for the benefit of the Certificateholders and the NIM
Insurer shall, to the extent consistent with this Agreement, take such actions
as may be necessary to ensure that, if this Agreement were deemed to create a

liabilities of the parties hereto or any of them.

          No Certificateholder shall have any right to vote (except as
provided herein) or in any manner otherwise control the operation and
management of the Trust Fund, or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor
shall anything herein set forth or contained in the terms of the Certificates

partners or members of an association; nor shall any Certificateholder be
under any liability to any third party by reason of any action taken by the

itself of any provisions of this Agreement to institute any suit, action or
proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this

after its receipt of such notice,


                                     138
<PAGE>


request and offer of indemnity shall have neglected or refused to institute
any such action, suit or proceeding; it being understood and intended, and
being expressly covenanted by each Certificateholder with every other
Certificateholder and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders of Certificates
shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue or by availing itself or
themselves of any provisions of this Agreement to affect, disturb or prejudice
the rights of the Holders of any other of the Certificates, or to obtain or
seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such Holder or to
enforce any right under this Agreement, except in the manner herein provided
and for the common benefit of all Certificateholders. For the protection and
enforcement of the provisions of this Section 10.08, each and every
Certificateholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be
given either at law or in equity.

          Section 10.09 Inspection and Audit Rights.

          The Master Servicer agrees that, on reasonable prior notice, it will
permit any representative of the Depositor, the Seller, the NIM Insurer or the
Trustee during the Master Servicer's normal business hours, to examine all the
books of account, records, reports and other papers of the Master Servicer
relating to the Mortgage Loans, to make copies and extracts therefrom, to
cause such books to be audited by independent certified public accountants
selected by the Depositor, the Seller or the Trustee, which certified public
accountants shall be reasonably acceptable to the NIM Insurer, and to discuss
its affairs, finances and accounts relating to the Mortgage Loans with its
officers, employees and independent public accountants (and by this provision
the Master Servicer hereby authorizes such accountants to discuss with such
representative such affairs, finances and accounts), all at such reasonable
times and as often as may be reasonably requested. Any out-of-pocket expense
incident to the exercise by the Depositor, the Seller, the NIM Insurer or the
Trustee of any right under this Section 10.09 shall be borne by the party
requesting such inspection; all other such expenses shall be borne by the
Master Servicer.

          Section 10.10 Certificates Nonassessable and Fully Paid.

          It is the intention of the Depositor that Certificateholders shall
not be personally liable for obligations of the Trust Fund, that the interests
in the Trust Fund represented by the Certificates shall be nonassessable for
any reason whatsoever, and that the Certificates, upon due authentication
thereof by the Trustee pursuant to this Agreement, are and shall be deemed
fully paid.

          Section 10.11 Rights of NIM Insurer.

          (a) The rights of the NIM Insurer under this Agreement shall exist
only so long as either:

               (i) the notes certain payments on which are guaranteed by the
          NIM Insurer remain outstanding or

               (ii) the NIM Insurer is owed amounts paid by it with respect to
          that guaranty.


                                     139
<PAGE>


          (b) The rights of the NIM Insurer under this Agreement are
exercisable by the NIM Insurer only so long as no default by the NIM Insurer
under its guaranty of certain payments under notes backed principally by the
Class C and Class P Certificates has occurred and is continuing. If the NIM
Insurer is the subject of any insolvency proceeding, the rights of the NIM
Insurer under this Agreement will be exercisable by the NIM Insurer only so
long as:

               (i) the obligations of the NIM Insurer under its guaranty of
          notes backed principally by the Class C and Class P Certificates
          have not been disavowed and

               (ii) the Seller and the Trustee have received reasonable
          assurances that the NIM Insurer will be able to satisfy its
          obligations under its guaranty of notes backed principally by the
          Class C or Class P Certificates.

          (c) The NIM Insurer is a third party beneficiary of this Agreement
to the same extent as if it were a party to this Agreement and may enforce any
of those rights under this Agreement.

          (d) A copy of any documents of any nature required by this Agreement
to be delivered by the Trustee, or to the Trustee or the Rating Agencies,
shall in each case at the same time also be delivered to the NIM Insurer. Any
notices required to be given by the Trustee, or to the Trustee or the Rating
Agencies, shall in each case at the same time also be given to the NIM
Insurer.

          Anything in this Agreement that is conditioned on not resulting in
the downgrading or withdrawal of the ratings then assigned to the Certificates
by the Rating Agencies shall also be conditioned on not resulting in the
downgrading or withdrawal of the ratings then assigned by the Rating Agencies
to the notes backed principally by the Class C and Class P Certificates.

               TRANSFER AFFIDAVIT FOR THE CLASS A-R CERTIFICATES

STATE OF                   )
                           ) ss.:
COUNTY OF                  )

          The undersigned, being first duly sworn, deposes and says as
follows:

          1. The undersigned is an officer of _______________, the proposed
Transferee of an Ownership Interest in a Class A-R Certificate (the
"Certificate") issued pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated
as of December 1, 2002 (the "Agreement"), by and among CWABS, Inc., as
depositor (the "Depositor"), Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., as Seller,
Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP, as Master Servicer, The Bank of New York,
as Trustee, and BNY Western Trust Company, as Co-Trustee. Capitalized terms
used, but not defined herein or in Exhibit 1 hereto, shall have the meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Agreement. The Transferee has authorized the
undersigned to make this affidavit on behalf of the Transferee.

          2. The Transferee is not an employee benefit plan that is subject to
Title I of ERISA or to section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, nor
is it acting on behalf of or with plan assets of any such plan. The Transferee
is, as of the date hereof, and will be, as of the date of the Transfer, a
Permitted Transferee. The Transferee is acquiring its Ownership Interest in
the Certificate for its own account.

          3. The Transferee has been advised of, and understands that (i) a
tax will be imposed on Transfers of the Certificate to Persons that are not
Permitted Transferees; (ii) such tax will be imposed on the transferor, or, if
such Transfer is through an agent (which includes a broker, nominee or
middleman) for a Person that is not a Permitted Transferee, on the agent; and
(iii) the Person otherwise liable for the tax shall be relieved of liability
for the tax if the subsequent Transferee furnished to such Person an affidavit
that such subsequent Transferee is a Permitted Transferee and, at the time of
Transfer, such Person does not have actual knowledge that the affidavit is
false.

          4. The Transferee has been advised of, and understands that a tax
will be imposed on a "pass-through entity" holding the Certificate if at any
time during the taxable year of the pass-through entity a Person that is not a
Permitted Transferee is the record holder of an interest in such entity. The
Transferee understands that such tax will not be imposed for any period with
respect to which the record holder furnishes to the pass-through entity an
affidavit that such record holder is a Permitted Transferee and the
pass-through entity does not have actual knowledge that such affidavit is
false. (For this purpose, a "pass-through entity" includes a regulated
investment company, a real estate investment trust or common trust fund, a
partnership, trust or estate, and certain cooperatives and, except as may be
provided in Treasury Regulations, persons holding interests in pass-through
entities as a nominee for another Person.)


                                    I-1-1
<PAGE>


          5. The Transferee has reviewed the provisions of Section 5.02(c) of
the Agreement (attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by
reference) and understands the legal consequences of the acquisition of an
Ownership Interest in the Certificate including, without limitation, the
restrictions on subsequent Transfers and the provisions regarding voiding the
Transfer and mandatory sales. The Transferee expressly agrees to be bound by
and to abide by the provisions of Section 5.02(c) of the Agreement and the
restrictions noted on the face of the Certificate. The Transferee understands
and agrees that any breach of any of the representations included herein shall
render the Transfer to the Transferee contemplated hereby null and void.

          6. The Transferee agrees to require a Transfer Affidavit from any
Person to whom the Transferee attempts to Transfer its Ownership Interest in
the Certificate, and in connection with any Transfer by a Person for whom the
Transferee is acting as nominee, trustee or agent, and the Transferee will not
Transfer its Ownership Interest or cause any Ownership Interest to be
Transferred to any Person that the Transferee knows is not a Permitted
Transferee. In connection with any such Transfer by the Transferee, the
Transferee agrees to deliver to the Trustee a certificate substantially in the
form set forth as Exhibit J-1 to the Agreement (a "Transferor Certificate") to
the effect that such Transferee has no actual knowledge that the Person to
which the Transfer is to be made is not a Permitted Transferee.

          7. The Transferee does not have the intention to impede the
assessment or collection of any tax legally required to be paid with respect
to the Class A-R Certificates.

          8. The Transferee's taxpayer identification number is _____.

          9. The Transferee is a U.S. Person as defined in Code section
7701(a)(30).

          10. The Transferee is aware that the Class A-R Certificates may be
"noneconomic residual interests" within the meaning of proposed Treasury
regulations promulgated pursuant to the Code and that the transferor of a
noneconomic residual interest will remain liable for any taxes due with
respect to the income on such residual interest, unless no significant purpose
of the transfer was to impede the assessment or collection of tax. In
addition, as the holder of a noneconomic residual interest, the Transferee may
incur tax liabilities in excess of any cash flows generated by the interest
and the Transferee hereby represents that it intends to pay taxes associated
with holding the residual interest as they become due.

          11. The Transferee has provided financial statements or other
financial information requested by the Transferor in connection with the
transfer of the Class A-R Certificates to permit the Transferor to assess the
financial capability of the Transferee to pay such taxes.

                                     * * *

                              Certain Definitions

          "Ownership Interest": As to any Certificate, any ownership interest
in such Certificate, including any interest in such Certificate as the Holder
thereof and any other interest therein, whether direct or indirect, legal or
beneficial.

          "Permitted Transferee": Any person other than (i) the United States,
any State or political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality
of any of the foregoing, (ii) a foreign government, International Organization
or any agency or instrumentality of either of the foregoing, (iii) an
organization (except certain farmers' cooperatives described in section 521 of
the Code) that is exempt from tax imposed by Chapter 1 of the Code (including
the tax imposed by section 511 of the Code on unrelated business taxable
income) on any excess inclusions (as defined in section 860E(c)(1) of the
Code) with respect to any Class A-R Certificate, (iv) rural electric and
telephone cooperatives described in section 1381(a)(2)(C) of the Code, (v) an
"electing large partnership" as defined in section 775 of the Code, (vi) a
Person that is not a citizen or resident of the United States, a corporation,
partnership, or other entity (treated as a corporation or a partnership for
federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, or an estate
whose income from sources without the United States is includible in gross
income for United States federal income tax purposes regardless of its
connection with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States,
or a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary
supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United States
persons have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trustor
unless such Person has furnished the transferor and the Trustee with a duly
completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, and (vii) any other Person so
designated by the Trustee based upon an Opinion of Counsel that the Transfer

"International Organization" shall have the meanings set forth in section 7701
of the Code or successor provisions. A corporation will not be treated as an
instrumentality of the United States or of any State or political subdivision

of its board of directors is not selected by such government unit.

                       Section 5.02(c) of the Agreement

                (c) Each Person who has or who acquires any Ownership Interest
in a Class A-R Certificate shall be deemed by the acceptance or acquisition of
such Ownership Interest to have agreed to be bound by the following provisions,
and the rights of each Person acquiring any Ownership Interest in a Class A-R
Certificate are expressly subject to the following provisions:

                   (i) Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest
          in a Class A-R Certificate shall be a Permitted Transferee and shall
          promptly notify the Trustee of any change or impending change in its
          status as a Permitted Transferee.

                   (ii) No Ownership Interest in a Class A-R Certificate may be
          registered on the Closing Date or thereafter transferred, and the
          Trustee shall not register the Transfer of any Class A-R Certificate
          unless, the Trustee shall have been furnished with an affidavit (a
          "Transfer Affidavit") of the initial owner or the proposed transferee
          in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I-1 or Exhibit I-2,
          respectively.

                   (iii) Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership
          Interest in a Class A-R Certificate shall agree (A) to obtain a
          Transfer Affidavit from any other Person to whom such Person attempts
          to Transfer its Ownership Interest in a Class A-R Certificate, (B) to
          obtain a Transfer Affidavit from any Person for whom such Person is
          acting as nominee, trustee or agent in connection with any Transfer
          of a Class A-R Certificate and (C) not to Transfer its Ownership
          Interest in a Class A-R Certificate, or to cause the Transfer of an
          Ownership Interest in a Class A-R Certificate to any other Person, if
          it has actual knowledge that such Person is not a Permitted
          Transferee.

                   (iv) Any attempted or purported Transfer of any Ownership
          Interest in a Class A-R Certificate in violation of the provisions of
          this Section 5.02(c) shall be absolutely null and void and shall vest
          no rights in the purported Transferee. If any purported transferee
          shall become a Holder of a Class A-R Certificate in violation of the
          provisions of this Section 5.02(c), then the last preceding Permitted
          Transferee shall be restored to all rights as Holder thereof
          retroactive to the date of registration of Transfer of such Class A-R
          Certificate. The Trustee shall be under no liability to any Person
          for any registration of Transfer of a Class A-R Certificate that is
          in fact not permitted by Section 5.02(b) and this Section 5.02(c) or
          for making any payments due on such Certificate to the Holder thereof
          or taking any other action with respect to such Holder under the
          provisions of this Agreement so long as the Transfer was registered
          after receipt of the related Transfer Affidavit and Transferor
          Certificate. The Trustee shall be entitled but not obligated to
          recover from any Holder of a Class A-R Certificate that was in fact
          not a Permitted Transferee at the time it became a Holder or, at such
          subsequent time as it became other than a Permitted Transferee, all
          payments made on such Class A-R Certificate at and after either such
          time. Any such payments so recovered by the Trustee shall be paid and
          delivered by the Trustee to the last preceding Permitted Transferee
          of such Certificate.

                   (v) The Master Servicer shall use its best efforts to make
          available, upon receipt of written request from the Trustee, all
          information necessary to compute any tax

                                    I-1-5

<PAGE>

          imposed under section 860E(e) of the Code as a result of a Transfer
          of an Ownership Interest in a Class A-R Certificate to any Holder
          who is not a Permitted Transferee.

          The restrictions on Transfers of a Class A-R Certificate set forth
in this section 5.02(c) shall cease to apply (and the applicable portions of
the legend on a Class A-R Certificate may be deleted) with respect to
Transfers occurring after delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel,
which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Trustee, the Seller or
the Master Servicer to the effect that the elimination of such restrictions
will not cause any constituent REMIC of any REMIC formed hereunder to fail to
qualify as a REMIC at any time that the Certificates are outstanding or result
in the imposition of any tax on the Trust Fund, a Certificateholder or another
Person. Each Person holding or acquiring any ownership Interest in a Class A-R
Certificate hereby consents to any amendment of this Agreement that, based on
an Opinion of Counsel furnished to the Trustee, is reasonably necessary (a) to
ensure that the record ownership of, or any beneficial interest in, a Class
A-R Certificate is not transferred, directly or indirectly, to a Person that
is not a Permitted Transferee and (b) to provide for a means to compel the
Transfer of a Class A-R Certificate that is held by a Person that is not a
Permitted Transferee to a Holder that is a Permitted Transferee.

receive answers from the Depositor concerning the purchase of the Certificates
and all matters relating thereto or any additional information deemed
necessary to our decision to purchase the Certificates, (d) either (i) we are

acting on behalf of any such plan or arrangement, nor are we using the assets
of any such plan or arrangement to effect such acquisition or (ii) if the
Certificates have been the subject of an ERISA-Qualifying Underwriting and we
are an insurance company, we are an insurance company which is purchasing such

acting on behalf of any such plan or arrangement, nor are we using the assets

Certificates have been the subject of an ERISA-Qualifying Underwriting and we
are an insurance company, we are an insurance company which is purchasing such
Certificates with funds contained in an "insurance company general account"

would render the disposition of the Certificates a violation of Section 5 of

respect to the Certificates, (f) we are a "qualified institutional buyer" as

            generally accepted accounting principles and if the investments
            of such subsidiaries are managed under the Buyer's direction.

            the Certificates are relying and will continue to rely on the
            statements made herein because one or more sales to the Buyer
            may be in reliance on Rule 144A.

         Until the date of purchase of the Rule 144A Securities, the Buyer
            will notify each of the parties to which this certification is
            made of any changes in the information and conclusions herein.
            Until such notice is given, the Buyer's purchase of the
            Certificates will constitute a reaffirmation of this
            certification as of the date of such purchase. In addition, if

            Buyer agrees that it will furnish to such parties updated annual

                     FORM OF SUBSEQUENT TRANSFER AGREEMENT

          SUBSEQUENT TRANSFER AGREEMENT, dated as of ____________, 200[_]
(this "Subsequent Transfer Agreement"), among CWABS, INC., a Delaware
corporation, as depositor (the "Depositor"), COUNTRYWIDE HOME LOANS, INC., a
New York corporation, in its capacity as seller under the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement referred to below ( the "Seller") and The Bank of New
York, a New York banking corporation, as trustee (the "Trustee");

          WHEREAS, the Depositor, the Seller, the Trustee and Countrywide Home
Loans Servicing LP, as Master Servicer, have entered in the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2002 (the "Pooling and Servicing
Agreement"), relating to the CWABS, Inc. Asset-Backed Certificates, Series
2002-6 (capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are used as defined in
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement);

          WHEREAS, Section 2.01(b) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
provides for the parties hereto to enter into this Subsequent Transfer
Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement;

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good
and valuable consideration the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged the parties hereto agree as follows:

          (a) The "Subsequent Transfer Date" with respect to this Subsequent
Transfer Agreement shall be ________ __, 200[_].

          (b) The "Subsequent Transfer Date Aggregate Purchase Amount" with
respect to this Subsequent Transfer Agreement shall be $_______________;
provided, however, that such amount shall not exceed the amount on deposit in
the Pre-Funding Account.

          (c) [reserved]

          (d) [reserved]

          (e) The Subsequent Mortgage Loans conveyed on the Subsequent
Transfer Date shall be determined by the Seller as follows.

               (i) The Seller shall list all funded mortgage loans then owned
          by it eligible for inclusion in the Trust Fund that qualify for
          inclusion in the Trust Fund and either Loan Group by the date on
          which they were funded, and for each date, the Mortgagors shall be
          listed alphabetically. Beginning with the earliest date,
          sequentially by date and within a date alphabetically, the listed
          loans shall be transferred to the Trust Fund in respect of the
          applicable Loan Groups until either their aggregate Stated Principal
          Balance is as close as possible or to equal to the Subsequent
          Transfer Date Aggregate Purchase Amount without exceeding it or all
          of the listed loans have been transferred. No fixed rate mortgage
          loan that would

                                     Q-1

<PAGE>

          be a Credit Comeback Loan is eligible for conveyance to the Trust
          Fund on a Subsequent Transfer Date occurring after ____, 200[_].

               Once the potential Subsequent Mortgage Loans are identified in
          this manner, the total potential Mortgage Loans as a whole and in
          each Loan Group shall be tested for compliance with the Pool
          Characteristics and the Loan Group Characteristics as provided in
          Section 2.01(e)(vii) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement after
          taking into account the addition of such potential Subsequent
          Mortgage Loans. If, as a result of the potential addition of
          Subsequent Mortgage Loans described in the preceding sentence, any
          Pool Characteristic or Loan Group Characteristic is outside any
          permitted parameter, then beginning with the last mortgage loan
          initially added as a potential Subsequent Mortgage Loan and
          progressing in reverse order, any potential Subsequent Mortgage Loan
          having a characteristic that is outside of the permitted parameters
          of a parameter violated by the total potential Mortgage Pool or Loan
          Group shall be removed. Then additional mortgage loans shall be
          added as provided in the preceding paragraph except that no mortgage
          loan shall be added if it has a Pool Characteristic or Loan Group
          Characteristic that is outside of the permitted parameters of a
          parameter violated by the total potential Mortgage Pool or Loan
          Group. This procedure shall be repeated until the Pool
          Characteristics and Loan Group Characteristics are satisfied after
          taking into account the addition of the potential Subsequent
          Mortgage Loans.

          (f) In case any provision of this Subsequent Transfer Agreement
shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby.

          (g) In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this
Subsequent Transfer Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the
provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall prevail.

          (h) This Subsequent Transfer Agreement shall be governed by, and
shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of
New York.

          (i) The Subsequent Transfer Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which so executed and delivered shall be deemed an
original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the
same instrument.
