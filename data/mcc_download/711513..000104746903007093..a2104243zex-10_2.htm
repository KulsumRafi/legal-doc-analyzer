<P><FONT SIZE=2>To
each of the Lenders<BR>
parties to the Credit Agreement<BR>
(as defined below) and to Citibank N.A.,<BR>
as Agent for such Lenders </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Ladies
and Gentlemen: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference
is made to the 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of November&nbsp;22, 2002, among The Boeing Company, the lenders parties thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as syndication agent,
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and JPMorgan Securities, Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers, and Citibank, N.A., as Agent for such lenders (as amended or modified from time to time, the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Credit Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Capitalized terms used in this letter that are not defined herein have the respective meanings specified in the Credit Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please
be advised that the Company hereby designates its undersigned Subsidiary, Boeing Capital Corporation (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Subsidiary Borrower</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"),
as a "Subsidiary Borrower" under and for all purposes of the Credit Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Subsidiary Borrower, in consideration of each Lender's agreement to extend credit to it under and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, does hereby assume
each of the obligations imposed upon a "Subsidiary Borrower" as a "Borrower" under the Credit Agreement and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement. In furtherance of
the foregoing, the Subsidiary Borrower hereby represents and warrants to each Lender as follows: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Subsidiary Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Subsidiary Borrower is
qualified to do business in every jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except where the failure to so qualify would not have a materially adverse effect on the financial condition of the
Company and the Subsidiary Borrowers as a whole. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
execution, delivery and performance by the Subsidiary Borrower of this Subsidiary Borrower Letter and its Notes, if any, are within the Subsidiary Borrower's
corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, have received all necessary governmental approval, if any (which approval remains in full force and effect), and do not
contravene any law, any provision of the Subsidiary Borrower's charter or by-laws or any contractual restriction binding on the Subsidiary Borrower. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Subsidiary Borrower Letter does, and the Notes of the Subsidiary Borrower when duly executed and delivered by the Subsidiary Borrower will, constitute legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Subsidiary Borrower, enforceable against the Subsidiary Borrower in accordance with their respective terms. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the Subsidiary Borrower's opinion, there are no pending or threatened actions or proceedings before any court or administrative agency that are reasonably likely to
have a material adverse affect on the financial condition or operations of the Subsidiary Borrower or any Subsidiary which is likely to impair the ability of the Subsidiary Borrower to repay the
Advances to it or which would affect the legality, validity or enforceability of such Advances or its Notes, if any. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2001 and the related Consolidated statement of earnings and retained earnings for the year then ended
(copies of which have been furnished to each Lender) correctly set forth the Consolidated financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of such date and the result of the Consolidated
operations for such year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Subsidiary Borrower is not engaged in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U
issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and no proceeds of any Advance to the Subsidiary Borrower will be used to purchase or carry any margin stock or to extend credit to
others for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying any margin stock. Following application of the proceeds of each Advance, not more than 25 percent of the value of the assets (either of the Subsidiary Borrower only or of the
Subsidiary Borrower and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis) subject to the provisions of Section 4.2(a) of the Credit Agreement or subject to any restriction contained in any agreement or
instrument between the Subsidiary Borrower and any Lender or any Affiliate of a Lender relating to Debt within the scope of Section 6.1(d) of the Credit Agreement will be margin stock (within the
meaning of Regulation U issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Subsidiary Borrower is not an "investment company," or an "affiliated person" of, or "promoter" or "principal underwriter" for, an "investment company," as such
terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Neither the making of any Advances, nor the application of the proceeds or repayment thereof by the Subsidiary Borrower, nor the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby, will violate any provision of such Act or any rule, regulation or order of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder. </FONT></P>
