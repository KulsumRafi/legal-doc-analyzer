among the parties heretofore made. This Letter Agreement may be amended only by
an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of each of the parties hereto,

enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Letter Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. </FONT></P>
