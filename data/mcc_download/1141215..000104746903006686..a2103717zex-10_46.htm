SIZE=2><B>(a)</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resignation.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the date hereof, you hereby resign your
position as Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Chief Marketing Officer, and as a full time employee of the Company effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2002 (the "Resignation Date"); provided however
that, commencing on the date hereof and continuing through the Resignation Date (the "Transition Period"), you will not enter into any agreements or make any commitments on behalf of the Company
without the prior written approval of Noel Johnson, President and COO, or another executive officer of the Company. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><B>(b)</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Transition Period, the Company will
continue to pay your base salary at the same level that you were receiving as of the date hereof. These salary payments will be made on the Company's regular payroll dates subject to standard
withholdings and deductions. Upon the Resignation Date, you will be paid for any accrued and unused vacation earned through the Resignation Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>(c)</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Transition Period, you will be entitled

requiring the payment of severance, as part of this Agreement and provided you sign and do not revoke this Agreement, the Company will pay you severance in an amount equal to twenty-six
(26)&nbsp;weeks of your current base salary, less required withholdings and deductions ("Severance Payment"). The Severance Payment will be paid in a lump sump within ten (10)&nbsp;business days
following the execution of the Supplemental Release attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;B. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><B>3.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Insurance.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Resignation Date and to the
extent permitted by the federal COBRA law and by the Company's current group health insurance policies, you will be eligible to continue your health insurance benefits at your own expense and, later,
to convert to an individual policy if you wish. Soon after the Resignation Date, you will be provided with a separate notice of your COBRA rights. As part of this Agreement, should you timely elect to
obtain insurance coverage pursuant to COBRA, the Company will reimburse you for the cost of your COBRA payments for twenty-six (26)&nbsp;weeks following the Resignation Date. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><B>4.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock Options.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April, 2002, you were granted an option to
purchase 160,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Option") under the Company's 1998 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"). As of the Resignation Date, the Option will be vested as to 0 shares. Provided you sign,
do not revoke, and perform your obligations under this Agreement in full, the Company shall accelerate the vesting period of the Option as to 20,000 shares effective January&nbsp;1, 2003. Pursuant
to the Plan, you will have 90&nbsp;days following the Resignation Date to exercise any portion of your vested option. Any portion of your vested option that is not exercised will be forfeited. You
are advised by the Company to seek independent legal advice with respect to any tax and securities laws regarding your option and any purchase, sale of Company stock you may make. </FONT></P>
