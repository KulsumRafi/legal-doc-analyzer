ARTICLE I
                                            PURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS


Section 1.1       Purchase Facility.

(a)      Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, Seller may, at its option, sell and assign
Purchaser Interests to the Agent for the benefit of one or more of the Purchasers.  In accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth herein, Conduit may, at its option, instruct the Agent to purchase on behalf
of Conduit, or if Conduit shall decline to purchase, the Agent shall purchase, on behalf of the Financial
Institutions, Purchaser Interests from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed at such time the
lesser of (i) the Purchase Limit and (ii) the aggregate amount of the Commitments during the period from the
date hereof to but not including the Facility Termination Date.

(b)      Seller may, upon at least 15 Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent, terminate in whole
or reduce in part, ratably among the Financial Institutions, the unused portion of the Purchase Limit;
provided that each partial reduction of the Purchase Limit shall be in an amount equal to $5,000,000 or an
integral multiple thereof.

Section 1.2       Increases.  Seller shall provide the Agent with at least two Business Days' prior notice in
a form set forth as Exhibit II hereto of each Incremental Purchase (a "Purchase Notice").  Each Purchase
Notice shall be subject to Section 6.2 hereof and, except as set forth below, shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the requested Purchase Price (which shall not be less than $1,000,000 and in additional increments
of $100,000), the date of purchase, the account number and bank name to which the proceeds of the
Incremental Purchase are to be remitted (the "Designated Account"), and, in the case of an Incremental
Purchase to be funded by the Financial Institutions, the requested Bank Rate and Tranche Period.  Following
receipt of a Purchase Notice, the Agent will determine whether Conduit agrees to make the purchase.  If
Conduit declines to make a proposed purchase, the Agent shall so notify Seller and Seller may cancel the
Purchase Notice or, in the absence of such a cancellation, the Incremental Purchase of the Purchaser
Interest will be made by the Financial Institutions.  On the date of each Incremental Purchase, upon
satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article VI, Conduit or the Financial
Institutions, as applicable, shall deposit to the Designated Account, in immediately available funds, no
later than 12:00 noon (Chicago time), an amount equal to (i) in the case of Conduit, the aggregate Purchase
Price of the Purchaser Interests Conduit is then purchasing or (ii) in the case of a Financial Institution,
such Financial Institution's Pro Rata Share of the aggregate Purchase Price of the Purchaser Interests the
Financial Institutions are purchasing.

Section 1.3       Decreases.  Seller shall provide the Agent with prior written notice in conformity with the
Required Notice Period and substantially in the form of Exhibit XI (a "Reduction Notice") of any proposed
reduction of Aggregate Capital from Collections.  Such Reduction Notice shall designate (i) the date upon
which any such reduction of Aggregate Capital shall occur (which date shall give effect to the applicable
Required Notice Period), and (ii) the amount of Aggregate Capital to be reduced which shall be applied
ratably to the Purchaser Interests of Conduit and the Financial Institutions in accordance with the amount
of Capital (if any) owing to Conduit, on the one hand, and the amount of Capital (if any) owing to the
Financial Institutions (ratably, based on their respective Pro Rata Shares), on the other hand (the
"Aggregate Reduction").  Only one (1) Reduction Notice shall be outstanding at any time.  No Aggregate
Reduction will be made following the occurrence of the Amortization Date without the consent of the Agent.

Section 1.4       Payment Requirements.  All amounts to be paid or deposited by any Seller Party pursuant to
any provision of this Agreement shall be paid or deposited in accordance with the terms hereof no later than
12:00 noon (Chicago time) on the day when due in immediately available funds, and if not received before
12:00 noon (Chicago time) shall be deemed to be received on the next succeeding Business Day.  If such
amounts are payable to a Purchaser they shall be paid to the Agent, for the account of such Purchaser, at 1
Bank One Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60670 until otherwise notified by the Agent.  All computations of Yield,
per annum fees calculated as part of any CP Costs, per annum fees hereunder and per annum fees under the Fee
Letter shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed.  If any
amount hereunder shall be payable on a day which is not a Business Day, such amount shall be payable on the
next succeeding Business Day.

ARTICLE II
                                           PAYMENTS AND COLLECTIONS


Section 2.1       Payments.  Notwithstanding any limitation on recourse contained in this Agreement, Seller
shall immediately pay to the Agent when due, for the account of the relevant Purchaser or Purchasers on a
full recourse basis, (i) such fees as set forth in the Fee Letter (which fees shall be sufficient to pay all
fees owing to the Financial Institutions), (ii) all amounts payable as CP Costs, (iii) all amounts payable
as Yield, (iv) all amounts payable as Deemed Collections (which shall be immediately due and payable by
Seller and applied to reduce outstanding Aggregate Capital hereunder in accordance with Sections 2.2 and 2.3
hereof), (v) all amounts required pursuant to Section 2.6, (vi) all amounts payable pursuant to Article X,
if any, (vii) all Servicer costs and expenses, including the Servicing Fee,  in connection with servicing,
administering and collecting the Receivables, provided, that so long as PSE shall act as Servicer hereunder,
Seller may pay such Servicer costs and expenses directly to PSE, (viii) all Broken Funding Costs and (ix)
all Default Fees (collectively, the "Obligations").  If any Person fails to pay or make any deposit of any
of the Obligations when due, such Person agrees to pay, on demand, the Default Fee in respect thereof until
paid.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement, the Fee Letter or any other
Transaction Document shall require the payment or permit the collection of any amounts hereunder in excess
of the maximum permitted by applicable law.  If at any time Seller receives any Collections or is deemed to
receive any Collections, Seller shall immediately pay such Collections or Deemed Collections to the Servicer
for application in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof and, at all times prior to such payment,
such Collections or Deemed Collections shall be held in trust by Seller for the exclusive benefit of the
Purchasers and the Agent.


Section 2.2       Collections Prior to Amortization.  Prior to the Amortization Date, any Collections and/or
Deemed Collections received by the Servicer shall be set aside and held in trust by the Servicer for the
payment of any accrued and unpaid Aggregate Unpaids or for a Reinvestment as provided in this Section 2.2.
If at any time any Collections and/or Deemed Collections are received by the Servicer prior to the
Amortization Date, (i) the Servicer shall set aside the Termination Percentage (hereinafter defined) of
Collections evidenced by the Purchaser Interests of each Terminating Financial Institution and (ii) Seller
hereby requests and the Purchasers (other than any Terminating Financial Institutions) hereby agree to make,
simultaneously with such receipt, a reinvestment (each a "Reinvestment") with that portion of the balance of
each and every Collection and Deemed Collection received by the Servicer that is part of any Purchaser
Interest (other than any Purchaser Interests of Terminating Financial Institutions), such that after giving
effect to such Reinvestment, the amount of Aggregate Capital immediately after such receipt and
corresponding Reinvestment shall be equal to the amount of Aggregate Capital immediately prior to such
receipt.  On each Settlement Date prior to the occurrence of the Amortization Date, the Servicer shall remit
to the Agent's account the amounts set aside during the preceding Settlement Period that have not been
subject to a Reinvestment and apply such amounts (if not previously paid in accordance with Section 2.1)
first, to reduce unpaid Obligations, second, to reduce the Capital of all Purchaser Interests of Terminating
Financial Institutions, applied ratably to each Terminating Financial Institution according to its
respective Termination Percentage and third, to reduce Aggregate Capital in an amount, if any necessary, so
that the aggregate of the Purchaser Interests does not exceed the Applicable Maximum Purchaser Interest,
applied ratably in accordance with the Pro Rata Shares.  If such Capital and Obligations shall be reduced to
zero, any additional Collections received by the Servicer (i) if applicable, shall be remitted to the
Agent's account no later than 12:00 noon. (Chicago time) to the extent required to fund any Aggregate
Reduction on such Settlement Date and (ii) any balance remaining thereafter shall be remitted from the
Servicer to Seller on such Settlement Date.  Each Terminating Financial Institution shall be allocated a
ratable portion of Collections from the date of its becoming a Terminating Financial Institution in
accordance with Section 12.3 (the "Termination Date") until such Terminating Financial Institution's Capital
shall be paid in full.  This ratable portion shall be calculated on the Termination Date of each Terminating
Financial Institution as a percentage equal to (i) Capital of such Terminating Financial Institution
outstanding on its Termination Date, divided by (ii) the Aggregate Capital outstanding on such Termination
Date (the "Termination Percentage").  Each Terminating Financial Institution's Termination Percentage shall
remain constant prior to the Amortization Date.  On and after the Amortization Date, each Termination
Percentage shall be disregarded, and each Terminating Financial Institution's Capital shall be reduced
ratably with all Financial Institutions in accordance with Section 2.3.

Section 2.3       Collections Following Amortization.  On the Amortization Date and on each day thereafter,
the Servicer shall set aside and hold in trust, for the holder of each Purchaser Interest, all Collections
received on such day and an additional amount of funds of Seller for the payment of any Aggregate Unpaids
owed by Seller and not previously paid by Seller in accordance with Section 2.1.  On and after the
Amortization Date, the Servicer shall, at any time upon the request from time to time by (or pursuant to
standing instructions from) the Agent (i) remit to the Agent's account the amounts set aside pursuant to the
preceding sentence, and (ii) apply such amounts to reduce the Capital associated with each such Purchaser
Interest and any other Aggregate Unpaids.

Section 2.4       Application of Collections.  If there shall be insufficient funds on deposit for the
Servicer to distribute funds in payment in full of the aforementioned amounts pursuant to Section 2.2 or 2.3
(as applicable), the Servicer shall distribute funds:


                  first, to the payment of the Servicer's reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in
         connection with servicing, administering and collecting the Receivables, including the Servicing
         Fee, if Seller or one of its Affiliates is not then acting as the Servicer,

                  second, to the reimbursement of the Agent's costs of collection and enforcement of this
         Agreement,

                  third, ratably to the payment of all accrued and unpaid fees under the Fee Letter, CP Costs
         and Yield,

                  fourth, (to the extent applicable) to the ratable reduction of the Aggregate Capital
(without regard to any Termination Percentage),

                  fifth, for the ratable payment of all other unpaid Obligations, provided that to the extent
         such Obligations relate to the payment of Servicer costs and expenses, including the Servicing Fee,
         when Seller or one of its Affiliates is acting as the Servicer, such costs and expenses will not be
         paid until after the payment in full of all other Obligations, and

                  sixth, after the Aggregate Unpaids have been indefeasibly reduced to zero, to Seller.

                  Collections applied to the payment of Aggregate Unpaids shall be distributed in accordance
with the aforementioned provisions, and, giving effect to each of the priorities set forth in Section 2.4
above, shall be shared ratably (within each priority) among the Agent and the Purchasers in accordance with
the amount of such Aggregate Unpaids owing to each of them in respect of each such priority.

Section 2.5       Payment Rescission.  No payment of any of the Aggregate Unpaids shall be considered paid or
applied hereunder to the extent that, at any time, all or any portion of such payment or application is
rescinded by application of law or judicial authority, or must otherwise be returned or refunded for any
reason.  Seller shall remain obligated for the amount of any payment or application so rescinded, returned
or refunded, and shall promptly pay to the Agent (for application to the Person or Persons who suffered such
rescission, return or refund) the full amount thereof, plus the Default Fee from the date of any such
rescission, return or refunding.

Section 2.6       Maximum Purchaser Interests. Seller shall ensure that the Purchaser Interests of the
Purchasers shall at no time exceed in the aggregate the Applicable Maximum Purchaser Interest.  If the
aggregate of the Purchaser Interests of the Purchasers exceeds the Applicable Maximum Purchaser Interest at
any time, Seller shall pay to the Agent within (i) at any time a Monthly Reporting Period is in effect, two
(2) Business Days, and (ii) at any time a Daily or Weekly Reporting Period is in effect, one (1) Business
Day, an amount to be applied to reduce the Aggregate Capital (as allocated by the Agent), such that, after
giving effect to such payment, the aggregate Purchaser Interests equal or is less than the Applicable
Maximum Purchaser Interest.

Section 2.7       Clean Up Call.  In addition to Seller's rights pursuant to Section 1.3, Seller shall have
the right (after providing written notice to the Agent in accordance with the Required Notice Period), at
any time following the reduction of the Aggregate Capital to a level that is less than 10.0% of the original
Purchase Limit, to repurchase from the Purchasers all, but not less than all, of the then outstanding
Purchaser Interests.  The purchase price in respect thereof shall be an amount equal to the Aggregate
Unpaids through the date of such repurchase, payable in immediately available funds.  Such repurchase shall
be without representation, warranty or recourse of any kind by, on the part of, or against any Purchaser or
the Agent.

Section 3.1       CP Costs.  Seller shall pay CP Costs with respect to the Capital associated with each
Purchaser Interest of Conduit for each day that any Capital in respect of such Purchaser Interest is
outstanding.  Each Purchaser Interest funded substantially with Pooled Commercial Paper will accrue CP Costs
each day on a pro rata basis, based upon the percentage share the Capital in respect of such Purchaser
Interest represents in relation to all assets held by Conduit and funded substantially with Pooled
Commercial Paper.

Section 3.2       CP Costs Payments.  On each Interest Payment Date, Seller shall pay to the Agent (for the
benefit of Conduit) an aggregate amount equal to all accrued and unpaid CP Costs in respect of the Capital
associated with all Purchaser Interests of Conduit for the immediately preceding Accrual Period in
accordance with Article II.

Section 3.3       Calculation of CP Costs.  On the 3rd Business Day immediately preceding each Interest
Payment Date, Conduit shall calculate the aggregate amount of CP Costs for the applicable Accrual Period and
shall notify Seller of such aggregate amount.

ARTICLE IV
                                        FINANCIAL INSTITUTION FUNDING

Section 4.1       Financial Institution Funding.  Each Purchaser Interest of the Financial Institutions shall
accrue Yield for each day during its Tranche Period at either the LIBO Rate or the Prime Rate in accordance
with the terms and conditions hereof.  Until Seller gives notice to the Agent of another Bank Rate in
accordance with Section 4.4, the initial Bank Rate for any Purchaser Interest transferred to the Financial
Institutions pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof shall be the Prime Rate.  If the Financial
Institutions acquire by assignment from Conduit any Purchaser Interest pursuant to the Liquidity Agreement,
each Purchaser Interest so assigned shall each be deemed to have a new Tranche Period commencing on the date
of any such assignment.

Section 4.2       Yield Payments.  On the Interest Payment Date for each Purchaser Interest of the Financial
Institutions, Seller shall pay to the Agent (for the benefit of the Financial Institutions) an aggregate
amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Yield for the entire Tranche Period of each such Purchaser Interest
in accordance with Article II.

Section 4.3       Selection and Continuation of Tranche Periods.

(a)      With consultation from the Agent, Seller shall from time to time request Tranche Periods for the
Purchaser Interests of the Financial Institutions, provided that, if at any time the Financial Institutions
shall have a Purchaser Interest, Seller shall always request Tranche Periods such that at least one Tranche
Period shall end on the date specified in clause (A) of the definition of Interest Payment Date.

(b)      Seller or the Agent, upon notice to and consent by the other  (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) received at least three (3) Business Days prior to the end of a Tranche Period (the
"Terminating Tranche") for any Purchaser Interest, may, effective on the last day of the Terminating
Tranche:  (i) divide any such Purchaser Interest into multiple Purchaser Interests, (ii) combine any such
Purchaser Interest with one or more other Purchaser Interests that have a Terminating Tranche ending on the
same day as such Terminating Tranche or (iii) combine any such Purchaser Interest with a new Purchaser
Interests to be purchased on the day such Terminating Tranche ends, provided, that in no event may a
Purchaser Interest of Conduit be combined with a Purchaser Interest of the Financial Institutions.

Section 4.4       Financial Institution Bank Rates.  Seller may select the LIBO Rate or the Prime Rate for
each Purchaser Interest of the Financial Institutions.  Seller shall by 12:00 noon (Chicago time): (i) at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the expiration of any Terminating Tranche with respect to which the
LIBO Rate is being requested as a new Bank Rate and (ii) at least one (1) Business Day prior to the
expiration of any Terminating Tranche with respect to which the Prime Rate is being requested as a new Bank
Rate, give the Agent irrevocable notice of the new Bank Rate for the Purchaser Interest associated with such
Terminating Tranche.   Until Seller gives notice to the Agent of another Bank Rate, the initial Bank Rate
for any Purchaser Interest transferred to the Financial Institutions pursuant to the terms and conditions
hereof shall be the Prime Rate.

Section 4.5       Suspension of the LIBO Rate.  If any Financial Institution notifies the Agent that it has
determined that funding its Pro Rata Share of the Purchaser Interests of the Financial Institutions at the
LIBO Rate would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive of any governmental or regulatory
authority, whether or not having the force of law, or that (i) deposits of a type and maturity appropriate
to match fund its Purchaser Interests at the LIBO Rate are not available or (ii) the LIBO Rate does not
accurately reflect the cost of acquiring or maintaining a Purchaser Interest at the LIBO Rate, then the
Agent shall suspend the availability of the LIBO Rate and require Seller to select the Prime Rate for any
Purchaser Interest accruing Yield at the LIBO Rate, and the then current Tranche Period for such Purchaser
Interest shall thereupon be terminated.

ARTICLE V

locations of which the Agent has been notified in accordance with Section 7.2(a) in jurisdictions where all
action required by Section 7.1(h) and/or Section 14.4(a) has been taken and completed.  Such Seller Party's
organizational number assigned to it by its jurisdiction of organization and such Seller Party's Federal
Employer Identification Number are correctly set forth on Exhibit III.  Such Seller Party has not, within a
period of one year prior to the date hereof, (i) changed the location of its principal place of business or
chief executive office or its organizational structure, (ii) changed its legal name, (iii) changed its
"location" (within the meaning of Section 9-307 of the UCC as in effect in all applicable jurisdictions), or
(iv) become a "new debtor" (as defined in Section 9-102(a)(56) of the UCC as in effect in all applicable
jurisdictions) with respect to a currently effective security agreement previously entered into by any other
Person.  Such Seller Party has not changed its jurisdiction of organization.  Seller is a Washington
corporation and is a "registered organization" (within the meaning of Section 9-102 of the UCC as in effect
in the State of Washington).

(l)      Collections.  The conditions and requirements set forth in Section 7.1(j) and Section 8.2 have at
all times been satisfied and duly performed.  The names and addresses of all Collection Banks, together with
the account numbers of the Collection Accounts at each Collection Bank and the post office box number of
each Lock-Box or P.O. Box, are listed on Exhibit IV.  Seller has not granted any Person, other than the
Agent as contemplated by this Agreement, dominion and control or "control" (within the meaning of Section
9-104 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) of any Lock-Box, P.O. Box or Collection Account, or the
right to take dominion and control or "control" (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC of all
applicable jurisdictions) of any such Lock-Box, P.O. Box or Collection Account at a future time or upon the
occurrence of a future event.  Each Seller Party has taken all steps necessary to ensure that the Agent has
"control" (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) over all
Collection Accounts.  Such Seller Party has the ability to identify, within one Business Day of receipt or
deposit, all amounts that are received in any Lock-Box or P.O. Box or deposited to any Collection Account as
constituting Collections or non-Collections.  Except for proceeds of Excluded Receivables (which shall be
electronically swept or otherwise transferred out of such Collection Account within 1 Business Day of being
deposited therein in accordance with Section 7.1(j)), no funds other than the proceeds of Receivables are
deposited to any Collection Account.

(m)      Material Adverse Effect.  (i) The initial Servicer represents and warrants that since December 31,
2001, no event has occurred that would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
operations of the initial Servicer and its Subsidiaries or the ability of the initial Servicer to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to which it is a party, and (ii)
Seller represents and warrants that since the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that would have
a material adverse effect on (A) the financial condition or operations of Seller, (B) the ability of Seller
to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents, or (C) the collectibility of the Receivables
generally or any material portion of the Receivables.

(n)      Names.  In the past five (5) years, Seller has not used any corporate or other names, trade names
or assumed names other than the name in which it has executed this Agreement.

(o)      Ownership of Seller.  Originator owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Seller, free and clear of any Adverse Claim.  Such capital stock is validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable, and there are no options, warrants or other rights to acquire securities of Seller.

(p)      PUHCA; Investment Company Act.  Such Seller Party is a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Puget Energy,
Inc., a public utility holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended
("PUHCA"), which is exempt from regulation under PUHCA and the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC")
rules thereunder (except for regulation under Section 9(a)(2) of PUHCA) pursuant to Section 3(a)(1) and SEC
Rule 2 under PUHCA.  Such Seller Party is not, and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, will not be required to register as, an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, or any successor statute.

(q)      Compliance with Law.  Such Seller Party has complied in all material respects with all applicable
statutes, rules, regulations, orders and restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or any
instrumentality or agency thereof having jurisdiction over the conduct of its businesses or the ownership of
its property, except for any failure to comply with any of the foregoing that could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Each Receivable, together with the Contract related thereto,
does not contravene any laws, rules or regulations applicable thereto (including, without limitation, laws,
rules and regulations relating to truth in lending, fair credit billing, fair credit reporting, equal credit
opportunity, fair debt collection practices or privacy), and no part of such Contract is in violation of any
such law, rule or regulation.

(r)      Compliance with Credit and Collection Policy.  Such Seller Party has complied in all material
respects with the Credit and Collection Policy with regard to each Receivable and the related Contract, and
has not made any change to such Credit and Collection Policy, except as permitted under Section 7.2(c) and
as to which the Agent has been notified, and if applicable, as to which the Agent has consented, in each
case, in accordance with Section 7.1(a)(vii).

(s)      Payments to Originator.  With respect to each Receivable transferred to Seller under the
Receivables Sale Agreement, Seller has given reasonably equivalent value to Originator in consideration
therefor and such transfer was not made for or on account of an antecedent debt.  No transfer by Originator
of any Receivable under the Receivables Sale Agreement is or may be voidable under any section of the
Federal Bankruptcy Code.

(t)      Enforceability of Contracts.  Each Contract with respect to each Receivable is effective to create,
and has created, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the related Obligor to pay the Outstanding Balance
of the Receivable created thereunder and any accrued interest thereon, enforceable against the Obligor in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(u)      Eligible Receivables.  Each Receivable included in the Net Receivables Balance as an Eligible
Receivable was an Eligible Receivable on the date of its purchase under the Receivables Sale Agreement.

(v)      Net Receivables Balance.  Seller has determined that, immediately after giving effect to each
purchase hereunder, the Net Receivables Balance is at least equal to the sum of (i) the Aggregate Capital,
plus (ii) the Aggregate Reserves, plus (iii) the Seller's Interest.

(w)      Accounting.  The manner in which such Seller Party accounts for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Receivables Sale Agreement does not jeopardize the true sale analysis.

(x)      Identification of Receivables.  Each Seller Party identifies the receivables purchased (or
purported to be purchased) by Seller under the Receivables Sale Agreement and in which an interest is
transferred (or purported to be transferred) hereunder on  its books and records (including any accounting
system) with the account code "FERC 142 Account Receivable."

Section 5.2       Financial Institution Representations and Warranties.  Each Financial Institution hereby
represents and warrants to the Agent and Conduit that:

(a)      Existence and Power.  Such Financial Institution is a corporation or a banking association duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, and has all corporate power to perform its obligations hereunder.

(b)      No Conflict.  The execution and delivery by such Financial Institution of this Agreement and the
performance of its obligations hereunder are within its corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, do not contravene or violate (i) its certificate or articles of incorporation or
association or by-laws, (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to it, (iii) any restrictions under any
agreement, contract or instrument to which it is a party or any of its property is bound, or (iv) any order,
writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree binding on or affecting it or its property, and do not result in
the creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim on its assets.  This Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by such Financial Institution.

(c)      Governmental Authorization.  No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or
filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution and delivery by
such Financial Institution of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder.

(d)      Binding Effect.  This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such
Financial Institution enforceable against such Financial Institution in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws
relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

ARTICLE VI
                                           CONDITIONS OF PURCHASES

Section 6.1       Conditions Precedent to Initial Incremental Purchase.  The initial Incremental Purchase of
a Purchaser Interest under this Agreement is subject to the conditions precedent that (a) the Agent shall
have received on or before the date of such purchase those documents listed on Schedule B, (b) the Agent
shall have received all fees and expenses required to be paid on or prior to such date pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement and the Fee Letter, and (c) Seller shall have marked its books and records with a legend
satisfactory to the Agent identifying the Agent's interest in the Receivables, Related Security and
Collections.

Interest hereunder and each Reinvestment shall be subject to the further conditions precedent that (a) in
the case of each such purchase or Reinvestment: (i) the Servicer shall have delivered to the Agent on or
prior to the date of such purchase, in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent, all reports as and when
due under Section 8.5 and (ii) upon the Agent's request, the Servicer shall have delivered to the Agent at
least three (3) days prior to such purchase or Reinvestment an interim Monthly Report showing the amount of
Eligible Receivables; (b) the Facility Termination Date shall not have occurred; (c) the Agent shall have
received such other approvals, opinions or documents as it may reasonably request and (d) on the date of
each such Incremental Purchase or Reinvestment, the following statements shall be true (and acceptance of
the proceeds of such Incremental Purchase or Reinvestment shall be deemed a representation and warranty by
Seller that such statements are then true):


                  (i)      the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.1 are true and correct
on and as of the date of such Incremental Purchase or Reinvestment as though made on and as of such date;

                  (ii)     no event has occurred and is continuing, or would result from such Incremental
Purchase or Reinvestment, that will constitute an Amortization Event, and no event has occurred and is

                  (iii)    the Aggregate Capital does not exceed the Purchase Limit and the aggregate

It is expressly understood that each Reinvestment shall, unless otherwise directed by the Agent or any
Purchaser, occur automatically on each day that the Servicer shall receive any Collections without the
requirement that any further action be taken on the part of any Person and notwithstanding the failure of
Seller to satisfy any of the foregoing conditions precedent in respect of such Reinvestment.  The failure of
Seller to satisfy any of the foregoing conditions precedent in respect of any Reinvestment shall give rise
to a right of the Agent, which right may be exercised at any time on demand of the Agent, to rescind the
related purchase and direct Seller to pay to the Agent for the benefit of the Purchasers an amount equal to
the Collections prior to the Amortization Date that shall have been applied to the affected Reinvestment.

         without limitation, an ability to recreate records evidencing Receivables in the event of
         the destruction of the originals thereof), and keep and maintain all documents, books,
         records and other information reasonably necessary or advisable for the collection of all
         Receivables (including, without limitation, records adequate to permit the immediate
         identification of each new Receivable and all Collections of and adjustments to each
         existing Receivable).  The Servicer will give the Agent notice of any material change in
         the administrative and operating procedures referred to in the previous sentence.

Originator to, perform each of their respective obligations and undertakings under and pursuant to the
Receivables Sale Agreement, will purchase Receivables thereunder in strict compliance with the terms thereof
and will vigorously enforce the rights and remedies accorded to Seller under the Receivables Sale
Agreement.  Seller will take all actions to perfect and enforce its rights and interests (and the rights and
interests of the Agent and the Purchasers as assignees of Seller) under the Receivables Sale Agreement as
the Agent may from time to time reasonably request, including, without limitation, making claims to which it
may be entitled under any indemnity, reimbursement or similar provision contained in the Receivables Sale
Agreement.

(h)      Ownership.  Seller will take all necessary action to (i) vest legal and equitable title to the
Receivables, the Related Security and the Collections purchased under the Receivables Sale Agreement
irrevocably in Seller, free and clear of any Adverse Claims other than Adverse Claims in favor of the Agent
and the Purchasers (including, without limitation, the filing of all financing statements or other similar
instruments or documents necessary under the UCC (or any comparable law) of all appropriate jurisdictions to

and (ii) establish and maintain, in favor of the Agent, for the benefit of the Purchasers, a valid and
perfected first priority undivided percentage ownership interest (and/or a valid and perfected first
priority security interest) in all Receivables, Related Security and Collections to the full extent
contemplated herein, free and clear of any Adverse Claims other than Adverse Claims in favor of the Agent
for the benefit of the Purchasers (including, without limitation, the filing of all financing statements or
other similar instruments or documents necessary under the UCC (or any comparable law) of all appropriate
jurisdictions to perfect the Agent's (for the benefit of the Purchasers) interest in such Receivables,
Related Security and Collections and such other action to perfect, protect or more fully evidence the
interest of the Agent for the benefit of the Purchasers as the Agent may reasonably request).

(i)      Purchasers' Reliance.  Seller acknowledges that the Purchasers are entering into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in reliance upon Seller's identity as a legal entity that is separate from
each Related Entity.  Therefore, from and after the date of execution and delivery of this Agreement, Seller
shall take all reasonable steps, including, without limitation, all steps that the Agent or any Purchaser
may from time to time reasonably request, to maintain Seller's identity as a separate legal entity and to
make it manifest to third parties that Seller is an entity with assets and liabilities distinct from those
of each Related Entity and not just a division of any Related Entity.  Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing and in addition to the other covenants set forth herein, Seller will:

(A)      conduct its own business in its own name and require that all full-time employees of Seller, if
                  any, identify themselves as such and not as employees of any Related
                  Entity (including, without limitation, by means of providing appropriate
                  employees with business or identification cards identifying such
                  employees as Seller's employees);

(B)      compensate all employees, consultants and agents directly, from Seller's own funds, for services
                  provided to Seller by such employees, consultants and agents and, to the
                  extent any employee, consultant or agent of Seller is also an employee,
                  consultant or agent of any Related Entity, allocate the compensation of
                  such employee, consultant or agent between Seller and such Related
                  Entity, on a basis that reflects the services rendered to Seller and such
                  Related Entity;

(C)      to the extent Seller maintains a separate office for the operation of its business, clearly
                  identify its offices (by signage or otherwise) as its offices and, if
                  such office is located in the offices of any Related Entity, Seller shall
                  lease such office at a fair market rent;

(D)      have a separate telephone number, which will be answered only in its name and separate stationery,
                  invoices and checks in its own name;

(E)      conduct all transactions with each Related Entity and the Servicer and their respective Affiliates
                  (including, without limitation, any delegation of its obligations
                  hereunder as Servicer) strictly on an arm's-length basis, allocate all
                  overhead expenses (including, without limitation, telephone and other
                  utility charges) for items shared between Seller and any Related Entity
                  on the basis of actual use to the extent practicable and, to the extent
                  such allocation is not practicable, on a basis reasonably related to
                  actual use;

(F)      at all times have a Board of Directors consisting of at least three members, at least one member of
                  which is an Independent Director;

(G)      observe all corporate formalities as a distinct entity, and ensure that all corporate actions
                  relating to (A) the selection, maintenance or replacement of the
                  Independent Director, (B) the dissolution or liquidation of Seller or (C)
                  the initiation of, participation in, acquiescence in or consent to any
                  bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding involving
                  Seller, are duly authorized by unanimous vote of its Board of Directors
                  (including the Independent Director);

(H)      maintain Seller's books and records separate from those of each Related Entity and otherwise
                  readily identifiable as its own assets rather than assets of any Related
                  Entity;

(I)      prepare its financial statements separately from those of each Related Entity and insure that any
                  consolidated financial statements of any Related Entity that include
                  Seller, including any that are filed with the Securities and Exchange
                  Commission or any other governmental agency, have notes clearly stating
                  that Seller is a separate corporate entity and that its assets will be
                  available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of the creditors of
                  Seller;

(J)      except as herein specifically otherwise provided, maintain the funds or other assets of Seller
                  separate from, and not commingled with, those of any Related Entity and
                  only maintain bank accounts or other depository accounts to which Seller
                  alone (or the Servicer in the performance of its duties hereunder) is the
                  account party, and from which Seller alone (or the Servicer in the
                  performance of its duties hereunder or the Agent hereunder) has the power
                  to make withdrawals;

(K)      pay all of Seller's operating expenses from Seller's own assets (except for certain payments by any
                  Related Entity or other Persons pursuant to allocation arrangements that
                  comply with the requirements of this Section 7.1(i));

(L)      operate its business and activities such that:   it does not engage in any business or activity of
                  any kind, or enter into any transaction or indenture, mortgage,
                  instrument, agreement, contract, lease or other undertaking, other than
                  the transactions contemplated and authorized by this Agreement and the
                  Receivables Sale Agreement; and does not create, incur, guarantee, assume
                  or suffer to exist any indebtedness or other liabilities, whether direct
                  or contingent, other than (1) as a result of the endorsement of
                  negotiable instruments for deposit or collection or similar transactions
                  in the ordinary course of business, (2) the incurrence of obligations
                  under this Agreement, (3) the incurrence of obligations, as expressly
                  contemplated in the Receivables Sale Agreement, to make payment to
                  Originator thereunder for the purchase of Receivables from Originator
                  under the Receivables Sale Agreement, and (4) the incurrence of operating
                  expenses in the ordinary course of business of the type otherwise
                  contemplated by this Agreement;

(M)      maintain its corporate charter in conformity with this Agreement, such that it does not amend,
                  restate, supplement or otherwise modify its Articles of Incorporation or
                  By-Laws in any respect that would impair its ability to comply with the

                  without limitation, Section 7.1(i) of this Agreement;

(N)      maintain the effectiveness of, and continue to perform under the Receivables Sale Agreement, such
                  that it does not amend, restate, supplement, cancel, terminate or
                  otherwise modify the Receivables Sale Agreement, or give any consent,
                  waiver, directive or approval thereunder or waive any default, action,
                  omission or breach under the Receivables Sale Agreement or otherwise
                  grant any indulgence thereunder, without (in each case) the prior written
                  consent of the Agent;

(O)      maintain its corporate separateness such that it does not merge or consolidate with or into, or
                  convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of (whether in one
                  transaction or in a series of transactions, and except as otherwise
                  contemplated herein) all or substantially all of its assets (whether now
                  owned or hereafter acquired) to, or acquire all or substantially all of
                  the assets of, any Person, nor at any time create, have, acquire,
                  maintain or hold any interest in any Subsidiary.

(P)      maintain at all times the Required Capital Amount (as defined in the Receivables Sale Agreement)
                  and refrain from making any dividend, distribution, redemption of capital
                  stock or payment of any subordinated indebtedness which would cause the
                  Required Capital Amount to cease to be so maintained; and

(Q)      take such other actions as are necessary on its part to ensure that the facts and assumptions set
                  forth in the opinion issued by Perkins Coie LLP, as counsel for Seller,
                  in connection with the closing or initial Incremental Purchase under this
                  Agreement and relating to substantive consolidation issues, and in the
                  certificates accompanying such opinion, remain true and correct in all
                  material respects at all times.

(j)      Collections.  Such Seller Party will instruct all Obligors to remit all Collections directly to a
Lock-Box, P.O. Box or Collection Account.  Such Seller Party will cause (1) all items from all P.O. Boxes to
be processed and deposited to a Collection Account within 1 Business Day after receipt in a P.O. Box and all
proceeds from all Lock-Boxes to be directly deposited by a Collection Bank into a Collection Account, (2)
all non-Collection amounts deposited to any Collection Account to be electronically swept or otherwise
transferred out of such Collection Account within 1 Business Day of being deposited therein, and (3) from
and after January 31, 2003, each Lock-Box, P.O. Box and Collection Account to be subject at all times to a
Collection Account Agreement that is in full force and effect.  In the event any payments relating to
Receivables are remitted directly to any Seller Party or any Affiliate of any Seller Party, such Seller
Party will remit (or will cause all such payments to be remitted) directly to a Collection Bank and
deposited into a Collection Account within two (2) Business Days following receipt thereof, and, at all
times prior to such remittance, such Seller Party will itself hold or, if applicable, will cause such
payments to be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of the Agent and the Purchasers.  Seller will
maintain exclusive ownership, dominion and control and "control" (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the
UCC of all applicable jurisdictions), subject to the terms of this Agreement, of each Lock-Box, P.O. Box and
Collection Account and shall not grant the right to take dominion and control or "control" (within the
meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) of any Lock-Box, P.O. Box or Collection
Account at a future time or upon the occurrence of a future event to any Person, except to the Agent as
contemplated by this Agreement.  With respect to each Collection Account, each Seller Party shall take all
steps necessary to ensure that the Agent has "control" (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC of
all applicable jurisdictions) over each such Collection Account.

(k)      Taxes.  Such Seller Party will file all tax returns and reports required by law to be filed by it
and will promptly pay and discharge, before the same shall become delinquent, all taxes, assessments and
governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or upon its property, except any such taxes, assessments,
charges or levies (i) that are being diligently contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings or (ii)
subject to the last sentence of this subsection (k), the non-payment of which could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Seller will pay when due any taxes payable in connection with
the Receivables, exclusive of taxes on or measured by income or gross receipts of Conduit, the Agent or any
Financial Institution.

(l)      Insurance.  Such Seller Party will maintain with responsible insurance companies or through PSE's
program of self-insurance, insurance against at least such risks and in at least such amounts as is
customarily maintained by similar businesses, or as may be required by any applicable law, rule or
regulation, any governmental approval, or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental
authority or agency.

(m)      Payment to Originator.  With respect to any Receivable purchased by Seller from Originator, such
sale shall be effected under, and in strict compliance with the terms of, the Receivables Sale Agreement,
including, without limitation, the terms relating to the amount and timing of payments to be made to
Originator in respect of the purchase price for such Receivable.

(n)      Identification of Receivables.  Such Seller Party shall at all times identify receivables purchased
(or purported to be purchased) by Seller under the Receivables Sale Agreement and in which an interest is
transferred (or purported to be transferred) hereunder on its books and records (including its accounting
system) with the account code "FERC 142 Account Receivable."

(o)      Conservation Trust Event.  Upon the occurrence of any Conservation Trust Event, such Seller Party
shall within 30 days thereafter, redeem or repurchase all Certificates (as defined in the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement) then outstanding, pay in full all obligations of Seller then outstanding under the
Conservation Trust and cause the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificates, and all related
documents to be cancelled and terminated.

Section 7.2       Negative Covenants of The Seller Parties.  Until the date on which the Aggregate Unpaids
have been indefeasibly paid in full and this Agreement terminates in accordance with its terms, each Seller
Party hereby covenants, as to itself, that:

(a)      Name and Jurisdiction Change, Offices and Records.  Such Seller Party will not change its name,
jurisdiction of organization, identity or corporate structure (within the meaning of Sections 9-503 and/or
9-507 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions), become a "new debtor" (as defined in Section 9-102(a)(56)
of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) with respect to a currently effective security agreement
previously entered into by any other Person, change its "location" (within the meaning of Section 9-307 of
the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) or relocate its chief executive office, principal place of business
or any office where Records are kept unless it shall have:  (i) given the Agent at least forty-five (45)
days' prior written notice thereof and (ii) delivered to the Agent all financing statements, instruments and
other documents requested by the Agent in connection with such change, event or relocation.

(b)      Change in Payment Instructions to Obligors.  Except as may be required by the Agent pursuant to
Section 8.2(b), such Seller Party will not add or terminate any bank as a Collection Bank, or make any
change in the instructions to Obligors regarding payments to be made to any Lock-Box, P.O. Box or Collection
Account, unless the Agent shall have received, at least ten (10) days before the proposed effective date
therefor, (i) written notice of such addition, termination or change and (ii) with respect to the addition
of a Collection Bank or a Collection Account, P.O. Box or Lock-Box, an executed Collection Account Agreement
with respect to the new Collection Account, P.O. Box or Lock-Box; provided, however, that the Servicer may
make changes in instructions to Obligors regarding payments if such new instructions require such Obligor to
make payments to another existing Collection Account.

(c)      Modifications to Contracts and Credit and Collection Policy.  Such Seller Party will not make any
change to the Credit and Collection Policy that could adversely affect the collectibility of the Receivables
or decrease the credit quality of any newly created Receivables.  Except as provided in Section 8.2(d), the
Servicer will not extend, amend or otherwise modify the terms of any Receivable or any Contract related
thereto other than in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy.

(d)      Sales, Liens.  Seller will not sell, assign (by operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise dispose
of, or grant any option with respect to, or create or suffer to exist any Adverse Claim upon (including,
without limitation, the filing of any financing statement) or with respect to, any Receivable, Related
Security or Collections, or upon or with respect to any Contract under which any Receivable arises, or any
Lock-Box, P.O. Box or Collection Account, or assign any right to receive income with respect thereto (other
than, in each case, the creation of the interests therein in favor of the Agent and the Purchasers provided
for herein), and Seller will defend the right, title and interest of the Agent and the Purchasers in, to and
under any of the foregoing property, against all claims of third parties claiming through or under Seller or
Originator.  Seller will not create or suffer to exist any mortgage, pledge, security interest, encumbrance,
lien, charge or other similar arrangement on any of its inventory.

(e)      Net Receivables Balance.  At no time prior to the Amortization Date shall Seller permit the Net
Receivables Balance to be less than an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Aggregate Capital plus (ii) the
Aggregate Reserves, plus (iii) the Seller's Interest.

(f)      Termination Date Determination.  Seller will not designate the Termination Date (as defined in the
Receivables Sale Agreement), or send any written notice to Originator in respect thereof, without the prior
written consent of the Agent, except with respect to the occurrence of such Termination Date arising
pursuant to Section 5.1(d) of the Receivables Sale Agreement.

(g)      Restricted Junior Payments.  From and after the occurrence of any Amortization Event, Seller will
not make any Restricted Junior Payment if, after giving effect thereto, Seller would fail to meet its
obligations set forth in Section 7.2(e).

(h)      Collections.  Except for proceeds of Excluded Receivables (which shall be electronically swept or
otherwise transferred out of such Collection Account within 1 Business Day of being deposited therein in
accordance with Section 7.1(j)), no Seller Party will deposit or otherwise credit, or cause or permit to be
so deposited or credited, to any Collection Account cash or cash proceeds other than Collections.  Except as
may be required by the Agent pursuant to the last sentence of  Section 8.2(b), from and after January 31,
2003, no Seller Party will deposit or otherwise credit, or cause or permit to be so deposited or credited,
any Collections or proceeds thereof to any lock-box account or to any other account not covered by a
Collection Account Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII
                                        ADMINISTRATION AND COLLECTION

Section 8.1       Designation of Servicer.

(a)      The servicing, administration and collection of the Receivables shall be conducted by such Person
(the "Servicer") so designated from time to time in accordance with this Section 8.1.  PSE is hereby
designated as, and hereby agrees to perform the duties and obligations of, the Servicer pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement.  The Agent may at any time following the occurrence of an Amortization Event,
designate as Servicer any Person to succeed PSE or any successor Servicer.

(b)      Without the prior written consent of the Agent and the Required Financial Institutions, PSE shall
not be permitted to delegate any of its duties or responsibilities as Servicer to any Person other than (i)
Seller and (ii) with respect to certain Charged-Off Receivables, outside collection agencies in accordance
with its customary practices.  Seller shall not be permitted to further delegate to any other Person any of
the duties or responsibilities of the Servicer delegated to it by PSE.  If at any time following the
occurrence of an Amortization Event the Agent shall designate as Servicer any Person other than PSE, all
duties and responsibilities theretofore delegated by PSE to Seller may, at the discretion of the Agent, be
terminated forthwith on notice given by the Agent to PSE and to Seller.

(c)      Notwithstanding any delegation by PSE pursuant to the foregoing subsection (b), (i) PSE shall be
and remain primarily liable to the Agent and the Purchasers for the full and prompt performance of all
duties and responsibilities of the Servicer hereunder and (ii) the Agent and the Purchasers shall be
entitled to deal exclusively with PSE in matters relating to the discharge by the Servicer of its duties and
responsibilities hereunder.  The Agent and the Purchasers shall not be required to give notice, demand or
other communication to any Person other than PSE in order for communication to the Servicer and its
sub-servicer or other delegate with respect thereto to be accomplished.  PSE, at all times that it is the
Servicer, shall be responsible for providing any sub-servicer or other delegate of the Servicer with any
notice given to the Servicer under this Agreement.

Section 8.2       Duties of Servicer.

(a)      The Servicer shall take or cause to be taken all such actions as may be necessary or advisable to
collect each Receivable from time to time, all in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations,
with reasonable care and diligence, and in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy.

(b)      The Servicer will instruct all Obligors to pay all Collections either (i) directly to a Collection
Account by means of an automatic electronic funds transfer, wire transfer or otherwise or (ii) directly to a
Lock-Box or P.O. Box.  From and after January 31, 2003, the Servicer shall effect a Collection Account
Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit VI with each bank party to a Collection Account at any time.
In the case of any remittances received in any Lock-Box, P.O. Box or Collection Account that shall have been
identified, to the satisfaction of the Servicer, to not constitute Collections or other proceeds of the
Receivables or the Related Security, the Servicer shall promptly remit such items to the Person identified
to it as being the owner of such remittances.  From and after the date the Agent delivers a Collection
Notice to any Collection Bank or a Postal Notice to any post office pursuant to Section 8.3, the Agent may
request that the Servicer, and the Servicer thereupon promptly shall instruct all Obligors with respect to
the Receivables, to remit all payments thereon to a new lock-box, post office box or depositary account
specified by the Agent and, at all times thereafter, Seller and the Servicer shall not deposit or otherwise
credit, and shall not permit any other Person to deposit or otherwise credit to such new lock-box, post
office box or depositary account any cash or payment item other than Collections.

(c)      The Servicer shall administer the Collections in accordance with the procedures described herein
and in Article II.  The Servicer shall set aside and hold in trust for the account of Seller and the
Purchasers their respective shares of the Collections in accordance with Article II.  The Servicer shall,
upon the request of the Agent, segregate, in a manner acceptable to the Agent, all cash, checks and other
instruments received by it from time to time constituting Collections from the general funds of the Servicer
or Seller prior to the remittance thereof in accordance with Article II.  If the Servicer shall be required
to segregate Collections pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Servicer shall segregate and deposit with a
bank designated by the Agent such allocable share of Collections of Receivables set aside for the Purchasers
on the first Business Day following receipt by the Servicer of such Collections, duly endorsed or with duly
executed instruments of transfer.

(d)      The Servicer may, in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy, extend the maturity of any
Receivable or adjust the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable as the Servicer determines to be appropriate
to maximize Collections thereof; provided, however, that such extension or adjustment shall not alter the
status of such Receivable as a Delinquent Receivable, Defaulted Receivable or Charged-Off Receivable or
limit the rights of the Agent or the Purchasers under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Agent shall have the absolute and unlimited right to direct the Servicer to
commence or settle any legal action with respect to any Receivable or to foreclose upon or repossess any
Related Security.

(e)      The Servicer shall hold in trust for Seller and the Purchasers all Records that (i) evidence or
relate to the Receivables, the related Contracts and Related Security or (ii) are otherwise necessary or
desirable to collect the Receivables and shall, as soon as practicable upon demand of the Agent, deliver or
make available to the Agent all such Records, at a place selected by the Agent.  The Servicer shall, as soon
as practicable following receipt thereof turn over to Seller any cash collections or other cash proceeds
received with respect to Indebtedness not constituting Receivables.  The Servicer shall, from time to time
at the request of any Purchaser, furnish to the Purchasers (promptly after any such request) a calculation
of the amounts set aside for the Purchasers pursuant to Article II.

(f)      Any payment by an Obligor in respect of any indebtedness owed by it to Originator or Seller shall,
except as otherwise specified by such Obligor or otherwise required by contract or law and unless otherwise
instructed by the Agent, be applied as a Collection of any Receivable of such Obligor (starting with the
oldest such Receivable) to the extent of any amounts then due and payable thereunder before being applied to
any other receivable or other obligation of such Obligor.

Section 8.3       Collection Notices.  The Agent is authorized at any time when an Amortization Event exists
or any Daily Reporting Period is in effect, to date and to deliver to the Collection Banks the Collection
Notices and to date and deliver the Postal Notices to the applicable post offices.  Seller hereby transfers
to the Agent for the benefit of the Purchasers, effective when the Agent delivers such notices, the
exclusive ownership and control and "control" (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC of all
applicable jurisdictions) of each Lock-Box, P.O. Box, each Collection Accounts and the amounts on deposit in
any Collection Account.  In case any authorized signatory of Seller whose signature appears on a Collection
Account Agreement shall cease to have such authority before the delivery of such notice, such Collection
Notice or Postal Notice shall nevertheless be valid as if such authority had remained in force.  Effective
when the Agent delivers such notices, Seller hereby authorizes the Agent, and agrees that the Agent shall be
entitled to (i) endorse Seller's name on checks and other instruments representing Collections, (ii) enforce
the Receivables, the related Contracts and the Related Security and (iii) take such action as shall be
necessary or desirable to cause all cash, checks and other instruments constituting Collections of
Receivables to come into the possession of the Agent rather than Seller.

Section 8.4       Responsibilities of Seller.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the exercise
by the Agent and the Purchasers of their rights hereunder shall not release the Servicer, Originator or
Seller from any of their duties or obligations with respect to any Receivables or under the related
Contracts.  The Purchasers shall have no obligation or liability with respect to any Receivables or related
Contracts, nor shall any of them be obligated to perform the obligations of Seller or Originator.

Section 8.5       Reports.  The Servicer shall prepare and forward to the Agent (i) (A) during a Monthly
Reporting Period, on the 15th calendar day of each month (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next
succeeding Business Day), a Monthly Report, (B) during a Weekly Reporting Period, on the 15th calendar day
of each month (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day), a Monthly Report
and on Tuesday of each calendar week (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business
Day), a Weekly Report covering the period from and including Monday of the preceding week to but excluding
Monday of such week and (C) during a Daily Reporting Period, on the 15th calendar day of each month (or if
such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day), a Monthly Report and on each Business
Day (or such other schedule as may be consented to by the Agent), a Daily Report and (ii) at such times as
the Agent shall reasonably request, a listing by Obligor of all Receivables together with an aging of
Receivables.

Section 8.6       Servicing Fees.  In consideration of PSE's agreement to act as Servicer hereunder, the
Purchasers hereby agree that, so long as PSE shall continue to perform as Servicer hereunder, Seller shall
pay over to PSE a fee (the "Servicing Fee") on the first calendar day of each month (or, if such day is not
a Business Day, then the next Business Day thereafter), in arrears for the immediately preceding month,
equal to 0.50% per annum of the average aggregate Outstanding Balance of all Receivables during such period,
as compensation for its servicing activities.

capacity to transfer, or otherwise be incapable of transferring Receivables to Seller under the Receivables
Sale Agreement, or Seller shall for any reason cease to purchase, or cease to have the legal capacity to
purchase, or otherwise be incapable of accepting Receivables from Originator under the Receivables Sale

cease to be effective or to be the legally valid, binding and enforceable obligation of any Seller Party, or
any Obligor shall directly or indirectly contest in any manner such effectiveness, validity, binding nature
or enforceability, or the Agent for the benefit of the Purchasers shall cease to have a valid and perfected
first priority security interest in the Receivables, the Related Security and the Collections with respect
thereto and the Collection Accounts.

Servicing Agreement and the related documents shall have been terminated, once executed and delivered to the
Agent, the Intercreditor Agreement shall terminate in whole or in part or shall cease to be in full force
and effect, or cease to be the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Conservation Trustee, or the
Conservation Trustee or any entity for whom the Conservation Trustee acts shall directly or indirectly
contest in any manner the effectiveness, validity, binding nature or enforceability thereof or (ii) the

contest in any manner the effectiveness, validity, binding nature or enforceability of this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document.

Agent may, or upon the direction of the Required Financial Institutions shall, take any of the following

occurred, whereupon the Amortization Date shall forthwith occur, without demand, protest or further notice

occurrence of an Amortization Event described in Section 9.1(d), or of an actual or deemed entry of an order
for relief with respect to any Seller Party under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or under any other applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement, moratorium or similar laws of any other jurisdiction (foreign or

                                               INDEMNIFICATION

Section 10.1      Indemnities by The Seller Parties.  Without limiting any other rights that the Agent or any
Purchaser may have hereunder or under applicable law, (A) Seller hereby agrees to indemnify (and pay upon
demand to) the Agent and each Purchaser and their respective Affiliates, successors, assigns, officers,
directors, agents and employees (each an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all damages, losses,
claims, taxes, liabilities, costs, expenses and for all other amounts payable, including reasonable
attorneys' fees (which attorneys may be employees of the Agent or such Purchaser) and disbursements (all of
the foregoing being collectively referred to as "Indemnified Amounts") awarded against or incurred by any of
them arising out of or as a result of this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or the transactions
contemplated by any Transaction Document, or any Receivable, Contract or Related Security, or the use of the
proceeds of any purchase or advance hereunder, or the acquisition, funding or ownership, either directly or
indirectly, by a Purchaser of a Purchaser Interest or an interest in the Receivables, the Contract or any
Related Security and (B) the Servicer hereby agrees to indemnify (and pay upon demand to) each Indemnified
Party for Indemnified Amounts awarded against or incurred by any of them arising out of the Servicer's
activities as Servicer hereunder or under any other Transaction Document excluding, however, in all of the
foregoing instances under the preceding clauses (A) and (B):

(i)      Indemnified Amounts to the extent a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction holds that
         such Indemnified Amounts resulted from gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part
         of the Indemnified Party seeking indemnification;

(ii)     Indemnified Amounts to the extent the same includes losses in respect of Receivables that are
         uncollectible on account of the insolvency, bankruptcy or lack of creditworthiness of the
         related Obligor; or

(iii)    taxes imposed by the United States federal government or the jurisdiction in which such Indemnified
         Party's principal executive office is located, on or measured by the overall net or gross
         income of such Indemnified Party to the extent that the computation of such taxes is
         consistent with the characterization for income tax purposes of the acquisition by the
         Purchasers of Purchaser Interests as a loan or loans by the Purchasers to Seller secured by
         the Receivables, the Related Security, the Collection Accounts and the Collections;

provided, however, that nothing contained in this sentence shall limit the liability of any Seller Party or
limit the recourse of the Purchasers to any Seller Party for amounts otherwise specifically provided to be
paid by such Seller Party under the terms of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing indemnification, Seller shall indemnify each Indemnified Party for
Indemnified Amounts (including, without limitation, losses in respect of uncollectible receivables,
regardless of whether reimbursement therefor would constitute recourse to Seller or the Servicer) relating
to or resulting from:

(i)      any representation or warranty made by any Seller Party or Originator (or any officers of any such
         Person) under or in connection with this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any
         other information or report delivered by any such Person pursuant hereto or thereto, which
         shall have been false or incorrect when made or deemed made;

(ii)     the failure by Seller, the Servicer or Originator to comply with any applicable law, rule or
         regulation with respect to any Receivable or Contract related thereto, or the nonconformity
         of any Receivable or Contract included therein with any such applicable law, rule or
         regulation or any failure of Originator to keep or perform any of its obligations, express
         or implied, with respect to any Contract;

(iii)    any failure of Seller, the Servicer or Originator to perform its duties, covenants or other
         obligations in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or any other Transaction
         Document;

(iv)     any products liability, personal injury or damage suit, or other similar claim arising out of or in
         connection with merchandise, insurance or services that are the subject of any Contract or
         any Receivable;

(v)      any dispute, claim, offset or defense (other than discharge in bankruptcy of the Obligor) of the
         Obligor to the payment of any Receivable (including, without limitation, a defense based on
         such Receivable or the related Contract not being a legal, valid and binding obligation of
         such Obligor enforceable against it in accordance with its terms), or any other claim
         resulting from the sale of the merchandise or service related to such Receivable or the
         furnishing or failure to furnish such merchandise or services;

(vi)     the commingling of Collections of Receivables at any time with other funds;

(vii)    any investigation, litigation or proceeding related to or arising from this Agreement or any other
         Transaction Document, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the use of the
         proceeds of an Incremental Purchase or a Reinvestment, the ownership of the Purchaser
         Interests or any other investigation, litigation or proceeding relating to Seller, the
         Servicer or Originator in which any Indemnified Party becomes involved as a result of any
         of the transactions contemplated hereby or by any other Transaction Document;

(viii)   any inability to litigate any claim against any Obligor in respect of any Receivable as a result of
         such Obligor being immune from civil and commercial law and suit on the grounds of
         sovereignty or otherwise from any legal action, suit or proceeding;

(ix)     any Amortization Event described in Section 9.1(d);

(x)      any failure of Seller to acquire and maintain legal and equitable title to, and ownership of any
         Receivable and the Related Security and Collections with respect thereto from Originator,
         free and clear of any Adverse Claim (other than as created hereunder); or any failure of
         Seller to give reasonably equivalent value to Originator under the Receivables Sale
         Agreement in consideration of the transfer by Originator of any Receivable, or any attempt
         by any Person to void such transfer under statutory provisions or common law or equitable
         action;

(xi)     any failure to vest and maintain vested in the Agent for the benefit of the Purchasers, or to
         transfer to the Agent for the benefit of the Purchasers, legal and equitable title to, and
         ownership of, a first priority perfected undivided percentage ownership interest (to the
         extent of the Purchaser Interests contemplated hereunder) or security interest in the
         Receivables, the Related Security and the Collections, free and clear of any Adverse Claim
         (except as created by the Transaction Documents);

(xii)    the failure to have filed, or any delay in filing, financing statements or other similar
         instruments or documents under the UCC of any applicable jurisdiction or other applicable
         laws with respect to any Receivable, the Related Security and Collections with respect
         thereto, and the proceeds of any thereof, whether at the time of any Incremental Purchase
         or Reinvestment or at any subsequent time;

(xiii)   any action or omission by any Seller Party which reduces or impairs the rights of the Agent or the
         Purchasers with respect to any Receivable or the value of any such Receivable;

(xiv)    any attempt by any Person to void any Incremental Purchase or Reinvestment hereunder under
         statutory provisions or common law or equitable action and;

(xv)     the failure of any Receivable included in the calculation of the Net Receivables Balance as an
         Eligible Receivable to be an Eligible Receivable at the time so included.

Section 10.2      Increased Cost and Reduced Return.  If after the date hereof, any Funding Source shall be
charged any fee, expense or increased cost on account of the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
regulation (including any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy) or any change
therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank
or comparable agency or any change in any accounting guideline by an accounting board or authority (whether
or not part of a government or instrumentality thereof) which is responsible for the establishment of or
interpretation of national or international accounting principles (in each case whether foreign or
domestic):  (i) that subjects any Funding Source to any charge or withholding on or with respect to any
Funding Agreement or a Funding Source's obligations under a Funding Agreement, or on or with respect to the
Receivables, or changes the basis of taxation of payments to any Funding Source of any amounts payable under
any Funding Agreement (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of a Funding Source
or taxes excluded by Section 10.1) or (ii) that imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve,
assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
the account of a Funding Source, or credit extended by a Funding Source pursuant to a Funding Agreement or
(iii) that imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase the cost to a Funding Source of
performing its obligations under a Funding Agreement, or to reduce the rate of return on a Funding Source's
capital as a consequence of its obligations under a Funding Agreement, or to reduce the amount of any sum
received or receivable by a Funding Source under a Funding Agreement or to require any payment calculated by
reference to the amount of interests or loans held or interest received by it, then, upon demand by the
Agent, Seller shall pay to the Agent, for the benefit of the relevant Funding Source, such amounts charged
to such Funding Source or such amounts to otherwise compensate such Funding Source for such increased cost
or such reduction.  Without limiting the foregoing, any interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No.
51 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board shall constitute an adoption, change, request or directive
pursuant to this Section 10.2.

Section 10.3      Other Costs and Expenses.  Seller shall reimburse the Agent and Conduit on demand for all
costs and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the preparation, negotiation, arrangement, execution,
delivery, and administration of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and the other documents
to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, the cost of Conduit's auditors auditing the books,
records and procedures of Seller (subject to the cost restrictions set forth in Section 7.1(d)), reasonable
fees and out-of-pocket expenses of legal counsel for Conduit and the Agent (which such counsel may be
employees of Conduit or the Agent) with respect thereto and with respect to advising Conduit and the Agent
as to their respective rights and remedies under this Agreement.  Seller shall reimburse the Agent on demand
for any and all costs and expenses of the Agent and the Purchasers, if any, including reasonable counsel
fees and expenses in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement and the other documents delivered
hereunder and in connection with any restructuring or workout of this Agreement or such documents, or the
administration of this Agreement following an Amortization Event.

ARTICLE XI
                                                  THE AGENT

Section 11.1      Authorization and Action.  Each Purchaser hereby designates and appoints Bank One to act as
its agent hereunder and under each other Transaction Document, and authorizes the Agent to take such actions
as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agent by the terms of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto.  The Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein
or in any other Transaction Document, or any fiduciary relationship with any Purchaser, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities on the part of the Agent shall be
read into this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or otherwise exist for the Agent.  In performing
its functions and duties hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents, the Agent shall act solely as
agent for the Purchasers and does not assume nor shall be deemed to have assumed any obligation or
relationship of trust or agency with or for any Seller Party or any of such Seller Party's successors or
assigns.  The Agent shall not be required to take any action that exposes the Agent to personal liability or
that is contrary to this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or applicable law.  The appointment and
authority of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the indefeasible payment in full of all Aggregate
Unpaids.  Each Purchaser hereby authorizes the Agent to authorize, execute and file each of the Uniform
Commercial Code financing or continuation statements (and amendments thereto and assignments or terminations
thereof) and the Intercreditor Agreement on behalf of such Purchaser (the terms of which shall be binding on
such Purchaser).

Section 11.2      Delegation of Duties.  The Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement and
each other Transaction Document by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.  The Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

Section 11.3      Exculpatory Provisions.  Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or
employees shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (except for its, their or such Person's own
gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Purchasers for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Seller Party contained in this Agreement,
any other Transaction Document or any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or
provided for in, or received under or in connection with, this Agreement, or any other Transaction Document
or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, or
any other Transaction Document or any other document furnished in connection herewith or therewith, or for
any failure of any Seller Party to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder, or for the satisfaction
of any condition specified in Article VI, or for the perfection, priority, condition, value or sufficiency
of any collateral pledged in connection herewith.  The Agent shall not be under any obligation to any
Purchaser to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements or
covenants contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, or to inspect
the properties, books or records of the Seller Parties.  The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of
any Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event unless the Agent has received notice from Seller or a
Purchaser.

Section 11.4      Reliance by Agent.  The Agent shall in all cases be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have
been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including, without limitation, counsel to any Seller Party), independent accountants and other experts
selected by the Agent.  The Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action under this Agreement or any other Transaction  Document unless it shall first receive such advice or
concurrence of Conduit or the Required Financial Institutions or all of the Purchasers, as applicable, as it
deems appropriate and it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Purchasers, provided that
unless and until the Agent shall have received such advice, the Agent may take or refrain from taking any
action, as the Agent shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Purchasers.  The Agent shall in
all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, in accordance with a request of
Conduit or the Required Financial Institutions or all of the Purchasers, as applicable, and such request and
any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Purchasers.

Section 11.5      Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Purchasers.  Each Purchaser expressly acknowledges that
neither the Agent, nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates
has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent hereafter taken, including,
without limitation, any review of the affairs of any Seller Party, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by the Agent.  Each Purchaser represents and warrants to the Agent that it has
and will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Purchaser and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, operations, property, prospects, financial and other conditions and creditworthiness of each
Seller Party and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and all
other documents related hereto or thereto.

Section 11.6      Reimbursement and Indemnification.  The Financial Institutions agree to reimburse and
indemnify the Agent and its officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents ratably according to
their Pro Rata Shares, to the extent not paid or reimbursed by the Seller Parties (i) for any amounts for
which the Agent, acting in its capacity as Agent, is entitled to reimbursement by the Seller Parties
hereunder and (ii) for any other expenses incurred by the Agent, in its capacity as Agent and acting on
behalf of the Purchasers, in connection with the administration and enforcement of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents.

Section 11.7      Agent in its Individual Capacity.  The Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept
deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with any Seller Party or any Affiliate of any
Seller Party as though the Agent were not the Agent hereunder.  With respect to the acquisition of Purchaser
Interests pursuant to this Agreement, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement
in its individual capacity as any Purchaser and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and
the terms "Financial Institution," "Purchaser," "Financial Institutions" and "Purchasers" shall include the
Agent in its individual capacity.

Section 11.8      Successor Agent.  The Agent may, upon five days' notice to Seller and the Purchasers, and
the Agent will, upon the direction of all of the Purchasers (other than the Agent, in its individual
capacity) resign as Agent.  If the Agent shall resign, then the Required Financial Institutions during such
five-day period shall appoint from among the Purchasers a successor agent.  If for any reason no successor
Agent is appointed by the Required Financial Institutions during such five-day period, then effective upon
the termination of such five day period, the Purchasers shall perform all of the duties of the Agent
hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents and Seller and the Servicer (as applicable) shall make
all payments in respect of the Aggregate Unpaids directly to the applicable Purchasers and for all purposes
shall deal directly with the Purchasers.  After the effectiveness of any retiring Agent's resignation
hereunder as Agent, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and
under the other Transaction Documents and the provisions of this Article XI and Article X shall continue in
effect for its benefit with respect to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent
under this Agreement and under the other Transaction Documents.

ARTICLE XII
                                         ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

Section 12.1      Assignments.

(a)      Seller, Servicer, the Agent and each Financial Institution hereby agree and consent to the complete
or partial assignment by Conduit of all or any portion of its rights under, interest in, title to and
obligations under this Agreement to the Financial Institutions pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to the
Liquidity Agreement or to any other Person, and upon such assignment, Conduit shall be released from its
obligations so assigned.  Further, Seller, Servicer, the Agent and each Financial Institution hereby agree
that any assignee of Conduit of this Agreement or all or any of the Purchaser Interests of Conduit shall
have all of the rights and benefits under this Agreement as if the term "Conduit" explicitly referred to
such party (provided that the Purchaser Interest of any such assignee shall accrue Yield pursuant to Article
IV as if such assignee were a Financial Institution hereunder), and no such assignment shall in any way
impair the rights and benefits of Conduit hereunder.  Neither Seller nor the Servicer shall have the right
to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement.

(b)      Any Financial Institution may at any time and from time to time assign to one or more Persons
("Purchasing Financial Institutions") all or any part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
pursuant to an assignment agreement, substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit VII hereto (the
"Assignment Agreement") executed by such Purchasing Financial Institution and such selling Financial
Institution.  The consent of Conduit, Seller and Servicer (such consent in the case of Seller and Servicer
not to be unreasonably withheld) shall be required prior to the effectiveness of any such assignment,
provided, that no such consent of Seller or Servicer shall be required (i) if an Amortization Event has
occurred and is continuing or (ii) the assigning Financial Institution is an Affected Financial
Institution.  Each assignee of a Financial Institution must (i) have a short-term debt rating of A-1 or
better by S&amp;P and P-1 by Moody's and (ii) agree to deliver to the Agent, promptly following any request
therefor by the Agent or Conduit, an enforceability opinion in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent
and Conduit.  Upon delivery of the executed Assignment Agreement to the Agent, such selling Financial
Institution shall be released from its obligations hereunder to the extent of such assignment.  Thereafter
the Purchasing Financial Institution shall for all purposes be a Financial Institution party to this
Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Financial Institution under this Agreement to
the same extent as if it were an original party hereto and no further consent or action by Seller, the
Purchasers or the Agent shall be required.

(c)      Each of the Financial Institutions agrees that in the event that it shall cease to have a
short-term debt rating of A-1 or better by S&amp;P and P-1 by Moody's (an "Affected Financial Institution"),
such Affected Financial Institution shall be obliged, at the request of Conduit or the Agent, to assign all
of its rights and obligations hereunder to (x) another Financial Institution or (y) another funding entity
nominated by the Agent and acceptable to Conduit, and willing to participate in this Agreement through the
Liquidity Termination Date in the place of such Affected Financial Institution; provided that the Affected
Financial Institution receives payment in full, pursuant to an Assignment Agreement, of an amount equal to
such Financial Institution's Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Capital and Yield owing to the Financial
Institutions and all accrued but unpaid fees and other costs and expenses payable in respect of its Pro Rata
Share of the Purchaser Interests of the Financial Institutions.

Section 12.2      Participations.  Any Financial Institution may, in the ordinary course of its business at
any time sell to one or more Persons (each a "Participant") participating interests in its Pro Rata Share of
the Purchaser Interests of the Financial Institutions, its obligation to pay Conduit its Acquisition Amounts
or any other interest of such Financial Institution hereunder.  Notwithstanding any such sale by a Financial
Institution of a participating interest to a Participant, such Financial Institution's rights and
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Financial Institution shall remain solely
responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and Seller, Conduit and the Agent shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Financial Institution in connection with such Financial
Institution's rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Each Financial Institution agrees that any
agreement between such Financial Institution and any such Participant in respect of such participating
interest shall not restrict such Financial Institution's right to agree to any amendment, supplement, waiver
or modification to this Agreement, except for any amendment, supplement, waiver or modification described in
Section 14.1(b)(i).

Section 12.3      Terminating Financial Institutions.

(a)      Each Financial Institution hereby agrees to deliver written notice to the Agent not more than 30
Business Days and not less than 5 Business Days prior to the Liquidity Termination Date indicating whether
such Financial Institution intends to renew its Commitment hereunder.  If any Financial Institution fails to
deliver such notice on or prior to the date that is 5 Business Days prior to the Liquidity Termination Date,
such Financial Institution will be deemed to have declined to renew its Commitment (each Financial
Institution which has declined or has been deemed to have declined to renew its Commitment hereunder, a
"Non-Renewing Financial Institution").  The Agent shall promptly notify Conduit of each Non-Renewing
Financial Institution and Conduit, in its sole discretion, may (A) to the extent of Commitment Availability,
declare that such Non-Renewing Financial Institution's Commitment shall, to such extent, automatically
terminate on a date specified by Conduit on or before the Liquidity Termination Date or (B) upon one (1)
Business Days' notice to such Non-Renewing Financial Institution assign to such Non-Renewing Financial
Institution on a date specified by Conduit its Pro Rata Share of the aggregate Purchaser Interests then held
by Conduit, subject to, and in accordance with, the Liquidity Agreement.  In addition, Conduit  may, in its
sole discretion, at any time (x) to the extent of Commitment Availability, declare that any Affected
Financial Institution's Commitment shall automatically terminate on a date specified by Conduit or (y)
assign to any Affected Financial Institution on a date specified by Conduit its Pro Rata Share of the
aggregate Purchaser Interests then held by Conduit, subject to, and in accordance with, the Liquidity
Agreement (each Affected Financial Institution or each Non-Renewing Financial Institution is hereinafter
referred to as a "Terminating Financial Institution").  The parties hereto expressly acknowledge that any
declaration of the termination of any Commitment, any assignment in accordance with the terms of this
Section 12.3 and the order of priority of any such termination or assignment among Terminating Financial
Institutions shall be made by Conduit in its sole and absolute discretion.

(b)      Upon any assignment to a Terminating Financial Institution as provided in this Section 12.3, any
remaining Commitment of such Terminating Financial Institution shall automatically terminate.  Upon
reduction to zero of the Capital of all of the Purchaser Interests of a Terminating Financial Institution
(after application of Collections thereto pursuant to Sections 2.2 and 2.3) all rights and obligations of
such Terminating Financial Institution hereunder shall be terminated and such Terminating Financial
Institution shall no longer be a "Financial Institution" hereunder; provided, however, that the provisions of
Article X shall continue in effect for its benefit with respect to Purchaser Interests held by such
Terminating Financial Institution prior to its termination as a Financial Institution.

Section 12.4      Extension of Liquidity Termination Date. Seller may advise the Agent in writing of its
desire to extend the Liquidity Termination Date for an additional 364 days, provided such request is made
not more than 90 days prior to, and not less than 60 days prior to, the then current Liquidity Termination
Date.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Agent shall promptly notify each Financial Institution and each such
Financial Institution shall notify the Agent and Seller of its decision to accept or decline the request for
such extension no later than 30 days prior to the then current Liquidity Termination Date (it being
understood that each Financial Institution may accept or decline such request in its sole discretion and on
such terms as it may elect, and the failure to so notify the Agent and Seller shall be deemed an election
not to extend by such Financial Institution). In the event that at least one Financial Institution agrees to
extend the Liquidity Termination Date, the Seller Parties, the extending Financial Institutions and the
Agent shall enter into such documents as such extending Financial Institutions may deem necessary or
appropriate to reflect such extension, and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by such Financial
Institutions and the Agent (including reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be paid by Seller.  In the event
that any Financial Institution declines the request to extend the Liquidity Termination Date, it shall be a
Non-Renewing Financial Institution for all purposes hereof, and if the Commitment of such Non-Renewing
Financial Institution is not assigned to another Person in accordance with the terms of this Article XII
prior to the then current Liquidity Termination Date, the Purchase Limit shall be reduced by an amount equal

Section 14.1      Waivers and Amendments.

(a)      No failure or delay on the part of the Agent or any Purchaser in exercising any power, right or
remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such power, right or remedy preclude any other further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
power, right or remedy.  The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and nonexclusive of any
rights or remedies provided by law.  Any waiver of this Agreement shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

(b)      No provision of this Agreement may be amended, supplemented, modified or waived except in writing
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 14.1(b).  Conduit, Seller and the Agent, at the direction
of the Required Financial Institutions, may enter into written modifications or waivers of any provisions of
this Agreement, provided, however, that no such modification or waiver shall:

(i)      without the consent of each affected Purchaser, (A) extend the Liquidity Termination Date or the
         date of any payment or deposit of Collections by Seller or the Servicer, (B) reduce the
         rate or extend the time of payment of Yield or any CP Costs (or any component of Yield or
         CP Costs), (C) reduce any fee payable to the Agent for the benefit of the Purchasers, (D)
         except pursuant to Article XII hereof, change the amount of the Capital of any Purchaser,
         any Financial Institution's Pro Rata Share (except pursuant to Sections 13.1 or 13.5) or
         any Financial Institution's Commitment, (E) amend, modify or waive any provision of the
         definition of Required Financial Institutions or this Section 14.1(b), (F) consent to or
         permit the assignment or transfer by Seller of any of its rights and obligations under this
         Agreement, (G) change the definition of "Aggregate Reserves," "Applicable Maximum Purchaser
         Interest," "Days Sales Outstanding Ratio," "Default Ratio," "Eligible Receivable", "Net
         Receivables Balance" and "Past Due Ratio" or (H) amend or modify any defined term (or any
         defined term used directly or indirectly in such defined term) used in clauses (A) through
         (G) above in a manner that would circumvent the intention of the restrictions set forth in
         such clauses; or

(ii)     without the written consent of the then Agent, amend, modify or waive any provision of this
         Agreement if the effect thereof is to affect the rights or duties of such Agent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) without the consent of the Financial Institutions, but with the consent
of Seller, the Agent may amend this Agreement solely to add additional Persons as Financial Institutions
hereunder and (ii) the Agent, the Required Financial Institutions and Conduit may enter into amendments to
modify any of the terms or provisions of Article XI, Article XII, Section 14.13 or any other provision of
this Agreement without the consent of any Seller Party, provided that such amendment has no negative impact
upon such Seller Party.  Any modification or waiver made in accordance with this Section 14.1 shall apply to
each of the Purchasers equally and shall be binding upon each Seller Party, the Purchasers and the Agent.

Section 14.2      Notices.  Except as provided in this Section 14.2, all communications and notices provided
for hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telecopy or electronic facsimile transmission or
similar writing) and shall be given to the other parties hereto at their respective addresses or telecopy
numbers set forth on the signature pages hereof or at such other address or telecopy number as such Person
may hereafter specify for the purpose of notice to each of the other parties hereto.  Each such notice or
other communication shall be effective (i) if given by telecopy, upon the receipt thereof, (ii) if given by
mail, three (3) Business Days after the time such communication is deposited in the mail with first class
postage prepaid or (iii) if given by any other means, when received at the address specified in this Section
14.2.  Seller hereby authorizes the Agent to effect purchases and Tranche Period and Bank Rate selections
based on telephonic notices made by any Person whom the Agent in good faith believes to be acting on behalf
of Seller.  Seller agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written confirmation of each telephonic notice
signed by an authorized officer of Seller; provided, however, the absence of such confirmation shall not
affect the validity of such notice.  If the written confirmation differs from the action taken by the Agent,
the records of the Agent shall govern absent manifest error.

Section 14.3      Ratable Payments.  If any Purchaser, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it
with respect to any portion of the Aggregate Unpaids owing to such Purchaser (other than payments received
pursuant to Section 10.2 or 10.3) in a greater proportion than that received by any other Purchaser entitled
to receive a ratable share of such Aggregate Unpaids, such Purchaser agrees, promptly upon demand, to
purchase for cash without recourse or warranty a portion of such Aggregate Unpaids held by the other
Purchasers so that after such purchase each Purchaser will hold its ratable proportion of such Aggregate
Unpaids; provided that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such
Purchaser, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery,
but without interest.

Section 14.4      Protection of Ownership Interests of the Purchasers.

(a)      Seller agrees that from time to time, at its expense, it will promptly execute and deliver all
instruments and documents, and take all actions, that may be necessary or desirable, or that the Agent may
reasonably request, to perfect, protect or more fully evidence the Purchaser Interests, or to enable the
Agent or the Purchasers to exercise and enforce their rights and remedies hereunder.  Without limiting the
foregoing, Seller will, upon the request of the Agent, file such financing or continuation statements, or
amendments thereto or assignments thereof, and execute and file such other instruments and documents, that
may be necessary or desirable, or that the Agent may reasonably request, to perfect, protect or evidence
such Purchaser Interests.  At any time after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Amortization
Event, the Agent may, or the Agent may direct Seller or the Servicer to, notify the Obligors of Receivables,
at Seller's expense, of the ownership or security interests of the Purchasers under this Agreement and may
also direct that payments of all amounts due or that become due under any or all Receivables be made
directly to the Agent or its designee.   Seller or the Servicer (as applicable) shall, at any Purchaser's
request, withhold the identity of such Purchaser in any such notification.

(b)      If any Seller Party fails to perform any of its obligations hereunder, the Agent or any Purchaser
may (but shall not be required to) perform, or cause performance of, such obligations, and the Agent's or
such Purchaser's costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by Seller as provided
in Section 10.3.  Each Seller Party irrevocably authorizes the Agent at any time and from time to time in
the sole and absolute discretion of the Agent, and appoints the Agent as its attorney-in-fact, to act on
behalf of such Seller Party (i) to authorize and/or execute on behalf of such Seller Party as debtor and to
file financing or continuation statements (and amendments thereto and assignments thereof) necessary or
desirable in the Agent's sole and absolute discretion to perfect and to maintain the perfection and priority
of the interest of the Purchasers in the Receivables and (ii) to file a carbon, photographic or other
reproduction of this Agreement or any financing statement with respect to the Receivables, the Related
Security and the Collections as a financing statement in such jurisdictions and in such offices as the Agent
in its sole and absolute discretion deems necessary or desirable to perfect and to maintain the perfection
and priority of the interests of the Purchasers in the Receivables, the Related Security and the
Collections.  This appointment is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.  The authorization by each
Seller Party set forth in the second sentence of this Section 14.4(b) is intended to meet all requirements
for authorization by a debtor under Article 9 of any applicable enactment of the UCC, including, without
limitation, Section 9-509 thereof.

Section 14.5      Confidentiality.

(a)      Each Seller Party and each Purchaser shall maintain and shall cause each of its employees and
officers to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and the other confidential or proprietary
information with respect to the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Agent
and Conduit and their respective businesses obtained by it or them in connection with the structuring,
negotiating and execution of the transactions contemplated herein, except that such Seller Party and such
Purchaser and its officers and employees may disclose such information to such Seller Party's and such
Purchaser's external accountants and attorneys, to any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such
Person or as required by any applicable law or order of any judicial or administrative proceeding.

(b)      Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Seller Party hereby consents to the
disclosure of any nonpublic information with respect to it (i) to the Agent, the Financial Institutions or
Conduit by each other, (ii) by the Agent or the Purchasers to any prospective or actual assignee or
participant of any of them and (iii) by the Agent to any rating agency, Commercial Paper dealer or provider
of a surety, guaranty or credit or liquidity enhancement to Conduit or any entity organized for the purpose
of purchasing, or making loans secured by, financial assets for which Bank One acts as the administrative
agent and to any officers, directors, employees, outside accountants and attorneys of any of the foregoing.
In addition, the Purchasers and the Agent may disclose any such nonpublic information pursuant to any law,
rule, regulation, direction, request or order of any judicial, administrative or regulatory authority or
proceedings (whether or not having the force or effect of law).

Section 14.6      Bankruptcy Petition.  Seller, the Servicer, the Agent and each Financial Institution hereby
covenants and agrees that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all
outstanding senior indebtedness of Conduit or any Funding Source that is a special purpose bankruptcy remote
entity, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, Conduit or any such
entity any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or other similar
proceeding under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States.

Section 14.7      Limitation of Liability.  Except with respect to any claim arising out of the willful
misconduct or gross negligence of Conduit, the Agent or any Financial Institution, no claim may be made by
any Seller Party or any other Person against Conduit, the Agent or any Financial Institution or their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys or agents for any special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of
liability arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any act, omission
or event occurring in connection therewith; and each Seller Party hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to
sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to
exist in its favor.

Section 14.8      CHOICE OF LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.

Section 14.9      CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.  EACH SELLER PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR ILLINOIS STATE COURT SITTING IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS IN ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT EXECUTED BY SUCH PERSON PURSUANT
TO THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH SELLER PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION
OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW
OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT
SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.  NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT OR ANY PURCHASER TO
BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ANY SELLER PARTY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.  ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING
BY ANY SELLER PARTY AGAINST THE AGENT OR ANY PURCHASER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE AGENT OR ANY PURCHASER
INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT EXECUTED BY SUCH SELLER PARTY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN
A COURT IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

Section 14.10     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL
PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE)
IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY DOCUMENT EXECUTED BY ANY SELLER
PARTY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER.

Section 14.11     Integration; Binding Effect; Survival of Terms.

(a)      This Agreement and each other Transaction Document contain the final and complete integration of
all prior expressions by the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall constitute
the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof superseding all
prior oral or written understandings.

(b)      This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns (including any trustee in bankruptcy).  This Agreement shall
create and constitute the continuing obligations of the parties hereto in accordance with its terms and
shall remain in full force and effect until terminated in accordance with its terms; provided, however, that
the rights and remedies with respect to (i) any breach of any representation and warranty made by any Seller
Party pursuant to Article V, (ii) the indemnification and payment provisions of Article X, and Sections 14.5
and 14.6 shall be continuing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

Section 14.12     Counterparts; Severability; Section References.  This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the
same Agreement.  Any provisions of this Agreement which are prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  Unless
otherwise expressly indicated, all references herein to "Article," "Section," "Schedule" or "Exhibit" shall
mean articles and sections of, and schedules and exhibits to, this Agreement.

Section 14.13     Bank One Roles.  Each of the Financial Institutions acknowledges that Bank One acts, or may
in the future act, (i) as administrative agent for Conduit or any Financial Institution, (ii) as issuing and
paying agent for the Commercial Paper, (iii) to provide credit or liquidity enhancement for the timely
payment for the Commercial Paper and (iv) to provide other services from time to time for Conduit or any
Financial Institution (collectively, the "Bank One Roles").  Without limiting the generality of this Section
14.13, each Financial Institution hereby acknowledges and consents to any and all Bank One Roles and agrees
that in connection with any Bank One Role, Bank One may take, or refrain from taking, any action that it, in
its discretion, deems appropriate, including, without limitation, in its role as administrative agent for
Conduit, and the giving of notice to the Agent of a mandatory purchase pursuant to the Liquidity Agreement.

Section 14.14     Characterization.

(a)      It is the intention of the parties hereto that each purchase hereunder shall constitute and be
treated as an absolute and irrevocable sale, which purchase shall provide the applicable Purchaser with the
full benefits of ownership of the applicable Purchaser Interest.  Except as specifically provided in this
Agreement, each sale of a Purchaser Interest hereunder is made without recourse to Seller; provided,
however, that (i) Seller shall be liable to each Purchaser and the Agent for all representations, warranties,
covenants and indemnities made by Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) such sale does
not constitute and is not intended to result in an assumption by any Purchaser or the Agent or any assignee
thereof of any obligation of Seller or Originator or any other person arising in connection with the
Receivables, the Related Security, or the related Contracts, or any other obligations of Seller or
Originator.

(b)      In addition to any ownership interest which the Agent may from time to time acquire pursuant
hereto, Seller hereby grants to the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Purchasers a valid and perfected
security interest in all of Seller's right, title and interest in, to and under all Receivables now existing
or hereafter arising, the Collections, each Lock-Box, each P.O. Box, each Collection Account, all Related
Security, all other rights and payments relating to such Receivables, and all proceeds of any thereof prior
to all other liens on and security interests therein to secure the prompt and complete payment of the
Aggregate Unpaids.  The Agent and the Purchasers shall have, in addition to the rights and remedies that
they may have under this Agreement, all other rights and remedies provided to a secured creditor under the
UCC in effect in any jurisdiction and other applicable law, which rights and remedies shall be cumulative.

Section 14.15     Excess Funds.  Each of Seller, the Servicer, each Purchaser and the Agent agrees that
Conduit shall be liable for any claims that such party may have against Conduit only to the extent that
Conduit has funds in excess of those funds necessary to pay matured and maturing Commercial Paper and to the
extent such excess funds are insufficient to satisfy the obligations of Conduit hereunder, Conduit shall
have no liability with respect to any amount of such obligations remaining unpaid and such unpaid amount
shall not constitute a claim against Conduit.  Any and all claims against Conduit shall be subordinate to
the claims against Conduit of the holders of Commercial Paper and any Person providing liquidity support to
Conduit.

                           (b)      contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable
                                    law or regulation or of its articles or certificate of incorporation or

                           a party has been duly executed and delivered by Originator and constitutes the

                           pursuant to Section 9-516 of the Washington UCC.

                           security interest in favor of Seller in all Receivables and upon the filing of
                           financing statements, Seller shall acquire a first priority, perfected security
                           interest in such Receivables.

                  --       To the best of the opinion giver's knowledge, there is no action, suit or other
                           proceeding against Originator or any Affiliate of Originator, which would
                           materially adversely affect the business or financial condition of Originator and
                           its Affiliates taken as a whole or which would materially adversely affect the
                           ability of Originator to perform its obligations under the Receivables Sale
                           Agreement.

12.      Executed copies of (i) all consents from and authorizations by any Persons and (ii) all waivers and

                           (b)      contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable
                                    law or regulation or of its articles or certificate of incorporation or
                                    bylaws or of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other
                                    instrument binding upon such Person; or

                           (c)      result in the creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim on assets of
                                    such Person or any of its Subsidiaries (except as contemplated by this
                                    Agreement).

                  --       This Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which such Person is a party
                           has been duly executed and delivered by such Person and constitutes the legal,
                           valid, and binding obligation of such Person, enforceable in accordance with its
                           terms, except to the extent the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
                           insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
                           generally and subject also to the availability of equitable remedies if equitable
                           remedies are sought.

                  --       The provisions of this Agreement are sufficient to constitute authorization by
                           Seller for the filing of the financing statements required under this Agreement.

                  --       The financing statements include not only all of the types of information required
                           by Section 9-502(a) of the Washington UCC but also the types of information
                           without which the Filing Office may refuse to accept the Financing Statement
                           pursuant to Section 9-516 of the Washington UCC.

                  --       For the purposes of the Washington UCC, Seller is a "registered organization".

                  --       The provisions of the Agreement are effective to create a valid security interest
                           in favor of the Agent for the benefit of the Purchasers in all Receivables, and
                           upon the filing of financing statements, the Agent for the benefit of the
                           Purchasers shall acquire a first priority, perfected security interest in such
                           Receivables.

                  --       To the best of the opinion giver's knowledge, there is no action, suit or other
                           proceeding against any Seller Party or any of their respective Affiliates, which
                           would materially adversely affect the business or financial condition of such
                           Person and its Affiliates taken as a whole or which would materially adversely
                           affect the ability of such Person to perform its obligations under any Transaction
                           Document to which it is a party.

12.      If requested by Conduit or the Agent, a favorable opinion of legal counsel for each Financial
         Institution, reasonably acceptable to the Agent which addresses the following matters:

                  --       This Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of such
                           Financial Institution.

                  --       This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Financial Institution
                           and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the other
                           parties thereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such
                           Financial Institution, enforceable against such Financial Institution in
                           accordance with its terms.

13.      A Compliance Certificate.

14.      The Fee Letter.

15.      A Monthly Report as at the last day of the calendar month immediately prior to the initial
         Incremental Purchase.

16.      Executed copies of (i) all consents from and authorizations by any Persons and (ii) all waivers and
         amendments to existing credit facilities, that are necessary in connection with this Agreement.

17.      A direction letter executed by Seller and the Servicer authorizing the Agent and Conduit, and
         directing warehousemen to allow the Agent and Conduit to inspect and make copies from Seller's
         books and records maintained at off-site data processing or storage facilities.

18.      For each Purchaser that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America, or a
         state thereof, two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
         W-8ECI, certifying in either case that such Purchaser is entitled to receive payments under the
         Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes.

19.      Executed Purchase Notice.
