Landlord under this Lease, hereby assumes all risk of and waives all claims against
Landlord for, loss or damage of any kind or nature relating to Landlord&#146;s
failure or inability to terminate the existing leasehold and/or cause any such
existing tenant or occupant to vacate the Premises. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, that Tenant shall not have the right to terminate if the

action that Tenant is required to take as and when specified in this Lease.</font></p>

records of all Gross Sales Adjustments.&#160;

Tenant which will result in a refund to Tenant must be reported to Landlord
within the ninety (90) day period following the end of the calendar year in
which such Gross Sales were made.&#160; If
any governmental authority shall increase the sales reported by Tenant on any
such tax return, after audit for any calendar year for which such sales have
been reported, then Tenant shall notify Landlord promptly of such increase and
pay any additional Percentage Rent due at that time.&#160; If it shall be determined as a result of an audit that there has
been a deficiency in the payment of Percentage Rent, then such deficiency shall
become immediately due and payable with interest at the Interest Rate from the
date when said payment was due.&#160; In
addition, if Tenant understates Gross Sales by more than three percent (3%), or
if any audit shows that Tenant has failed to maintain the books of account and
records as required or if Tenant fails to appear for and/or cooperate with
Landlord&#146;s audit representative and, as a result, Landlord is unable to verify
the accuracy of Tenant&#146;s statement, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord all
reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees)
incurred by Landlord in conducting such audit and collecting any underpayment.&#160; If such audit shall disclose any fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by Tenant, then, in addition to all other rights
and remedies hereunder, Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease with no
further obligations thereafter accruing from Landlord to Tenant.</font></p>

hereunder shall be reasonably satisfactory to Landlord.&#160; If Landlord or any of the other additional

contributing, excess or contingent basis, the amount of Tenant&#146;s insurance
company&#146;s liability under the policy of insurance maintained by Tenant shall
not be reduced by the existence of such other insurance. Tenant shall, prior to
the Commencement Date and from time to time during the Lease Term at Landlord&#146;s
request, provide Landlord with a completed Certificate of Insurance, using a
form acceptable in Landlord&#146;s reasonable judgment, attaching thereto copies of
all endorsements required to be provided by Tenant under this Lease. If Tenant

Landlord, in addition to its other rights and remedies, may (but shall not be

Tenant&#146;s expense. Landlord, at any time, and from time to time, may require the
insurance limits set forth herein to be increased to reflect the
then-prevailing standards in the industry as to businesses of the type being
operated at the time in the Premises.</font></p>

sublease or conveyance voluntarily made by Tenant of some or all of Tenant&#146;s
interest, rights or duties in this Lease or the Premises, including Tenant&#146;s
right to use, occupy or possess the Premises, in whole or in part, including,

mortgage, deed of trust, trust, operation of law, or otherwise of any shares,

control of Tenant, unless such change results from the trading of shares listed
on a recognized public stock exchange and such trading is not for the purpose
of acquiring effective control of Tenant.&#160;
If Tenant is a private corporation whose stock becomes publicly held,
the transfers of such stock from private to public ownership shall not be
deemed a Change of Control.&#160; If Tenant
is a sole proprietorship, the death or incapacity of Tenant shall be deemed a

<p style="margin:0in 0in 12.0pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt;">As used in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Section, the &#147;worth at the
time of award&#148; is computed by allowing interest at the Interest Rate.&#160; &#147;Interest Rate&#148; means the lesser of (i) the
maximum lawful rate permitted by usury or similar law in the State of
California to be charged by Landlord to Tenant, or (ii) four percent (4%) above
the annualized rate of interest publicly announced from time to time by Bank of
America NT&amp;SA (or its successors-in-interest), as its &#147;prime rate&#148; or
&#147;reference rate,&#148; and such interest shall be computed on the basis of monthly
compounding with actual days elapsed compared to a 360-day year. As used in
subparagraph (c) of this Section, the &#147;worth at the time of award&#148; is computed
by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of
San Francisco at the time of award plus one percent (1%). All additional rent
shall, for the purposes of calculating any amount due under the provisions of
subparagraph (c) of this Section, be computed on the basis of the average
monthly amount thereof accruing during the immediately preceding sixty (60)
month period, except that, if it becomes necessary to compute such additional
rent before such a sixty (60) month period has occurred, then such additional
rent shall be computed on the basis of the average monthly amount hereof
accruing during such shorter period.</font></p>

against Tenant for a default under Section 19.1(a) above; although Tenant shall
be entitled to assert any such claims in a separate action brought by Tenant.&#160; Tenant hereby waives its right to jury trial

amount of Minimum Rent or additional rent when due, such unpaid amount shall
bear interest from the date due until paid, at the Interest Rate. In addition
to such interest, Tenant acknowledges that the late payment by Tenant of any
installment of Minimum Rent or additional rent when due will cause Landlord to
incur certain costs and expenses not contemplated under this Lease, the exact
amount of which costs are extremely difficult or impracticable to
determine.&#160; Such costs and expenses will
include, without limitation, attorneys&#146; fees, administrative and collection costs,
and processing and accounting expenses and other costs and expenses necessary
and incidental thereto.&#160; Therefore, if
any such installment is not received by Landlord from Tenant within ten (10)
days after Tenant receives written notice from Landlord that such sum is owed
(provided that no such notice shall be required if Tenant has received one (1)
or more written notices of nonpayment or past-due payment from Landlord under
this Section within the preceding twelve (12) months), Tenant shall immediately
pay to Landlord, in addition to the interest provided above, ten percent (10%)
of such payment as a late charge.&#160;
Landlord and Tenant agree that such late charge represents a reasonable
estimate of such costs and expenses and is fair compensation to Landlord for
Landlord&#146;s loss caused by Tenant&#146;s late payment.&#160; The interest and late charges set forth herein are in addition to
the unpaid amount, and acceptance of such late charge shall not constitute a
waiver of Tenant&#146;s default with respect to such overdue amount, nor prevent
Landlord from exercising any other rights and remedies granted hereunder or by
law to Landlord.</font></p>

accordance with the United States Arbitration Act (Title 9, U.S. Code),
notwithstanding any choice of law provision in this Agreement, and under the
Commercial Rules of the AAA.&#160; The
arbitrator(s) shall give effect to statutes of limitation in determining any
claim.&#160; Any controversy concerning
whether an issue is arbitrable shall be determined by the arbitrator(s).&#160; Judgment upon the arbitration award may be
