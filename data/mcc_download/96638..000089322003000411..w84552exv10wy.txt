MASTER AGREEMENT  (MA-01-02)                   [D&B LOGO] DECIDE WITH CONFIDENCE

Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. ("D&B") and the customer named on the attached Order
("Customer") agree that D&B shall make available to Customer business
information services ("Services"), which may include information
("Information"); computer programs or applications (including those accessed
remotely), documentation and media (collectively, "Software"); and other
services, subject to this Master Agreement ("Agreement"). The Services subject
to this Agreement are identified in Orders entered into from time to time by D&B
and Customer. No obligation to furnish or to pay for a particular Service arises
under this Agreement until D&B accepts an order and any attachments thereto
placed by Customer. All accepted orders and their attachments (collectively, the
"Order(s)") for Services are subject to this Agreement, and the terms of such
Orders are incorporated by reference in this Agreement. Subject to paragraph
10.2, this Agreement continues in force even though no Order may then be
outstanding. The Services will also be made available to U.S. companies that are
subsidiaries, divisions or affiliates, wholly-owned or controlled by Customer
and that are identified on a "Customer-Related Companies" schedule.

1. LICENSES

1.1 D&B grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable license ("License")
to use and display the Information and Software (in object code format only)
constituting each D&B product specified in an Order, subject to the limitations
contained in this Agreement and such Order. D&B retains all ownership rights
(including copyrights and other intellectual property rights) in the Services,
in any form, and Customer obtains only such rights as are explicitly granted in
this Agreement and such Order. The Services will include a custom model
developed by D&B through the use of D&B and Customer information. To the extent
such model is customized for Customer, the customized model shall be owned by
Customer; provided that (i) Customer grants D&B a license to use such model in
connection with its provision of Services to Customer hereunder, (ii) Customer's
ownership of the customized model does not (x) include ownership of any D&B
information, techniques, processes, methods, expertise, or other intellectual
property included therein (which collectively remain D&B intellectual property)
or (y) affect D&B's ability or rights with respect to the use of such D&B
information, techniques, processes, methods, expertise, or other intellectual
property for the purpose of developing custom models for other customers for any
purpose, and (iii) Customer shall not license, sell, distribute or otherwise
make available such custom model to any third party, other than those third
parties to which Customer may make Information or Software available pursuant to
the first sentence of paragraph 2.2.

1.2 Each License and Order is for a term, beginning on the date of the Order, of
12 months, unless another term is specified in the Order. D&B may extend the
term for an additional period, in its discretion, while the parties are engaged
in renewal discussions. Any such extension shall be subject to this Agreement.
Each License or Order may be renewed as set forth in the Order and by mutual
written agreement and payment of renewal fees and applicable product and service
fees (the initial term and any renewal period for an Order or License constitute
"the Term" for such Order or License).

1.3 Software "Updates" (i.e., minor enhancements, additions, and substitutions
to Software, including corrections and bug fixes) are provided at no additional
fee, if available. "Upgrades" (i.e., modifications, additions or substitutions
that result in a substantial change, improvement or addition to Software), if
available, are provided for an additional fee, if applicable. The determination
of whether a matter involves an Update or an Upgrade is within the sole
discretion of D&B. All Updates and Upgrades obtained by Customer are subject to
this Agreement.

1.4 Telephone and email based software support is available during the Term of
an Order for the currently licensed Software versions, and only if Customer has
installed all Updates received.

2. RESTRICTIONS ON USE

2.1 Information and Software are licensed for Customer's internal use only and
(i) only at the points of service specified in the Order; (ii) only for the
frequency of use or total number of users set forth in the Order; and (iii)
subject to any other restrictions set forth in the Order.

2.2 Customer will not provide Information or Software to others, whether
directly in any media or indirectly through incorporation in a database,
marketing list, report or otherwise, or use or permit the use of Information to
generate any statistical or other information that is or will be provided to
third parties (including as the basis for providing recommendations to others);
use or permit the use of Information to prepare any comparison to other
information databases that is or will be provided to third parties; or
voluntarily produce Information in legal proceedings; except that Customer may
provide Information or Software to Representatives as defined below, in response
to regulatory requests, or as otherwise required by law. Customer shall: (i)
maintain the Information in strict confidence, including by restricting
disclosure of the Information solely to those of its employees, consultants,
agents and advisors (collectively, "Representatives") with a need to know and
not allowing it to be disclosed, through negligence or otherwise, to third
parties, (ii) advise Representatives who receive the Confidential Information of
their obligations hereunder and assume full responsibility for any breach by
them of such obligations, (iii) use the Confidential Information only in
furtherance of the business relationship described in Paragraph 1 above, and
(iv) take all steps to ensure that no unauthorized persons have access to
Confidential Information and that all persons having access to Confidential
Information refrain from any unauthorized disclosure.

2.3 Customer will not attempt to access, use, modify, copy, reverse engineer, or
otherwise derive the source code of Software.

2.4 Upon reasonable notice and during regular business hours, Customer will
permit D&B to inspect the locations at, or computer systems on which,
Information and Software are used, stored or transmitted so that D&B can verify
Customer's compliance with this Agreement.

2.5 Customer will be responsible for any direct damages or lost profits incurred
by D&B as a result of Customer's breach of this paragraph 2.

3. COPYING

3.1 Customer will not copy, download, upload or in any other way reproduce
Information or Software except for (i) creating a reasonable number of copies of
Information in any format for internal use only in accordance with this
Agreement and not for general internal distribution; and (ii) making one copy of
Information and of Software for internal archival purposes.

4. D-U-N-S NUMBERS

4.1 D-U-N-S Numbers are proprietary to and controlled by D&B. D&B grants
Customer a non-exclusive, perpetual, limited license to use D-U-N-S Numbers
solely for identification purposes and only for Customer's internal business
use. Where practicable, Customer will refer to the number as a "D-U-N-S Number"
and state that D-U-N-S is a registered trademark of D&B.

5. THIRD PARTY SERVICES

5.1 Customer may engage a third party to process or host Information (the
"Processor") provided that the Processor and D&B enter into a D&B Processor's
Agreement before any Information or Software is provided to the Processor.

5.2 Third parties that provide Information to D&B for use in providing the
Services are intended third party beneficiaries of paragraphs 8 and 11.

6. PAYMENT

6.1 Customer will pay D&B in accordance with the Order. Prices and product
descriptions are those set forth in the Order, or, if not included in the Order,
in the applicable pricing and product policies made available to Customer in
hard copy or on any D&B Internet site, which policies are incorporated herein. A
late payment charge of the lesser of 1 1/2% per month or the highest lawful rate
may be applied to any outstanding balances until paid.

6.2 Customer will pay any applicable taxes relating to this Agreement, other
than taxes based on D&B income and franchise - related taxes.

6.3 For certain Orders for a committed volume or usage represented by an upfront
payment by Customer, Customer may be entitled to "carry over" portions of unused
volume or usage upon renewal. In addition, if Customer's


MA-01-02

<PAGE>

usage exceeds the committed amount, such excess usage shall be billed at a
specified "overrun" rate. Such carryover and/or overrun rate, if applicable,
will be determined in accordance with the Order, or, if not included in the
Order, in the applicable pricing and product policies made available to Customer
in hard copy or on any D&B Internet site.

6.4 If Customer's pricing with respect to a particular Order is based on
Customer's expected volume or usage as indicated on such Order and Customer does
not meet such volume or usage levels, Customer will pay D&B a "true-up amount"
based on the pricing applicable to the volume or usage actually utilized by
Customer.

7. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW

7.1 Customer will not use Information as a factor in establishing an
individual's eligibility for (i) credit or insurance to be used primarily for
personal, family, or household purposes, or (ii) employment. In addition,
Customer will not use any Service to engage in any unfair or deceptive practices
and will use the Services only in compliance with applicable state, local,
federal or foreign laws or regulations, including laws and regulations regarding
telemarketing, customer solicitation (including fax and/or e-mail solicitation),
data protection and privacy.

8. DISCLAIMERS

8.1 Though D&B uses extensive procedures to keep its database current and to
maintain accurate data, Customer acknowledges that the Information will contain
a degree of error and that Customer is responsible for determining that the
Information is sufficiently accurate for Customer's purposes. If the Information
is not sufficiently accurate for Customer's purposes, then Customer must so
notify D&B, in writing, within 15 days after receipt of such Information. D&B
will, at its option, either correct the inaccuracy at D&B's expense or refund
any amounts paid relating to the unusable Information.
