         4.01 Covenants of Seller.  Seller  covenants and agrees with Buyer that
              -------------------

replaced by equivalent  property and production  sold in the ordinary  course of
business  and  which is  accounted  for  hereunder  or  consumed  in the  normal
operation of the Interests.

              (c)  Take  or  cause  to be  taken  all  such  actions  as  may be
reasonably  necessary or advisable to consummate  and make effective the sale of
the Interests and the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and to assure

              (d) Promptly notify Buyer (i) if any representation or warranty of
Seller  contained in this  Agreement is discovered to be or becomes  untrue,  or

permits,  licenses and  authorizations  as may be necessary for Buyer to own and
operate  the  Interests   following  the   consummation   of  the   transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

              (g)  Exercise  all due  diligence  in  safe-guarding  and securely
maintaining all engineering,  geological and geophysical data, reports and maps,
all other  confidential  information,  in any medium or form whatsoever,  in the
possession of Seller relating to the Interests.

              (h) Promptly  notify Buyer if any material  adverse  change occurs
with respect to the Interests.

              (i)  Immediately  cease and cause to be  terminated  all  existing
discussions  and  negotiations,  if any such exist,  with any parties  conducted
heretofore  with respect to any  Acquisition  Proposal.  As used in this Section
4.01(i),  "Acquisition  Proposal"  means any tender offer or exchange offer by a
non-affiliated  third party for fifty percent or more of the outstanding  shares
of  common  stock  either or both of the  parties  constituting  Seller,  or any
proposal or offer by a non-affiliated  third party for a merger,  consolidation,
amalgamation or other business  combination  involving either party constituting
Seller,  or  any  equity  securities  (or  securities  convertible  into  equity
securities) of either party  constituting  Seller, or any proposal or offer by a
non-affiliated  third party to acquire in any manner a fifty  percent or greater
equity or beneficial  interest in, or a material  portion of the assets or value
of either party  constituting  Seller,  other than pursuant to the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  Unless and until this Agreement shall have been
terminated,  the  parties  constituting  Seller  shall not  permit  any of their
respective officers,  directors,  employees, agents, financial advisors, counsel

facilitating  the making of, any offer or proposal that  constitutes  or that is
reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition  Proposal,  (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) furnish
to any person or business  entity (other than St. Mary,  Buyer, or any affiliate
or Representative of Seller) any nonpublic information or nonpublic data outside
the ordinary course of conducting  Seller's business.  Seller shall notify Buyer
of any such inquiries, offers or proposals (including the identity of the person
or entity making any inquiry,  offer or proposal) as promptly as possible and in
any event within  twenty four hours after receipt  thereof or the  occurrence of
such events, as appropriate.

              (j)  Subject to the  provisions  of Section  2.02(a)(iii),  Seller
shall pay all ad valorem, property, production,  severance and similar taxes and
assessments with respect to the Interests for all periods prior to the Effective
Time.

              (k) Seller shall retain and discharge all of its  liabilities  and
obligations  accruing  prior to Closing  other than  those  associated  with the
operation and  maintenance  of the Interests in the ordinary  course of business
and incurred from the Effective Time until Closing,  unless such liabilities and
obligations  are otherwise  specifically  attributed to Buyer in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

              (l)   Seller   shall   grant   Buyer,   or   Buyer's    authorized
representatives,  at all  reasonable  times prior to Closing  and upon  adequate
notice to Seller, physical access to the Interests for the purpose of inspecting
same insofar as Seller is the operator  for such  portion of the  Interests.  If
Seller is not the  operator of the  affected  portion of the  Interests,  Seller
shall  make  a  good  faith  effort  to  give  Buyer,   or  Buyer's   authorized
representatives,  at all  reasonable  times before  Closing,  and upon  adequate
notice to  Seller,  physical  access to such  portion of the  Interests  for the
purpose  of  inspecting  the  same.  Where  Seller  is not the  operator,  Buyer
recognizes  that  Seller's  ability  to  obtain  access to such  portion  of the
Interests  and the  manner  and  extent of such  access is subject to the rules,
regulations and conditions of such third party operators. Buyer agrees to comply
fully  with the  rules,  regulations  and  instructions  issued by Seller or the
operator  of such  property  where  Seller is not the  operator,  regarding  the
actions of Buyer while upon, entering or leaving the Interests.

contractual  restriction that would prohibit or delay the timely consummation of
such transactions.

              (b)  Cause  all  the   representations  and  warranties  of  Buyer
contained  in this  Agreement  to be true and  correct on and as of the  Closing
Date.

              (c) Promptly notify Seller (i) if any  representation  or warranty
of Buyer contained in this Agreement is discovered to be or becomes  untrue,  or
(ii) if  Buyer  fails to  perform  or  comply  with any  covenant  or  agreement
contained in this Agreement or it is reasonably  anticipated  that Buyer will be
unable to perform or comply with any  covenant or  agreement  contained  in this
Agreement.

              (d)  St.   Mary   shall,   subject  to  the   provisions   of  the

access  at  all  reasonable  times  to  its  assets,  liabilities,  records  and

              (g) St. Mary shall  cause the Shares of St.  Mary Stock  issued to
Seller upon the Closing to be approved for listing  (subject to official  notice
of issuance) on the New York Stock Exchange.

              (h) Prior to the  Closing,  Buyer will  satisfy  all  bonding  and
regulatory  requirements  of all state and federal  governmental  authorities so
that  Buyer  is  qualified  to  own  the  Interests.  The  consummation  of  the
transactions  contemplated  hereby will not cause Buyer to be disqualified as an
owner of state or federal oil, gas and mineral leases,  or to exceed any acreage
limitation imposed by any law, statute, rule or regulation.

         5.04  Definition of Title  Defect.  As used in this Article V, the term
               ---------------------------
Interests includes all items  specifically  identified on Exhibit B, and the use
of the term  Interest  refers to any  single  item  specifically  identified  on
Exhibit B. As used in this  Agreement,  the term "Title  Defect"  shall mean any
defect  which  renders  title to an  Interest,  as  herein  defined,  less  than
Marketable Title.

         5.05 Title Procedure.
              ---------------

              (a) As used herein, "Title Defect Amount" shall mean, with respect
to any reduction of the Net Revenue Interest set forth on Exhibit "B" hereto, an
amount  calculated by multiplying  the  percentage  reduction in the Net Revenue
Interest by the Allocated Value for such affected  Interests;  and, with respect
to any Title  Defect that does not cause the Net Revenue  Interest  set forth on
Exhibit "B" to decrease or cause the Working  Interest  set forth on Exhibit "B"
to increase,  an amount  determined by  evaluating  the portion of the Interests
affected by such Title  Defect,  the legal effect of the Title  Defect,  and the
potential  economic  effect of the Title  Defect  over the life of the  affected
Interests. The Title Defect Amount as to any particular Interest, however, shall
never  exceed the  Allocated  Value  therefor.  Furthermore,  in the event it is
determined that the Net Revenue  Interests for any affected  Interest is greater
than  set  forth  on  Exhibit  "B"   hereto,   the   Purchase   Price  shall  be
proportionately  adjusted upward by multiplying  the percentage  increase in the
Net  Revenue  Interest  by the  Allocated  Value  for  such  affected  Interest.
Increases or decreases in the Working Interest without a corresponding  increase
or decrease in the Net Revenue  Interest  shall be evaluated  by  rerunning  the
economics used in determining the Allocated  Value for the affected  Interest to
determine  the  impact  on the  Allocated  Value  for such  affected  Interests.
Notwithstanding any terms contained in this Agreement to the contrary,  no Title
Defect  shall be asserted by Buyer  unless the Title  Defect  Amount is at least
$15,000.00.  This  $15,000.00  threshold  shall  likewise  apply  to any  upward
adjustment sought by Seller under this Section 5.05(a).

              (b) If Buyer  discovers any Title Defect,  Buyer shall give Seller
notice of such Title  Defect no later  than ten (10) days  prior to the  Closing
Date. Such notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the
Title Defect and (ii) the Title Defect Amount therefor. Buyer shall be deemed to
have  waived all Title  Defects to which  Buyer has not given  timely  notice to
Seller thereof.

              (c) Seller  shall  notify  Buyer in writing no later than five (5)
days before the Closing Date whether it elects to cure the alleged Title Defect.
If Seller has elected to cure the Title Defect,  then the  Interests  subject to
the Title  Defect  shall not be assigned  at the  Closing  and Seller  shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such Title Defect during a period ending
sixty (60) days after  Closing.  Upon the  completion  of the cure of such Title
Defect,  the affected Interest shall be assigned to Buyer and the Purchase Price
reduction  which  occurred  with  respect to such Title  Defect shall be paid to
Seller.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Seller shall be under no obligation to
cure any Title Defect unless  Seller  otherwise  expressly  agrees in writing to
cure such Title Defect.

              (d) With  respect to any Title  Defect that  Seller  elects not to
cure or fails to cure within sixty days, Seller shall have the option to:

                  (i)  Exclude  the  Interest,  including  pipelines  and  other
personal  property  necessary to operate the particular  Interest subject to the
Title  Defect,  in which  event  the  Purchase  Price  shall be  reduced  by the
Allocated Value of the excluded Interest; or

                  (ii) If Buyer and Seller so agree,  sell the Interest  subject
to such Title  Defect to Buyer and the  Purchase  Price  shall be reduced by the
Title Defect Amount, or by such other amount as the parties shall agree.

              (e)  Notwithstanding  any terms contained in this Agreement to the
contrary,  in the event the aggregate  adjustments  to the Purchase Price exceed
twenty  percent (20%) of the Purchase  Price as a result of (i) the Title Defect
Amounts  and  (ii)  the  Environmental   Defect  Amounts,   excluding  exercised
preferential  rights to purchase,  either Seller or Buyer may elect to terminate
this Agreement.

         5.06 Consents and Preferential Rights.
              --------------------------------

              (a) If any third  party  consent to the sale and  transfer  of the
Interests  is not  obtained  prior to the  Closing,  Buyer  shall not treat that
portion of the Interests  subject to such consent  requirement as a Title Defect
if such consent is  customarily  secured  after the Closing or such consent does
not materially  affect the value of the affected  Interests if such consent were
withheld.

              (b) If any of the Interests are subject to a preferential right to
purchase,  Seller shall in a good faith,  prior to the Closing Date,  attempt to
notify each third party which holds a  preferential  right to purchase  covering
that portion of the Interests  subject  thereto.  If the notice period under any
preferential  right to purchase has not expired prior to the Closing Date, Buyer
shall nevertheless  purchase that portion of the Interests which may be affected
by the exercise of such  preferential  right but the  Interests  subject to such
unexpired  preferential  right shall not be treated as a Title Defect.  If after
the  Closing  any  party  holding a  preferential  right to  purchase  elects to
exercise same,  Buyer shall then  coordinate  with Seller in connection with the
execution by such third party of a purchase and sale agreement  substantially in
the form hereof.  Buyer shall be due any consideration  paid by such third party
upon the exercise of such  preferential  right to purchase in exchange for Buyer
delivering  such third party an  assignment  for that  portion of the  Interests
affected by the exercise of such preferential right.

         5.07 Environmental Procedure.
              -----------------------

              (a)  Prior  to  the  Closing  Date,  Buyer  may  conduct  a  field
inspection of the Interests and Buyer may further secure, at its sole risk, cost
and expense, an environmental audit of all or any of the Interests. If obtained,
Buyer shall immediately furnish a copy of such environmental audit to Seller and
the  contents of such  environmental  audit  shall  remain  confidential  unless
required to be disclosed by any rule, order or governmental proceeding.

              (b) As used herein, "Environmental Defect" shall mean any material
environmental  defect  relating to the Interests in the nature of  environmental
pollution or contamination,  including  pollution of the soil or water,  whether
surface or subsurface,  or the air, and which is a violation of environmental or
land use laws,  rules,  regulations,  or orders of appropriate  state or federal
regulatory agencies.

              (c) As used herein,  "Environmental  Defect Amount" means the cost
to  remediate  such   Environmental   Defect  in  accordance   with   applicable
environmental laws. Notwithstanding any terms contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, no adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made unless the aggregate
sum of all such  Environmental  Defect  Amounts is more than Two  Hundred  Fifty
Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($250,000.00). This $250,000.00 sum is a deductible,
and if this  sum is  exceeded,  the  Purchase  Price  shall be  adjusted  by the
difference  between  the total  sum of these  defects  and the sum of  $250,000.
Notwithstanding  any terms  contained  in this  Agreement  to the  contrary,  no
Environmental  Defect shall be asserted by Buyer unless the Environmental Defect
Amount is at least $10,000.00.

              (d) If Buyer discovers any Environmental  Defect, Buyer shall give
Seller notice of such Environmental  Defect no later than ten (10) days prior to
the  Closing  Date.  Such  notice  shall be in writing  and shall  include (i) a
description of the Environmental Defect and (ii) the Environmental Defect Amount
therefor.  Except as otherwise  specifically provided in Section 8.03(d),  Buyer
shall be deemed to have waived all Environmental  Defects to which Buyer has not
given timely notice to Seller thereof.

              (e) Seller  shall  notify  Buyer in writing no later than five (5)
days before the Closing Date whether it elects to cure the alleged Environmental
Defect.  If  Seller  has  elected  to cure the  Environmental  Defect,  then the
Interest  subject  to the  Environmental  Defect  shall not be  assigned  at the
Closing  and  Seller  shall use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to cure such
Environmental  Defect during a period ending one hundred eighty (180) days after
Closing.  Upon the  completion  of the cure of such  Environmental  Defect,  the
affected  Interest shall be assigned to Buyer and the Purchase  Price  reduction
which  occurred  with  respect  to such  Environmental  Defect  shall be paid to
Seller.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Seller shall be under no obligation to
cure any  Environmental  Defect  unless  Seller  otherwise  expressly  agrees in
writing to cure such Environmental Defect.

              (f) With respect to any  Environmental  Defect that Seller  elects
not to cure, Seller shall have the option to:

                  (i)  Exclude  the  Interest,  including  pipelines  and  other
personal  property  necessary to operate the particular  Interest subject to the
Environmental  Defect, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of the excluded Interest; or

                  (ii) If Buyer and  Seller  shall so agree,  sell the  Interest
subject to the  Environmental  Defect to Buyer and the  Purchase  Price shall be
reduced by the  Environmental  Defect Amount or such other amount as the parties
shall agree.

              (g)  Notwithstanding  any terms contained in this Agreement to the
contrary,  in the event the aggregate  adjustments  to the Purchase Price exceed
twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price as a result of (i) the  Environmental
Defect  Amounts  and  (ii)  the  Title  Defect  Amounts,   excluding   exercised
preferential  rights to purchase,  either Seller or Buyer may elect to terminate
this Agreement.

         5.08 Casualty Loss. If, prior to the Closing, all or any portion of the
              -------------
Interests  shall be  destroyed or damaged by fire or other  casualty,  or if any
portion of the Interests  shall be taken in  condemnation  or under the right of
eminent  domain,  or if  proceedings  for  such  purposes  shall be  pending  or
threatened  (collectively  "Casualty  Losses"),  except as provided below,  this
Agreement  shall  remain  in full  force  and  effect  notwithstanding  any such
destruction  or taking,  and Seller  shall have the option to either (i) exclude
the Interest  from this  transaction , including  pipelines  and other  personal
property  necessary to operate the particular  Interest  subject to the Casualty
Loss, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated  Value
of the excluded  Interest or (ii) at Closing,  convey the  affected  Interest to
Buyer and pay to Buyer all sums paid to Seller by reason of such  destruction or
taking.  If Seller  elects not to exclude such  Interest,  Seller shall  assign,
transfer and set over unto Buyer all of the right,  title and interest of Seller
in and to any unpaid awards or other payments arising out of such destruction or
taking  and the  Purchase  Price  shall be  reduced  by the  amount of  Seller's
deductible under any applicable policy of insurance or other sums not covered by
Seller's insurance or any shortfall in the unpaid awards insofar as they pertain
to payments arising out of the destruction or taking of the affected  Interests.
Seller shall not voluntarily compromise, settle or adjust any amounts payable by
reason of such destruction or taking without first obtaining the written consent
of Buyer.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  in the  event  the  total  value of
Casualty Losses exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price, either Buyer
or Seller may elect to terminate this Agreement.

         5.09 Exclusivity of Defect Process. The provisions of Sections 5.05 and
              -----------------------------
5.07 shall constitute Buyer's exclusive remedy for any Purchase Price adjustment
for Title Defects or Environmental Defects (collectively "Defects"). Buyer shall
give Seller notice of all such Defects in accordance with the terms of these two
Sections.  All  Defects of which Buyer  fails to notify  Seller  shall be deemed
waived by Buyer.  If Buyer  identifies a Defect  pursuant to these two Sections,
whether (a) Buyer elects not to assert the Defect,  (b) Buyer asserts the Defect
and receives an adjustment to the Purchase Price or Seller cures the Defect,  or
(c) Buyer  waives the Defect,  such Defect shall not be the subject of any other
claim for a Purchase Price  adjustment by Buyer against  Seller.  Further,  such
Defects shall not be asserted as the basis for any indemnity  under Article VIII
hereof; provided however, nothing in this Section 5.09 shall preclude Buyer from
seeking any indemnity to which it is entitled in accordance  with the provisions
of either Sections 8.03(b) or 8.03(d) hereof to the extent that a matter covered
by either of  Sections  8.03(b)  or  8.03(d) is  asserted  by a third  party and
provided that Buyer first  discovers  such matter  following the date the notice
for any such Defects is due.

         5.10  Hedging  Contracts.  Seller is a party to the  hedging  contracts
               ------------------
identified on Schedule  5.10.  It is the  understanding  and  assumption by both
Seller and Buyer that these  hedging  contracts  can and will be  assigned  from
Seller to Buyer at  Closing.  Inasmuch  as it is the intent of Seller that Buyer
receive the economic consequences of these hedging contracts, if for some reason
they are not  assignable,  Seller  agrees that it will  cooperate  with Buyer in
attempting to cause the economic  consequences of all of these hedging contracts
to pass  through  Seller to Buyer.  Further,  if this goal of allowing  Buyer to
receive the economic  consequences of all of these hedging  contracts  cannot be
accomplished,  then the parties agree that the Purchase Price will be reduced by
the portion of the Allocated Value for the hedging contracts attributable to the
hedging contracts for which Buyer will not receive the economic consequences.

         5.11 Plugging and Abandonment.  Upon Closing, Buyer shall assume all of
              ------------------------
Seller's plugging,  replugging,  abandonment,  removal, disposal and restoration
obligations associated with the Wells acquired hereunder. Such obligations being
assumed shall include,  but not be limited to, all necessary and proper plugging
and  abandonment  and/or  removal  and  disposal  of all of the  Wells,  whether
pre-existing  or drilled by Seller,  and all structures,  personal  property and
equipment  located on or  associated  with the Leases,  the necessary and proper
capping and burying of all associated  flowlines,  and any necessary disposal of
naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) or asbestos except those matters
which are  asserted as  Environmental  Defects  and which  remain  uncured.  All
plugging, replugging,  abandonment, removal, disposal and restoration operations
shall be in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and conducted
in a good and workmanlike manner.

         5.12  Disclaimer  of  Warranties.   THE  EXPRESS   REPRESENTATIONS  AND
               --------------------------

INTERESTS. BUYER IS RELYING SOLELY UPON ITS OWN INSPECTION OF THE INTERESTS, AND

WHERE IS".  WITHOUT  LIMITATION  OF THE  FOREGOING,  AND  SUBJECT TO THE EXPRESS

EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF
ANY  DATA,  REPORTS,  RECORDS,  PROJECTIONS,   INFORMATION,  OR  MATERIALS  NOW,

ENVIRONMENTAL  CONDITION OF THE  INTERESTS OR ANY OTHER  MATERIALS  FURNISHED OR
MADE  AVAILABLE TO BUYER BY SELLER,  OR BY SELLER'S  AGENTS OR  REPRESENTATIVES.

ORAL)  FURNISHED BY SELLER OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE OR DISCLOSED TO BUYER ARE

LIABILITY OF OR AGAINST SELLER,  AND ANY RELIANCE ON OR USE OF THE SAME SHALL BE
AT BUYER'S SOLE RISK TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

                                     -------

         7.01  Date  of  Closing.  Subject  to the  conditions  stated  in  this
               -----------------

(the  "Closing")  shall be held on January  29,  2003,  at 10:00  a.m.,  or such
earlier date as the parties shall agree in writing.  Said date shall be referred

best efforts to obtain the credit facility Buyer is currently  negotiating  with
Wachovia Securities,  Inc., Buyer is unable to fund by the Closing Date the loan
evidenced by the Note with the funds from this credit facility,  Buyer may delay

February 15, 2003, by giving written notice to Buyer prior to the Closing Date.

              ----------------
Seller, or at such other place as Buyer and Seller may agree upon in writing.

         7.03 Closing  Obligations. At the  Closing, the  following events shall
              -------------------
occur, each being a condition precedent to the  others and each being  deemed to
have occurred simultaneously with the others:

              (a) Seller shall execute,  acknowledge  and deliver (in sufficient
counterparts  to facilitate  recording) the  Assignment,  Conveyance and Bill of
Sale  ("Assignment")  conveying the Interests to Buyer in substantially the form
attached as Exhibit "C"  hereto.  As  appropriate,  Seller  shall also  execute,
acknowledge  and deliver  separate  assignments  of the  Interests on officially
approved forms, in sufficient counterparts,  to satisfy applicable statutory and
regulatory  requirements.  In addition to the  Assignment,  Seller and Buyer, as
appropriate  shall  execute  the  Nonrecourse  Secured  Promissory  Note in form
attached  hereto as Exhibit D (the  "Note"),  the Stock Pledge  Agreement in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit E, the Registration Rights Agreement in the form
attached  hereto as Exhibit  F, the Put and Call  Option  Agreement  in the form
attached  hereto as  Exhibit  G, the  Standstill  Agreement  attached  hereto as
Exhibit H and the Share  Transfer  Restriction  Agreement  in the form  attached
hereto as Exhibit I. With respect to the Note,  notwithstanding  that the stated
principal amount of the Note in Exhibit D is $72,000,000,  if the Purchase Price
as adjusted by the application of Article V is more or less than the $85,000,000
set forth in Section 2.01,  the  principal  amount of the Note set forth therein
and in the Stock  Pledge  Agreement in Exhibit E shall be adjusted to be 84.7059
percent of the adjusted  Purchase Price.  For example,  if the Purchase Price as
adjusted is $80,000,000,  the principal  amount of the Note shall be $67,764,720
and if the Purchase Price as adjusted is  $90,000,000,  the principal  amount of
the  Note  shall be  $76,235,310.  If the  Purchase  Price  as  adjusted  by the
application  of  Article  V is more or less  than the  $85,000,000  set forth in
Section 2.01, the principal amount of the Put Payment Price set forth in the Put
and Call Option  Agreement in Exhibit G shall be adjusted to equal the principal
amount  of the Note  (and  increased  as set  forth  in the Put and Call  Option
Agreement)  and the Call Payment  Price set forth  therein  shall be adjusted so
that it is 115.2941 percent of such adjusted Purchase Price.

              (b) Seller and Buyer shall  execute a  settlement  statement  (the
"Preliminary  Settlement Statement") prepared by Seller that shall set forth the
Preliminary  Amount  (as  hereinafter  defined)  and  each  adjustment  and  the
calculation  of such  adjustments  used  to  determine  such  amount.  The  term
"Preliminary  Amount"  shall mean the amount of money  determined as provided in
Section 2.02 using for such  adjustments  the best  information  then available.
After these amounts are  determined in accordance  with Section 2.02, and netted
against one another, the party owing money to the other shall at the Closing pay
the amount owed by wire transfer in readily  available  U.S. funds to an account
as directed by the party to whom the monies are due. Any  disagreement as to the
Preliminary Settlement Statement shall be resolved pursuant to the provisions of
Section 8.01.

              (c) Buyer shall deliver to Seller the number of shares of St. Mary
Stock  corresponding  to this Purchase  Price as adjusted by the  application of
Article V based  upon one  share of St.  Mary  Stock for each $25 of  adjustment
(rounded to the nearest $25 increment)  and Seller shall  redeliver the St. Mary
Stock to Buyer pursuant to the terms of the Stock Pledge Agreement.

              (d) Seller  shall  deliver to Buyer  exclusive  possession  of the
Interests.

              (e) Seller  shall  prepare  and both it and Buyer  shall  execute,
acknowledge and deliver transfer orders or letters in lieu thereof directing all
purchasers of production to make payment of proceeds  attributable to production
from the Interests after the Effective Time to Buyer.

              (f) Seller  shall  deliver to Buyer the  original  Records.  Buyer
agrees to furnish  Seller at Seller's  cost after the Closing with a copy of any
of the Records upon written request by Seller.

              (g) If Seller is the operator of any of the Interests,  Seller and
Buyer  shall  execute  the  appropriate  regulatory  forms  prepared  by  Seller
transferring  operatorship  of the Interests to Buyer and Seller shall file such
forms subject to the provisions of Article X hereinbelow.

              (h) Seller shall  transfer to Buyer all proceeds  from  production
attributable  to the  Interests  which are  currently  held in suspense  for any
reason. Buyer shall be responsible for proper distribution of all such suspended
proceeds to the parties lawfully entitled to them.

              (i) Seller shall provide all reasonable assistance to Buyer in its
efforts to become Seller's successor operator with respect to the Interests.

                                  Article VIII
                                  ------------

                            OBLIGATIONS AFTER CLOSING
                            -------------------------

         8.01  Post-Closing  Adjustments.  After the  Closing,  Seller and Buyer
               -------------------------
shall make available to each other all accounting  records  necessary for Seller
to prepare  within 120 days of Closing,  in accordance  with this  Agreement,  a
statement (the "Final  Settlement  Statement")  setting forth each adjustment or
payment  which was not  finally  determined  as of the  Closing  and showing the
calculation of such  adjustments.  As soon as  practicable  after receipt of the
Final  Settlement  Statement,  Buyer  shall  deliver to Seller a written  report
containing  any  changes  which Buyer  proposes be made to the Final  Settlement
Statement.  The parties shall undertake to agree with respect to the amounts due
pursuant to such  post-closing  adjustment no later than one hundred fifty (150)
days after the Closing.  If such post-closing  adjustment has not been agreed to
within one hundred fifty (150) days after the Closing,  either party may seek to
enforce any rights it claims  hereunder.  The date upon which such  agreement is
reached or upon which these adjustments are established, shall be referred to as
the "Final Settlement Date." The net sums due shall be referred to herein as the
"Final Settlement  Amount." In the event that (i) the Final Settlement Amount is
more than the Preliminary  Amount,  Buyer shall deliver to Seller or to Seller's
account by wire transfer the amount of such difference in readily available U.S.
funds as directed by Seller,  or (ii) the Final  Settlement  Amount is less than
the Preliminary Amount, Seller shall deliver to Buyer's account by wire transfer
the amount of such  difference in readily  available  U.S.  funds as directed by
Buyer.  The payment required hereby shall be made within five (5) days after the
Final Settlement Date. To the extent not accounted for in the computation of the
Final Settlement Amount, all uncollected accounts receivable attributable to the
Interests accruing on or after the Effective Time shall be assigned to Buyer.

         8.02 Sales Taxes  and Recording Fees. Buyer  shall pay all  sales taxes
              ------------------------------
occasioned by the sale of the Interests. Buyer shall pay all documentary, filing
and recording fees  required in connection with  the filing and recording of all
assignments.

         8.03  Indemnification.  After  the  Closing,  Buyer  and  Seller  shall
               ---------------
indemnify each other as follows:

              (a)  Including  any  "Environmental  Claim" as  defined in Section
8.03(c)  hereinbelow,  Buyer shall defend,  indemnify and save and hold harmless
Seller against any and all costs, expenses, claims, demands and causes of action
of whatsoever  kind or character,  including  court costs and  attorneys'  fees,
arising out of any operations conducted,  commitment made or any action taken or
omitted  with respect to the  Interests,  which accrue or relate to times on and
after the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Article X.

              (b)  Excluding  any  "Environmental  Claim" as  defined in Section
8.03(c) hereinbelow,  Seller shall defend,  indemnify and save and hold harmless
Buyer against any and all costs, expenses,  claims, demands and causes of action
of whatsoever  kind or character,  including  court costs and  attorneys'  fees,
arising out of any operations conducted,  commitment made or any action taken or
omitted with respect to the Interests,  which accrue or relate to times prior to
the  Effective  Time and of which  Seller has been timely  notified  pursuant to
Section 8.06.

              (c)  Notwithstanding  any terms contained in Sections  8.03(a) and
(b) above,  but in furtherance of same, and subject to the provisions of Article
X, Buyer expressly agrees to assume all liabilities and obligations  arising out
of or related to, and to fully and promptly pay, perform and discharge,  defend,
indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against any and all costs, expenses,
claims, demands and causes of action of whatsoever kind or character,  including
court costs and attorneys'  fees,  resulting from any  "Environmental  Claim" as
hereinafter defined arising out of any operations conducted,  commitment made or
any action taken or omitted at any time,  whether  accruing or relating to times
prior to or after  the  Effective  Time,  with  respect  to the  Interests.  For
purposes of this paragraph "Environmental Claim" shall mean any claim, demand or
cause of action asserted by any governmental  agency or any person,  corporation
or other  entity for personal  injury  (including  sickness,  disease or death),
property  damage or damage to the  environment  resulting  from the discharge or
release  of  any  chemical,  material  or  emission  into  one  or  more  of the
environmental media at or in the vicinity of the Interests.

              (d)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 8.03(c),  if after
the Closing, but in no event later than one (1) year after the Closing Date, any
third party other than Buyer asserts an Environmental Claim arising from an act,
omission or other  event  which  occurred  prior to the  Effective  Time and the
out-of-pocket cost of resolving such Environmental Claim,  including the cost to
remediate in accordance with applicable  environmental laws, or damages incurred
with respect thereto,  exceeds $35,000.00 net to Seller's interest (individually
a  "Retained   Environmental   Liability"   and   collectively   the   "Retained
Environmental  Liabilities"),  Buyer may notify Seller in writing to assume such
Environmental  Claim  relating to such  Retained  Environmental  Liabilities  in
accordance  with the terms of this Section  8.03(d).  Such written  notice shall
describe the details known to Buyer of the Environmental  Claim relating to such
Retained Environmental  Liability and Buyer shall concurrently furnish to Seller
all  information  available to Buyer relating to such  Environmental  Claim.  If
Buyer timely notifies Seller of such Environmental  Claim relating to a Retained
Environmental Liability on or before one (1) year after the Closing Date, Seller
shall retain the risk,  cost,  expense and  liability  related to such  Retained
Environmental  Liability.  If Buyer  fails to notify  Seller in  writing  of any
Environmental  Claim within the 1 year period  following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall have waived and forfeited  Buyer's  right to require  Seller to retain the
risk, cost,  expense and/ or liability  relating to such Retained  Environmental
Liability.  It is agreed that Seller and Buyer will cooperate with each other in
connection  with the disposition of the Retained  Environmental  Liability which
may require either (i) remediation, (ii) reacquisition of the affected Interests
by Seller  (taking into  consideration  the  Allocated  Value  therefor less net
profits owed or received by Buyer and the value added by subsequent  development
or  operations),  or (iii) such  other  disposition  as Seller  and Buyer  shall
mutually agree.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if the parties cannot agree on
the  disposition  of or the cost to remediate  or  otherwise  resolve a Retained
Environmental  Liability,  the affected  Interest shall be reacquired by Seller.
Notwithstanding  the  provisions of this Section  8.03(d),  Seller shall have no
obligation  under  this  section  unless  the  aggregate  value of all  Retained
Environmental Liabilities exceeds $500,000.00,  which amount is a threshold, not
a  deductible,  and if such  threshold is  exceeded,  the  indemnity  obligation
provided in this Section 8.03(d) shall be from the first dollar.

              (e)  THE  INDEMNIFICATION,   RELEASE  AND  ASSUMPTION   PROVISIONS
PROVIDED FOR IN THIS  AGREEMENT  SHALL BE APPLICABLE  WHETHER OR NOT THE LOSSES,
COSTS,  EXPENSES AND DAMAGES IN QUESTION AROSE SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE GROSS,
ACTIVE,  PASSIVE OR  CONCURRENT  NEGLIGENCE,  OR OTHER FAULT OF ANY  INDEMNIFIED
PARTY.  BUYER AND  SELLER  ACKNOWLEDGE  THAT THIS  STATEMENT  COMPLIES  WITH THE
EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS CONSPICUOUS.

         8.04 Further  Assurances.  Seller and Buyer shall execute,  acknowledge
              -------------------
and deliver or cause to be executed, acknowledged and delivered such instruments
and take such other  action as may be  necessary or advisable to carry out their
obligations under this Agreement and under any exhibit, document, certificate or
other instrument delivered pursuant hereto.

         8.05 Survival. The representations,  warranties,  covenants, agreements
              --------
and  indemnities  contained  in this  Agreement  shall  terminate at the Closing
except for the provisions of Section  3.01(t),  Section  3.02(g),  Section 5.09,
Section 5.10 and all of Articles VIII., X. and XI.

         8.06 Limitation on Seller's Liability. After the Closing, any assertion
              --------------------------------
by Buyer that Seller is liable under this  Agreement  (i) for the  inaccuracy of
any  surviving  representation  or  warranty,  (ii) for breach of any  surviving
covenant,  (iii) for any surviving  indemnity  under the terms of this Agreement
other than under  Section  8.03(d),  or (iv)  otherwise in  connection  with the
transactions  contemplated in this  Agreement,  must be made by Buyer in writing
and must be given to Seller on or prior to the first  business day following the
first anniversary of the Closing Date. The notice shall state the facts known to
Buyer  that give rise to such  notice in  sufficient  detail to allow  Seller to
evaluate the assertion of Buyer.

         8.07 Transaction Not to Constitute a  Reorganization  for Tax Purposes.
              -----------------------------------------------------------------
Buyer  and  Seller  do not  intend  that the  transaction  contemplated  by this
Agreement qualify as a tax-free reorganization.  Consequently,  Buyer and Seller
agree to report this transaction on all applicable  federal and state income tax
returns  as a  taxable  purchase  and  sale of  assets.  Seller  represents  and
warrants,  and covenants  that neither party  constituting  Seller intend to and
neither  will  distribute  the St.  Mary Stock  they  receive  pursuant  to this
transaction  for at least one calendar  year after  Closing,  and these  parties
further represent that they have no present plan to make such distribution.  The
parties  constituting  Seller  recognize  that the shares of St. Mary Stock they
will receive in the course of this  transaction will be restricted in the manner
set forth in the Share Transfer Restriction Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit
I, and Seller agrees to be bound by these restrictions.

                                   Article IX
                                   ----------

                            TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
                            ------------------------

         9.01 Termination.  This Agreement  and  the  transactions  contemplated
              -----------
hereby may be terminated in the following instances:

              (a) By Buyer if any  condition  set forth in  Section  6.02  above
shall not be satisfied on or before the Closing,  or Buyer  otherwise  elects to
terminate this Agreement  pursuant to Sections 5.05(e),  5.07(g) or 5.08 of this
Agreement.

              (b) By Seller if any  condition  set forth in  Section  6.01 above
shall not be  satisfied on or before the Closing or Seller  otherwise  elects to
terminate this Agreement  pursuant to Sections 5.05(e),  5.07(g) or 5.08 of this
Agreement.

              (c) By the mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller.

         9.02 Return  of  Information. If  this Agreement  is terminated,  Buyer
              ---------------------
shall return to Seller all information and material delivered to Buyer by Seller
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement  or pursuant to other agreements between
Buyer and Seller.

         9.03 Liquidated  Damages.  Subject to the delay of Closing provision of
              -------------------
Section  7.01,  if Seller is ready,  willing  and able to close the  transaction
contemplated  by this  Agreement in  compliance  herewith and is not in material
breach of this Agreement and Buyer is not otherwise entitled to avoid Closing by
operation of Sections  5.05(e),  5.07(g),  5.08 or 6.02, but Buyer  nevertheless
elects  for  any  reason  not to  close  the  transaction  contemplated  by this
Agreement,  then Seller shall be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of
$5,000,000 which shall be immediately due and payable in readily available funds
from Buyer.  Subject to the delay of Closing provision of Section 7.01, if Buyer
is  ready,  willing  and  able to close  the  transaction  contemplated  by this
Agreement in compliance herewith and is not in material breach of this Agreement
and Seller is not  otherwise  entitled to avoid Closing by operation of Sections
5.05(e),  5.07(g),  5.08 or 6.01, but Seller  nevertheless elects for any reason
not to close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then Buyer shall be
entitled  to  liquidated  damages in the  amount of  $5,000,000  which  shall be
immediately due and payable in readily  available  funds from Seller.  Buyer and
Seller  acknowledge that each of them will have incurred  significant  costs and
will have invested significant time and resources  investigating and negotiating
this  Agreement  and each agrees that the specific  damages  provided for herein
constitute  reasonable  liquidated damages in light of the anticipated or actual
harm to Buyer or Seller that would be caused by a failure of this transaction to
close for the  reasons  provided  for in this  Section  9.03.  Buyer and  Seller
further agree that actual damages would be extremely difficult if not impossible
to ascertain with precision,  and therefore,  both of these parties agree to the
use of this liquidated  damage  provision  which shall  constitute the exclusive
remedy for a failure of this  transaction to close for the reasons  provided for
in this Section 9.03.

                                   Article X
                                   ---------

                               ------------------

         If Seller is the operator of the Interests, Seller shall continue to
operate the Interests during the period between the Effective Time and 7:00 a.m.
on the first day of the month following the Closing Date (the "Interim Period"),
but Seller shall not have any obligation to operate the Interests after the
Interim Period. Seller shall operate the Interests during the Interim Period in
a prudent manner consistent with generally accepted industry practices and
standards, applicable laws and regulations, and all applicable lease and other
agreement terms, but shall not be liable to Buyer except for gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Seller shall be entitled (i) to charge Buyer the COPAS
overhead rates under existing operating agreements, or where none exist, a rate
of $500.00 per well per month during the Interim Period proportionately reduced
to the affected Interests and (ii) to retain any overhead fees owing or paid by
any third party non-operators attributable to the operations during the Interim
Period. Seller makes no representation or warranty that Buyer will become
operator of any portion of the Interests, as that matter is controlled by the
applicable operating agreements and governmental regulatory requirements.
