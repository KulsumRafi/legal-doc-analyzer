Purchaser is purchasing the Preferred Stock for Purchaser's own account and for investment and not with a view to
distribution of the Preferred Stock, that the Purchaser has made no agreement with others regarding any of the
shares of Preferred Stock and that the Purchaser's financial condition is such that it is not likely that it will be
necessary to dispose of any of the Shares of Preferred Stock in the foreseeable future (Purchaser is aware that, in
the view of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a purchase of the shares of Preferred Stock with an intent to
distribute by reason of any foreseeable specific contingency or anticipated change in market values, or any change
in the condition of the Company, or in connection with a contemplated liquidation or settlement of any loan obtained
for the acquisition of the shares of Preferred Stock and for which the shares of Preferred Stock were pledged, would

of investment for an indefinite period of time because the shares of the Preferred Stock will be "restricted
securities" and are therefore subject to restrictions on resale; (iii) Purchaser may not be able to liquidate his
investment in the event of an emergency or pledge any of the shares of the Preferred Stock as collateral for loans;
and (iv) transferability of the Preferred Stock is restricted and legends will be placed on the certificates
representing the Preferred Stock referring to the applicable restrictions on transferability;</FONT></TD></TR>
