                          REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

         REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of
February 18, 2003, by and between Environmental Tectonics Corporation, a
corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the
"Company"), and H. F. Lenfest ("Lenfest").

         WHEREAS:

         A. In connection with the Convertible Note and Warrant Purchase
Agreement of even date herewith by and between the Company and Lenfest (the
"Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement"), the Company has agreed, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions contained therein, to issue and sell to Lenfest
(i) subordinated convertible notes (the "Notes") which are convertible into
shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.05 per share (the "Common
Stock") and (ii) warrants (the "Warrants") to acquire shares of Common Stock.

         B. To induce Lenfest to execute and deliver the Note and Warrant
Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to provide certain registration
rights under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder, or any similar successor statute (collectively, the
"Securities Act"), and applicable state securities laws.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and
Lenfest hereby agree as follows:

         1. DEFINITIONS.

            (a) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

                (i) "Investors" means Lenfest and any transferees or assignees
who agree to become bound by the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 9 hereof.

                (ii) "register," "registered," and "registration" refer to a
registration effected by preparing and filing a Registration Statement or
Registration Statements in compliance with the Securities Act and pursuant to
Rule 415 under the Securities Act or any successor rule providing for offering
securities on a continuous basis ("Rule 415"), and the declaration or ordering
of effectiveness of such Registration Statement by the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").


<PAGE>

                (iii) "Registrable Securities" means (A) the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Notes, and (B) the Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Warrants.

                (iv) "Registration Statement" means a registration statement of
the Company under the Securities Act.

            (b) Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Note and Warrant Purchase
Agreement.

         2. REGISTRATION.

            (a) Demand Registration. Upon receipt of a written request (a
"Demand Request") from Investors holding a majority of the Registrable
Securities, which Demand Request shall set forth the number of Registrable
Securities the Investors are seeking to have registered, the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC as soon as practicable, but in no event later than
sixty (60) days from the date of its receipt of a Demand Request, a Registration
Statement on Form S-3 (or, if Form S-3 is not then available, on such form of
Registration Statement as is then available to effect a registration of all of
the Registrable Securities) covering the resale of the Registrable Securities
which are the subject of the Demand Request. The Registration Statement filed
hereunder, to the extent allowable under the Securities Act and the rules
promulgated thereunder (including Rule 416), shall state that such Registration
Statement also covers such indeterminate number of additional shares of Common
Stock as may become issuable to prevent dilution resulting from stock splits,
stock dividends or similar transactions. The Investors shall not be entitled to
make more than four (4) Demand Requests pursuant to this Agreement. A
registration request pursuant to this Section 2(a) shall not be deemed to have
been effected and shall not be considered a demand registration which may be
requested pursuant to this Section 2(a) unless a registration statement with
respect thereto has been declared effective by the SEC.

            (b) Piggy-Back Registrations. If at any time prior to the expiration
of the Registration Period (as hereinafter defined), the Company shall file with
the SEC a Registration Statement relating to an offering for its own account or
the account of others under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities
(other than the amendment of a registration statement now on file, registration
statements on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or their then equivalents relating to equity
securities to be issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity
or business or equity securities issuable in connection with stock option or
other employee benefit plans), the Company shall send to each Investor written
notice of such filing and, if within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of such
notice, an Investor shall so request in writing, the Company shall include in
such Registration Statement all or any part of the Registrable Securities such
Investor requests to be registered, except that if, in connection with any
underwritten public offering, the managing underwriter(s) thereof shall impose a
limitation on the number of shares of Common Stock which may be included in the
Registration Statement because, in such underwriter(s)' judgment, marketing or
other factors dictate such limitation is necessary to facilitate public

                                       2
<PAGE>

distribution, then the Company shall be obligated to include in such
Registration Statement only such limited portion of the Registrable Securities
with respect to which such Investor has requested inclusion hereunder as the
underwriter shall permit. Any exclusion of Registrable Securities shall be made
pro rata among the Investors seeking to include Registrable Securities, in
proportion to the number of Registrable Securities sought to be included by such
Investors; provided, however, that the Company shall not exclude any Registrable
Securities unless the Company has first excluded all outstanding securities, the
holders of which are not contractually entitled to inclusion of such securities
in such Registration Statement or are not contractually entitled to pro rata
inclusion with the Registrable Securities; and provided, further, however, that,
after giving effect to the immediately preceding proviso, any exclusion of
Registrable Securities shall be made pro rata with holders of other securities
having the contractual right to include such securities in the Registration
Statement other than holders of securities contractually entitled to inclusion
of their securities in such Registration Statement by reason of demand
registration rights. If an offering in connection with which an Investor is
entitled to registration under this Section 2(b) is an underwritten offering,
then each Investor whose Registrable Securities are included in such
Registration Statement shall offer and sell such Registrable Securities in an
underwritten offering using the same underwriter or underwriters and, subject to
the provisions of this Agreement, on the same terms and conditions as other
shares of Common Stock included in such underwritten offering.

            (c) Registrations on Form S-3. Upon receipt of a written request (an
"S-3 Request") from Investors holding a majority of the Registrable Securities,
which S-3 Request shall set forth the number of Registrable Securities the
Investors are seeking to have registered, the Company shall prepare and file
with the SEC as soon as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days
from the date of its receipt of an S-3 Request, a Registration Statement on Form
S-3 covering the resale of the Registrable Securities which are the subject of
the S-3 Request. The Registration Statement filed hereunder, to the extent
allowable under the Securities Act and the rules promulgated thereunder
(including Rule 416), shall state that such Registration Statement also covers
such indeterminate number of additional shares of Common Stock as may become
issuable to prevent dilution resulting from stock splits, stock dividends or
similar transactions. The Investors shall not be entitled to make more than two
(2) S-3 Requests during any twelve (12) month period.

            (d) Eligibility for Form S-3. The Company represents and warrants
that it meets the requirements for the use of Form S-3 for registration of the
sale by the Investors of the Registrable Securities and the Company shall use
its best efforts to file all reports required to be filed by the Company with
the SEC in a timely manner so as to thereafter maintain such eligibility for the
use of Form S-3.

         3. OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY.

            In connection with the registration of the Registrable Securities,
the Company shall have the following obligations:

            (a) Upon receipt of a Demand Request, the Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC the Registration Statement in accordance with Section 2(a),
and cause such Registration Statement relating to Registrable Securities to
become effective as soon as practicable after such filing, and keep such
Registration Statement effective pursuant to Rule 415 at all times until such
date as is the earlier of (i) the date on which all of the Registrable
Securities have been sold and (ii) the date on which all of the Registrable
Securities (in the opinion of counsel to the Investors, which shall be sought
upon the request of the Company) may be immediately sold to the public without
registration or restriction pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act or
any successor provision (the "Registration Period"), which Registration
Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto and prospectuses
contained therein and all documents incorporated by reference therein) shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and (iii) shall comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder. The financial statements of the Company included in the
Registration Statement or incorporated by reference therein will comply in all
material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC applicable with respect thereto. Such financial
statements will be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied, during the periods involved (except
in the case of unaudited interim statements, to the extent they may not include
footnotes or may be condensed on summary statements) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to immaterial year-end adjustments).

            (b) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments
(including post-effective amendments) and supplements to the Registration
Statement and the prospectus used in connection with the Registration Statement
as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective at all times
during the Registration Period, and, during such period, comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
Registrable Securities of the Company covered by the Registration Statement
until the earlier of (i) such time as all of such Registrable Securities have
been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the
seller or sellers thereof as set forth in the Registration Statement or (ii) the
expiration of the Registration Period.

            (c) The Company shall furnish to each Investor whose Registrable
Securities are included in the Registration Statement and its legal counsel (i)
promptly after the same is prepared and publicly distributed, filed with the
SEC, or received by the Company, one copy of the Registration Statement and any
amendment thereto, each preliminary prospectus and prospectus and each amendment
or supplement thereto, and, in the case of the Registration Statement referred
to in Section 2(a), each letter written by or on behalf of the Company to the
SEC or the staff of the SEC (including, without limitation, any request to
accelerate the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or amendment
thereto), and each item of correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC,
in each case relating to the Registration Statement (other than any portion, if
any, thereof which contains information for which the Company has sought
confidential treatment), (ii) on the date of effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or any amendment thereto, a notice stating that the Registration
Statement or amendment has been declared effective, and (iii) such number of
copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, and all amendments
and supplements thereto and such other documents as such Investor may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities
owned by such Investor.

                                       4
<PAGE>

            (d) The Company shall (i) register and qualify the Registrable
Securities covered by the Registration Statement under such other securities or
"blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as each Investor who
holds Registrable Securities being offered reasonably requests, (ii) prepare and
file in those jurisdictions such amendments (including post-effective
amendments) and supplements to such registrations and qualifications as may be
necessary to maintain the effectiveness thereof during the Registration Period,
(iii) take such other actions as may be necessary to maintain such registrations
and qualifications in effect at all times during the Registration Period, and
(iv) take all other actions reasonably necessary or advisable to qualify the
Registrable Securities for sale in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that
the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition
thereto to (A) qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 3(d), (B) subject itself
to general taxation in any such jurisdiction, (C) file a general consent to
service of process in any such jurisdiction, (D) provide any undertakings that
cause the Company undue expense or burden, or (E) make any change in its charter
or bylaws, which in each case the Board of Directors of the Company determines
to be contrary to the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.

            (e) As promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event,
the Company shall notify each Investor by telephone and facsimile of the
happening of any event, of which the Company has knowledge, as a result of which
the prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as then in effect,
includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, and, promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to the
Registration Statement to correct such untrue statement or omission, and deliver
such number of copies of such supplement or amendment to each Investor as such
Investor may reasonably request.

            (f) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts (i) to prevent the
issuance of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of a
Registration Statement, and, if such an order is issued, to obtain the
withdrawal of such order at the earliest practicable moment (including in each
case by amending or supplementing such Registration Statement) and (ii) to
notify each Investor who holds Registrable Securities being sold (or, in the
event of an underwritten offering, the managing underwriters) of the issuance of
such order and the resolution thereof (and if such Registration Statement is
supplemented or amended, deliver such number of copies of such supplement or
amendment to each Investor as such Investor may reasonably request).

                                       5
<PAGE>

            (g) The Company shall permit a single firm of counsel designated by
the Investors to review the Registration Statement and all amendments and
supplements thereto a reasonable period of time prior to its filing with the
SEC, and not file any document in a form to which such counsel reasonably
objects.

            (h) At the request of an Investor in the case of an underwritten
public offering, the Company shall furnish, on the date of effectiveness of the
Registration Statement (i) an opinion, dated as of such date, from counsel
representing the Company addressed to each Investor and in form, scope and
substance as is customarily given in an underwritten public offering and (ii) a
letter, dated such date, from the Company's independent certified public
accountants in form and substance as is customarily given by independent
certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering,
addressed to the underwriters, if any, and each Investor.

            (i) The Company shall hold in confidence and not make any disclosure
of information concerning an Investor provided to the Company unless (i)
disclosure of such information is necessary to comply with federal or state
securities laws, (ii) the disclosure of such information is necessary to avoid
or correct a misstatement or omission in any Registration Statement, (iii) the
release of such information is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order
from a court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction, (iv) such
information has been made generally available to the public other than by the
Company or disclosure in violation of this or any other agreement, or (v) such
Investor consents to the form and content of any such disclosure. The Company
agrees that it shall, upon learning that disclosure of such information
concerning an Investor is sought in or by a court or governmental body of
competent jurisdiction or through other means, give prompt notice to such
Investor prior to making such disclosure, and allow the Investor, at its
expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of, or to obtain
a protective order for, such information.

            (j) The Company shall promptly cause all of the Registrable
Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be listed, at its option, on
the Nasdaq National Market ("NNM"), the Nasdaq SmallCap Market ("SmallCap"), the
New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") or the American Stock Exchange ("AMEX") or
another national securities exchange and on each additional national securities
exchange on which securities of the same class or series issued by the Company
are then listed, if any, if the listing of such Registrable Securities is then
permitted under the rules of such exchange.

                                       6
<PAGE>

            (k) The Company shall provide a transfer agent and registrar, which
may be a single entity, for the Registrable Securities.

            (l) The Company shall cooperate with the Investors who hold
Registrable Securities being offered and the managing underwriter or
underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of
certificates (not bearing any restrictive legends) representing Registrable
Securities to be offered pursuant to the Registration Statement and enable such
certificates to be in such denominations or amounts, as the case may be, as the
managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or the Investors may reasonably
request and registered in such names as the managing underwriter or
underwriters, if any, or the Investors may request, and, within five (5)
business days after the Registration Statement which includes Registrable
Securities is ordered effective by the SEC, the Company shall deliver, and shall
cause legal counsel selected by the Company to deliver, to the transfer agent
for the Registrable Securities (with copies to the Investors whose Registrable
Securities are included in such Registration Statement), an opinion of such
counsel in the form reasonably satisfactory to the transfer agent.

         4. OBLIGATIONS OF THE INVESTORS.

            In connection with the registration of the Registrable Securities,
each Investor shall have the following obligations:

            (a) It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the
Company to complete the registration pursuant to this Agreement with respect to
the Registrable Securities of a particular Investor that such Investor shall
furnish to the Company such information regarding himself, the Registrable
Securities held by him or it and the intended method of disposition of the
Registrable Securities held by him or it as shall be reasonably required to
effect the registration of such Registrable Securities and shall execute such
documents in connection with such registration as the Company may reasonably
request. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the first anticipated filing date
of the Registration Statement, the Company shall notify each Investor of the
information the Company requires from each such Investor.

            (b) Each Investor, by such Investor's acceptance of the Registrable
Securities, agrees to cooperate with the Company as reasonably requested by the
Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the Registration
Statement hereunder. The Company shall not be required to include in any
Registration Statement the Registrable Securities of any Investor who fails to
cooperate with the Company as reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation and filing of the Registration Statement.

            (c) Each Investor agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Sections 3(e) or
3(f), such Investor will immediately discontinue disposition of Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such Registrable
Securities until such Investor's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or
amended prospectus contemplated by Sections 3(e) or 3(f) and, if so directed by
the Company, such Investor shall deliver to the Company (at the expense of the
Company) or destroy (and deliver to the Company a certificate of destruction at
the Company's request) all copies in such Investor's possession, of the
prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt
of such notice.

            (d) No Investor may participate in any underwritten distribution
hereunder unless such Investor (i) agrees to sell such Investor's Registrable
Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements in usual and
customary form entered into by the Company, (ii) completes and executes all
customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements and other documents reasonably required under underwritten offerings
for selling shareholders, (iii) agrees to pay its pro rata share of all
underwriting discounts and commissions and any expenses in excess of those
payable by the Company pursuant to Section 5 below, and (iv) complies with all
applicable laws in connection therewith.

                                       7
<PAGE>

            (e) In the event that in the judgment of the Company, it is
advisable to suspend the use of a Prospectus included in the Registration
Statement due to pending material developments or other events which have not
yet been publicly disclosed and as to which the Company believes public
disclosure would be detrimental to the Company, the Company shall notify each
Investor to such effect, and, upon receipt of such notice, each Investor shall
immediately discontinue any sales of Registerable Securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement until such Investor receives copies of a supplemental or
amended Prospectus or until such Investor is advised in writing by the Company
that the then current Prospectus may be used and have received copies of any
additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated
by reference in such Prospectus (a "Disclosure Delay Period"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, there shall not be more than an aggregate of ninety (90) days in
any twelve (12) month period during which the Company is in a Disclosure Delay
Period.

         5. EXPENSES OF REGISTRATION. All reasonable expenses incurred by the
Company or the Investors in connection with registrations, filings or
qualifications pursuant to Sections 2 and 3 above, including, without
limitation, all registration, listing and qualifications fees, printers and
accounting fees, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company shall
be borne by the Company.

         6. INDEMNIFICATION. In the event any Registrable Securities are
included in a Registration Statement under this Agreement:

            (a) To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify, hold
harmless and defend (i) each Investor who holds such Registrable Securities, and
(ii) the directors, officers, partners, members, employees and agents of such
Investor and each person who controls any Investor within the meaning of Section
15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, if any, (each, an
"Indemnified Person"), against any joint or several losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses (collectively, together with actions, proceedings or
inquiries by any regulatory or self-regulatory organization, whether commenced
or threatened, in respect thereof, "Claims") to which any of them may become
subject insofar as such Claims arise out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in a Registration
Statement or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any preliminary prospectus if used prior to the effective date
of such Registration Statement, or contained in the final prospectus (as amended
or supplemented, if the Company files any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto with the SEC) or the omission or alleged omission to state therein any
material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which the statements therein were made, not misleading, or
(iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act, any other law, including, without limitation, any state
securities law, or any rule or regulation thereunder relating to the offer or
sale of the Registrable Securities (the matters in the foregoing clauses (i)
through (iii) being, collectively, "Violations"). The Company shall reimburse
the Investors and each other Indemnified Person, promptly as such expenses are
incurred and are due and payable, for any reasonable legal fees or other
reasonable expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any such Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this Section 6(a) shall not
apply to a Claim arising out of or based upon a Violation which occurs in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the
Company by such Indemnified Person for use in the Registration Statement or any
such amendment thereof or supplement thereto. Such indemnity shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the Indemnified Person and shall survive the transfer of the Registrable
Securities by the Investors pursuant to Section 9 hereof.

                                       8
<PAGE>

            (b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which an
Investor is participating, each such Investor agrees severally and not jointly
to indemnify, hold harmless and defend, to the same extent and in the same
manner set forth in Section 6(a), the Company, each of its directors, each of
its officers who signs the Registration Statement, its employees, agents and
each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15
of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and any other
stockholder selling securities pursuant to the Registration Statement or any of
its directors or officers or any person who controls such stockholder within the
meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (collectively and together
with an Indemnified Person, an "Indemnified Party"), against any Claim to which
any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or
otherwise, insofar as such Claim arises out of or is based upon any Violation,
in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by such Investor expressly for use in connection with such Registration
Statement; and, subject to Section 6(c), such Investor will reimburse any legal
or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating
or defending any such Claim; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement
contained in this Section 6(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of
any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of
such Investor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided,
further, however, that the Investor shall be liable in the aggregate to all
Indemnified Parties under this Agreement (including this Section 6(b) and
Section 7) for only that amount as does not exceed the net proceeds actually
received by such Investor as a result of the sale of Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this
Section 6(b) with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the
benefit of any Indemnified Party if the untrue statement or omission of material
fact contained in the preliminary prospectus was corrected on a timely basis in
the prospectus, as then amended or supplemented.

                                       9
<PAGE>

            (c) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person or Indemnified
Party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action
(including any governmental action), such Indemnified Person or Indemnified
Party shall, if a Claim in respect thereof is to made against any indemnifying
party under this Section 6, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice
of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to
participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume control of the
defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying party and
the Indemnified Person or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be; provided,
however, that such indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume such
defense and an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party shall have the right to
retain its own counsel with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying
party, if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel retained by the indemnifying
party, the representation by such counsel of the Indemnified Person or
Indemnified Party and the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to
actual or potential conflicts of interest between such Indemnified Person or
Indemnified Party and any other party represented by such counsel in such
proceeding or the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such
action include both the Indemnified Person or the Indemnified Party and the
indemnifying party and any such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party
reasonably determines that there may be legal defenses available to such
Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party which are in conflict with those
available to such indemnifying party. The indemnifying party shall pay for only
one separate legal counsel for the Indemnified Person or the Indemnified
Parties, as applicable, and such legal counsel shall be selected by Investors
holding a majority-in-interest of the Registrable Securities included in the
Registration Statement to which the Claim relates (with the approval of the
Initial Investor if it holds Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement), if the Investors are entitled to indemnification
hereunder, or by the Company, if the Company is entitled to indemnification
hereunder, as applicable. The failure to deliver written notice to the
indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such
action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the
Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party under this Section 6, except to the
extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced in its ability to
defend such action. The indemnification required by this Section 6 shall be made
by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the
investigation or defense, as such expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred
and is due and payable.

                                       10

         7. CONTRIBUTION. To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying
party is prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the
maximum contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be
liable under Section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law as is appropriate
to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and
the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party, as the case may be, on the other
hand, with respect to the Violation giving rise to the applicable Claim;
provided, however, that (i) no contribution shall be made under circumstances
where the party would not have been liable for indemnification under the fault
standards set forth in Section 6, (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any seller of Registrable Securities who
was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation, and (iii) contribution
(together with any indemnification or other obligations under this Agreement) by
any seller of Registrable Securities shall be limited in the aggregate amount to
the net amount of proceeds actually received by such seller from the sale of
such Registrable Securities.

         8. REPORTS UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT. With a view to making available to
each Investor the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act or
any other similar rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit each
Investor to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration
("Rule 144"), the Company agrees to:

            (a) to use its best efforts to file with the SEC in a timely manner
and make and keep available all reports and other documents required of the
Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act so long as the Company
remains subject to such requirements and the filing and availability of such
reports and other documents is required for the applicable provisions of Rule
144; and

            (b) furnish to each Investor so long as such Investor owns
Registrable Securities, promptly upon request, (i) a written statement by the
Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or
quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by
the Company, and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested to
permit each Investor to sell such securities under Rule 144 without
registration.

         9. ASSIGNMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS. The rights of the Investors
hereunder, including the right to have the Company register Registrable
Securities pursuant to this Agreement, shall be automatically assignable by each
Investor to any transferee of Registrable Securities or any assignee of the Note
and Warrant Purchase Agreement if: (i) the Investor agrees in writing with the
transferee or assignee to assign such rights, and a copy of such agreement is
furnished to the Company after such assignment, (ii) the Company is furnished
with written notice of (A) the name and address of such transferee or assignee,
and (B) the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being
transferred or assigned, and (iii) the transferee or assignee agrees in writing
for the benefit of the Company to be bound by all of the provisions contained
herein.

        10. AMENDMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS. Provisions of this Agreement may
be amended and the observance thereof may be waived only with written consent of
the Company and Investors who hold a majority in interest of the Registrable
Securities or, in the case of a waiver, with the written consent of the party
charged with the enforcement of any such provision.
