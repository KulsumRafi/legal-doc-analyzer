                  2.3      Payment of Purchase Price. Subject to Section 2.6, on
the Closing Date, Serologicals shall:

                           (a)      deposit in escrow with the Escrow Agent
         $19,000,000 (the "Escrow Amount"), which amount shall be held and
         disbursed in accordance with the terms of an Escrow Agreement,
         substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Escrow
         Agreement"); and

                           (b)      remit to the holders of the Chemicon Debt,
         for the account of the appropriate Chemicon Entity, an amount
         sufficient to repay in full the Chemicon Debt; and

                           (c)      remit to Novus Molecular, Inc., a California

                           (d)      pay or cause to be paid to the Shareholder
         (or to such other persons identified by Shareholder in writing to
         Serologicals not less than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date)
         an amount equal to the Purchase Price minus the sum of (i) the Escrow
         Amount, (ii) the Chemicon Debt, (iii) the amount paid to Novus pursuant
         to Section 2.3(c), and (iv) the Miller and Casey Payment.

                  2.4      Closing Statement.

                           (a)      No later than sixty (60) days after the
         Closing Date, Serologicals will prepare and deliver to the Shareholder
         a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth Serologicals'
         calculation of Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Working
         Capital"). The Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with
         the accounting principles set forth on Schedule 2.4(a) and otherwise in
         accordance with GAAP, shall set forth by line item the components of
         Working Capital with such line items corresponding to the line items in
         the Audited Balance Sheets and shall be accompanied by such detail and
         supporting schedules as may be necessary, or may be reasonably
         requested by the Shareholder, to verify Serologicals' calculation of
         Working Capital.

                           (b)      If the Shareholder disagrees with
         Serologicals' calculation of Working Capital delivered pursuant to
         Section 2.4(a), the Shareholder may, within sixty (60) days after
         delivery of the documents referred to in Section 2.4(a), deliver a
         notice (an "Objection Notice") to Serologicals disagreeing with such
         calculation and setting forth the Shareholder's calculation of Working
         Capital. Any such Objection Notice shall specify those line items in
         the Closing Statement and the items, amounts, calculations, or
         valuations used to determine such line items, as to which the
         Shareholder disagrees. The Shareholder shall be deemed to have agreed
         with all line items or amounts contained in the Closing Statement and
         all calculations or valuations used in determining any line item of the
         Estimated Closing Working Capital set forth in the Closing Statement
         delivered pursuant to Section 2.4(a), unless, and only to the extent
         that, such items, amounts, calculations, valuations are specifically
         objected to in the Objection Notice.

<PAGE>

                           (c)      If an Objection Notice is duly delivered
         pursuant to Section 2.4(b), Serologicals and the Shareholder shall,
         during the fifteen (15) days following such delivery, use their best
         efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts.

                           (d)      If during such period set forth in Section
         2.4(c), Serologicals and the Shareholder are unable to reach a final
         resolution, Serologicals and the Shareholder will jointly retain the
         Accounting Referee to resolve any remaining disagreements. If the
         Accounting Referee is unable or unwilling to accept such engagement,
         Serologicals and the Shareholder shall appoint another nationally
         recognized accounting firm to serve as the Accounting Referee. If
         Serologicals and the Shareholder are unable to agree on the choice of
         the Accounting Referee, then the Accounting Referee will be chosen by
         lot from among KPMG LLP, Grant Thornton and BDO Siedman. Serologicals
         and the Shareholder will direct the Accounting Referee to render a
         determination and send notice of such determination to Serologicals and
         Shareholder pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.1 within sixty (60)
         days of its retention and Serologicals, the Shareholder, and their
         respective agents will cooperate with the Accounting Referee during its
         engagement. The Accounting Referee will consider only those line items
         and amounts in the Closing Statement set forth in the Objection Notice
         which Serologicals and the Shareholder are unable to resolve.
         Serologicals and the Shareholder shall each submit a binder to the
         Accounting Referee promptly (and in any event within twenty (20) days
         after the Accounting Referee's engagement), which binder shall contain
         such party's computation of those line items or amounts contained in
         the Closing Statement about which the parties could not resolve any
         differences and such party's calculation of Working Capital. The
         Accounting Referee shall review such binders and base its determination
         solely on them. In resolving all disputed line items and amounts, the
         Accounting Referee's determination of Working Capital may not exceed
         the amount of Working Capital set forth on the Objection Notice and may
         not be less than the amount of Estimated Closing Working Capital set
         forth on the Closing Statement. The Accounting Referee's determination
         will be based on the definition of Working Capital set forth in this
         Agreement. The determination of the Accounting Referee will be
         conclusive and binding upon the parties. The Shareholder shall bear a
         percentage of the costs and expenses of the Accounting Referee equal to
         the difference between the aggregate amount contested by the
         Shareholder as set forth on the Objection Notice and amounts actually
         paid to (or by) the Shareholder with respect to contested items, as a
         percentage of the aggregate amount so contested. Serologicals shall
         bear the remainder of such costs and expenses.

                           (e)      Serologicals and the Shareholder agree that
         they will, and agree to cause their respective independent accountants
         to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing Statement
         and the calculation of Working Capital and in the conduct of the
         reviews and procedures referred to in this Section 2.4, including
         without limitation, the making available, to the extent necessary, of
         books, records, work papers and personnel.

                  2.5      Adjustment of Purchase Price.

                           (a)      If Actual Working Capital is less than the
         Lower Limit, the Shareholder shall, within five (5) Business Days after
         the determination of Actual

                                     - 11 -

<PAGE>

         Working Capital (or if determined pursuant to Section 2.4(d), within
         five (5) Business Days after the earlier of actual receipt of the
         determination of the Accounting Referee or deemed delivery of such
         determination pursuant to Section 9.1), pay to Serologicals an amount
         equal to the excess of the Lower Limit over Actual Working Capital plus
         interest on such amount from the Closing Date to the date of payment at
         an interest rate equal to the "Prime Rate" as listed in the Wall Street
         Journal (Southeastern Edition) on the Closing Date calculated daily on
         the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed
         (the "Prime Rate").

                           (b)      If Actual Working Capital is greater than
         the Upper Limit, Serologicals shall, within five (5) Business Days
         after the determination of Actual Working Capital (or if determined
         pursuant to Section 2.4(d), within five (5) Business Days after the
         earlier of actual receipt of the determination of the Accounting
         Referee or deemed delivery of such determination pursuant to Section
         9.1), pay to the Shareholder an amount equal to the excess of Actual
         Working Capital over the Upper Limit plus interest on such amount from
         the Closing Date to the date of payment at an interest rate equal to
         the Prime Rate.

                  2.6      Tax Withholding. With respect to each payment made by
Serologicals pursuant to this Agreement to persons other than the Shareholder,
including any persons identified by the Shareholder pursuant to Section 2.3(d),
Serologicals shall be entitled to deduct, withhold and remit to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities (or cause to be deducted, withheld and remitted) any
and all Taxes required by Law, in the reasonable judgment of Serologicals, to be
so remitted. Any such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the party who otherwise would have received
such amounts but for such withholding.

         3.       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SHAREHOLDER. The
Shareholder hereby represents and warrants to Serologicals as follows:

                  3.1      Organization.

                           (a)      Chemicon is a corporation, duly
         incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
         the State of California. Schedule 3.1(a) sets forth an accurate and
         complete list of all Chemicon Entities and their states or
         jurisdictions of incorporation or organization. Each such Chemicon
         Entity is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
         the laws of its state or jurisdiction of incorporation or organization.
         Except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(a) or as set forth in paragraph (a)
         of Schedule 3.28, Chemicon is the beneficial and record holder of all
         of the issued and outstanding capital stock or other equity interests
         of each Chemicon Entity (except for Chemicon). Except as set forth on
         Schedule 3.1(a), no shares of the Common Stock or shares of the capital
         stock of any other Chemicon Entity have been pledged to secure the
         repayment of the Chemicon Debt.

                           (b)      Each Chemicon Entity has all requisite
         corporate power and corporate authority to carry on and conduct its
         business as it is now being conducted and to own or lease its
         properties and assets. No Chemicon Entity is required to be qualified
         to do business in any state or jurisdiction in which it is not so
         qualified except to the

                                     - 12 -

<PAGE>

         extent that such failure to be qualified would not have, or could not
         reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. A list of
         countries and states in which each Chemicon Entity currently conducts
         or, in the past five (5) years, has conducted business is set forth on
         Schedule 3.1(b).

                           (c)      Except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(c) and
         except for Chemicon's ownership of the other Chemicon Entities, no
         Chemicon Entity has any interest, direct or indirect, or commitment to
         purchase any interest, direct or indirect, in any corporation,
         partnership, joint venture or other business enterprise or entity.

                           (d)      Attached hereto as Schedule 3.1(d) is a
         correct and complete copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws
         of Chemicon, which reflect all amendments made thereto at any time
         before the date hereof. Chemicon has delivered or made available to
         Serologicals copies of the minutes of the meetings of each of the board
         of directors and shareholders of Chemicon that are the complete, true
         and correct records of the meetings of the board of directors and
         shareholders of Chemicon and reflect all transactions required to be
         contained in such records, pursuant to the applicable provisions of the
         California General Corporations Law (the "CGCL"). Chemicon has also
         delivered or made available to Serologicals true and correct copies of
         all articles of incorporation, charters, bylaws, operating agreements,
         partnership agreements, and similar governing documents and all minutes
         for all meetings of directors, stockholders, members, managers,
         partners, and similar interest holders for each Chemicon Entity.

                           (e)      Attached hereto as Schedule 3.1(e) is a
         correct and complete copy of the certificate of organization and
         limited liability company agreement (or similar agreements) of the
         Shareholder, which reflects all amendments made thereto at any time
         before the date hereof.

                           (f)      The current officers, directors, managers,
         or partners (as the case may be) of the Chemicon Entities and the
         Shareholder are listed on Schedule 3.1(f).

                  3.2      Shareholder Authority. The Shareholder has all
requisite limited liability company power and limited liability company
authority to enter into this Agreement and the Indemnification Agreement and
each other document contemplated hereby and thereby to be executed by the
Shareholder. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Indemnification Agreement by the Shareholder and the consummation by the
Shareholder of the transactions contemplated herein and therein have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Shareholder. This
Agreement and the Indemnification Agreement and each other document contemplated
hereby and thereby have been (or when executed, will be) duly executed and
delivered by the Shareholder and constitute, or when executed and delivered by
the Shareholder (assuming that Serologicals executes and delivers such
agreements) will constitute, the legal, valid and binding agreements of the
Shareholder, enforceable against the Shareholder in accordance with their
respective terms, except as such enforceability may be affected by bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights and by judicial
discretion in the enforcement of equitable remedies.

<PAGE>

                  3.3      No Conflict. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.3, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Indemnification Agreement by
the Shareholder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and
therein by the Shareholder, and the performance of the covenants and agreements
of the Shareholder contained herein and therein will not, with or without the
giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both, (i) violate or conflict with any
of the provisions of, the certificate of organization, limited liability company
agreement or any governing documents of the Shareholder or any of the Chemicon
Entities, (ii) violate or conflict with any option, right of first refusal or
any similar right to purchase any Common Stock or any equity interest in any
Chemicon Entity, (iii) violate, conflict with or result in a breach or default
or loss of rights under, result in, cause or create any liability, reassessment
or revaluation of assets, or Lien pursuant to, or cause the termination or
acceleration of or give any third party the right to modify, terminate, or
accelerate any obligation under, any term or condition of any indenture,
mortgage, lease, loan agreement, license, permit, contract, agreement or
instrument to which the Shareholder or any Chemicon Entity is a party or by
which the Shareholder or any Chemicon Entity, or any of their respective
properties, may be bound, (iv) violate or conflict with any law, ordinance,
rule, order, judgment, decree or ruling of any Governmental Authority applicable
to the Shareholder or any Chemicon Entity or any of their respective assets or
properties, (v) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any assets
or properties of any Chemicon Entity, or (vi) except for approval pursuant to
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act") or the Fair Trading Act of 1973, as amended (the "FTA"), require any
authorization, consent, approval, exemption, or other action by or notice or
declaration to or filing with, any court or administrative or other governmental
body or agency.

                  3.4      Capitalization.

                           (a)      The capital stock of Chemicon consists of
         100 million shares of Common Stock, of which 1,960 shares are issued
         and outstanding. The Shareholder is the sole record and beneficial
         owner of all of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, and there
         exists no other capital stock or other equity interest in Chemicon.

                           (b)      Except as set forth on Schedule 3.4 and
         except for this Agreement, no Chemicon Entity is bound by any
         subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, contracts, demands,
         commitments, understandings or other agreements requiring any Chemicon
         Entity to issue or entitling any person or entity to acquire any shares
         of Common Stock or any equity interest in any Chemicon Entity,
         including any right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding
         security or other instrument, and under which any Chemicon Entity is
         obligated to issue any equity or similar interest for any purpose. No
         former or present holder of any Common Stock, any interest therein or
         any capital stock or equity interest of any Chemicon Entity has any
         legal claim against Chemicon based on any issuance, sale, purchase,
         redemption or involvement in any transfer of any Common Stock by
         Chemicon or capital stock or equity interest in any Chemicon Entity. No
         Chemicon Entity has outstanding any obligation to repurchase, redeem or
         otherwise acquire any outstanding Common Stock or any capital stock or
         equity interest of any Chemicon Entity. There are no voting trusts,
         proxies or any other similar agreements or understandings with respect
         to the Common Stock.

                  3.5      Transfer Claims. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5,
no prior offer, issue, redemption, call, purchase, sale, transfer, negotiation
or other transaction of any nature or kind with respect to any Common Stock or
any capital stock or other equity interest in any Chemicon Entity (including
shares, offers, options, warrants or debt convertible into Common Stock or any
capital stock or equity interest of any Chemicon Entity) has given or would
reasonably be likely to give rise to any valid claim or action by any person
which is enforceable against any Chemicon Entity, and no fact or circumstance
exists which would reasonably be likely to give rise to any such right, claim or
action on behalf of any person. With respect to all issuances, transfers or
purchases of Common Stock, all have been performed in compliance with all
applicable agreements and all applicable Laws, including federal and state
securities laws, none have been in violation of any pre-emptive or similar right
and all Taxes thereon have been paid.

                  3.6      Financial Statements. Schedule 3.6 contains the
audited consolidated balance sheets for Chemicon as of December 31, 2000 and
December 31, 2001 and the related audited consolidated statements of operations,
statements of shareholders' equity and statements of cash flows for the years
ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001 (the "Audited Financial
Statements"), and the unaudited combined balance sheet for Chemicon, Chemicon
Europe and Cymbus Biotechnology Limited, dated as of October 31, 2002 (the
"Interim Balance Sheet Date"), and the related unaudited combined statement of
operations and statement of cash flows for the ten-month period ending on
October 31, 2002 (the "Interim Financial Statements" and, together with the
Audited Financial Statements, collectively the "Financial Statements"). The
Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (subject
to the exception disclosed on Schedule 3.14(a)) and present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Chemicon as of the
date thereof, and the related results of consolidated operations and its
consolidated cash flows for the years then ended. The Interim Financial
Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (subject to the absence of
footnote disclosure and year-end adjustments, which will not be material either
individually or in the aggregate and subject to the exception disclosed on
Schedule 3.14(a)), and present fairly, in all material respects, the combined
financial position of Chemicon, Chemicon Europe and Cymbus Biotechnology Limited
as of October 31, 2002, and the related results of their combined operations and
their combined cash flows for the ten-month period then ended, and are based on
the Chemicon Entities' books and records, which have been kept, and such Interim
Financial Statements have been prepared, in accordance with the historical
accounting methods of Chemicon, Chemicon Europe and Cymbus Biotechnology
Limited, as the case may be, consistently applied. The balance sheet as of
December 31, 2001, included in the Audited Financial Statements is referred to
herein as the "Audited Balance Sheet" and the unaudited balance sheet as of
October 31, 2002 included in the Interim Financial Statements is referred to
herein as the "Interim Balance Sheet."

                  3.7      No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as and to the
extent reflected and adequately reserved against in the Interim Balance Sheet or
as shown on Schedule 3.7, as of the Interim Balance Sheet Date, Chemicon had no
debts, liabilities or obligations whatsoever, (whether accrued, absolute,

                  modification or acceleration of rent under any Real Property
                  Lease;

                  3.13     Intellectual Property.

                           (a)      The Chemicon Entities own or have the right
         to use pursuant to license, sublicense, agreement, or permission all

         Schedule 3.13(a) sets forth a list of all registered patents,
         registered and unregistered trademarks, trade names, service marks,
         assumed names and copyrights owned by any Chemicon Entity and all
         applications therefor filed by any Chemicon Entity. Chemicon has made
         available to Serologicals correct and complete copies of all such
         patents, registrations, and applications. The Chemicon Entities have
         taken all necessary and desirable action to maintain and protect each
         item of Proprietary Rights required to be identified on Schedule
         3.13(a) in each jurisdiction in which the Business is conducted as of
         the date hereof. With respect to each Proprietary Right required to be
         identified on Schedule 3.13(a):

                                    (i)      except as set forth on Schedule
                  3.13(a), the appropriate Chemicon Entity possesses all right,
                  title, and interest in and to the item, free and clear of any
                  Liens, license, or other restriction (other than Permitted
                  Liens);

                                    (ii)     the item is not subject to any
                  outstanding injunction, judgment, order, decree or ruling;

                                    (iii)    no action, suit, proceeding,
                  hearing, investigation, complaint, claim or demand is pending
                  or, to the Knowledge of the Shareholder, threatened which
                  challenges the legality, validity, enforceability, use, or
                  ownership of the item; and

                                    (iv)     no Chemicon Entity has ever agreed
                  to indemnify any Person for or against any interference,
                  infringement, misappropriation, or other conflict with respect
                  to the item.

                           (b)      Except as described in Schedule 3.13(b),
         each item of Proprietary Rights required to be identified on Schedule
         3.13(a) will not be affected by consummation of the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement.

                           (c)      To the Knowledge of the Shareholder, no
         Chemicon Entity has interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated,
         or otherwise come into conflict with any Proprietary Rights of third
         parties, and, except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(c), none of the
         officers (and employees with responsibility for Proprietary Rights
         matters) of any Chemicon Entity has received, since December 31, 2000,
         any written charge, complaint, claim, demand, or notice alleging any
         such interference, infringement, misappropriation, or violation
         (including any claim that any Chemicon Entity must license or refrain
         from using any intellectual property rights of any third party). To the
         Knowledge of the

                                     - 21 -

         Shareholder, no third party has interfered with, infringed upon,
         misappropriated, or otherwise come into conflict with any Proprietary
         Rights of any Chemicon Entity listed or required to be listed on
         Schedule 3.13(a).

                           (d)      Schedule 3.13(d) identifies each license,
         sublicense agreement, or other permission that any Chemicon Entity has
         granted to any third party with respect to any Proprietary Rights
         (together with any exceptions). Chemicon has made available to
         Serologicals correct and complete copies of all such licenses,
         sublicenses, agreements, and permissions (as amended to date) and has
         made available to Serologicals correct and complete copies of all other
         written documentation evidencing ownership and prosecution (if
         applicable) of each such item.

                           (e)      Schedule 3.13(e) identifies each Proprietary
         Right that any third party owns and that any Chemicon Entity uses
         pursuant to a license, sublicense, agreement, or permission and
         identifies each such license, sublicense, agreement or permission.
         Chemicon has made available to Serologicals correct and complete copies
         of all such licenses, sublicenses, agreements, and permissions (as
         amended to date). Schedule 3.13(e) identifies the Top IP Contracts.
         With respect to the Top IP Contracts and subject to the receipt of any
         relevant consents as set forth on Schedule 3.11(a) or the provision of
         any relevant notices as set forth on Schedule 3.11(b):

                                    (i)      the license, sublicense, agreement,
                  or permission covering the item is legal, valid, binding and
                  enforceable and in full force and effect;

                                    (ii)     the license, sublicense, agreement,
                  or permission will not be affected by consummation of the
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

                                    (iii)    no Chemicon Entity is, and to the
                  Knowledge of the Shareholder, no other party to the license,
                  sublicense, agreement, or permission is, in breach or default,
                  and, to the Knowledge of the Shareholder, no event has
                  occurred that with notice or lapse of time would constitute a
                  breach or default or permit termination, modification, or
                  acceleration thereunder;

                                    (iv)     no Chemicon Entity has, and to the
                  Knowledge of the Shareholder, no other party to any Top IP
                  Contract has, repudiated any provision thereof;

                                    (v)      with respect to each sublicense, to
                  the Knowledge of the Shareholder, the representations and
                  warranties set forth in Sections 3.13(e)(i) through
                  3.13(e)(iv) above are true and correct with respect to the
                  underlying license;

                                    (vi)     the underlying item of Proprietary
                  Rights is not subject to any outstanding injunction, judgment,
                  order, decree or ruling to which any Chemicon Entity is a
                  party nor, to the Shareholder's Knowledge, to which any other
                  person claiming an interest therein is a party;

                                     - 22 -

<PAGE>

                                    (vii)    no action, suit, proceeding,
                  hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand is
                  pending or, to the Knowledge of the Shareholder, threatened
                  which challenges the legality, validity, or enforceability of
                  the Proprietary Rights underlying the Top IP Contracts; and

                                    (viii)   no Chemicon Entity has granted any
                  sublicense or similar right with respect to any Top IP
                  Contract.

                  3.14     Inventory/Product Warranty.

                           (a)      The inventory of the Chemicon Entities
         consists of raw material and supplies, manufactured and purchased parts
         and materials, goods in process, and finished goods. The book value of
         any such inventory that is slow-moving, obsolete, damaged, or defective
         does not exceed the reserve for inventory set forth on the face of the
         Interim Balance Sheet (rather than in the notes) and the book value of
         any such inventory that is slow-moving, obsolete, damaged, or defective
         as of the Closing Date will not exceed the reserve for inventory used
         to determine Actual Working Capital in accordance with Section 2.4.
         Except as set forth in Schedule 3.14(a), the amount at which the
         inventory of the Chemicon Entities is carried on the Interim Balance
         Sheet fairly represents, in all material respects, the cost (or market
         value, if lower) of such inventory as determined in accordance with
         GAAP.

                           (b)      No Chemicon Entity has any liability or
         obligation (and, to the Knowledge of the Shareholder, there is no basis
         for any present or future action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
         investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand against any of them
         giving rise to any liability or obligations) for replacement of any
         product manufactured, sold, leased or delivered by any Chemicon Entity
         or damages in connection therewith, subject only to the reserve for
         product warranty claims set forth on the face of the Interim Balance
         Sheet (rather than in the notes). No product manufactured, sold, leased
         or delivered by any Chemicon Entity is subject to any guaranty,
         warranty or other indemnity beyond the standard terms and conditions
         thereof, which are fully and accurately set forth on Schedule 3.14(b).

                           (c)      No Chemicon Entity has any liability or
         obligations (and, to the Knowledge of the Shareholder, there is no
         basis for any present or future action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
         investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand against any of them
         giving rise to any liability or obligation) arising out of any injury
         to individuals or property as a result of the ownership, possession, or
         use of any product manufactured, sold, leased, or delivered by any
         Chemicon Entity.

                  3.15     Notes and Accounts Receivable. All notes and accounts
receivable of the Chemicon Entities are (a) reflected properly on the Interim
Financial Statements and (b) valid receivables, subject to no setoffs or
counterclaims. The allowance for doubtful accounts set forth on the Interim
Balance Sheet was calculated in accordance with past practice and is adequate in
light of all known facts and circumstances having a bearing on the
collectibility of the accounts and notes receivable of the Chemicon Entities.

                  3.16     Legal Proceedings. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.16, there are no suits, actions, claims, proceedings or investigations pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Shareholder, threatened against, relating to or
involving any Chemicon Entity or any of their officers, directors or
shareholders, in their capacities as officers, directors or shareholders of any
Chemicon Entity, before any court, arbitrator or administrative or Governmental
Authority. None of such suits, actions, claims, proceedings or investigations,
if finally determined adversely, would have, or could reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. No Chemicon
Entity is subject to, or has received any notice that it may be subject to, any
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any court. No Chemicon Entity is
subject to, or has received any notice that it may be subject to, any
governmental restriction that would have, or could reasonably be expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect.

                  3.17     Employee Benefit Plans.

                           (a)      Schedule 3.17 sets forth a complete and
         accurate list of all plans, programs, agreements, arrangements,
         commitments, policies or understandings of any kind (whether written or
         oral) providing compensation, remuneration or benefits of any kind or
         description whatsoever (whether current or deferred and whether paid in
         cash or in kind) to, or on behalf of, any present or former officer,
         manager, director, employee, or consultant or other independent
         contractor (or any of their dependents) of the Chemicon Entities or any
         predecessors in interest thereto, that are currently in effect or as to
         which any Chemicon Entity has any liability, duty or obligation
         whatsoever (whether fixed or contingent), including, any stock option,
         employment, change of control, consulting, severance, or collective
         bargaining agreement and any "employee benefit plan" as defined in
         Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
         amended ("ERISA") without regard to whether such plan is subject to
         ERISA (all such plans, programs, agreements, arrangements, commitments,
         policies and understandings shall be referred to collectively as the
         "Employee Benefit Plans"). Except as set forth on Schedule 3.17, all of
         the Employee Benefit Plans are currently in effect. All retirement
         plans intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code are
         separately identified on Schedule 3.17. No Employee Benefit Plan that
         is described in Section 3(1) of ERISA provides any benefits after a
         termination of employment except to the extent such benefits are
         required to satisfy the minimum requirements under Part 6 of Subtitle B
         of Title I of ERISA. None of the Employee Benefit Plans are
         "multiemployer plans" as defined in Section 3(37) and Section
         4001(a)(3) of ERISA and no Chemicon Entity nor any ERISA Affiliate of
         either of them has at any time established or maintained, or has at any
         time been obligated to make, or made, contributions to or under any
         multiemployer plan established pursuant to ERISA or any comparable
         federal, provincial or local law or any plan described in Sections 4063
         and 4064 of ERISA. No Chemicon Entity is obligated to pay any amount to
         any officer, manager, director or employee with respect to or
         contingent upon (i) the termination of his or her employment following
         consummation of the Acquisition; (ii) the execution of this Agreement
         or the consummation of the Acquisition; or (iii) the continuation of
         his or her employment with the relevant Chemicon Entity pending or
         after the consummation of the Acquisition.

                           (b)      Except as set forth on Schedule 3.17, (i)
         the Chemicon Entities have complied, in all material respects, with all
         of their respective obligations with

                                     - 24 -

<PAGE>

         respect to all Employee Benefit Plans, including the payment of all
         contributions required or due to be paid, the satisfaction of all
         reporting and disclosure requirements to federal, state, provincial and
         local governments and governmental agencies and to all Employee Benefit
         Plan participants and beneficiaries, and the payment or accrual of all
         expenses for all periods, including the period between the end of the
         previous plan year and the date hereof; (ii) the Employee Benefit Plans
         have been established, maintained, invested, and administered, in all
         material respects, in compliance with their respective terms and with
         all applicable Laws, regulations and administrative requirements; (iii)
         the levels of insurance reserves and accrued liabilities with regard to
         the Employee Benefit Plans are reasonable and are sufficient to provide
         for all incurred but unreported claims and any retroactive premium
         adjustments; (iv) the assets of all the Employee Benefit Plans that are
         required under applicable Laws to be held in trust (or other form of
         funding vehicle which is separate and apart from the general assets of
         the applicable Chemicon Entity) are in fact so held, and the fair
         market value of the assets of each such Employee Benefit Plan equal or
         exceed the liabilities of each such plan; (v) the liabilities of each
         Employee Benefit Plan are properly and accurately reported on the
         Financial Statements; (vi) the assets of each Employee Benefit Plan are
         reported at their fair market value on the books and records of each
         plan or the related trust; and (vii) each Employee Benefit Plan
         intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code is, and has been,
         so qualified and has received a current favorable determination letter
         from the Internal Revenue Service on the current form of the plan
         stating that such plan is so qualified.

                           (c)      Chemicon has made available to Serologicals:
         (i) a correct, complete and current copy of (A) each written Employee
         Benefit Plan and any amendments thereto together with any trust
         agreements or other contracts or agreements which are a part of such
         plan, and (B) with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, all Internal
         Revenue Service, Department of Labor and Pension Benefit Guaranty
         Corporation rulings or determinations, and all rulings or
         determinations from any comparable foreign agency or body; (ii) a
         complete written description of each unwritten Employee Benefit Plan;
         (iii) with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, the ERISA summary
         plan description, if applicable, and any other summary of plan
         provisions provided to participants and beneficiaries; (iv) the annual
         reports filed with the Department of Labor or the Internal Revenue
         Service for the most recent three (3) plan years and the most recent
         financial statements, actuarial reports, and periodic accounting for
         related plan assets with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan; and (v)
         such other documentation with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan as
         reasonably requested by Serologicals

                           (d)      Except as described on Schedule 3.17, (i) no
         Chemicon Entity has any agreement, arrangement, commitment or
         understanding, whether legally binding or not, to create any additional
         benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement or to increase the rate of
         benefit accrual or contribution requirement under any of the Employee
         Benefit Plans; to amend or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan; or,
         except as specifically provided in any existing law, regulations,
         revenue rulings or revenue procedures, to continue any Employee Benefit
         Plan or any provision thereunder for any period of time; (ii) the
         Chemicon Entities have the right pursuant to the terms of each Employee
         Benefit Plan and all agreements related to such plan unilaterally to
         terminate such plan (or its

                                     - 25 -

<PAGE>

         participation in such plan) and to amend the terms of such plan at any
         time without triggering a penalty or an obligation to make any
         additional contributions to such plan; and (iii) the Chemicon Entities
         after the date hereof shall have the same rights to unilaterally take
         such action as they did prior to the date hereof without triggering any
         penalty or any obligation to make any additional contributions to such
         plan.

                           (e)      To the Knowledge of the Shareholder, none of
         the Employee Benefit Plans is currently under audit or, investigation
         or review, by the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service or
         any other United States federal or state Governmental Authority or any
         foreign Governmental Authority, and to the Knowledge of the
         Shareholder, no such audit, investigation or review has been proposed.

                           (f)      There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of
         the Shareholder, threatened claims with respect to an Employee Benefit
         Plan (other than routine and reasonable claims for benefits made in the
         ordinary course of plan operations) or with respect to the terms and
         conditions of employment or termination of employment of any employee
         or former employee of any Chemicon Entity.

                           (g)      No Employee Benefit Plan is liable for any
         unpaid Taxes nor is any Chemicon Entity liable for any unpaid Taxes
         with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

                           (h)      Except as described in Schedule 3.17, the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in any
         additional or accelerated payments to, increased benefit accruals for
         or increase the vested interest of, any current or former officer,
         employee or director or their dependents under any Employee Benefit
         Plan.

                           (i)      There have been no prohibited transactions
         or breaches of fiduciary duty under ERISA or prohibited transactions
         under the Code for which any Chemicon Entity has any liability, and
         except as described in Schedule 3.17, no Chemicon Entity has any
         obligation to indemnify or hold harmless any person or entity in
         connection with any liability attributable to any acts or omissions by
         such person or entity with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

                           (j)      Except as described on Schedule 3.17, no
         assets have been set aside in any trust or account (other than an
         account that is part of a Chemicon Entity's general assets) to satisfy
         any obligations under any Employee Benefit Plan.

                           (k)      Neither any Chemicon Entity, nor any ERISA
         Affiliate, nor, to the Knowledge of the Shareholder, any fiduciary of
         any of the Employee Benefit Plans has incurred (and no facts exist that
         may be reasonably expected to cause a Chemicon Entity, ERISA Affiliate
         or fiduciary to incur) any liability for any amount of Tax, fine or
         penalty or funding or contribution obligation as a result of a
         violation of the Code, ERISA or other applicable Law with respect to
         any Employee Benefit Plan or any plan of an ERISA Affiliate.

                           (l)      No Chemicon Entity nor any ERISA Affiliate
         makes or has any obligation to make, or has made or had any obligation
         to make, either directly or

         indirectly (whether by reimbursing another employer or otherwise),
         contributions to any plan, program or arrangement, including a
         multiemployer plan, that is subject to Title IV of ERISA.

                  3.18     Labor Relations. Except to the extent set forth on
Schedule 3.18:

                           (a)      There are no collective bargaining
         agreements to which any Chemicon Entity is a party or is bound and
         there are no certifications issued by a labor board or tribunal with
         respect to any Chemicon Entity.

                           (b)      Since January 1, 1996, no Chemicon Entity
         has experienced any organized slow down, work interruption, strike or
         work stoppage. There are no existing or, to the Knowledge of the
         Shareholder, threatened labor disputes, requests or applications for
         union representation.

                           (c)      There are no investigations, administrative
         proceedings or formal complaints of discrimination (including
         discrimination based on sex, age, family status, marital status, race,
         national origin, sexual preference, disability or veteran status)
         pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any
         federal, state, local or foreign Governmental Authority against or
         involving any Chemicon Entity with respect to such matters; nor, to the
         Knowledge of the Shareholder, are any such complaints threatened.

                           (d)      Schedule 3.18 sets forth a true and correct
         list of all employees employed by the Chemicon Entities, together with
         their respective job titles, continuous service dates, compensation
         rates and accrued vacation leave (and any applicable leave loading),
         long service leave and sick leave as of the most recent practicable
         date.

                           (e)      Each individual who has received
         compensation for the performance of services on behalf of any Chemicon
         Entity has been properly classified as an "employee" or "independent
         contractor" in compliance with all applicable federal, state,
         provincial, or local laws. There has been no complaint, investigation
         or proceeding pending, or to the Knowledge of the Shareholder,
         threatened, relating to the classification of an individual as an
         "independent contractor" of any Chemicon Entity.

                           (f)      No Chemicon Entity has taken any action that
         would constitute a "Mass Layoff" or "Plant Closing" within the meaning
         of WARN or would otherwise trigger notice requirements or liability
         under any federal, state, provincial, county, local or foreign plant
         closing notice law. No agreement, arbitration or court decision or
         order or rules of any Governmental Authority in any way limits or
         restricts any Chemicon Entity from relocating or closing any of its
         operations.

                           (g)      No Chemicon Entity has failed to pay when
         due any wages, salaries, bonuses, commissions, benefits, Taxes,
         penalties or assessments or other monies, owed to, or arising out of
         the employment of or any relationship or arrangement with, any officer,
         director, stockholder, manager, employee, sales representative,
         contractor, consultant or other agent.

                           (h)      The Chemicon Entities are in material
         compliance with all United States and foreign immigration laws relating
         to employment and have properly completed and maintained all applicable
         forms (including I-9 forms) and, there are no citations,
         investigations, administrative proceedings or formal complaints of
         violations of the immigration laws pending or, to the Knowledge of the
         Shareholder, threatened before the Immigration and Naturalization
         Service or any federal, state or local Governmental Authority against
         or involving any Chemicon Entity with respect to such matters.

                           (i)      No Chemicon Entity is nor has, since January
         1, 1996, been in violation, in any material respect, of any applicable
         local, state, provincial or federal labor, employment or wage law,
         ordinance, regulation, order or decree.

                  3.19     Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements. Except
as set forth in Schedule 3.19:

                           (a)      Each Chemicon Entity, and their respective
         Affiliates and each piece of real property occupied by them is in
         compliance, in all material respects, and has at all times during such
         occupancy since January 1, 1996 complied, in all material respects,
         with all Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements.

                           (b)      Without limiting the generality of Section
         3.19(a), each Chemicon Entity has obtained and complied with and is in
         compliance, in all material respects, with, all permits, licenses and
         other authorizations that are required pursuant to Environmental,
         Health and Safety Requirements for the occupation of its facilities and
         the operation of its businesses; a list of all such licenses, permits
         and other authorizations is set forth on Schedule 3.19.

                           (c)      No Chemicon Entity, nor, to the Knowledge of
         the Shareholder, any legal entity that was merged with or into any
         Chemicon Entity, that was consolidated with any Chemicon Entity, or the
         liabilities of which for matters related to Environmental, Health and
         Safety Requirements were assumed by any Chemicon Entity (each a
         "Predecessor Entity") has received any written or oral notice, report
         or other information regarding any actual or alleged material violation
         of Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements, or any liabilities
         or potential liabilities (whether accrued, absolute, contingent
         unliquidated or otherwise), including any investigatory, remedial, or
         corrective obligations relating to any of them or their facilities
         arising under Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements.

                           (d)      None of the following exists at any facility
         or property owned, operated or leased by any Chemicon Entity:

                                    (i)      underground storage tanks;

                                    (ii)     asbestos-containing material in any
                  form or condition;

                                    (iii)    materials or equipment containing
                  polychlorinated biphenyls; or

                                     - 28 -

                                    (iv)     landfills, surface impoundments or
                  disposal areas.

                           (e)      No Chemicon Entity, nor any of their
         respective Affiliates, nor, to the Knowledge of the Shareholder, any
         Predecessor Entity has treated, stored, disposed of, arranged for or
         permitted the disposal of, transported, handled, or released any
         substance, including, any Hazardous Material, or owned or operated any
         property or facility (and no such property or facility is contaminated
         by any such Hazardous Material) in a manner that has given or would
         reasonably be likely to give rise to liabilities, including any
         liability for response costs, corrective action costs, personal injury,
         property damage, natural resource damage, or attorney fees, pursuant to
         the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
         Act of 1980, as amended, the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended or
         any other Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements.

                           (f)      Neither this Agreement nor the consummation
         of the Acquisition will result in any obligations for site
         investigation or cleanup, or notification to or consent of government
         agencies or third parties, pursuant to any of the so-called
         "transaction-triggered," or "responsible property transfer"
         Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements or otherwise pursuant to
         Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements.

                           (g)      No Chemicon Entity, nor, to the Knowledge of
         the Shareholder, any Predecessor Entity has either expressly or by
         operation of law, assumed or undertaken any liability, including any
         obligations for corrective or remedial action, of any other Person
         relating to Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements.

                           (h)      Since January 1, 1997, no Chemicon Entity
         nor, to the Knowledge of the Shareholder, any facility or property
         owned or occupied by them, has ever been subject to an audit,
         evaluation, assessment, review or study relating to compliance with
         Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements or the presence or
         release of Hazardous Materials.

                  3.20     Insurance Policies. Schedule 3.20 sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all insurance policies in force naming any
Chemicon Entity or employees thereof as an insured or beneficiary or as a loss
payable payee or for which any Chemicon Entity has paid or is obligated to pay
all or part of the premiums. All such policies are in full force and effect and
no Chemicon Entity is in default under the terms of such policies or has
received notice of any pending or threatened cancellation or premium increase
(retroactive or otherwise) with respect thereto, and the relevant Chemicon
Entity is in compliance in all material respects with all conditions contained
therein. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.20, all such policies that provide
insurance against liability to third parties were written on an occurrence
basis. There are no pending claims against such insurance as to which insurers
are defending under reservation of rights or have denied liability and there
exists no claim under such insurance that has not been properly filed. Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.20, during the past three (3) years, no insurance policy
has been canceled by any insurer and no application for insurance by any
Chemicon Entity has been rejected by any insurer.

                  3.21     Contracts and Commitments.

                           (a)      Except for (i) Contracts for the purchase of
         services, goods or raw materials by a Chemicon Entity entered into in
         the Ordinary Course of Business that do not individually involve an
         amount in excess of $50,000 (treating each purchase order as a separate
         agreement) and that are reasonably expected to be fully performed
         within six (6) months of their respective dates (collectively, the
         "Immaterial Contracts"), and (ii) Contracts listed on Schedules
         3.10(a), 3.12, 3.13(a), 3.13(d) and 3.13(e) (or that would have been
         listed on such schedules but for the disclosure thresholds set forth
         therein), each Contract to which any Chemicon Entity is a party is
         listed on Schedule 3.21(a).

                           (b)      Except as set forth on Schedule 3.21(b),
         during the past five (5) years no Chemicon Entity has, directly or
         indirectly, purchased, leased from others or otherwise acquired any
         property or obtained any services from, or sold, leased to others or
         otherwise disposed of any property or furnished any services to, or
         otherwise dealt with (except with respect to remuneration for services
         rendered as a director, officer, manager, or employee of the relevant
         Chemicon Entity), in the Ordinary Course of Business or otherwise: (i)
         any direct or indirect record or beneficial owner of Common Stock, the
         Trust or the Beckmans or (ii) any person, firm or corporation (other
         than a Chemicon Entity) which, directly or indirectly, alone or
         together with others, controls, is controlled by or is under common
         control with any direct or indirect record or beneficial owner of
         Common Stock, the Trust or the Beckmans. Except as set forth on
         Schedule 3.21(b) and except for amounts currently due or that become
         due with respect to those Contracts set forth on Schedule 3.21(b), no
         Chemicon Entity owes any amount to, or has any contract with or
         commitment to, the Shareholder or any of the directors, officers,
         managers, employees, consultants or any Affiliates of any of the
         Shareholder (other than a Chemicon Entity), the Trust or the Beckmans
         and none of such persons owes any amount to any Chemicon Entity, except
         with respect to remuneration for services rendered as a director,
         officer, manager or employee of the relevant Chemicon Entity.

                           (c)      To the Knowledge of the Shareholder, all of
         the Contracts listed or required to be listed on Schedules 3.10(a),
         3.12, 3.13(a), 3.13(d), 3.13(e), or 3.21(a) (collectively, the
         "Chemicon Contracts") are valid and binding, and are in full force and
         effect and are enforceable in accordance with their terms. To the
         Knowledge of the Shareholder, there is no pending or threatened
         bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding with respect to any party
         to any Chemicon Contract. No event has occurred which (whether with or
         without notice, lapse of time or the happening or occurrence of any
         other event) would constitute a default pursuant to such Chemicon
         Contracts by the relevant Chemicon Entity or, to the Knowledge of the
         Shareholder, any other party thereto. Each Chemicon Entity has
         performed all obligations required to be performed by it pursuant to,
         and is in compliance with the terms and conditions of, each Chemicon
         Contract to which it is a party and is not in default under or in
         breach of, nor in receipt of any claim of default or breach under any
         Chemicon Contract. No condition or state of facts exists that, with
         notice or the passage of time, or both, would constitute a material
         default or material breach by the relevant Chemicon Entity under any
         Chemicon Contract. Chemicon has made available to Serologicals correct
         and complete copies of all written Chemicon Contracts together with all
         amendments, waivers and other changes

                                     - 30 -

         thereto. Schedules 3.10(a), 3.12, 3.13(a), 3.13(d), 3.13(e), and
         3.21(a) collectively contain an accurate and complete description of
         all material terms of all oral Chemicon Contracts referred to therein.

                  3.22     Absence of Certain Changes and Events. Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.22 and as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, since
the date of the Interim Balance Sheet, each Chemicon Entity has conducted the
Business only in the Ordinary Course of Business, and has not:

                           (a)      received any notice of termination of any
         Chemicon Contract, lease or other agreement or suffered any damage,
         destruction or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) which, in any
         case or in the aggregate, has had, or could reasonably be expected to
         have, a Material Adverse Effect;

         obligated itself to purchase, retire or redeem, any Common Stock or any
         equity interest in any Chemicon Entity or other securities;

                           (c)      except for customary increases based on term
         of service or regular promotion of non-officer employees, (i) increased
         the compensation payable or to become payable to any employee, officer,
         shareholder, director, manager, member, distributor or agent of any
         Chemicon Entity or (ii) increased any bonus, insurance, pension,
         vacation or other employee benefits, payments or arrangements for such
         persons;

                  3.23     Tax Matters.

                           (a)      All Tax Returns of any Chemicon Entity that
         are due to have been filed in accordance with any applicable Law have
         been duly filed, are true, correct and complete in all material
         respects, and have been prepared in substantial compliance with all
         applicable Laws. Chemicon has delivered or made available to
         Serologicals true, correct and complete copies of all such Tax Returns
         filed for the three (3) most recent years for which such returns have
         been filed.

                           (b)      All Taxes due and owing by any Chemicon
         Entity (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been timely paid
         in full. Each Chemicon Entity has withheld and paid all Taxes required
         to have been withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid or
         owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or
         other third party.

                           (c)      The unpaid Taxes of each Chemicon Entity (i)
         did not, as of the date of the Interim Financial Statements, exceed the
         reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes
         established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income)
         set forth on the face of the Interim Balance Sheet (rather than in any
         notes thereto) and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the
         passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past
         custom and practice of the Chemicon Entities in filing their Tax
         Returns. Since the date of the Interim Financial Statement, no Chemicon
         Entity has incurred any liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary
         gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the Ordinary
         Course of Business.

                           (d)      Except as set forth on Schedule 3.23(d),
         there are no extensions of time in effect with respect to the dates on
         which any Tax Returns were or are due to be filed by any Chemicon
         Entity.

                           (e)      All deficiencies asserted or reassessments
         made as a result of any examination or audit of any Tax Return have
         been paid in full, accrued as liabilities in the full amount of the
         deficiency or reassessment on the Interim Balance Sheets or finally
         settled and paid, and no issue has been raised in any such examination
         or audit which, by application of the same or similar principles,
         reasonably could be expected to result in a proposed deficiency or
         reassessment against any Chemicon Entity for any other period not so
         examined.

                           (f)      No claims for any Taxes have been asserted
         and no proposals, adjustments or deficiencies for any Taxes are, to the
         Knowledge of the Shareholder, being asserted, proposed or threatened,
         and, to the Knowledge of the Shareholder, no audit or investigation of
         any Tax Return is currently under way, pending or threatened by any
         Governmental Authority. No claim has ever been made by a Governmental
         Authority in a jurisdiction in which any Chemicon Entity does not file
         Tax Returns that such Chemicon Entity is or may be subject to taxation
         by that jurisdiction. Schedule 3.23(f) sets forth each taxable year or
         other period for which an audit or other examination of any Chemicon
         Entity was conducted by any Governmental Authority

                                     - 33 -

<PAGE>

         with respect to taxable periods beginning on or after January 1, 1996,
         the issues examined in connection with such audit or examination, and
         the disposition thereof.

                           (g)      Except as set forth on Schedule 3.23(g),
         there are no outstanding waivers or agreements or requests to execute
         such waivers or agreements by any Chemicon Entity extending the time
         for the assessment or payment of any Taxes or deficiency thereof, nor
         are there any requests for rulings, outstanding subpoenas or requests
         for information, notices of proposed reassessment of any property owned
         or leased by any Chemicon Entity or any other Tax matters pending
         between any Chemicon Entity and any Governmental Authority.

                           (h)      There are no Liens for Taxes on any asset or
         property used in the Business nor are there any Liens that are, to the
         Knowledge of the Shareholder, pending or threatened, other than Liens
         for Taxes not yet due and payable.

                           (i)      No Chemicon Entity is currently contesting
         or has reason to contest any Tax liability before any Governmental
         Authority.

                           (j)      No Chemicon Entity has made any payment
         which constitutes an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
         Section 280G of the Code, and no payment by any Chemicon Entity is
         required to be made under any Chemicon Contract that will, if made,
         constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
         280G of the Code.

                           (k)      As of the year end of the tax year preceding
         the date hereof, and as of the date hereof, the adjusted basis of the
         depreciable or amortizable assets of any Chemicon Entity for U.S.
         federal income tax purposes ("U.S. Tax Basis") are in both cases as set
         forth on the tax attributes list attached as Schedule 3.23(k) showing
         the original tax cost of the assets and the tax depreciation or
         amortization thereof as of the year end of the taxable year preceding
         the date hereof, and as of the date hereof.

                           (l)      No Chemicon Entity is a party to any tax
         allocation, tax sharing or similar agreement. No Chemicon Entity has
         any liability for the Taxes of another Person (other than another
         Chemicon Entity) under Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-6 (or any
         similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or
         successor, by contact, or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation or
         otherwise.

                           (m)      Except as set forth on Schedule 3.23(m), no
         Chemicon Entity is currently or has been a partner or member of any
         partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. income
         tax purposes or a member of an affiliated group (within the meaning of
         Section 1504(a) of the Code) filing a consolidated United States
         federal income tax return.

                           (n)      No Chemicon Entity has paid any
         non-deductible compensation to any of its shareholders, officers,
         directors or employees for the current Tax year or any prior Tax year.

                                     - 34 -

<PAGE>

                           (o)      No property of any Chemicon Entity is
         "tax-exempt use property" within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the
         Code nor property that Serologicals will be required to treat as being
         owned by another Person pursuant to Section 168 of the Code (or any
         corresponding provision of prior law).

                           (p)      No Chemicon Entity is a "United States real
         property holding corporation" as such term is defined in Section
         897(c)(2) of the Code.

                           (q)      To the Knowledge of the Shareholder, all
         "controlled transactions" between two (2) or more Chemicon Entities or
         between one (1) or more Chemicon Entities comply, in all material
         respects, with the arm's length standards set forth in Section 482 of
         the Code.

                           (r)      None of the Chemicon Entities has filed a
         consent under Section 341(f) of the Code concerning collapsible
         corporations.

                           (s)      No Chemicon Entity has distributed stock of
         another Person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person, in
         a transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or
         in part by Section 355 or Section 361 of the Code.

                           (t)      From February 1, 1987 through December 31,
         2002, Chemicon was subject to income Tax as a qualifying subchapter S
         corporation within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code
         and for purposes of the corresponding provisions of California Tax Law.

                  3.24     Employee Notice. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.24
hereto, no salaried employee of any Chemicon Entity has notified any Chemicon
Entity of his or her intention to resign or retire.

                  3.25     No Interest in Properties, Competitors, Etc. Except
as set forth in Schedule 3.25 hereto and except for transactions between or
among the Chemicon Entities, Chemicon Europe and the European Subsidiaries, no
Chemicon Entity nor, to the Knowledge of the Shareholder, any of their
respective directors, officers, managers or shareholders, directly or
indirectly, owns any interest in, controls or is an employee, officer, manager,
shareholder, member, director or agent of, or employee to, any person or entity
that is a competitor or supplier or otherwise has a material business
relationship with any Chemicon Entity.

                  3.26     Brokers' and Finders' Fees. Other than as set forth
on Schedule 3.26, neither any Chemicon Entity, the Shareholder nor anyone acting
on behalf of any of them, has any liability to any party for any brokers' or
finders' fees or the like or any other liability that is contingent upon the
consummation of the Acquisition in connection with this Agreement, the European
Purchase Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby.
Serologicals shall have no liability arising from any such action by any
Chemicon Entity, the Shareholder, or anyone acting on behalf of any of them for
any such fees, expenses, or the like in connection with this Agreement, the
European Purchase Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby.

                  3.27     Ethical Practices. Neither any Chemicon Entity nor
any officer, director, employee, member, manager, agent or any representative
thereof has offered or given anything of value to: (i) any official of a
Governmental Authority, any political party or official thereof, or any
candidate for political office; (ii) any customer or member of the government;
or (iii) any other Person, in any such case while knowing or having reason to
know that all or a portion of such money or thing of value may be offered, given
or promised, directly or indirectly, to any customer, member of the government
or candidate for political office for the purpose of the following: (x)
influencing any action or decision of such Person, in his or its official
capacity, including a decision to fail to perform his or its official function;
(y) inducing such Person to use his or its influence with any government or
instrumentality thereof to affect or influence any act or decision of such
government or instrumentality to assist any Chemicon Entity in obtaining or
retaining business for, or with, or directing business to, any Person; or (z)
where such payment would constitute a bribe, kickback or illegal or improper
payment to assist any Chemicon Entity in obtaining or retaining business for, or
with, or directing business to, any Person. The business and operations of each
Chemicon Entity have been conducted in material compliance with all applicable
Laws.

         Knowledge of any acts that furnish a reasonable basis for a Warning
         Letter, untitled letter, Section 305 notice or other similar

         4.       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SEROLOGICALS. Serologicals
hereby represents and warrants to the Shareholder as follows:

                  4.1      Organization, Power and Authority. Each of
Serologicals and Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and each has all requisite
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement, the European
Purchase Agreement, the Indemnification Agreement and the Parent Guaranty (as
the case may be) and each other document contemplated hereby and thereby to
which it is a party. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement,
the European Purchase Agreement and the Indemnification Agreement by
Serologicals and the consummation by Serologicals of the transactions
contemplated herein and therein have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Serologicals. The execution, delivery and
performance of the Parent Guaranty by the Parent and the consummation by the
Parent of the transactions contemplated therein have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Parent. The execution and delivery of
the Parent Guaranty by Parent does not require the authorization, consent or
approval of the stockholders of Serologicals or Parent. This Agreement, the
European Purchase Agreement, the Indemnification Agreement and the Parent
Guaranty and each other document contemplated hereby or thereby have been (or
when executed, will be) duly executed and delivered by Serologicals or Parent
(as the case may be) and constitute, and each instrument delivered pursuant
hereto, when executed and delivered by Serologicals or Parent (as the case may
be) (assuming that each other party thereto executes and delivers such
agreements) will constitute, the legal, valid and binding agreement of
Serologicals or Parent (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar laws affecting creditors' rights and by judicial discretion in the
enforcement of equitable remedies.

                  4.2      No Conflict. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.2, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the European Purchase Agreement and
the Indemnification Agreement by Serologicals and the Parent Guaranty by the
Parent, the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein by
Serologicals, and the performance of the covenants and agreements of
Serologicals contained herein and of Parent contained in the Parent Guaranty
will not, with or without the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both,
(i) violate or conflict with any of the provisions of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Serologicals or Parent, (ii) violate, conflict with
or result in a breach or default or loss of rights under, result in, cause or
create any liability, reassessment or revaluation of assets, or Lien pursuant
to, or cause the termination or acceleration of or give any third party the
right to modify, terminate, or accelerate any obligations under, any term or
condition of any indenture, mortgage, lease, loan agreement, license, permit,
contract, agreement or instrument to which Serologicals or Parent either is a

or conflict with any law, ordinance, rule, order, judgment, decree or ruling of
any Governmental Authority applicable to Serologicals or Parent or any of their
respective assets or properties, (iv) result in the creation or imposition of
any Lien upon any assets or properties of Serologicals or Parent, or (v) except
for approval pursuant to the HSR Act and the FTA, require any

authorization, consent, approval, exemption, or other action by or notice or
declaration to or filing with, any court or administrative or other governmental
body or agency, except in the cases of clauses (ii)-(v), for such violations,
conflicts, breaches, Liens, authorizations, consents or similar matters as to
which requisite waivers or consents will have been obtained prior to the Closing
or which individually, or in the aggregate, would not impair Serologicals'
ability to perform its obligations hereunder or under the European Purchase
Agreement or the Indemnification Agreement or Parent's ability to perform its
obligations under the Parent Guaranty.

                  4.3      Brokers' and Finders' Fees. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.3, neither Parent, Serologicals nor anyone acting on their behalf has
any liability to any party for any brokers' or finders' fees or the like in
connection with this Agreement, the European Purchase Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. The Shareholder will not have any
liability arising from any such action by Parent, Serologicals or anyone acting
on their behalf for any such fees, expenses, or the like in connection with this
Agreement, the European Purchase Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereby or thereby.

                  4.4      Legal Proceedings. There are no suits, actions,
claims, proceedings or investigations pending, or to the knowledge of
Serologicals, threatened against, relating to or affecting Parent, Serologicals
or any of their respective Assets and Properties which could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the consummation of any of the

         with respect to any matter first existing or occurring after the date
         hereof which, if existing or occurring at or prior to the date hereof,

         Agreement as a result of any event, occurrence or item, first occurring

         Serologicals will promptly supplement or amend the Schedules which it

         first existing or occurring after the date hereof which, if existing or

         to be set forth or described in such Schedules or (ii) would have been

         terminate this Agreement as a result of any event, occurrence or item,
         first occurring after the date hereof and set forth on any supplement
         or amendment, such event, occurrence or item set forth on such

                  5.9      Tax Matters.

                           (a)      The Shareholder shall be responsible for the
         preparation and filing of all Tax Returns for each Chemicon Entity that
         are actually filed before the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be
         prepared and filed in a manner consistent with the past practices of
         the Chemicon Entities in preparing their Tax Returns. Serologicals
         shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns
         for each Chemicon Entity that are actually filed after the Closing
         Date. The party responsible for the preparation and filing of a Tax
         Return under this Section 5.9(a) shall submit a draft return to the
         other party within a reasonable period prior to filing and shall make
         such revisions to such Tax Return as are reasonably requested by such
         other party; provided, however, that Serologicals shall not be required
         to seek the Shareholder's comments with respect to Tax Returns covering
         periods beginning after the Closing Date.

                           (b)      Each of the Parties shall cooperate fully,
         as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
         connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section and
         any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
         cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's
         request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
         relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
         employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
         additional information and explanation of any material provided
         hereunder. Serologicals and the Shareholder agree (i) to retain all
         books and records, in their respective possessions or under their
         respective control, with respect to Tax matters pertinent to any
         Chemicon Entity relating to any Taxable period beginning before the
         Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and,
         to the extent notified by Serologicals or the Shareholder, any
         extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by
         all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority,
         and (ii) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
         transferring,

                                     - 48 -

         destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other
         party so requests, to allow such other party to take possession of such
         books and records. The Shareholder further agrees, upon request, to use
         its best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
         governmental authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
         mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including,
         with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). The Shareholder
         further agrees, upon request, to provide Serologicals with all
         information that either party may be required to report pursuant to
         Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury Regulations promulgated
         thereunder.

                           (c)      All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
         stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any
         penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement
         shall be paid by the Shareholder when due, and the Shareholder will, at
         its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
         with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
         registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable
         Law, Serologicals will, and will cause its affiliates to, join in the
         execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

                  5.10     Transfer of Real Estate. Prior to, or concurrent with
the Closing, the Shareholder shall cause Chemicon to purchase and acquire from
Ramona and cause Ramona to sell, transfer, and convey, free and clear of all
Liens, all right, title and interest in and to all real property (the "Ramona
Real Property") and all improvements, furniture and fixtures thereon and all
other assets owned by Ramona as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date.

                  5.11     Insurance. Concurrent with the Closing or immediately
following the Closing, Serologicals shall, or shall cause Chemicon to, obtain
and pay the premium for an extended discovery period endorsement for the product
liability insurance policies maintained by each Chemicon Entity on the date
hereof, with such endorsement being for a period of not less than four years and
being in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Shareholder.

                  8.1      Termination. This Agreement and the European Purchase
Agreement may be terminated at any time at or prior to the Closing (the
"Termination Date"):

                           (a)      in writing by mutual consent of the Parties;

                           (b)      by written notice from Serologicals to the
         Shareholder, if the Shareholder (i) fails to perform in any material
         respect any of its covenants contained in this Agreement or the
         European Purchase Agreement required to be performed by it on or prior
         to the Closing Date or (ii) materially breaches any of its
         representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the
         European Purchase Agreement, which failure or breach is not cured
         within fifteen (15) days after Serologicals has notified the
         Shareholder of Serologicals' intent to terminate this Agreement and the
         European Purchase Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b);

                           (c)      by written notice from the Shareholder to
         Serologicals, if Serologicals (i) fails to perform in any material
         respect any of its covenants contained in this Agreement or the
         European Purchase Agreement required to be performed by it on or prior
         to the Closing Date or (ii) materially breaches any of its
         representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the
         European Purchase Agreement, which failure or breach is not cured
         within fifteen (15) days after the Shareholder has notified
         Serologicals of the Shareholder's intent to terminate this Agreement
         and the European Purchase Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c);

                           (d)      by the Shareholder if any of the conditions
         specified in Sections 6.1 and 6.3 have not been met or waived by the
         Shareholder at such time as such condition can no longer be satisfied
         provided, however, that the Shareholder's right to terminate this
         Agreement and the European Purchase Agreement pursuant to this Section
         8.1(d) shall not be available if the Shareholder is in material breach
         of its obligations under this Agreement or the European Purchase
         Agreement or its failure to fulfill any of

                                     - 54 -

<PAGE>

         its obligations contained in this Agreement or the European Purchase
         Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
         condition to be satisfied;

                           (e)      by Serologicals if any of the conditions
         specified in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have not been met or waived by
         Serologicals at such time as such condition can no longer be satisfied
         provided, however, that Serologicals' right to terminate this Agreement
         and the European Purchase Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)
         shall not be available if Serologicals is in material breach of its
         obligations under this Agreement or the European Purchase Agreement or
         its failure to fulfill any of its obligations contained in this
         Agreement or the European Purchase Agreement has been the cause of, or
         resulted in, the failure of the condition to be satisfied; or

                           (f)      by written notice by the Shareholder to
         Serologicals or by Serologicals to the Shareholder, as the case may be,
         if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to April 30, 2003 for any
         reason other than delay or nonperformance of the Party seeking such
         termination.

                  8.2      Effect of Termination.

                           (a)      Subject to the provisions of Section 8.2(b),
         in the event of termination of this Agreement and the European Purchase
         Agreement pursuant to Section 8, this Agreement and the European
         Purchase Agreement will forthwith become void and there will be no
         liability on the part of any Party or its respective officers,
         directors or stockholders, except for obligations under Sections 5.6
         and 9.13 and this Section and the obligations set out in clause 4.2 of
         the European Purchase Agreement, all of which will survive the
         Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in
         this Agreement will relieve any Party from liability for any breach of
         this Agreement.

                           (b)      In order to induce the Shareholder to enter
         into this Agreement and to reimburse and compensate the Shareholder for
         its time and lost opportunity costs for pursuing the Acquisition,
         Serologicals shall pay to the Shareholder (by wire transfer of
         immediately available funds to an account identified in writing to
         Serologicals by Shareholder) within five Business Days of written
         demand by the Shareholder an amount equal to $5,000,000 if:

                                    (i)      Serologicals terminates this
                  Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) solely because of the
                  failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.2(i) to be
                  satisfied; or

                                    (ii)     Either party terminates this
                  Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) and all of the conditions
                  set forth in Section 6 have been satisfied or waived by the
                  appropriate party other than (A) the condition set forth in
                  Section 6.2(i); (B) the condition set forth in Section 6.2(g)
                  provided that each of the firms indicated in Section 6.2(g)
                  confirm that they would deliver opinions substantially in the
                  forms set forth in Exhibits B, C and D if the Closing were to
                  occur; and (C) the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(h) and
                  6.3(f), provided that the sole reason

                                     - 55 -

<PAGE>

                  for the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in
                  Sections 6.2(h) and 6.3(f) shall be the failure to satisfy the
                  condition set forth in Section 6.2(i).

         The Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the payment of the fee
         provided for in this Section 8.2(b) shall be the sole and exclusive
         remedy for termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 8.1(e) or
         8.1(f) in the event of such termination.

                  8.3      Specific Performance and Other Remedies. The Parties
each acknowledge that the rights of each Party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the European Purchase Agreement are special,
unique and of extraordinary character and that, in the event that any Party
violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by it in
this Agreement or the European Purchase Agreement, the non-breaching Party may
be without an adequate remedy at law. The Parties agree, therefore, that in the
event that any Party violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or
agreement made by such Party in this Agreement or the European Purchase
Agreement, the non-breaching Party may, subject to the terms of this Agreement
and in addition to any remedies at law for damages or other relief, institute
and prosecute an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce
specific performance of such covenant or agreement or seek any other equitable
relief.

                  9.6      Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc. Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably consents and agrees that, except as provided in the next
sentence, any action, suit or proceeding arising in connection with any
disagreement, dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any related document (for purposes of this Section, a "Legal
Dispute") shall be brought only to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
the State of California or the federal courts located in the State of
California, County of San Diego. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the
Parties hereby irrevocably consent and agree that any Legal Dispute with respect
to any claim for indemnification pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement shall
be brought only in such federal or state court to which any third party claims
giving rise to such indemnification has been brought; provided, however, that no
party shall be prevented from raising an objection to subject matter
jurisdiction in such forum. The Parties agree that, after a Legal Dispute is
before a court as specified in this Section 9.6 and during the pendency of such
Legal Dispute before such court, all actions, suits or proceedings with respect
to such Legal Dispute or any other Legal Dispute, including, any counterclaim,
cross-claim or interpleader, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such court. Each of the Parties hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a
defense in any Legal Dispute, that it is not subject thereto or that such
action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such
court (other than as set forth above with respect to subject-matter
jurisdiction)or that its property is exempt or immune from execution, that the
action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue
of the action, suit or proceeding is improper (other than as set forth above
with respect to subject-matter jurisdiction). Each Party hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any action, suit or proceeding described in this Section 9.6
after the expiration of any period permitted for appeal and subject to any stay
during appeal shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Laws. The
provisions of this Section 9.6 are without prejudice to the rights of the
parties to apply to the English Court for interim relief (to include, but not
limited to, injunctions) and to obtain the same in aid of actual or contemplated
proceedings before the courts of the State of California or the federal courts
located in the State of California, San Diego County in connection with the
matters arising from or contemplated in this Agreement, and for the purpose of
an application pursuant to this sentence, the parties hereby submit to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English Court and waive all rights to
challenge such application on grounds of jurisdiction and/or forum non
conveniens. For the purpose of any proceedings pursuant to the preceding
sentence, the Shareholder, the Trust and the Beckmans hereby appoint Minter
Ellison of 10 Dominion Street, London, ECM 2EE to accept service of process on
their behalf, such service to be effected at 10 Dominion Street, London, ECM
2EE.

                  9.7      Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which
is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction will
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
To the extent permitted by law, the Parties waive any provision of law which
renders any such provision prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.
