Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Paragraph&nbsp;I. 2, upon achievement by the Company of EBITDA of at least $131.3&nbsp;million (the "2005 Target") in respect
of the fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2005, all unvested Shares subject to the Performance Vesting Option shall vest on March&nbsp;31, 2006; provided that the Optionee is on March&nbsp;31,
2006, and at all times since the Date of Grant has been, in the employment or service, as the case may be, of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
For purposes of this Annex A, "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>EBITDA</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" for a fiscal year shall have the meaning assigned to it in the Credit Agreement and shall be
subject to adjustment as set forth in the immediately subsequent paragraph; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> that EBITDA shall not include (i)&nbsp;Transaction Payments as
defined in the Credit Agreement and (ii)&nbsp;liability for or payment by the Company or its Subsidiaries of annual retainer to Donaldson, Lufkin&nbsp;&amp; Jenrette Securities Corporation (or any
affiliate or successor thereof). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>II. ADJUSTMENT OF EBITDA TARGETS UPON ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
From time to time, the Board (or the Compensation Committee thereof) may make adjustments in EBITDA for a fiscal year so that extraordinary or unusual charges or credits,
acquisitions, mergers, consolidations, dispositions and other corporate transactions and other elements of or factors influencing the calculation of EBITDA do not distort or affect the operation of
the Plan in a manner inconsistent with its purpose. The good faith decisions of the Board (or, if applicable, the Compensation Committee thereof) as to the computation of EBITDA and other good faith
determinations to be made with respect to the Plan shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company or its Subsidiaries effectuate any acquisitions during a fiscal year, the Floor and Target Amounts set forth in Paragraph&nbsp;I.
2(a) shall be adjusted, effective as of immediately prior to the Performance Vesting Date for such year, by adding to each such amount the product of (1)&nbsp;90% and 100%, respectively, multiplied
by (2)&nbsp;the "Acquisition EBITDA," as defined below, resulting from each acquisition completed during such fiscal year. For this purpose, the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>"Acquisition
EBITDA"</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> resulting from any acquisition shall mean the estimated pro forma EBITDA for the period of the current year after the acquisition and each remaining full year among the
four fiscal years set forth above. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company or its Subsidiaries effectuate any acquisitions prior to December&nbsp;31, 2005, the 2005 Target shall be adjusted by adding to such
amount the pro forma EBITDA which is forecast at the time of acquisition to be generated in fiscal year 2005 by each such acquired property. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company or its Subsidiaries effectuate any disposition during a fiscal year, and if the Disposition Contribution, as defined below, for such
disposition is positive, the Floor and Target Amounts set forth in Paragraph&nbsp;I. 2(a) for the fiscal year in which such disposition occurs and all subsequent fiscal years shall be adjusted,
effective as of immediately prior to the Performance Vesting Date for such year, by multiplying such Floor and Target amounts by the "Disposition Fraction", as defined below, for such disposition. For
this purpose, the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>"Disposition Fraction"</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> for any disposition shall mean a fraction determined by subtracting from 1 a fraction the numerator of which
shall be the Contribution generated by the business disposed of for the fiscal year most recently completed prior to such disposition (the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>"Disposition
Contribution"</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> for such disposition), and the denominator of which shall be the total Contribution of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year most recently
completed prior to such disposition. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the Disposition Contribution is a negative number, the Disposition Fraction shall be deemed to be 1, and no
adjustment shall be made to the Floor and Target Amounts. </FONT></P>

Time, such amount of cash, added to all cash previously received by the DLJ Funds in connection with their investment, equals or exceeds 300% of the DLJ Capital Investment; and (iii)&nbsp;if such
realization occurs on or after the fourth anniversary of the Effective Time, such amount of cash equals or exceeds 400% of the DLJ Capital Investment. </FONT></P>
