         The words and phrases defined in this Article shall have the meaning

                           other person if as a result of such sale, lease,

                           in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock
                           immediately prior to such sale, lease, exchange or
                           other transfer; or

                                   ARTICLE III

                                   ELIGIBILITY

                  The individuals who shall be eligible to receive Options and
Stock Awards shall be those certain employees of the Company or any of its
Affiliates, as the Committee shall determine from time to time, who are not
covered under the terms and limitations of Section 16b of the Exchange Act or
any rules promulgated thereunder. The Board of Directors may designate one or
more individuals who shall not be eligible to receive any Option or Stock Award
under this Plan or under other similar plans of the Company.


                                   ARTICLE IV

             GENERAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO OPTIONS AND STOCK AWARDS

         4.1 AUTHORITY TO GRANT OPTIONS AND STOCK AWARDS. The Committee may
grant to those key Employees of the Company or any of its Affiliates, as it
shall from time to time determine, Options or Stock Awards under the terms and
conditions of this Plan. Subject only to any applicable limitations set out in
this Plan, the number of shares of Stock to be covered by any Option or Stock
Award to be granted to an Employee shall be as determined by the Committee.

         4.2 DEDICATED SHARES. The total number of shares of Stock with respect
to which Options and Stock Awards may be granted under the Plan shall be
4,400,000 shares. The shares


                                      -4-
<PAGE>

may be treasury shares or authorized but unissued shares. The number of shares
stated in this Section 4.2 shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with the
provisions of Section 4.5.

                  In the event that any outstanding Option or Stock Award shall
expire or terminate for any reason or any Option or Stock Award is surrendered,
the shares of Stock allocable to the unexercised portion of that Option or Stock
Award may again be subject to an Option or Stock Award under the Plan. If Stock
is used by the Employee pursuant to Section 5.6 of this Plan to pay the exercise
price of an Option, only the net number of shares of Stock issued by the Company
shall be considered utilized under this Plan. If shares of Stock are withheld by
the Company to pay tax withholding due from the Employee, the number of such
shares withheld shall not be considered utilized under this Plan.

         4.3 NON-TRANSFERABILITY. Options shall not be transferable by the
Employee otherwise than by will or under the laws of descent and distribution,
and shall be exercisable, during the Employee's lifetime, only by him.
Restricted Stock shall be purchased by and/or become vested under a Restricted
Stock Agreement during the Employee's lifetime, only by him. Any attempt to
transfer a Stock Award other than under the terms of the Plan and the Restricted
Stock Agreement shall terminate the Stock Award and all rights of the Employee
to that Restricted Stock. Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the
contrary, an Employee may transfer any Option to an Immediate Family Member or
an entity controlled by the Employee or an Immediate Family Member, provided,
however, no further transfer shall be made except for a transfer back to such
Employee or such other transfer which may be approved by the President of the
Company. For this purpose "Immediate Family Member" means an Employee's
children, grandchildren or spouse, or a trust for the benefit of such Immediate
Family Members.

         4.4 REQUIREMENTS OF LAW. The Company shall not be required to sell or
issue any Stock under any Option or Stock Award if issuing that Stock would
constitute or result in a violation by the Employee or the Company of any
provision of any law, statute, or regulation of any governmental authority.
Specifically, in connection with any applicable statute or regulation relating
to the registration of securities, upon exercise of any Option or pursuant to
any Stock Award, the Company shall not be required to issue any Stock unless the
Committee has received evidence satisfactory to it to the effect that the holder
of that Option or Stock Award will not transfer the Stock except in accordance
with applicable law, including receipt of an opinion of counsel satisfactory to
the Company to the effect that any proposed transfer complies with applicable
law. The determination by the Board on this matter shall be final, binding and
conclusive. The Company may, but shall in no event be obligated to, register any
Stock covered by this Plan pursuant to applicable securities laws of any country
or any political subdivision. In the event the Stock issuable on exercise of an
Option or pursuant to a Stock Award is not registered, the Company may imprint
on the certificate evidencing the Stock any legend that counsel for the Company
considers necessary or advisable to comply with applicable law. The Company
shall not be obligated to take any other affirmative action in order to cause
the exercise of an Option or vesting under a Stock Award, or the issuance of
shares under either of them, to comply with any law or regulation of any
governmental authority.

         4.5 CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The existence of
outstanding Options or Stock Awards shall not affect in any way the right or
power of the Company or its stockholders to make or authorize any or all
adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations or


                                      -5-
<PAGE>

other changes in the Company's capital structure or its business, or any merger
or consolidation of the Company, or any issue of bonds, debentures, preferred or
prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the Stock or its rights, or the
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any
part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding,
whether of a similar character or otherwise.

                  If the Company shall effect a subdivision or consolidation of
shares or other capital readjustment, the payment of a stock dividend, or other
increase or reduction of the number of shares of the Stock outstanding, without
receiving compensation for it in money, services or property, then (a) the
number, class, and per share price of shares of Stock subject to outstanding
Options under this Plan shall be appropriately adjusted in such a manner as to
entitle an Employee to receive upon exercise of an Option, for the same
aggregate cash consideration, the equivalent total number and class of shares he
would have received had he exercised his Option in full immediately prior to the
event requiring the adjustment; and (b) the number and class of shares of Stock
then reserved to be issued under the Plan shall be adjusted by substituting for
the total number and class of shares of Stock then reserved, that number and
class of shares of Stock that would have been received by the owner of an equal
number of outstanding shares of each class of Stock as the result of the event
requiring the adjustment.

                  If while unexercised Options remain outstanding under the Plan
(i) the Company shall not be the surviving entity in any merger, consolidation
or other reorganization (or survives only as a subsidiary of an entity other
than an entity that was wholly-owned by the Company immediately prior to such
merger, consolidation or other reorganization), (ii) the Company sells, leases
or exchanges or agrees to sell, lease or exchange all or substantially all of
its assets to any other person or entity (other than an entity wholly-owned by
the Company), (iii) the Company is to be dissolved, or (iv) the Company is a
party to any other corporate transaction (as defined under Section 424(a) of the
Code and applicable Treasury Regulations) that is not described in clauses (i),
(ii) or (iii) of this sentence (each such event is referred to herein as a
"Corporate Change"), then (x) except as otherwise provided in an Option
Agreement or as a result of the Board's effectuation of one or more of the
alternatives described below, there shall be no acceleration of the time at
which any Option then outstanding may be exercised, and (y) no later than ten
(10) days after the approval by the stockholders of the Company of such
Corporate Change, the Board, acting in its sole and absolute discretion without
the consent or approval of any Optionee, shall act to effect one or more of the
following alternatives, which may vary among individual Optionees and which may
vary among Options held by any individual Optionee:

                  (1) accelerate the time at which some or all of the Options
         then outstanding may be exercised so that such Options may be exercised
         in full for a limited period of time on or before a specified date
         (before or after such Corporate Change) fixed by the Board, after which
         specified date all such Options that remain unexercised and all rights
         of Optionees thereunder shall terminate,

                  (2) require the mandatory surrender to the Company by all or
         selected Optionees of some or all of the then outstanding Options held
         by such Optionees (irrespective of whether such Options are then
         exercisable under the provisions of this Plan or the Option Agreements
         evidencing such Options) as of a date, before


                                      -6-
<PAGE>

         or after such Corporate Change, specified by the Board, in which event
         the Board shall thereupon cancel such Options and the Company shall pay
         to each such Optionee an amount of cash per share equal to the excess,
         if any, of the per share price offered to stockholders of the Company
         in connection with such Corporate Change over the exercise price(s)
         under such Options for such shares,

                  (3) with respect to all or selected Optionees, have some or
         all of their then outstanding Options (whether vested or unvested)
         assumed or have a new Option substituted for some or all of their then
         outstanding Options (whether vested or unvested) by an entity which is
         a party to the transaction resulting in such Corporate Change and which
         is then employing him, or a parent or subsidiary of such entity,
         provided that (A) such assumption or substitution is on a basis where
         the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the shares subject to
         the Option immediately after the assumption or substitution over the
         aggregate exercise price of such shares is equal to the excess of the
         aggregate fair market value of all shares subject to the Option
         immediately before such assumption or substitution over the aggregate
         exercise price of such shares, and (B) the assumed rights under such
         existing Option or the substituted rights under such new Option as the
         case may be will have the same terms and conditions as the rights under
         the existing Option assumed or substituted for, as the case may be,

                  (4) provide that the number and class of shares of Stock
         covered by an Option (whether vested or unvested) theretofore granted
         shall be adjusted so that such Option when exercised shall thereafter
         cover the number and class of shares of stock or other securities or
         property (including, without limitation, cash) to which the Optionee
         would have been entitled pursuant to the terms of the agreement and/or
         plan relating to such Corporate Change if, immediately prior to such
         Corporate Change, the Optionee had been the holder of record of the
         number of shares of Stock then covered by such Option, or

                  (5) make such adjustments to Options then outstanding as the
         Board deems appropriate to reflect such Corporate Change (provided,
         however, that the Board may determine in its sole and absolute
         discretion that no such adjustment is necessary)."

                  In effecting one or more of alternatives (3), (4) or (5)
         above, and except as otherwise may be provided in an Option Agreement,
         the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion and without the consent
         or approval of any Optionee, may accelerate the time at which some or
         all Options then outstanding may be exercised.

                  In the event of changes in the outstanding Stock by reason of
recapitalizations, reorganizations, mergers, consolidations, combinations,
exchanges or other relevant changes in capitalization occurring after the date
of the grant of any Option and not otherwise provided for by this Section 4.5,
any outstanding Options and any agreements evidencing such Options shall be
subject to adjustment by the Board in its sole and absolute discretion as to the
number and price of shares of stock or other consideration subject to such
Options. In the event of any such


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

change in the outstanding Stock, the aggregate number of shares available under
this Plan may be appropriately adjusted by the Board, whose determination shall
be conclusive.

                  After a merger of one or more corporations into the Company or
after a consolidation of the Company and one or more corporations in which the
Company shall be the surviving corporation, each Employee shall be entitled to
have his Restricted Stock appropriately adjusted based on the manner the Stock
was adjusted under the terms of the agreement of merger or consolidation.

                  The issue by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or
securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, for cash or property,
or for labor or services either upon direct sale or upon the exercise of rights
or warrants to subscribe for them, or upon conversion of shares or obligations
of the Company convertible into shares or other securities, shall not affect,
and no adjustment by reason of such issuance shall be made with respect to, the
number, class, or price of shares of Stock then subject to outstanding Options
or Stock Awards.

         4.6 ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(b) OF THE CODE. No Employee shall
exercise the election permitted under Section 83(b) of the Code under this Plan
without written approval of the Committee.


                                    ARTICLE V

                                     OPTIONS

         5.1 OPTION PRICE. The price at which shares of Stock may be purchased
under an Option shall be the Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock on the
date the Option is granted, unless the Committee in its sole discretion provides
otherwise in the Option Agreement.

         5.2 DURATION OF OPTIONS. No Option shall be exercisable after the
expiration of 10 years from the date the Option is granted.

         5.3 AMOUNT EXERCISABLE. Each Option is exercisable, in whole or in
part, in the manner and subject to the conditions the Committee, in its sole
discretion, may provide in the Option Agreement, as long as the Option is valid
and outstanding.

         5.4 EXERCISE OF OPTIONS. Each Option shall be exercised by the delivery
of written notice to the Committee setting forth the number of shares of Stock
with respect to which the Option is to be exercised, together with: (a) cash,
certified check, bank draft, or postal or express money order payable to the
order of the Company for an amount equal to the option price of the shares, (b)
Mature Shares at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise, (c) payment to
the Company, through a broker-assisted exercise that is approved by the
Committee, for an amount equal to the option price of the shares and the
Company's tax withholding obligation, if any, (d) any combination of (a), (b),
or (c), and/or (e) any other form of payment which is acceptable to the
Committee, and specifying the address to which the certificates for the shares
are to be mailed.


                                      -8-
<PAGE>


                  As promptly as practicable after receipt of written
notification and payment, the Company shall deliver to the Employee certificates
for the number of shares with respect to which the Option has been exercised,
issued in the Employee's name. If Mature Shares are used in payment, the
aggregate Fair Market Value of the Mature Shares tendered must be equal to or
less than the aggregate exercise price of the shares being purchased upon
exercise of the Option, and any difference must be paid by cash, certified
check, bank draft, or postal or express money order payable to the order of the
Company. Delivery of the shares shall be deemed effected for all purposes when a
stock transfer agent of the Company shall have deposited the certificates in the
United States mail, addressed to the Employee, at the address specified by the
Employee.

                  Whenever an Option is exercised by exchanging Mature Shares
owned by the Employee, the Employee shall deliver to the Company certificates
registered in the name of the Employee representing a number of Mature Shares
legally and beneficially owned by the Employee, free of all liens, claims, and
encumbrances of every kind, accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in blank
by the record holder of the shares represented by the certificates (with
signature guaranteed by a commercial bank or trust company or by a brokerage
firm having a membership on a registered national stock exchange). The delivery
of certificates upon the exercise of Options is subject to the condition that
the person exercising the Option provide the Company with the information the
Company might reasonably request pertaining to exercise, sale or other
disposition. The Committee may provide that a legend or restriction be printed
on the certificate as the Committee determines is necessary, in its discretion,
to comply with applicable laws.

                  If Mature Shares are used in payment, the aggregate Fair
Market Value of the Mature Shares tendered must be equal to or less than the
aggregate exercise price of the Shares being purchased upon exercise of the
Option, and any difference must be paid by cash, certified check, bank draft, or
postal or express money order payable to the order of the Company. Delivery of
the Common Stock issued on exercise shall be deemed effective for all purposes
when a stock transfer agent of the Company shall have deposited the certificates
in the United States mail, addressed to the Optionee, at the address specified
by the Optionee.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Optionee may elect, subject
to the approval of the Committee, to satisfy any required income tax withholding
obligation, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold whole shares of
Common Stock, which otherwise would be issued on exercise, having a Fair Market
Value not in excess of the amount of the Company's minimum tax withholding
obligation.

                  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Committee
shall have the authority to cause an Optionee to utilize a different method of
exercise if the method selected by the Optionee could result in adverse
accounting treatment for the Company.

         5.5 EXERCISE ON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. Unless it is expressly
provided otherwise in the Option Agreement, Options shall terminate one day less
than three months after severance of employment of the Employee from the Company
and all Affiliates for any reason, with or without cause, other than death,
retirement under the then established rules of the Company, or severance for
disability. Whether authorized leave of absence or absence on


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

military or government service shall constitute severance of the employment of
the Employee shall be determined by the Committee at that time.

                  In determining the employment relationship between the Company
and the Employee, employment by any Affiliate shall be considered employment by
the Company, as shall employment by a corporation issuing or assuming a stock
option in a transaction to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, or by a
parent corporation or subsidiary corporation of the corporation issuing or
assuming a stock option (and for this purpose, the phrase "corporation issuing
or assuming a stock option" shall be substituted for the word "Company" in the
definitions of parent corporation and subsidiary corporation in Section 2.1, and
the parent-subsidiary relationship shall be determined at the time of the
corporate action described in Section 424(a) of the Code).

                  DEATH. If, before the expiration of an Option, the Employee,
whether in the employ of the Company or after he has retired or was severed for
disability, dies, the Option shall become fully vested and shall continue until
the earlier of the Option's expiration date or one year following the date of
his death, unless it is expressly provided otherwise in the Option Agreement.
After the death of the Employee, his executors, administrators or any persons to
whom his Option may be transferred by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution shall have the right, at any time prior to the Option's expiration
or termination, whichever is earlier, to exercise the Option in full unless it
is expressly provided otherwise in the Option Agreement.

                  RETIREMENT. Unless it is expressly provided otherwise in the
Option Agreement, if before the expiration of an Option, the Employee shall be
retired in good standing from the employ of the Company under the then
established rules of the Company, the Option shall terminate on the earlier of
the Option's expiration date or one year after his retirement. In the event of
retirement, the Employee shall have the right prior to the termination of the
Option to exercise the Option, to the extent to which he was entitled to
exercise it immediately prior to his retirement, unless it is expressly provided
otherwise in the Option Agreement.

                  DISABILITY. If, before the expiration of an Option, the
Employee shall be severed from the employ of the Company for disability, the
Option shall terminate on the earlier of the Option's expiration date or one
year after the date he was severed because of disability, unless it is expressly
provided otherwise in the Option Agreement. In the event that the Employee shall
be severed from the employ of the Company for disability, the Employee shall
become fully vested in his Option and have the right prior to the termination of
the Option to exercise the Option in full unless it is expressly provided
otherwise in the Option Agreement.

                  Notwithstanding the above, an Option may be amended by the
Committee to extend the termination date of the Option, provided such extension
shall not exceed a period of 10 years from the date of the initial grant of the
Option.

         5.6 SUBSTITUTION OPTIONS. Options may be granted under this Plan from
time to time in substitution for stock options held by employees of other
corporations who are about to become employees of or affiliated with the Company
or any Affiliate as the result of a merger or consolidation of the employing
corporation with the Company or any Affiliate, or the acquisition by the Company
or any Affiliate of the assets of the employing corporation, or the acquisition
by

                                      -10-
<PAGE>


the Company or any Affiliate of stock of the employing corporation as the result
of which it becomes an Affiliate of the Company. The terms and conditions of the
substitute Options granted may vary from the terms and conditions set out in
this Plan to the extent the Committee, at the time of grant, may deem
appropriate to conform, in whole or in part, to the provisions of the stock
options in substitution for which they are granted.

         5.7 NO RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER. No Employee shall have any rights as a
stockholder with respect to Stock covered by his Option until the date a stock
certificate is issued for the Stock.


                                   ARTICLE VI

                                  STOCK AWARDS

         6.1 STOCK AWARDS. The Committee may issue shares of Restricted Stock to
an eligible employee subject to the terms of a Restricted Stock Agreement. The
Restricted Stock may be issued for no payment by the Employee or for a payment
below the Fair Market Value on the date of grant. Restricted Stock shall be
subject to restrictions as to sale, transfer, alienation, pledge or other
encumbrance and generally will be subject to vesting over a period of time
specified in the Restricted Stock Agreement. The Committee shall determine the
period of vesting, the number of shares, the price, if any, of Stock included in
a Stock Award, and the other terms and provisions which are included in a
Restricted Stock Agreement. In the discretion of the Committee, a Restricted
Stock Award may be made as a grant of Restricted Stock or as a right to receive
stock (or their cash equivalent or a combination of both) in the future.

         6.2 RESTRICTIONS. Restricted Stock shall be subject to the terms and
conditions as determined by the Committee, including without limitation any or
all of the following:

                  (a) a prohibition against the sale, transfer, alienation,
pledge or other encumbrance of the shares of Restricted Stock, such prohibition
to lapse at such time or times as the Committee shall determine (whether in
annual or more frequent installments, at the time of the death, disability or
retirement of the holder of such shares, or otherwise);

                  (b) a requirement that the holder of shares of Restricted
Stock forfeit, or in the case of shares sold to an Employee, resell back to the
Company at his cost, all or a part of such shares in the event of termination of
the holder's employment during any period in which the shares remain subject to
restrictions;

                  (c) a prohibition against employment of the holder of
Restricted Stock by any competitor of the Company or its Affiliates, or against
such holder's dissemination of any secret or confidential information belonging
to the Company or an Affiliate;

                  (d) unless stated otherwise in the Restricted Stock Agreement,
(i) if restrictions remain at the time of severance of employment with the
Company and all Affiliates, other than for reason of disability or death, the
Restricted Stock shall be forfeited; and (ii) if severance of employment is by
reason of disability or death, the restrictions on the shares shall


                                      -11-
<PAGE>

lapse and the Employee or his heirs or estate shall be 100% vested in the shares
subject to the Restricted Stock Agreement.

         Notwithstanding (a) above, an Employee may transfer Restricted Stock to
an Immediate Family Member (as defined in Section 4.3) or an entity controlled
by the Employee or an Immediate Family Member provided, however, no further
transfer shall be made except for a transfer back to such Employee or such other
transfer which may be approved by the President of the Company. For this
purpose, "Immediate Family Member" means an Employee's children, grandchildren
or spouse, or a trust for the benefit of such Immediate Family Member.

         6.3 STOCK CERTIFICATE. Shares of Restricted Stock shall be registered
in the name of the Employee receiving the Stock Award and deposited, together
with a stock power endorsed in blank, with the Company. Each such certificate
shall bear a legend in substantially the following form:

         The transferability of this certificate and the shares of Stock
         represented by it is restricted by and subject to the terms and
         conditions (including conditions of forfeiture) contained in the
         Bindview Development Corporation 2000 Employee Incentive Plan, and an
         agreement entered into between the registered owner and the Company,
         including any shareholders agreement. A copy of the Plan and agreement
         is on file in the office of the Secretary of the Company.

         6.4 RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Plan, each Employee receiving a certificate for Restricted Stock shall have all
the rights of a stockholder with respect to the shares of Stock included in the
Stock Award during any period in which such shares are subject to forfeiture and
restrictions on transfer, including without limitation, the right to vote such
shares. Dividends paid with respect to shares of Restricted Stock in cash or
property other than stock in the Company or rights to acquire stock in the
Company shall be paid to the Employee currently. Dividends paid in stock in the
Company or rights to acquire stock in the Company shall be added to and become a
part of the Restricted Stock.

         6.5 LAPSE OF RESTRICTIONS. At the end of the time period during which
any shares of Restricted Stock are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on
sale, transfer, alienation, pledge, or other encumbrance, such shares shall vest
and will be delivered in a certificate, free of all restrictions, to the
Employee or to the Employee's legal representative, beneficiary or heir;
provided the certificate shall bear such legend, if any, as the Committee
determines is reasonably required by applicable law. By accepting a Stock Award
and executing a Restricted Stock Agreement, the Employee agrees to remit when
due any federal and state income and employment taxes required to be withheld.

         6.6 RESTRICTION PERIOD. No Stock Award may provide for restrictions
continuing beyond 10 years from the date of the Stock Award.

                                 ADMINISTRATION

                  This Plan shall be administered by the Committee. All
questions of interpretation and application of the Plan, Options or Stock Awards
shall be subject to the determination of the Committee. A majority of the
members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum. All determinations of the
Committee shall be made by a majority of its members. Any decision or
determination reduced to writing and signed by a majority of the members shall
be as effective as if it had been made by a majority vote at a meeting properly
called and held. This Plan shall be administered in such a manner as to permit
the Options granted under it which are designated to be Incentive Options to
qualify as Incentive Options. In carrying out its authority under this Plan, the
Committee shall have full and final authority and discretion, including but not
limited to the following rights, powers and authorities, to:

         (a) determine the Employees to whom and the time or times at which
Options or Stock Awards will be made,

         (b) determine the number of shares and the purchase price of Stock
covered in each Option or Stock Award, subject to the terms of the Plan,

         (c) determine the terms, provisions and conditions of each Option and
Stock Award, which need not be identical,

         (d) accelerate the time at which any outstanding Option may be
exercised,

         (e) define the effect, if any, on an Option or Stock Award of the
death, disability, retirement, or termination of employment of the Employee,

         (f) prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to
administration of the Plan, and

         (g) make all other determinations and take all other actions deemed
necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the proper administration of this Plan.

The actions of the Committee in exercising all of the rights, powers, and
authorities set out in this Article and all other Articles of this Plan, when
performed in good faith and in its sole judgment, shall be final, conclusive and
binding on all parties.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                        AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF PLAN

                  The Board of Directors of the Company may amend, terminate or
suspend this Plan at any time, in its sole and absolute discretion. The Board
shall have the power to make any changes in the Plan and in the regulations and
administrative provisions under it as in the opinion of counsel for the Company
may be necessary or appropriate from time to time.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS


         9.1 NO ESTABLISHMENT OF A TRUST FUND. No property shall be set aside
nor shall a trust fund of any kind be established to secure the rights of any
Employee under this Plan. All Employees shall at all times rely solely upon the
general credit of the Company for the payment of any benefit which becomes
payable under this Plan.

         9.2 NO EMPLOYMENT OBLIGATION. The granting of any Option or Stock Award
shall not constitute an employment contract, express or implied, nor impose upon
the Company or any Affiliate any obligation to employ or continue to employ any
Employee. The right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate the employment
of any person shall not be diminished or affected by reason of the fact that an
Option or Stock Award has been granted to him.

         9.3 FORFEITURE. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan, if
the Committee finds by a majority vote after full consideration of the facts
that the Employee, before or after termination of his employment with the
Company or an Affiliate for any reason (a) committed or engaged in fraud,
embezzlement, theft, commission of a felony, or proven dishonesty in the course
of his employment by the Company or an Affiliate, which conduct damaged the
Company or Affiliate, or disclosed trade secrets of the Company or an Affiliate,
or (b) participated, engaged in or had a material, financial or other interest,
whether as an employee, officer, director, consultant, contractor, stockholder,
owner, or otherwise, in any commercial endeavor which is competitive with the
business of the Company or an Affiliate without the written consent of the
Company or Affiliate, the Employee shall forfeit all outstanding Options and all
outstanding Restricted Stock, and including all exercised Options and other
situations pursuant to which the Company has not yet delivered a stock
certificate. Clause (b) shall not be deemed to have been violated solely by
reason of the Employee's ownership of stock or securities of any publicly owned
corporation, if that ownership does not result in effective control of the
corporation.

                  The decision of the Committee as to the cause of the
Employee's discharge, the damage done to the Company or an Affiliate, and the
extent of the Employee's competitive activity shall be final. No decision of the
Committee, however, shall affect the finality of the discharge of the Employee
by the Company or an Affiliate in any manner.

         9.4 TAX WITHHOLDING. The Company or any Affiliate shall be entitled to
deduct from other compensation payable to each Employee any sums required by
federal, state, or local tax law to be withheld with respect to the grant or
exercise of an Option or lapse of restrictions on Restricted Stock. In the
alternative, the Company may require the Employee (or other person exercising
the Option or receiving the Restricted Stock) to pay the sum directly to the
employer corporation. If the Employee (or other person exercising the Option or
receiving the Restricted Stock) is required to pay the sum directly, payment in
cash or by check of such sums for taxes shall be delivered within 10 days after
the date of exercise or lapse of restrictions. The Company shall have no
obligation upon exercise of any Option or lapse of restrictions on Restricted
Stock until payment has been received, unless withholding (or offset against a
cash payment) as of or


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

prior to the date of exercise or lapse of restrictions is sufficient to cover
all sums due with respect to that exercise. The Company and its Affiliates shall
not be obligated to advise an Employee of the existence of the tax or the amount
which the employer corporation will be required to withhold.

         9.5 WRITTEN AGREEMENT. Each Option and Stock Award shall be embodied in
a written Option Agreement or Restricted Stock Agreement which shall be subject
to the terms and conditions of this Plan and shall be signed by the Employee and
by a member of the Committee on behalf of the Board and the Company or an
executive officer of the Company other than the Employee on behalf of the
Company. The Option Agreement or Restricted Stock Agreement may contain any
other provisions that the Committee in its discretion shall deem advisable which
are not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan. This Plan and all shares of
stock or stock equivalents granted pursuant hereto shall be subject to the terms
of any shareholders agreement entered into by the Company concurrent, or prior
to, the grant of any Option hereunder.

         9.6 INDEMNIFICATION OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. With
respect to administration of this Plan, the Company shall indemnify each present
and future member of the Committee and the Board of Directors against, and each
member of the Committee and the Board of Directors shall be entitled without
further act on his part to indemnity from the Company for, all expenses
(including attorney's fees, the amount of judgments and the amount of approved
settlements made with a view to the curtailment of costs of litigation, other
than amounts paid to the Company itself) reasonably incurred by him in
connection with or arising out of any action, suit, or proceeding in which he
may be involved by reason of his being or having been a member of the Committee
and/or the Board of Directors, whether or not he continues to be a member of the
Committee and/or the Board of Directors at the time of incurring the expenses --
including, without limitation, matters as to which he shall be finally adjudged
in any action, suit or proceeding to have been found to have been negligent in
the performance of his duty as a member of the Committee or the Board of
Directors. However, this indemnity shall not include any expenses incurred by
any member of the Committee and/or the Board of Directors in respect of matters
as to which he shall be finally adjudged in any action, suit or proceeding to
have been guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of
his duty as a member of the Committee and the Board of Directors. In addition,
no right of indemnification under this Plan shall be available to or enforceable
by any member of the Committee and the Board of Directors unless, within 60 days
after institution of any action, suit or proceeding, he shall have offered the
