<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GUARANTEE dated as of this 12<SUP>th</SUP> day of November, 2002, by TELEPHONE AND DATA SYSTEMS,&nbsp;INC., a Delaware corporation (with its successors,
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Guarantor</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), for the benefit of JPMORGAN CHASE BANK (with its successors and assigns, "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Beneficiary</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
TDSI Corporation, a Delaware corporation (with its successors, "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Obligor</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), is a 100%-owned subsidiary of Guarantor; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Obligor has entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of the date hereof, between Obligor and Beneficiary (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Stock Purchase
Agreement</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") pursuant to which Obligor and Beneficiary have agreed to sell and purchase certain ordinary shares, no par value, of Deutsche Telekom AG, a German stock corporation
(the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Issuer</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), or security entitlement in respect thereof (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Ordinary Shares</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), at the time and on
the terms set forth therein; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
pursuant to the Pledge Agreement dated as of the date hereof among Obligor, Beneficiary and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Collateral Agent (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Pledge
Agreement</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), Obligor has granted to Beneficiary, as of the date hereof, a security interest in certain Ordinary Shares to secure the obligations of Obligor under the Stock
Purchase Agreement; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Guarantor agrees as follows: </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>ARTICLE 1<BR>
Guarantee  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.01.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarantee.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Guarantor hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantees the full and punctual payment when due of any and all obligations of Obligor (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Obligations</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") under the Stock Purchase Agreement and the
Pledge Agreement, each as may be further modified, amended or supplemented from time to time (collectively, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Agreements</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Upon failure by the
Obligor to pay punctually any Obligation, the Guarantor shall forthwith on demand pay the amount not so paid at the place and in the manner specified in the instrument evidencing such Obligation.
Guarantor's obligations under this Guarantee shall be subject to Obligor's defenses and rights to set-off, counterclaim or withhold payment as provided in the Agreements. Guarantor agrees
to pay on demand any and all fees, funding and other costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses) incurred by Beneficiary in connection with enforcing any rights or
collecting any amounts or deliveries under the Agreements. Any amounts or deliveries that would be owed or due by Obligor to Beneficiary under the Agreements but are unenforceable or not allowable
against Obligor because Obligor is the subject of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar case or proceeding, shall nonetheless be deemed owed or due for the purposes of this
Article&nbsp;1. Beneficiary shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Obligations in the event Obligor becomes subject to a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar case or
proceeding, and the failure by Beneficiary to so file shall not affect Guarantor's obligations hereunder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Article&nbsp;1 is a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection. Guarantor agrees that Beneficiary may resort to Guarantor for payment of any of the
Obligations, whether or not Beneficiary shall have realized against or applied, or attempted (except as provided below) to realize against or apply, any property provided by an entity as collateral
security or other credit support for the Obligations (such property and credit support collectively, "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Security</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") or proceeded or attempted to </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;proceed
against Obligor or any other entity principally or secondarily obligated with respect to the Obligations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarantor's
obligations under this Article&nbsp;1 shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Beneficiary agrees that it will not make a demand or claim under this Guarantee in respect of any Secured Portion of the Obligations
unless Beneficiary has first used commercially reasonable efforts, for at least five Business Days, to realize against or apply property held as Collateral (as defined in the Pledge Agreement) under
the Pledge Agreement in satisfaction of the Obligations. "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Secured Portion</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" means, at any time, a portion of the Obligations consisting of the obligation
to deliver cash or property with a value, as determined by the Calculation Agent (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement), equal to the value, as determined by the Calculation Agent in a
consistent manner, of the Collateral then pledged to the Beneficiary under the Pledge Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarantor
hereby waives any right to revoke this guarantee, and acknowledges that its obligations under this Article&nbsp;1 are continuing in nature and apply to all

hereby waives (i)&nbsp;any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by Beneficiary that in any manner impairs,
