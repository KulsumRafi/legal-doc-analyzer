terminate his employment with the Corporation for Good Reason as defined in
Section&nbsp;4(d) above, he may apply in writing to the Corporation for confirmation
of such entitlement prior to the Executive&#146;s actual separation from employment,
by following the claims procedure set forth in Section&nbsp;10 hereof. The
submission of such a request by an Executive shall not constitute &#147;Cause&#148; for
the Corporation to terminate an Executive under Section&nbsp;4(c) hereof; and
Executive shall continue to receive all compensation and benefits he was
receiving at the time of such submission throughout the resolution of the
matter pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;10 hereof. If the

within ninety (90)&nbsp;days after the claim is submitted to binding arbitration
pursuant to Section&nbsp;10(d).

by the Corporation or by the Executive (other than termination based on the
Executive&#146;s death) following a Change in Control shall be communicated by a

Agreement, a &#147;Notice of Termination&#148; shall mean a notice which shall indicate
the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set
forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a
basis for termination of the Executive&#146;s employment under the provision so
indicated. For purposes of this Agreement, no purported termination shall be
effective without the delivery of such Notice of Termination.

Control shall mean (i)&nbsp;if the Executive is terminated by his death, the date of

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination Benefits.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Executive shall be terminated from employment with the Corporation
as described in Section&nbsp;4(a) such that Executive is entitled to the
compensation set forth in this Section&nbsp;5, then the Executive shall be entitled
to receive the following severance benefits:
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp; Severance Payment. In lieu of any further payments to the Executive
including any payments to which the Executive would be entitled under any
existing employment agreement, the Corporation shall pay as severance pay to
the Executive an amount equal to the compensation that Executive would have
received for a thirty (30)&nbsp;month period (the &#147;payment period&#148;) at an annualized
rate equal to the higher of the rate in effect immediately prior to the Change
in Control or the rate in effect on the date of the Notice of Termination.
Such cash payment shall be payable in a single sum, within 10 business days
following the Executive&#146;s Date of Termination.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp; Incentive Awards. The Executive shall receive a cash payment in a
single sum, within 10 business days following the Executive&#146;s Date of
Termination, in the amount equal to the pro rata portion of any bonus the
Executive shall be deemed to have earned under any incentive or compensation
plan in which Executive is then participating for the year in which the
Executive&#146;s termination occurs based on the number of completed months (a
partial month shall be counted as a completed month) in the calendar year as of
his Date of Termination. The method of calculating any bonus under such plan
shall be adjusted and/or weighted in such manner as is appropriate and
equitable to reflect partial year results and the Corporation&#146;s historical
operating results, including rates of growth and seasonality.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp; Stock Options. Any non-vested stock options granted to the Executive
by the Corporation shall become 100% vested without change to the stated
expiration dates thereof.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp; Insurance and Welfare Benefits. During the payment period the
Executive shall be entitled to the continuation of the same or equivalent life,
health, hospitalization, dental and disability insurance coverage and other
employee insurance or welfare benefits that he had received (including
equivalent coverage for his spouse and dependent children) immediately prior to
the Change in Control. In the event that Executive is ineligible under the
terms of such insurance to continue to be so covered, the Corporation shall
provide the Executive with substantially equivalent coverage through other
sources or will provide Executive with a lump sum payment equal to the cost of
obtaining such coverage for the payment period. If the Executive prior to a
Change in Control was receiving any cash-in-lieu payments designed to enable
the Executive to obtain insurance coverage of his choosing, the Corporation
shall, in addition to any other benefits to be provided under this Section
5(d), provide Executive with a lump-sum payment equal to the amount of such
in-lieu payments that the Executive would have been entitled to receive over
the payment period. The benefits to be provided under this Section&nbsp;5(d) shall
be reduced to the extent of the receipt of substantially equivalent coverage by
the Executive from any successor employer.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp; Tax Gross-Up. If any payments received by Executive pursuant to this
Agreement will be subject to the excise tax (the &#147;Excise Tax&#148;) imposed by
Section&nbsp;4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), or
any successor or similar provision of the Code, the Corporation shall pay to
the Executive additional compensation such that the net amount received by the
Executive after deduction of any Excise Tax (and

<P><FONT size="2">taking into account any
federal, state and local income taxes payable by the Executive as a result of
the receipt of such gross-up compensation), shall be equal to the total
payments he would have received had no such Excise Tax (or any interest or
penalties thereon) been paid or incurred. The Corporation shall pay such
additional compensation at the time when the Corporation withholds such Excise
Tax from any payments to the Executive. The calculation of the tax gross-up
payment shall be approved by the Corporation&#146;s independent certified public
accounting firm and the Executive&#146;s designated financial adviser.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Mitigation.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payments
provided for by this Agreement by seeking employment or otherwise, nor shall
the amount of any cash payments or benefit provided under this Agreement be
reduced by any compensation or benefit earned by the Executive after his Date
of Termination (except as provided in Section&nbsp;5(d) above).
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successors.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp; The Corporation shall require any successor (whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Corporation, by
agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Executive, to
expressly assume and agree to perform the obligations of the Corporation under
this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Corporation
would be required to perform this Agreement if no such succession had taken
place. Failure of the Corporation to obtain such agreement prior to the
effective date of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and
shall entitle the Executive to compensation from the Corporation in the same
amount and on the same terms as he would be entitled to receive hereunder if he
terminated his employment for Good Reason, except that for purposes of
implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes
effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination. As used in this Agreement,
&#147;Corporation&#148; shall mean the Corporation as hereinbefore defined and any
successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid, which successor executes
and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section&nbsp;7(a) or which otherwise
becomes bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of
law.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp; This Agreement and all rights of the Executive hereunder shall inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive&#146;s personal or legal
representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees,
devisees and legatees. If the Executive should die after his termination while
any amounts would still be payable to him hereunder if he had continued to
live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive&#146;s devisee,
legatee, or other designee or, if there be no such designee, to the Executive&#146;s
estate.

determinations as to the right of any person to receive benefits under
subsections (b)&nbsp;and (c)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;10. Any denial by the Administrator of
a claim for benefits by the Executive, his heirs or personal representative
(&#147;the claimant&#148;) shall be stated in writing by the Administrator and delivered
or mailed to the claimant within 10&nbsp;days after receipt of the claim, unless
special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim.
If such an extension is required, written notice of the extension shall be
furnished to the claimant prior to the termination of the initial 10-day
period. In no event shall such extension exceed a period of 10&nbsp;days from the
end of the initial period. Any notice of denial shall set forth the specific
reasons for the denial, specific reference to pertinent provisions of this
Agreement upon which the denial is based, a description of any additional
material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect his claim, with
an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and any
explanation of claim review procedures, written to the best of the
Administrator&#146;s ability in a manner that may be understood without legal or
actuarial counsel.

denied by the Administrator may request, within 10&nbsp;days following the date of
such denial, in a writing addressed to the Administrator, a review of such
denial. The claimant shall be entitled to submit such issues or comments in
writing or otherwise as he shall consider relevant to a determination of his
claim, and he may include a request for a hearing in person before the
Administrator. Prior to submitting his request, the claimant shall be entitled
to review such documents as the Administrator shall agree are pertinent to his
claim. The claimant may, at all stages of review, be represented by counsel,
legal or otherwise, of his choice, provided that the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be borne by the claimant, unless the claimant is successful, in
which case, such costs shall be borne by the Corporation. All requests for
review shall be promptly resolved. The Administrator&#146;s decision with respect
to any such review shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the
claimant not later than 10&nbsp;days following receipt by the Administrator of the
claimant&#146;s request unless special circumstances, such as the need to hold a
hearing, require an extension of time for processing, in which case the
Administrator&#146;s decision shall be so mailed not later than 20&nbsp;days after
receipt of such request.

of this section, but who has not obtained full relief on his claim for
benefits, may, within 60&nbsp;days following his receipt of the Administrator&#146;s
written decision on review, apply in writing to the Administrator for expedited
and binding arbitration of his claim before an arbitrator in Minnehaha County,
South Dakota, in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the
American Arbitration Association, as then in effect, or pursuant to such other
form of alternative dispute resolution as the parties may agree (collectively,
the &#147;arbitration&#148;). The Corporation shall advance filing fees and other costs
required to initiate the arbitration, as well as up to $2,500 for Executive&#146;s
initial attorney fees (which fees and costs shall not be recoverable by the
Corporation). The arbitrator&#146;s sole authority shall be to interpret and apply
the provisions of this Agreement; he shall not change, add to, or subtract
from, any of its provisions. The arbitrator shall have the power to compel
attendance of witnesses at the hearing. Any court having jurisdiction may
enter a judgment based upon such arbitration. The arbitrator shall be
appointed by mutual agreement of the Corporation and the claimant pursuant to
the applicable commercial arbitration rules. The arbitrator shall be a
professional person with a reputation in the community for expertise in
employee benefit matters and who is unrelated to the claimant and any employees
of the Corporation. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding
on the claimant and the Corporation.
