and costs of any and all description and type in and related to entering into
this Agreement and performance of the Services, including but not limited to
salaries, taxes, benefits and expenses of its employees plus all overhead; all
fees and expenses of its agents, subcontractors and the like, if any; fees for
necessary or appropriate licenses and permits, if any, and all out-of-pocket
expenses and other costs, including, but not limited to, travel, hotels, meals,
photocopying, messenger, telephone, delivery and similar items. The fees

charge or credit, such party shall notify the other party of such dispute as
soon as practicable after the discrepancy has been discovered. The parties
shall investigate and seek to resolve the dispute in good faith pursuant to

Client is in good faith disputing any amount alleged by Crowe Chizek to be due
and payable, Crowe Chizek will have the right to suspend performance of the
Services, pending the resolution of such dispute. Immediately following the
payment by Client of any amount agreed by the parties or judicially determined
to be payable by Client, Crowe Chizek shall re-commence the performance of the

<P><FONT size="2">If such a change is requested by either party,
Crowe Chizek shall inform Client in writing if such change would result in a

</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp; Upon delivery by Crowe Chizek of a Deliverable to Client in accordance
with a Binding Request for Services, Client shall have thirty (30)&nbsp;days from
the date of receipt of the Deliverable (or such longer period as may be set
forth in the applicable Binding Request for Services) to evaluate, review and
test such Deliverable (&#147;Test Period&#148;) in accordance with the specifications and
test criteria set forth in the applicable Binding Request for Services. In the
event that Client believes that a Deliverable does not conform to the
specifications or the test criteria set forth in the applicable Binding Request
for Services, then Client shall notify Crowe Chizek in writing within the Test
Period setting forth the reason or reasons why Client believes that such
Deliverable does not conform. Client shall identify all non-conformities
within a single written notice of rejection, unless a non-conformity prevents
Client from evaluating, reviewing and testing the entire Deliverable. Client
may reject a Deliverable only for its failure materially to conform to either
the specifications or test criteria set forth in the Binding Request for
Services. Further, if Crowe Chizek has not received a written notice of
rejection of a Deliverable within the Test Period, then such Deliverable shall
be deemed to be accepted by Client. If Client delivers to Crowe Chizek written
notice of rejection of a Deliverable within the Test Period, then Crowe Chizek
shall have thirty (30)&nbsp;days from the date of receipt of a written notice of
rejection either (i)&nbsp;to correct the non-conformities that Client identifies in
the written notice or (ii)&nbsp;to develop a plan mutually agreeable to Client and
Crowe Chizek to correct the non-conformities that Client identified in the
written notice within a period of time agreed to by the parties in the plan,
but in no event will such period of time be less than thirty (30)&nbsp;days. Crowe
Chizek shall correct such non-conformities and, upon correction, Crowe Chizek
will resubmit the corrected Deliverable to Client for evaluation, review, and
testing and the procedure set forth above shall be repeated. Such procedure
shall continue until the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the expiration of the Test Period
without delivery of a written notice of rejection by Client, or (ii)&nbsp;the date
written notice of acceptance is delivered to Crowe Chizek by Client (&#147;Date of
Acceptance&#148;); <I>provided, however</I>, that in the event Client provides written
notice of rejection of the Deliverable after either the initial or any
subsequent thirty (30)&nbsp;day time period or the initial or any subsequent time
period agreed to by the parties for failure to correct a material
non-conformity previously identified, then Client may send Crowe Chizek a
notice of default pursuant to Section&nbsp;12(c). However, if Client rejects a
Deliverable after either the initial or any subsequent thirty (30)&nbsp;day time
period or the initial or any subsequent time period agreed to by the parties
based upon a non-conformity not previously identified by the Client then the
procedure set forth above shall be repeated to permit Crowe Chizek to correct
such non-conformity before Client may send a notice of default.

binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, except that any affiliate of Client that
enters into a Binding Request for Services with Crowe Chizek or for which Crowe
Chizek performs Services pursuant to a Binding Request for Services,
notwithstanding that such affiliate is not a party thereto) will be a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement as it relates to such Binding Request for
Services. Crowe Chizek shall not assign this Agreement or any part hereof,
including the delegation of duties or assignment of any benefits hereunder (by
operation of law or otherwise), or sublet or subcontract to another any part of
the Service to be performed hereunder, or undergo a change of control (which
shall mean a 25% or greater change in the ownership interests of Crowe Chizek
based on the ownership structure on the date hereof), without the prior written
consent of Client, which Client may in its sole discretion withhold; provided,
however, with respect to a change of control event, Client&#146;s consent will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any attempted assignment or
subcontracting by either party hereto not in compliance with the terms hereof
shall be null and void. It is agreed by the parties that the Services are in
the nature of &#147;Personal Services&#148; and, accordingly, the parties agree that this
Agreement cannot be assigned pursuant to Section&nbsp;365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

party for the timely and proper performance of all of its and its affiliates
obligations hereunder and the proper and timely performance and actions of any
person or entity to which a party delegates or subcontracts any such
obligation, even if such obligations are delegated to third party agents,
affiliates or subcontractors.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp; Upon Client&#146;s request, Crowe Chizek shall promptly provide to Client
information regarding any proposed subcontractors or the like to be utilized in
performance of any Services, the scope of the Services to be delegated thereto,
the experience and financial position of the proposed third party, Crowe
Chizek&#146;s selection criteria therefor and conclusions regarding its selection,
in order to permit Client to determine whether to grant its consent to such
delegation or subcontract. Subject to Crowe Chizek&#146;s timely provision of the
foregoing information to Client, Client shall timely review such information,
and notify Crowe Chizek in writing of its acceptance or objection to such
delegation or subcontract.
