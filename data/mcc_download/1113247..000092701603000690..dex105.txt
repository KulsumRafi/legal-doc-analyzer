     "Restricted Stock"), subject to the following restrictions:

     (i)  The Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, assigned or
          otherwise disposed of (whether by operation of law or otherwise) until
          you cease to be a director; and

     (ii) The Restricted Stock may not be pledged, hypothecated or encumbered or
          be subject to execution, attachment or similar process until you cease

2.   By entering into this Agreement and accepting the Restricted Stock Award,
     you acknowledge and agree that:

          contractual or other right to receive future grants of Restricted
          Stock Awards or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Awards; and

     (ii) your participation in the Plan does not create a right to continue to
          serve as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company.

3.   Regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to any or all
     income tax, payroll tax or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related
     Items"), you acknowledge and agree that the ultimate liability for all
     Tax-Related Items is your responsibility.

4.   The validity, construction and effect of this Agreement and the Plan shall
     be determined in accordance with the laws of the United States and the
     State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
