on January 1, 2003, the PO is for the calendar month of April 2003, and the
rolling twenty-four (24) month forecast will be for the months of May 1, 2003
through April 30, 2005.)&#160;&#160; If a written
PO for the fourth subsequent month is not received after eight (8) calendar
days following the first day of the calendar month, then the forecast amount
for that corresponding month as specified on the most recent twenty-four (24)
month rolling forecast will automatically become the amount of the PO and such
amount will be binding, noncancellable and non-changeable, unless both parties
mutually agreed in writing. Except as specified above, the rolling twenty-four
(24) month forecasts for the fifth (5<sup>th</sup>) through twenty-eighth (28<sup>th</sup>)
subsequent months are nonbinding; provided, however, that for long-lead time
components (i.e., such components having an ordering lead time of greater than
four (4) months) Sankyo shall be responsible for covering the costs of
noncancellable, commercially reasonable orders for long-lead time components in
the event that such components cannot be utilized.&#160; Additionally, any POs for a period of time not covered by the
then-current Sales, Marketing and Distribution Plan cannot exceed the highest
monthly forecast in the prior three (3) calendar months within the then-current
Sales, Marketing and Distribution Plan. The parties recognize that forecasting
for the first Sales Year is potentially variable.&#160; Sankyo Pharma Inc. will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to provide accurate forecasting during the first Sales Year and throughout the
Term of the Sales, Marketing and Distribution Agreement, and Cygnus agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts using equipment capacity and staffing
current at the time the PO is provided to accommodate requirements beyond one
hundred and twenty percent (120%) of firm orders during the first Sales Year
and throughout the Term of the Sales, Marketing and Distribution Agreement,
subject to Section 2.11 of this Supply Agreement.</font></p>

Within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of a PO from Sankyo or within
seven (7) calendar days after the first day of a calendar month in which no
written PO is received, as set forth in Section 2.2 of this Supply Agreement,
Cygnus will provide Sankyo a written acceptance of the PO and a firm delivery
schedule.&#160; In the event that there is no
response from Cygnus and if the PO is not greater by twenty percent (20%) or
less by ten percent (10%) than the amount for that corresponding month as
specified on the most recent twenty-four (24) month rolling forecast, the PO
shall be deemed accepted.</font></p>

and Acceptance of Product. Sankyo will pay Cygnus fifty percent (50%) of the
Transfer Price at the time of acceptance of the POs by Cygnus, the acceptance
of which will be indicated by written notice from Cygnus, as set forth in
Section 2.3 of this Supply Agreement, accompanied by an invoice for this
initial fifty percent (50%) of payment. Cygnus will issue additional invoices
to Sankyo for the remaining amounts, which Sankyo will pay upon Sankyo&#146;s
acceptances of shipments, provided however, that, if Cygnus does not ship
Product in the scheduled month as set forth on an accepted PO, and such delay
in shipment is not at the request of Sankyo, then Sankyo is not obligated to
pay Cygnus for any further shipments set forth on this PO until all Product
covered by this PO has been received and accepted by Sankyo.</font></p>

for shipments must contain specific lot information. Sankyo will pay Cygnus
only for amounts of Product actually accepted by Sankyo.&#160; Sankyo shall have seven (7) calendar days
following the date on which the Product is received to reject such Product only
in the event that all or part of the shipment fails to conform to the
applicable specification documentation.&#160;
Sankyo shall provide written notice to Cygnus within such seven (7)
calendar day period specifying the manner in which all or part of such shipment
fails to meet the specification </font></p>

If Cygnus and Sankyo disagree on whether a rejection is valid, the
matter will be determined by an independent third-party expert and the parties
shall bear equally the costs and expenses of such independent third-party
expert. In the event that no such notification is received, the Product shall
be deemed accepted and payment shall be due.&#160;

Products are not intended for resale and that Sankyo will be responsible for
reporting and paying any sales tax due on such Product.&#160; Payment will be due and made as set forth in

To ensure that there is no interruption of supply of Product to Sankyo&#146;s
customers, Sankyo will maintain a minimum of three (3) months inventory during

reason covered by the Product warranty; and (c) stale dating on the Product,
defined as Product with less than six (6) months dating left until the printed

based on a defect in workmanship or materials and/or Product warranty requests
will be referred to Cygnus&#146; Technical Support, who will issue Return
