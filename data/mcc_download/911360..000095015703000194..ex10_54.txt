     4. Increased Costs, Etc.; Funding Losses.

     (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in, or in
the interpretation of, any law or regulation or (ii) the need to comply
with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental
Authority (whether or not having the force of law) adopted or made after
the date of this Note (except, with respect to both subclauses (i) and
(ii), any law, regulation, guideline or request addressed in Section 5),
there shall be any increase in the cost to the Bank or any Person
controlling the Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining
the Loan, then the Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by the
Bank, pay to the Bank additional amounts sufficient to compensate the Bank
for such increased cost; provided, however, that, before making any such
demand, the Bank agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its
internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a
different Lending Office if the making of such a designation would avoid
the need for, or reduce the amount of, such increased cost and would not,
in the reasonable judgment of the Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to the
Bank. The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower in writing of the
occurrence of any such event, such notice to state, in reasonable detail,
the reasons therefor and the additional amounts required fully to
compensate the Bank for such increased cost or reduced amount; provided,
however, that notice in respect of any additional amounts payable hereunder
in respect of any Interest Period shall not be effective, and no such
additional amounts shall be payable hereunder in respect of such Interest
Period, unless such notice is given not later than the 360th day following
the Maturity Date. No such additional amounts shall be payable hereunder
for increased costs incurred in respect of any period from 90 days after
the date on which the Bank becomes actually aware of such increased cost to
the date on which the Bank delivers notice of such increased cost, except
for additional amounts for increased costs incurred as a result of the
retroactive application of any law, rule or regulation. A certificate as to
the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower by the Bank,
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

     (b) If the Bank determines that (i) the introduction of or any change
in, or in the interpretation of, any law or regulation or (ii) the need to
comply with any guideline or request from any central bank or other
Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) adopted or
made after the date hereof affects or would affect the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by the Bank or any Person controlling
the Bank and the Bank determines that the amount of such capital is
increased as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby and other
commitments of this type, then, upon demand by the Bank, the Borrower shall
pay to the Bank, from time to time as specified by the Bank, additional
amounts sufficient to compensate the Bank in light of such circumstances,
to the extent that the Bank reasonably determines such increase in capital
to be allocable to the existence of Loan made hereunder; provided, however,
that, before making any such demand, the Bank agrees to use reasonable
efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory
restrictions) to designate a different Lending Office if the making of such
a designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such
increase in capital and would not, in the reasonable judgment of the Bank,
be otherwise disadvantageous to the Bank. The Bank shall promptly notify
the Borrower in writing of the occurrence of any such event, such notice to
state, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and the additional
amounts required fully to compensate the Bank for such increased cost or
reduced amount; provided, however, that notice in respect of any additional
amounts payable hereunder in respect of any Interest Period shall not be
effective, and


                                   -14-


<PAGE>


no such additional amounts shall be payable hereunder in respect of such
Interest Period, unless such notice is given not later than the 360th day
following the Maturity Date. No such additional amounts shall be payable
hereunder for increased capital requirements for any period from 90 days
after the date on which the Bank becomes actually aware of such increased
capital requirements to the date on which the Bank delivers notice of such
increased capital requirements, except for additional amounts for increased
capital requirements as a result of the retroactive application of any law,
rule or regulation. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the
Borrower by the Bank, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

     (c) If the Bank determines that the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest
Period for the Loan will not adequately reflect the cost to the Bank of
making, funding or maintaining the Loan for such Interest Period, the Bank
shall forth-with so notify the Borrower, whereupon the Loan will
automatically, on the last day of the then-existing Interest Period, bear
interest by reference to the Alternate Base Rate.

     (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Note, if the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other
Governmental Authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for the Bank or
its Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder, then, on notice
thereof and demand therefor by the Bank to the Borrower, the Loan will
automatically, upon such demand, bear interest, at the end of the current
Interest Period therefor (or sooner if required by law), by reference to
the Alternate Base Rate; provided, however, that, before making any such
demand, the Bank agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its
internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a
different Lending Office if the making of such a designation would allow
the Bank or its Lending Office to continue to perform its obligation to
maintain the Loan and would not, in the judgment of the Bank, be otherwise
disadvantageous to the Bank.

     (e) In the event the Bank shall incur any loss, cost, or expense
(including any loss, cost, or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation
or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by the Bank to make,
continue, or maintain any portion of the principal amount of the Loan), but
excluding any loss of any margin above the Eurodollar Rate, as a result of
any repayment or prepayment of the principal amount of the Loan on a date
other than the scheduled last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto
then, upon the written notice of the Bank to the Borrower, the Borrower
shall, within five days of its receipt thereof, pay directly to the Bank
such amount as will (in the reasonable determination of the Bank) reimburse
the Bank for such loss, cost or expense. Such written notice (which shall
include all calculations in reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of
manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the Borrower.

     5. Taxes.

     (a) Any and all payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or
future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all
liabilities with respect thereto, excluding franchise taxes, taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings (and all liabilities with
respect thereto) imposed on or measured by reference to net income which
are imposed on the Bank by (i) the United States of America, (ii) any
political subdivision of the United States or (iii) any foreign
jurisdiction or political subdivision thereof under the laws of which the
Bank is


                                   -15-


<PAGE>


organized, or in which the Bank has qualified to do or in fact does
business (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as
"Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from
or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to the Bank, (x) the sum payable
shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section) the Bank receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deductions been made, (y) the Borrower shall make
such deductions and (z) the Borrower shall pay the full amount required to
be deducted to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable law. The Bank shall provide to the Borrower such
forms and certifications as are reasonably necessary to avoid or reduce the
Borrower's obligation to deduct Taxes from any payment hereunder; provided
that the Bank shall not be required to furnish any such form or
certification to the extent such Person reasonably determines (consistent
with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) that such
action would be disadvantageous to such Person.

     (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future
stamp or documentary taxes or any excise or property taxes or any other
charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or
from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect
to, this Note (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

     (c) The Borrower will indemnify the Bank for the full amount of Taxes
or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes
imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by
the Bank and any liability (including penalties, additions to tax, interest
and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto whether or not such
Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. This
indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date the Bank makes
written demand therefor.

     (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes by the
Borrower, the Borrower will furnish to the Bank, at its address referred to
in Section 9(b), the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing
payment thereof (or, if a receipt cannot be obtained in the applicable
jurisdiction, other appropriate evidence of payment thereof).

     (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower
contained in this Section shall survive the payment in full of principal
and interest hereunder.

                                   -16-

Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2001, and the related Consolidated

Governmental Authority or arbitrator that (i) if adversely determined,
would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the legality, validity or
enforceability of this Note, any other Loan Document, or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

     (k) (i) Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action (including any steps to terminate any Compensation Plan), nor made
any omission (including


                                   -18-


<PAGE>


any failure to make any required contribution to any Compensation Plan),
with respect to any Compensation Plan, in either case which (A) would
result in a liability to the Borrower or any Subsidiary in excess of U.S.
$1,000,000 (or the equivalent in any other currency), (B) would give rise
to a Lien over any of its properties, assets, or revenues, or (C) would be
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect; and

          (ii) the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance
     in all material respects with the regulatory requirements of
     applicable law relating to pensions, employee retirement benefits and
     social security and has made all payments required to be made pursuant
     thereto. Except as set forth in Item 6(k) of the Disclosure Schedule,
     neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, or is
     required to contribute to, any Compensation Plan, except such
     Compensation Plans that do not require funding and that may be
     terminated by the Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary, as the case
     may be, without its incurring any liability.

     (l) Except as set forth in Item 6(l) of the Disclosure Schedule, each
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has filed all material tax returns and
reports required to be filed, and have paid all material taxes,
assessments, fees and other governmental charges levied or imposed upon
them or their properties, income or assets otherwise due and payable,
except (i) those which are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been provided in
accordance with GAAP or (ii) where the failure to do so could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no
proposed tax assessment against the Borrower or any Subsidiary that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (m) (i) Except as set forth in Item 6(m) of the Disclosure Schedule,
the operations and properties of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries
comply in all material respects with all Environmental Laws, all materially
necessary Environmental Permits have been obtained and are in effect for
the operations and properties of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects
with all such Environmental Permits, except where the failure to comply
with or obtain such Environmental Permits would not be reasonably likely to
result in a Material Adverse Effect and no circumstances exist that could
(A) form the basis of an Environmental Action against the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties that would be reasonably
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (B) cause any such
property to be subject to any material restrictions on ownership,
occupancy, use or transferability under any Environmental Law; and

          (ii) Hazardous Materials have not been generated, used, treated,
     handled, stored or disposed of on, or released or transported to or
     from, any property of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except
     in compliance with all Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits,
     and all other wastes generated at any such properties have been
     disposed of in compliance with all Environmental Laws and
     Environmental Permits and except where the failure to comply with
     Environmental Laws or obtain such Environmental Permits would not be
     reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     (n) Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
Existing Debt Agreement, indenture, loan or credit agreement or any lease or
other agreement or instrument or


                                   -19-


<PAGE>


subject to any charter or corporate restriction that materially inhibits
the conduct of its business, as currently operated or as planned.

     (o) Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an "investment
company" or an "affiliated person" of, or "promoter" or "principal
underwriter" for, an "investment company" required to be registered as such
within the meaning of the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended. Neither the making of the Loan, nor the application of the
proceeds of repayment thereof by the Borrower, nor the consummation of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, will violate any provision of such
Act or any rule, regulation or order of the Securities and Exchange
Commission thereunder.

     (p) Set forth in Item 6(p) of the Disclosure Schedule is a complete
and accurate list of all material Existing Debt, as of September 30, 2002,
showing as of such date the outstanding principal amount thereof. No other
material Debt has been incurred since such date. Except as shown in Item
6(p) of the Disclosure Schedule, on the date hereof, there is no Debt owing
from the Borrower to any of its Subsidiaries. The Obligations of the
Borrower under this Note rank at least pari passu with all other senior,
unsecured Debt of the Borrower.

     (q) Neither the Borrower nor any of its property or assets has any
immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from set-off or any legal
process (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation.

     (r) The Borrower is not engaged principally, or as one of its
important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose
of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock. None of the proceeds of the Loan
will be used for the purpose of, or be made available by the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries in any manner to any other Person to enable or
assist such Person in, purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

     (s) The Borrower, individually and on a Consolidated basis with its
Subsidiaries, is, after giving effect to the Loan, Solvent.

     (t) The Borrower used the proceeds of the Loan made by the Bank to
finance the acquisition of certain assets in Panama.

     (u) The Board of Directors of the Borrower adopted by resolution a
dividend policy whereby an amount equal to between 15% and 25% of the
Borrower's Consolidated net income from the previous year will be paid to
shareholders each year, in quarterly distributions, as determined by the
Board of Directors. Such dividend policy remains in effect as of the date
hereof. Pursuant to the Certificate of Designations in effect as of the
date of this Agreement for the Series C Preferred Stock of the Borrower,
any change in the Borrower's policy with respect to dividends or
distributions to shareholders of the Borrower requires the approval of the
holder of the two outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock. As of the
date of this Agreement, the Borrower does not anticipate any change in its
dividend policy or in the terms of the Certificate of Designations of the
Series C Preferred Stock.

7.       Covenants.

     (a) Affirmative Covenants. So long as any Obligations under this Note
shall remain unpaid, the Borrower shall, unless the Bank shall otherwise
consent in writing:

          (i) Compliance with Laws, Etc. Except when the failure to do so
     would not be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect,
     comply, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to comply, in all material
     respects, with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders.

          (ii) Payment of Taxes, Etc. Pay and discharge, and cause each of
     its Subsidiaries to pay and discharge, before the same shall become
     delinquent, (A) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or
     levies imposed upon it or upon its property or assets and (B) all
     lawful claims that, if unpaid, might by law become a Lien upon its
     property; provided, however, that neither the Borrower nor any of its
     Subsidiaries shall be required to pay or discharge any such tax,
     assessment, charge or claim that is being contested in good faith and
     by proper proceedings and as to which appropriate reserves are being
     maintained (if required by GAAP), unless and until any Lien resulting
     therefrom attaches to its property or assets and becomes enforceable
     against its other creditors.

          (iii) Compliance with Environmental Laws. Except when the failure
     to do so would not be reasonably likely to result in a Material
     Adverse Effect, comply, and cause each of its Subsidiaries and all
     lessees and other Persons occupying its properties to comply, in all
     material respects, with all Environmental Laws and Environmental
     Permits applicable to its operations and properties; obtain and renew
     all Environmental Permits necessary for its operations and properties;
     and conduct, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to conduct, any
     reasonable investigation, study, sampling and testing, and undertake
     any reasonable cleanup, removal, remedial or other action necessary to
     remove and clean up all Hazardous Materials from any of its
     properties, in accordance with the requirements of all Environmental
     Laws; provided, however, that neither the Borrower nor any of its
     Subsidiaries shall be required to undertake any such cleanup, removal,
     remedial or other action to the extent that its obligation to do so is
     being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings and
     appropriate reserves are being maintained with respect to such
     circumstances.

          (iv) Maintenance of Insurance. Maintain, and cause each of its
     Subsidiaries to maintain, insurance with responsible insurance
     companies or associations in such amounts and covering such risks as
     is usually carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and
     owning similar properties in the same general areas in which the
     Borrower or such Subsidiary operates.

          (v) Preservation of Corporate Existence, Etc. Except as permitted
     under Section 7(b)(ii), preserve and maintain, and cause each of its
     Subsidiaries to preserve and maintain, its corporate existence, rights
     (charter and statutory) and franchises (including, without limitation,
     any franchise agreement of the Borrower or any Subsidiary with TCCC or
     any Affiliate thereof, which agreements shall be preserved and
     maintained in a manner consistent in all material respects with past
     practice); provided, however, that


                                   -21-


<PAGE>


     neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
     preserve any right or franchise, nor shall the Borrower be required to
     maintain the corporate existence of any Subsidiary if the preservation
     or maintenance thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the
     business of the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and
     the failure to preserve any such right or franchise or maintain the
     corporate existence of such Subsidiary would not be reasonably likely
     to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Borrower and its
     Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

          (vi) Visitation Rights. At any time during regular business hours
     upon prior written notice to and approval of the Borrower (which
     approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) permit the
     Bank, or any agents or representatives thereof, to examine and make
     notes with respect to records and books of account of, and visit the
     properties of, the Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries, and to
     discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Borrower and any of
     its Subsidiaries with any of their executive officers or directors and
     with their independent certified public accountants.

          (vii) Keeping of Books. Keep, and cause each of its Subsidiaries
     to keep, proper books of record and account, in which full and correct
     entries shall be made of all financial transactions and the assets and
     business of the Borrower and each such Subsidiary in accordance with
     GAAP.

          (viii) Maintenance of Properties, Etc. Except where the failure
     to do so would not be reasonably likely to result in a Material
     Adverse Effect, maintain and preserve, and cause each of its
     Subsidiaries to maintain and preserve, all of its properties and
     assets that are material to the conduct of its business in good
     working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

          (ix) Transactions with Affiliates.

               (A) Conduct, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to conduct,
          all transactions otherwise permitted hereunder with any of its
          Subsidiaries (x) in the ordinary course of business in accordance
          with past practices or (y) on terms that are fair and reasonable
          and no less favorable to the Borrower or such Subsidiary than it
          would obtain in a comparable arm's-length transaction with a
          Person not an Affiliate.

               (B) Conduct, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to conduct,
          all transactions otherwise permitted hereunder with any of their
          Affiliates (other than their Subsidiaries) on terms that are fair
          and reasonable and no less favorable to the Borrower or such
          Subsidiary than it would obtain in a comparable arm's length
          transaction with a Person not an Affiliate.

               (C) Prior to the Borrower becoming indebted to any Affiliate
          of the Borrower, cause such Affiliate to execute a subordination
          agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank,
          subordinating such Debt to be owed to such Affiliate to all
          Obligations of the Borrower hereunder, and thereafter deliver to
          the Bank a copy thereof certified by a duly authorized officer or
          agent to be a true and correct copy of the original.

          (x) Compliance with Terms of Leaseholds. Except where the failure
     to do so would not be reasonably likely to result in a Material
     Adverse Effect, make all payments and otherwise perform in all
     material respects all obligations in respect of all material leases of
     real property and cause all of its Subsidiaries to do so, and, to the
     extent material to the business of the Borrower, keep such leases in
     full force and effect and not allow such leases to lapse or be
     terminated or rights to renew such leases to be forfeited or canceled.

          (xi) Sales of Assets. Cause any assets that are, in the aggregate
     during the term of this Note, material to the Consolidated financial
     position of the Borrower, to be sold or otherwise transferred by the
     Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to be so sold or transferred at a
     value that shall reasonably approximate their fair market value (it
     being understood that "material," for purposes of this clause (xi)
     only, shall mean an amount equal to, for all assets during the term of
     this Note, 5.5% of Consolidated Tangible Net Assets (calculated as of
     the end-date of the last quarter for which Consolidated financial
     statements have been distributed)).

     (b) Negative Covenants. So long as any Obligation under this Note
shall remain unpaid, the Borrower shall not, without the written consent of
the Bank:

          (i) Liens, Etc. Create, incur, assume or suffer to exist, or
     permit any of its Subsidiaries to create, incur, assume or suffer to
     exist, any Lien on or with respect to any of its properties and assets
     of any character (including, without limitation, accounts and capital
     stock) whether now owned or hereafter acquired, or assign, or permit
     any of its Subsidiaries to assign, any accounts or other rights to
     receive revenues, excluding, however, from the operation of the
     foregoing restrictions:

               (A) Permitted Liens; and

               (B) Liens securing Debt if, after giving pro forma effect to
          the incurrence of such Debt (and the receipt and application of
          the proceeds thereof) or the securing of outstanding Debt, the
          sum of (without duplication) all Debt of the Borrower and its
          Subsidiaries secured by Liens (other than Permitted Liens), at
          the time of determination would not exceed 10% of Consolidated
          Tangible Net Assets.

          (ii) Mergers, Etc. Merge with or into or consolidate with or into
     any Person, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to do so, unless: (A)
     either (1) such merger or consolidation is between any of the
     Borrower's Subsidiaries and any of the Borrower's other Subsidiaries,
     (2) the Borrower shall be the continuing Person in the case of a
     merger or (3) the resulting or surviving Person if other than the
     Borrower (the "Successor Company") shall expressly assume, by a
     written agreement, executed and delivered to the Bank, in form
     satisfactory to the Bank, all the Obligations of the Borrower under
     this Note; (B) immediately after giving effect to such transaction
     (and treating any Debt which becomes an obligation of the Successor
     Company or any Subsidiary of the Borrower or the Successor Company as
     a result of such transaction as having been incurred by the Successor
     Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no
     Default would occur or be continuing and the Borrower shall have
     delivered to the


                                   -23-


<PAGE>


     Bank an officer's certificate to that effect; and (C) except in the
     case of any merger or consolidation under subclause (A)(1) above: (1)
     the Borrower shall have delivered to the Bank an officer's certificate
     and an opinion of counsel, each stating that such consolidation or
     merger and such written agreement comply with this Note and, if such
     consolidation or merger results in a Successor Company, that such
     written agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
     of the Successor Company, enforceable against such entity in
     accordance with its terms, subject to customary exceptions, and (2) at
     least two of Standard & Poor's, Moody's or Fitch shall have notified
     the Bank in writing that the proposed merger or consolidation will not
     result in a withdrawal or reduction of its credit rating of the
     Borrower below the lower of the then existing rating thereof.

          (iii) Change in Nature of Business. Make, or permit any of its
     Subsidiaries to make, any material change in the nature and conduct of
     the business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole as
     carried on at the date hereof.

          (iv) Accounting Changes. Make or permit, or permit any of its
     Subsidiaries to make or permit, any change in accounting policies or

     notify the Bank of any such change).

          (v) Constitutional Documents. Amend, modify or change in any
     manner any material term or condition of any constitutional document
     (including, without limitation, the Voting Trust Agreement, any other
     shareholders agreement or any similar agreement) of the Borrower or
     any Subsidiary or take any other action in connection with any
     constitutional document that would reasonably be likely to result in a
     Material Adverse Effect, except as permitted by Section 7(b)(ii).

          (vi) Shareholders' Agreements. Enter into, or permit any of its
     Subsidiaries to enter into, any shareholders' agreement (or similar
     agreement or arrangement) with any holder of Voting Stock of the
     Borrower (other than with TCCC or any Subsidiary thereof or with
     Venbottling Holdings, Inc. or with the voting trustees under the
     Voting Trust Agreement).

          (vii) Change in Control. Suffer, or allow its Subsidiaries to
     suffer, a Change in Control.

     dispose of, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to sell, lease, transfer
     or otherwise dispose of, any of its assets, including (without
     limitation) any shares of capital stock of Subsidiaries and any

          of business, provided that the proceeds thereof are promptly

          of capital stock of Subsidiaries) of the Borrower or any of its
          Subsidiaries, provided that at the time of such sale and after
          giving effect thereto no Event of Default shall have occurred and
          be continuing; and

               (D) sales of assets to Affiliates permitted under Section
          7(a)(ix).

          (ix) Debt. Create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Debt, or

               such Debt owed by the Borrower to any Affiliate of the
               Borrower shall be subordinated to all Obligations of the
               Borrower under this Note pursuant to a subordination
               agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank;

               the time such Debt is incurred and after giving effect
               thereto (and to the repayment required hereunder) no Event

               Disclosure Schedule; and

                    (2) any Debt of any Subsidiary not otherwise permitted

               and after giving effect thereto, no Event of Default shall
               have occurred and be continuing.

     For purposes of determining compliance with the foregoing covenant,
(i) in the event that an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one
of the types of Debt described above, the Borrower, in its reasonable
discretion, will classify such item of Debt and only be required to include
the amount and type of such Debt in one of the above clauses and (ii) an
item of Debt may be split between more than one of the applicable types of
Debt described above.

     (c) Reporting Requirements. So long as any Obligation under this Note
shall remain unpaid, the Borrower shall, unless the Bank shall otherwise
consent in writing, furnish to the Bank:

     two days after the occurrence of each Default continuing on the date
     of such statement, a statement of the chief financial officer of the

     GAAP, together with a certificate of such officer stating that no
     Default has occurred and is continuing or, if a Default has occurred
     and is continuing, a statement as to the nature thereof and the action

any


                                   -28-

agreement or instrument relating to any such Debt, if the effect of such
event or condition is to accelerate the maturity of such Debt or otherwise
to cause, or to permit the holder thereof to cause, such Debt to mature; or

     (g) any judgment or order for the payment of money in excess of U.S.
$20,000,000 (or the equivalent in another currency) which is not covered by
insurance shall be rendered against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
and either (i) enforcement proceedings shall have been commenced by any
creditor upon such judgment or order or (ii) there shall be any period of
30 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment or
order, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect;

     (l) by reason of any material interference by any Governmental
Authority, or otherwise, this Note, in whole or in part, shall become
invalid, or shall fail to be in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms or the binding effect or enforceability thereof shall be
contested by the Borrower;

then, and in any such event, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower,
declare this Note, all interest hereon and all other amounts payable under
this Note to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the Note, all such
interest and all such amounts shall become and be forthwith due and
payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower; provided,
however, that in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an order for
relief with respect to the Borrower under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or
any similar order or adjudication under applicable law that would impose a
moratorium on or stay of creditor efforts to collect debts to become
effective, the Note, all such interest and all such amounts shall
automatically become and be due and payable, without presentment, demand,
protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived
by the Borrower.

     9. Miscellaneous.

     (a) Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Note or any other Loan Document, nor consent to any departure by the
Borrower therefor, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
in writing and signed by the Bank, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which given.

     (b) Notices, Etc. All notices and other communications provided for

and other communications, if not in English, shall be accompanied by an
English translation.

     (c) No Waiver, Remedies. No failure on the part of the Bank to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any
other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein

     rights, or interests, under this Note and any other Loan Document,
     with respect to negotiations with the Borrower or with other creditors
     of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of any Default
     or any events or circumstances that may give rise to a Default and
     with respect to presenting, claims in or otherwise participating in or
     monitoring any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding
     involving creditors' rights generally and any proceeding ancillary
     thereto and (B) all costs and expenses of the Bank in connection with

          (ii) The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Bank
     and each of its Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees,
     agents and advisors (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against

     (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of
     counsel) that are actually incurred by or asserted or awarded against
     any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection
     with or by reason of, or in connection with the preparation for a
     defense of, any investigation, litigation or proceeding arising out
     of, related to or in connection with (i) the Borrower's use of the
     proceeds of the Loan, (ii) the actual or alleged presence of Hazardous
     Materials on any property of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
     or any Environmental Action relating in any way to the Borrower or any

     creditors or an Indemnified Party, whether or not any Indemnified
     Party is otherwise a party thereto, except to the extent such claim,
     damage, loss, liability or expense is found in a final, non-appealable
     judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from
     such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

          (iii) If the Borrower fails to pay when due any costs, expenses
     or other amounts payable by it under this Note, including, without
     limitation, fees and expenses of counsel (including the allocated cost
     of in-house counsel) and indemnities, such amount may be paid on
     behalf of the Borrower by the Bank, in its sole discretion, and such
     amount shall be reimbursed by the Borrower.

     (e) Right of Set-off. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of any payment Event of Default, the Bank is hereby authorized at any time
and from time to time, to the fullest


                                   -31-


<PAGE>


extent permitted by law, to set off and otherwise apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any
time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by the Bank to or for
the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the
Obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing hereunder,
irrespective of whether the Bank shall have made any demand hereunder and
although such Obligations may be unmatured. The Bank agrees promptly to
notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application; provided,
however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity
of such set-off and application. The rights of the Bank under this Section
9(e) are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without
limitation, other rights of set-off) that the Bank may have.

     (f) Binding Effect; Assignments and Participations. This Note shall be
binding upon the Borrower and its successors and assigns and shall inure to

at any time assign or otherwise transfer or sell participations in this
Note or any of its rights with respect hereto to an Eligible Assignee.

     (g) Governing Law. This Note shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York.

regulation or judicial process and (iii) as requested or required by any
state, federal or foreign authority or examiner regulating banks or
banking.

     (i) Judgment.

          (i) If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it
     is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in U.S. Dollars into
     another currency (the "Other Currency"), the Borrower agrees, to the
     fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the rate of
     exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking
     procedures the Bank could purchase U.S. Dollars in New York City on
     the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.

          (ii) The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any sum due in
     U.S. Dollars from it to the Bank hereunder shall, notwithstanding any
     judgment in any Other Currency, be discharged only to the extent that,
     on the Business Day following receipt by the Bank of any sum adjudged
     to be so due in such Other Currency the Bank may, in accordance with
     normal banking procedures, purchase U.S. Dollars with such Other
     Currency; if the amount of the U.S. Dollars so purchased is less than
     the sum originally due to the Bank in U.S. Dollars, the Borrower
     agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding such judgment, to
     indemnify the Bank against such loss, and if the amount of the U.S.
     Dollars so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to the Bank in
     U.S. Dollars, the Bank agrees to remit to the Borrower such excess.

     (j) Consent to Jurisdiction.

          (i) The Borrower hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction
     of any New York State or Federal court sitting in the borough of
     Manhattan in New York City and any appellate court from any thereof
     and to the courts of its own corporate domicile with respect to
     actions brought against it as a defendant in any action or proceeding
     arising out of or relating to this Note or any other Loan Document,
     and the Borrower hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect
     of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
     New York State court or in such Federal court. The Borrower hereby
     irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so,
     any objection it may now or hereafter have as to the venue of any such
     action or proceeding brought in any such court or that such court is
     an inconvenient forum. The Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints CT
     Corporation System, Inc. (the "Process Agent"), with an office on the
     date hereof at 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10011, United States,
     as its agent to receive on behalf of the Borrower and its property
     service of copies of the summons and complaint and any other process
     which may be served in any such action or proceeding. Such service may
     be made by delivering a copy of such process to the Borrower in care
     of the Process Agent at the Process Agent's above address, and the
     Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Process Agent
     to accept such service on its behalf. As an alternative method of
     service, the Borrower also irrevocably consents to the service of any
     and all process in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of
     copies of such process to the Borrower at its address specified in
     Section 9(b). The Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such
     action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
     jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
     by law.

          (ii) Nothing in this clause (j) shall affect the right of the
     Bank to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or
     affect the right of the Bank to bring any action or proceeding against
     the Borrower or its property in the courts of other jurisdictions.

          (iii) To the extent that the Borrower has or hereafter may
     acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal
     process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to
     judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with
     respect to itself or its property, the Borrower hereby irrevocably
     waives such immunity in respect of its Obligations under this Note.

          (iv) Any judicial proceeding by the Borrower against the Bank
     involving, directly or indirectly, any matter in any way arising out
     of, related to, or connected to this Note or any Loan Document shall
     be brought only in court in New York, New York, to the extent that
     jurisdiction may be effected against the Bank in New York, New York.

     (k) WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS NOTE OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

agrees not to sue the Bank upon any claim for any special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages suffered by the Borrower in connection
with, arising out of, or in any way related to this Note or the
relationship established by this Note, or any act, omission or event
occurring in connection therewith, unless it is determined by a judgment of
a court that is binding on the Bank, and is final and not subject to review
on appeal, that such damages were the result of acts or omissions on the
part of the Bank constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct.
