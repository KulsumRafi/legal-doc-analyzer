<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp; Purposes of the Plan. The Quintiles Transnational Corp. 2002 Stock
Option Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) has been established by Quintiles Transnational Corp.
(the &#147;Company&#148;) to (i)&nbsp;attract and retain persons eligible to participate in
the Plan; (ii)&nbsp;motivate such persons, by means of appropriate incentives, to
achieve long-range goals; (iii)&nbsp;provide incentive compensation opportunities
that are competitive with those of other, similar companies; and (iv)&nbsp;further
identify Optionees&#146; interests with those of the Company&#146;s other shareholders
through compensation based upon the Common Stock and thereby promote the
long-term financial interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Options
granted under the Plan may be Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualified Stock
Options, as determined by the Administrator at the time of grant.

such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set
forth in the Notice of Grant. Except as provided in the Notice of Grant,
Options granted to Service Providers who are &#147;non-exempt&#148; Employees, within the
meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act, shall not be exercisable within six

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp; Procedure for Exercise. An Option shall be deemed to be exercised
when the Company receives (i)&nbsp;notice of exercise from the Optionee in
accordance with the Option Agreement and (ii)&nbsp;full payment for the Shares in
the form of any consideration and method of payment permitted by the Plan and
authorized by the Administrator. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp; Rights as a Shareholder. Until Shares subject to Options are issued
(as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly
authorized transfer agent of the Company), Optionees shall have no right to
vote or receive dividends or any other rights as shareholders with respect to
such Shares. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) Shares promptly
after Options are exercised. No adjustment shall be made for dividends or
other rights for which the record date is prior to the date Shares are issued,
except as provided in Section&nbsp;12 hereunder. The exercise of an Option shall
decrease the number of Shares thereafter available under the Plan and under the
Option by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.

to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination, under the Option
Agreement or other applicable agreement, within such period of time as is
specified in the Option Agreement (but in no event later than the expiration of
the term of the Option). In the absence of a specified time in the Option
Agreement, an Option shall remain exercisable for three (3)&nbsp;months following
the Optionee&#146;s termination. If, on the date of termination, an Optionee is not
vested as to an entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of
the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, an Optionee does
not exercise an Option within the time specified in the Option Agreement or

guardian or the Optionee&#146;s estate or a person who acquires the right to

Option). In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the
Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12)&nbsp;months following the Optionee&#146;s
termination. If, on the date of termination, an Optionee is not vested as to
an entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option
shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, an Optionee does not exercise
an Option within the time specified in the Option Agreement or this Section
10(e), as applicable, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by the
Option shall revert to the Plan.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;Non-Transferability of Options. Unless determined otherwise by the
Administrator, Options may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated,
transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of
descent and distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the
Optionee, only by the Optionee. If the Administrator in its sole discretion
permits an Option to be transferable, it shall be transferable only by gift or
by domestic relations order to or for the benefit of a &#147;family member&#148; of the
Optionee, as defined in the General Instructions to Form&nbsp;S-8 under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.&nbsp;Effect of Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required action
by the shareholders of the Company, the number of Shares covered by each
outstanding Option, the number of Shares that have been authorized for issuance
under the Plan but as to which no Options have yet been granted or which have
been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of Options, as well
as the price per Share covered by each outstanding Option and the repurchase
price per Share of unvested Shares purchased upon exercise of Options, shall be
proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued
Shares resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
split-up, spin-off, combination, exchange or reclassification of the Common
Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares
effected without receipt of consideration by the Company. The conversion of
any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been
&#147;effected without receipt of consideration.&#148; The Board shall make any such
adjustment, and the Board&#146;s determination in that respect shall be final,
binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by
the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into
shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof
shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to
Options.

</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp; Definition. For purposes of this Plan, a &#147;Change in Control&#148; shall
mean the occurrence of any one of the following:
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp; An acquisition (other than directly from the Company) of any voting
securities of the Company by any &#147;Person&#148; (as such term is used in Sections
3(a)(9), 13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the &#147;Act&#148;)), after which such Person, together with its &#147;affiliates&#148;
and &#147;associates&#148; (as such terms are defined in Rule&nbsp;12b-2 under the Act),
becomes the &#147;beneficial owner&#148; (as such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;13d-3 under the
Act), directly or indirectly, of more than one-third (33.33%) of the total
voting power of the Company&#146;s then outstanding voting securities, but excluding
any such acquisition by the Company, any Person of which a majority of its
voting power or its voting equity securities or equity interests is owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company (solely for purposes of this Section
13(a), a &#147;Subsidiary&#148;), any employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including any Person acting as trustee or other fiduciary for any
such plan), or Dennis B. Gillings;
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp; The shareholders of the Company approve a merger, share exchange,
consolidation or reorganization involving the Company and any other corporation
or other entity that is not controlled by the Company, as a result of which
less than two-thirds (66.66%) of the total voting power of the outstanding
voting securities of the Company or of the successor corporation or entity
after such transaction are held in the aggregate by the holders of the
Company&#146;s voting securities immediately prior to such transaction; or
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp; The shareholders of the Company approve a liquidation or dissolution
of the Company, or approve the sale or other disposition by the Company of all
or substantially all of the Company&#146;s assets to any Person (other than a
transfer to a Subsidiary of the Company).
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp; Effect of a Change in Control.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp; In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing,
successor, or purchasing corporation or Parent thereof, as the case may be (the
&#147;Acquiring Corporation&#148;) may either assume the Company rights and obligations
under outstanding Options or substitute for outstanding Options substantially
equivalent options to purchase the Acquiring Corporation&#146;s stock.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp; Except as otherwise determined by the Administrator, in the event
that the Acquiring Corporation does not assume or substitute for outstanding
Options, the Administrator shall notify Optionees in writing that outstanding
Options shall remain outstanding for no less than fifteen (15)&nbsp;days from date
of such notice, shall be exercisable to the extent exercisable under the Plan
and any applicable agreement upon the consummation of the Change

<P><FONT size="2">in Control, and shall terminate and cease to be outstanding upon later of
the expiration of such fifteen (15)-day period or upon the consummation of the
Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shares acquired upon
exercise of Options prior to the Change in Control and any consideration
received pursuant to the Change in Control with respect to such Shares shall
continue to be subject to all applicable provisions of the Option Agreements
evidencing such Options, except as otherwise may be provided in such Option
Agreements.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp; For the purposes of this Section&nbsp;13(b), an Option shall be
considered assumed if, following a Change in Control, the Option confers the
right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Option immediately
prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or
other securities or property) received in the Change in Control by holders of
Common Stock (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type
of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Shares). If such consideration is not solely common stock of the Acquiring
Corporation, the Administrator may, with the consent of the Acquiring
Corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of
an Option to be solely common stock of the Acquiring Corporation equal in fair
market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock
in the Change in Control.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.&nbsp;Date of Grant. The date of grant of an Option shall, for all
purposes, be the date on which the Administrator makes the determination
granting the Option, or such later date as the Administrator shall determine.
Notice of such determination shall be given to Optionees within a reasonable
time after the date of grant.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.&nbsp;Amendment and Termination of the Plan.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp; Amendment and Termination. The Board may at any time amend, alter,
suspend or terminate the Plan, provided that (i)&nbsp;no amendment or termination
may, in the absence of written consent of the Optionee (or, if the Optionee is
not then living, the affected beneficiary), adversely affect the right of any
Optionee or beneficiary under any Option granted under the Plan prior to the
date such amendment is adopted by the Board and (ii)&nbsp;no amendment may increase
the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan under Section&nbsp;3,
modify the exclusions upon the authority of the Administrator set forth in
Section&nbsp;4(c), increase the limitations on the number of Shares set forth in
Section&nbsp;6(b), decrease the minimum Option exercise price set forth in Section
9(a), or effect any other material change in the Plan, unless such amendment is
approved by the Company&#146;s shareholders. Adjustments pursuant to Section&nbsp;12
hereof shall not be subject to the foregoing limitations of this Section&nbsp;15(a).
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp; Termination for Cause; Noncompetition. The provisions of Section
15(a) notwithstanding, the Administrator shall retain the right and power to
(i)&nbsp;cancel or suspend any Option if the Optionee is terminated for cause, as
determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, and (ii)&nbsp;provide for
the forfeiture of Shares or other gain under an Option upon the Optionee&#146;s
competing against the Company or any Subsidiary.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.&nbsp;Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares. Notwithstanding any other
provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no obligation to issue and
deliver Shares pursuant to the exercise of an Option unless such exercise and
the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all Applicable Laws,
including, without limitation, withholding of all taxes and any requirements of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The issuance and delivery of such
Shares shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with
respect to such compliance. To the extent the Plan provides for the issuance
of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of Shares, the issuance may be
effected on a non-certificated basis to the extent not prohibited by Applicable
Laws.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.&nbsp;Reservation of Shares. During the term of the Plan, the Company shall
at all times reserve and keep available a number of Shares sufficient to
satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.&nbsp;Shareholder Approval. The Plan shall be subject to shareholder
approval, which shall be obtained in accordance with Applicable Laws within
twelve (12)&nbsp;months of the adoption of the Plan by the Board.
