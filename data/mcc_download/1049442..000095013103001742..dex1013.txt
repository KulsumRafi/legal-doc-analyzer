<PAGE>

                  "Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the First
            Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company has issued and delivered
            Warrants to certain of the Initial Holders in accordance with the
            First Securities Purchase Agreement. In connection with the
            execution and delivery of the Second Securities Purchase Agreement,
            the Company has issued and delivered Warrants to certain of the
            Initial Holders in accordance with the Second Securities Purchase
            Agreement. The Company will issue and deliver Warrants to certain of
            the Initial Holders in accordance with the Third Securities Purchase
            Agreement on or after the date of the Third Securities Purchase
            Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to all
            Warrants, and each Holder that is not a party to this Agreement, by
            its acceptance of a Warrant, agrees to be bound by the applicable
            provisions hereof."

            (c)    The Original Agreement is amended by deleting the fifth
sentence of Section 3.1(a) and inserting the following sentence in lieu thereof:

                  "Irrespective of any adjustments in the Exercise Price or the
            number or kind of shares or other securities or property issuable
            upon the exercise of Warrants, any Warrants theretofore or
            thereafter issued may, as a matter of form, continue to express the
            same Exercise Price and the same number of shares of Common Stock
            issuable upon the exercise of such Warrants as were stated in the
            Warrants initially issued pursuant to the First Securities Purchase
            Agreement, the Second Securities Purchase Agreement or the Third
            Securities Purchase Agreement, as applicable."

            (d)    The Original Agreement is amended by deleting the first
sentence of Section 4.3(a) and inserting the following sentence in lieu thereof:

                  "As promptly as practicable but in any event within seven (7)
            days (or if the Common Stock is publicly Traded at such time, within
            three (3) days or such other time period as is customary in the
            market for Publicly Traded securities) following the delivery date
            (the "Delivery Date") of (i) an Exercise Form or Exchange Form in
            accordance with Section 4.1 or 4.2, (ii) the related Warrant and
            (iii) any required payment of the Exercise Price, the Company shall,
            without charge, issue, register and deliver one or more stock
            certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of Common
            Stock to which the Holder of such Warrant is entitled and, upon
            compliance with the applicable provisions of this Warrant Agreement,
            the Other Equity Documents and the First Securities Purchase
            Agreement, the Second Securities Purchase Agreement or the Third
            Securities Purchase Agreement, as applicable, transfer to such
            Holder appropriate evidence of ownership of other securities or
            property (including any cash) to which such Holder is entitled, in

                                       2

            such denominations, and registered or otherwise placed in, or
            payable to the order of, such name or names, as may be directed in
            writing by such Holder."

            (e)    The Original Agreement is amended by deleting the last
sentence of Section 4.3(f) and inserting the following sentence in lieu thereof:

                  "Notwithstanding anything in this Warrant Agreement to the
            contrary, in no event shall a Holder be entitled to exercise a
            Warrant unless (i) a registration statement filed under the
            Securities Act in respect of the issuance of the Warrant Shares is
            then effective or (ii) the exercise of such Warrants is exempt from
            the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such
            securities are qualified for sale or exempt from qualification under
            the applicable securities laws of the states or other jurisdictions
            in which such Holders reside, such exemption to be evidenced by an
            opinion of counsel to the extent such an opinion would be required
            under Section 6.3 of the First Securities Purchase Agreement,
            Section 6.3 of the Second Securities Purchase Agreement or Section
            7.3 of the Third Securities Purchase Agreement, as applicable, in
            respect of a transfer to the Person to whom the Warrant Shares are
            to be issued."

            (f)    Section 7.3(c) of the Original Agreement shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to read as set forth below.

                  "(c) Additional Initial Holders. Any "Purchaser" (as defined
            in the Second Securities Purchase Agreement or the Third Securities
            Purchase Agreement) who is not already an Initial Holder hereunder
            shall become an `Initial Holder' upon execution of a counterpart to
            this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
            herein, Schedule I attached hereto may be amended from time to time
            without the consent of the Requisite Holders to add any "Purchasers"
            who have become Initial Holders and to otherwise update the number
            of Warrant Shares issued to the Initial Holders."

            (g)    Schedule I of the Original Agreement, as amended through the
date hereof, is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as set forth on
Exhibit A attached hereto.

      Section 2.   Acknowledgement.

            The Requisite Holders acknowledge that the adjustments set forth in
Article V of the Warrant Agreement are not applicable to the purchase of
Warrants issued pursuant to the Third Securities Purchase Agreement and the
issuance of any such Warrants Shares following the exercise of such Warrants
pursuant to the Warrant Agreement.

      Section 3.   No other Amendments or Waivers.

            Except as modified by this Amendment, the Original Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect, enforceable in accordance with its terms. This
Amendment is not a consent to any waiver or modification of any other terms or
conditions of the Original Agreement or any of the instruments or documents
referred to in the Original Agreement and shall not prejudice any right or

connection with the Original Agreement or any of the instruments or documents
referred to therein.

            This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective
when one or more counterparts have been signed by the Requisite Holders and the
Company (by facsimile or otherwise), it being understood that all of the
foregoing need not sign the same counterpart. Any counterpart or other signature
to this Amendment that is delivered by facsimile shall be deemed for all
purposes as constituting good and valid execution and delivery by such party of
this Amendment.

      Section 5.   Governing Law.

            This Amendment shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether in the State of New York or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York.
