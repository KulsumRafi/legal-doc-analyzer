SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS,</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> the Company considers the establishment and maintenance of a sound and vital management to be essential to protecting and
enhancing the best interests of the Company and the shareholders of Mid-State Bancshares; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS,</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> the Company recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a change in control may
arise and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the
Company and the shareholders of Mid-State Bancshares; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS,</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and
encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company's management to their assigned duties without distraction in circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in
control of the Company. In particular, the Board believes it important, should the Company, Mid-State Bancshares or the shareholders of Mid-State Bancshares receive a proposal
for transfer of control of the Company, that Executive be able to assess and advise the Board and/or the Board of Directors of Mid-State Bancshares whether such proposal would be in the
best interests of the Company and Mid-State Bancshares' shareholders and to take such other action regarding such proposal as such Boards might determine to be appropriate, without being
influenced by the uncertainties of your own situation; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS,</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> the Board of Directors of the Company has approved this Agreement; </FONT></P>

subject to the Company's providing the benefits hereinafter specified in accordance with the terms hereof. </FONT></P>

for his benefit paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise in connection with, or arising out of, his employment with the Company or a Change
in Control (including the accelerated exercise of any stock options)(any such payment or benefit being a "Payment" or "Payments"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of
the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively
referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive will be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount equal to the total Excise Tax imposed on the
Executive as a result of such Payments (including the Excise Tax reimbursement due pursuant to this sentence and the Excise Taxes on any federal and state tax reimbursements due pursuant to the next
subsection). </FONT></P>

reimbursements due to the Executive pursuant
to this sentence. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the "total presumed federal and state taxes" that could be imposed on the Executive shall be conclusively calculated using a combined tax rate
equal to the sum of (a)&nbsp;the highest individual income tax rate in effect under (i)&nbsp;Federal tax law and (ii)&nbsp;the tax laws of the state in which the Executive resides on the date
that the payment under this Section&nbsp;8 is computed and (b)&nbsp;the hospital insurance portion of FICA. </FONT></P>

such other time as requested by the Company or by the Executive (provided the Executive reasonably believes that any of the Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax) and if the Accounting Firm
determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive with respect to a Payment or Payments, it shall furnish the Executive with an opinion reasonably acceptable to the Executive that no Excise
Tax will be imposed with respect to any such Payment or Payments. Within ten days of the delivery of the Determination to the Executive, the Executive shall have the right to dispute the Determination
(the "Dispute"). The Gross-Up Payment, if any, as determined pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8 shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the
Accounting Firm's determination. The existence of the Dispute shall not in any way affect the Executive's right to receive the Gross-Up Payment in accordance with the Determination. Upon
