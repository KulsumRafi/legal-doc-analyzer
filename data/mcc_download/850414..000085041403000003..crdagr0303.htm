any such payment and continuing through the first Banking Day following such
demand and thereafter at the Default Rate. The principal amount of any such

pursuant to <U>Section 2.5(c)</U> for its Pro Rata Share of any payment made by
the Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit shall thereupon acquire a pro rata
participation, to the extent of such reimbursement, in the claim of the Issuing

Borrower, the Issuing Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the
ratable benefit of those Lenders that had reimbursed the Issuing Lender pursuant

(rated &#147;B&#148; or better by &#147;A.M. Best&#146;s Insurance
Reports&#148;) as are customarily used by companies operating in the same
industry as Borrower and its Subsidiaries and reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent. Borrower shall furnish the Administrative Agent with a
schedule of all such insurance prepared by their insurance broker, and
certificates of insurance with respect thereto <U>(including</U> the text of the
lender&#146;s loss payable clause in favor of the Administrative Agent required
below), or such other evidence of insurance as the Administrative Agent may
require within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date. Borrower shall furnish
the Administrative Agent with a copy of each applicable policy within thirty
(30) days after the Closing Date. In the event Borrower fails to procure or
cause to be procured any such insurance or to timely pay or cause to be paid the
premium(s) on any such insurance, the Administrative Agent may do so for
Borrower but Borrower shall continue to be liable for the same. All casualty
insurance policies shall contain standard lender&#146;s loss payable clauses
issued in favor of the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Lenders)
indicating that the Administrative Agent is sole lender loss payee, under which
all losses thereunder shall be paid to the Administrative Agent (on behalf of
the Lenders) as the Administrative Agent&#146;s interest may appear. Such
policies shall expressly provide that the requisite insurance cannot be altered
or canceled without thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Administrative
Agent and shall insure the Administrative Agent notwithstanding the act or
neglect of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. Borrower hereby appoints the
Administrative Agent as its attorney-in-fact, exercisable at the Administrative
Agent&#146;s option only during the occurrence and continuance of a Default or
an Event of Default, and only to the extent the Obligations are outstanding, to
endorse any check which may be payable to Borrower and to file proofs of loss
with respect to any insurance claims, in order to collect the proceeds of such
insurance and any amount or amounts collected by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph may be applied by the
Administrative Agent to the Obligations. Borrower further covenants that all
insurance premiums due and owing under its current casualty policies have been
paid. Borrower also agrees to notify the Administrative Agent, promptly, upon
any receipt of a notice of termination, cancellation, or non-renewal from its
insurance company of any such policy.</FONT></P>

<U>Indemnification</U>. Each Lender shall, ratably in accordance with its Pro
Rata Share of all of the then applicable Commitments (if any of the Commitments
are then in effect) and/or in accordance with its proportion of the aggregate
Indebtedness then evidenced by the Notes (if all of the Commitments have then

out-of-pocket cost or expense incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery, amendment, waiver,

 <U>Successor
Administrative Agent</U>. The Administrative Agent may, and at the request of
the Requisite Lenders shall, resign as Administrative Agent upon reasonable
notice to the Lenders and Borrower effective upon acceptance of appointment by a
successor Administrative Agent. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as
Administrative Agent under this Agreement, the Requisite Lenders shall appoint
from among the Lenders a successor Administrative Agent for the Lenders, which
successor Administrative Agent shall be approved by Borrower (and such approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor Administrative
Agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting
with the Lenders and Borrower, a successor Administrative Agent from among the
Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor Administrative
Agent hereunder, such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to all the
rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the term
&#147;Administrative Agent&#148; shall mean such successor Administrative Agent
and the retiring Administrative Agent&#146;s appointment, powers and duties as

while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if no successor Administrative Agent has accepted appointment as
Administrative Agent by the date which is thirty (30)&#160;days following a
retiring Administrative Agent&#146;s notice of resignation, the retiring
Administrative Agent&#146;s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become
effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative
Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Requisite Lenders appoint a
successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. </FONT>

the case of an assignment to an Affiliate of the assigning Lender, to another
Lender or of the entire remaining rights and obligations of the assigning Lender
under this Agreement, the assignment shall not assign a portion of such
assigning Lender&#146;s Commitments and/or Advances owing to such assigning
Lender that is equivalent to less than $3,000,000, and (iv)&#160;the effective
date of any such assignment shall be as specified in the Assignment and
Acceptance, but not earlier than the date which is five&#160;(5) Banking Days

Acceptance. Upon the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance, the
Eligible Assignee named therein shall be a Lender for all purposes of this
Agreement, with the Commitments and/or Advances therein set forth and, to the
extent of such Commitments and/or Advances, the assigning Lender shall be
released from its further obligations under this Agreement. Borrower agrees that
it shall execute and deliver (against delivery by the assigning Lender to
Borrower of such Lender&#146;s Notes) to such assignee Lender, Notes evidencing
that assignee Lender&#146;s Commitments and/or Advances, and to the assigning
Lender, Notes evidencing the remaining balance of the Commitments and/or

Office a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register
(the &#147;<U>Register</U>&#148;) of the names and address of each of the
Lenders and the Pro Rata Share of the Commitments held by each Lender, giving
effect to each Assignment and Acceptance. The Register shall be available during
normal business hours for inspection by Borrower or any Lender upon reasonable
prior notice to the Administrative Agent. After receipt of a completed
Assignment and Acceptance executed by any Lender and an Eligible Assignee, and
receipt of an assignment fee of $3,500 from such Lender or Eligible Assignee,
the Administrative Agent shall, promptly following the effective date thereof,
provide to Borrower and the Lenders a revised <U>Schedule&#160;1.1</U> giving
effect thereto. Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall deem
and treat the Persons listed as Lenders in the Register as the holders and
owners of the Pro Rata Shares of the Facilities listed therein for all purposes
hereof, and no assignment or transfer of any Lender&#146;s rights and
obligations hereunder shall be effective, in each case unless and until an
Assignment and Acceptance effecting the assignment or transfer thereof shall
have been accepted by the Administrative Agent and recorded in the Register as
provided above. Prior to such recordation, all amounts owed with respect to the
applicable Pro Rata Shares of the Facilities shall be owed to the Lender listed
in the Register as the owner thereof, and any request, authority or consent of
any Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such authority or
consent, is listed in the Register as a Lender shall be conclusive and binding
on any subsequent holder, assignee or transferee of the corresponding Pro Rata
Shares of any of the Facilities.</FONT></P>

 <U>Sharing of

any right of setoff, banker&#146;s lien or counterclaim against Borrower, or
otherwise, receives payment of the Obligations held by it that is ratably more
than any other Lender, through any means, receives in payment of the Obligations
held by that Lender, then, subject to applicable Laws: (a)&#160;the Lender
exercising the right of setoff, banker&#146;s lien or counterclaim or otherwise
receiving such payment shall purchase, and shall be deemed to have
simultaneously purchased, from each of the other Lenders a participation in the
Obligations held by the other Lenders and shall pay to the other Lenders a
purchase price in an amount so that the share of the Obligations held by each
Lender after the exercise of the right of setoff, banker&#146;s lien or
counterclaim or receipt of payment shall be in the same proportion that existed
prior to the exercise of the right of setoff, banker&#146;s lien or counterclaim
or receipt of payment; and (b)&#160;such other adjustments and purchases of
participations shall be made from time to time as shall be equitable to ensure
that all of the Lenders share any payment obtained in respect of the Obligations
ratably in accordance with each Lender&#146;s share of the Obligations
immediately prior to, and without taking into account, the payment;
<U>provided</U> that, if all or any portion of a disproportionate payment
obtained as a result of the exercise of the right of setoff, banker&#146;s lien,
counterclaim or otherwise is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender by
Borrower or any Person claiming through or succeeding to the rights of Borrower,
the purchase of a participation shall be rescinded and the purchase price
thereof shall be restored to the extent of the recovery, but without interest.
Each Lender that purchases a participation in the Obligations pursuant to this
<U>Section&#160;11.10</U> shall from and after the purchase have the right to
give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under
this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the
same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the
Obligations purchased. Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements
and agrees that any Lender holding a participation in an Obligation so purchased
pursuant to this <U>Section&#160;11.10</U> may exercise any and all rights of
setoff, banker&#146;s lien or counterclaim with respect to the participation as
fully as if the Lender were the original owner of the Obligation purchased. </FONT>

<U>Indemnity by
Borrower</U>. Borrower agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless the
Administrative Agent and each Lender and their respective directors, officers,
agents, attorneys and employees (collectively the
<U>&#147;Indemnitees</U>&#148;) from and against: (a)&#160;any and all claims,
demands, actions or causes of action (<U>except</U> a claim, demand, action, or
cause of action for any amount excluded from the definition of &#147;Taxes&#148;
in <U>Section&#160;3.10(e)</U>) if the claim, demand, action or cause of action
arises out of or relates to any act or omission (or alleged act or omission) of
Borrower, any other Obligor, any Affiliate of any Obligor or any partner,
officer, director, stockholder, or other equity interest holder of any Obligor
relating to any of the Facilities, the use or contemplated use of proceeds of
any Borrowing, or the relationship of Borrower and the Lenders under this
Agreement; (b)&#160;any administrative or investigative proceeding by any
Governmental Agency arising out of or related to a claim, demand, action or
cause of action described in clause&#160;<U>(a)</U> above; and (c)&#160;any and
all liabilities, losses, reasonable costs or expenses (<U>including</U>
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and the reasonably allocated costs of attorneys
employed by any Indemnitee and disbursements of such attorneys and other
professional services) that any Indemnitee suffers or incurs as a result of the
assertion of any foregoing claim, demand, action or cause of action;
<U>provided</U> that no Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any
liability, loss, cost or expense caused by its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct or for any liability, loss, cost or expense asserted against it by
another Indemnitee. If any claim, demand, action or cause of action is asserted
against any Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall promptly notify Borrower, but the
failure to so promptly notify Borrower shall not affect Borrower&#146;s
obligations under this Section unless such failure materially prejudices
Borrower&#146;s right to participate in the contest of such claim, demand,
action or cause of action, as hereinafter provided. Such Indemnitee may (and
shall, if requested by Borrower in writing) contest the validity, applicability
and amount of such claim, demand, action or cause of action and shall permit
Borrower to participate in such contest. Any Indemnitee that proposes to settle
or compromise any claim or proceeding for which Borrower may be liable for
payment of indemnity hereunder shall give Borrower written notice of the terms
of such proposed settlement or compromise reasonably in advance of settling or
compromising such claim or proceeding and shall obtain Borrower&#146;s prior
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In connection
with any claim, demand, action or cause of action covered by this
<U>Section&#160;11.11</U> against more than one Indemnitee, all such Indemnitees
shall be represented by the same legal counsel (which may be a law firm engaged
by the Indemnitees or attorneys employed by an Indemnitee or a combination of
the foregoing) selected by the Indemnitees, <U>provided</U>, that if such legal
counsel determines in good faith that representing all such Indemnitees would or
could result in a conflict of interest under Laws or ethical principles
applicable to such legal counsel or that a defense or counterclaim is available
to an Indemnitee that is not available to all such Indemnitees, then to the
extent reasonably necessary to avoid such a conflict of interest or to permit
unqualified assertion of such a defense or counterclaim, each affected
Indemnitee shall be entitled to separate representation by legal counsel
selected by that Indemnitee, with all such legal counsel using reasonable
efforts to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort by counsel for all
Indemnitees; and <U>further</U> <U>provided</U> that the Administrative Agent
(as an Indemnitee) shall at all times be entitled to representation by separate
legal counsel (which may be a law firm or attorneys employed by the
Administrative Agent or a combination of the foregoing). Any obligation or
liability of Borrower to any Indemnitee under this <U>Section&#160;11.11</U>
shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement and the repayment
of all Borrowings and the payment and performance of all other Obligations owed
to the Lenders. </FONT>
