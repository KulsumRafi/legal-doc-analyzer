RE:  Employment Agreement of November 18, 2001

Dear Mr. Dunham:

         Please refer to the Employment Agreement, dated as of November 18,
2001, between you, Conoco Inc. and ConocoPhillips. The capitalized terms in the
Agreement will have the same meaning here, unless otherwise specified.

         Under your Employment Agreement, ConocoPhillips (called "New Parent" in
the Agreement) has agreed to provide you the compensation and benefits described

signing this letter, you acknowledge and agree that ConocoPhillips will satisfy
this obligation by causing its wholly owned subsidiary administering the payroll

benefits described in Section 2(b) of the Agreement.

                                                Sincerely,



                                                /s/ R. A. Harrington
