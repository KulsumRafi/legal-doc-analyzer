<PAGE>


DEFINITIONS - "I", "me" or "my" means each Borrower who signs this note and each
other person or legal entity (including guarantors, endorsers, and sureties) who
agrees to pay this note (together referred to as "us"). "You" or "your" means
the Lender and its successors and assigns.

APPLICABLE LAW - This note and any agreement securing this note will be governed
by the laws of the state of Arkansas. The federal Truth-in-Lending disclosures
on page 1 are disclosures only and are not intended to be terms of this
agreement. The fact that any part of this note cannot be enforced will not
affect the rest of this note. Any change to this note or any agreement securing
this note must [be in writing] and signed by you and me.

PAYMENTS - Each payment I make on this note will be applied first to any charges
I owe other than principal and interest, then to interest that is due, and
finally to principal that is due. No late charge will be assessed on any payment
when the [very] delinquency is due to late fees assessed on earlier payments and
the payment otherwise a full payment. The actual amount of my final payment will
depend on my payment record.

PREPAYMENT - I may prepay this loan in whole or in part at any time. If I prepay
in part, I must still make each later payment in the original amount as it
becomes due until this note is paid in full.

USURY - The interest rate and other charges on this loan will never exceed the
interest rate or charge allowed by law for this loan.

ACCRUAL METHOD - The amount of interest rate that I will pay on this loan will
be calculated using the interest rate and accrual method stated on page 1. For
interest calculation, the accrual method will determine the number of days in a
year. If no accrual method is stated, then you may use any reasonable accrual
method for calculating interest.

POST MATURITY INTEREST - Interest will accrue on the principal balance remaining
unpaid after final maturity at the rate specified on page 1. For purposes of
this section, final maturity occurs:

   If this loan is payable on demand, on the date you make demand for payment;

   If this loan is payable on demand with alternate payment date(s), on the date
you make demand for payment or on the final alternate payment date, whichever is
earlier;

   On the date of the last scheduled payment of principal; or

   On the date you accelerate the due date of this loan (demand immediate
payment).

REAL ESTATE SECURITY - If this loan is secured by real estate the existence of a
default and your remedies for such a default will be determined by applicable
law, by the terms of any separate instrument creating the security interest and,
to the extent not prohibited by law and not contrary to the terms of the
separate security instrument, by this agreement.

DEFAULT - Subject to any limitations in the "REAL ESTATE SECURITY" paragraph
above, I will be in default if any one or more of the following occurs:

   I fail to make a payment in full when due;

   I die, am declared incompetent, or become insolvent;

   I fail to keep any promise I have made in connection with this loan;

   I fail to pay, or keep any other promise, on any other loan or agreement I
have with you;

   I make any written statement or provide any financial information that is
untrue or inaccurate at the time it is provided;

   Any creditor of mine attempts to collect any debt I owe through court
proceedings, set-off or self-help repossession;

   The Property is damaged, destroyed or stolen;

   I fail to provide any additional security that you may require;

   Any legal entity (such as a partnership or corporation) that has agreed to
pay this note merges, dissolves, reorganizes, ends its business or existence, or
a partner or majority stockholder dies or is declared incompetent; or

   Anything else happens that causes you to believe that you will have
   difficulty collecting the amount I owe you.

   If any of us are in default on this note or any security agreement, you may
exercise your remedies against any or all of us.

REMEDIES - Subject to any limitations in the "REAL ESTATE SECURITY" paragraph
above, if I am in default on this loan or any agreement securing this loan, you
may:

   Make unpaid principal, earned interest and all other agreed charges I owe you
under this loan immediately due;

   Use the right of set-off as explained below;

   Demand more security or new parties obligated to pay this loan (or both) in
return for not using any other remedy;

   Make a claim for any and all insurance benefits or refunds that may be
available from my default;

   Use any remedy you have under state or federal law; and

   Use any remedy given to you in any agreement securing this loan.

   By choosing any one or more of these remedies you do not give up your right
to use another remedy later. By deciding not to use any remedy should I be in
default, you do not waive your right to later consider the event a default if it
happens again.

COSTS OF COLLECTION AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - I agree to pay you all reasonable
costs you incur to collect this debt or realize on any security. This includes,
unless prohibited by law, reasonable attorney's fees. This provision also will
apply if I file a petition or any other claim for relief under any bankruptcy
rule or law of the United States, or if such petition or other claim for relief
is filed against me by another.

SET OFF - I agree that you may set off any amount due and payable under this
note against any right I have to receive money from you.

   "Right to receive money from you" means:

   Any deposit account balance I have with you;

   Any money owed to me on an item presented to you or in your possession for
   collection or exchange; and

   Any repurchase agreement or other nondeposit obligation.

   "Any amount due and payable under this note" means the total amount of which
you are entitled to demand payment under the terms of this note at the time you
set off. This total includes any balance the due date for which you properly
accelerate under this note.

   If my right to receive money from you is also owned by someone who has not
agreed to pay this note, your right of set off will apply to my interest in the
obligation and to any other amounts I could withdraw on my sole request or
endorsement. Your right of set off does not apply to an account or other
obligation where my rights arise only in a representative capacity. It also does
not apply to any Individual Retirement Account or other tax-deferred retirement
account.

   You will not be liable for the dishonor of any check when the dishonor occurs
because you set off this debt against any of my accounts. I agree to hold you
harmless from any such claims arising as a result of your exercise of your right
to set off.

OTHER SECURITY - Any present or future agreement securing any other debt I owe
you also will secure the payment of this loan. Property securing another debt
will not secure this loan if such property is my principal dwelling and you fail
to provide any required notice of right of rescission. Also, property securing
another debt will not secure this loan to the extent such property is in
household goods.

OBLIGATIONS INDEPENDENT - I understand that my obligation to pay this loan is
independent of the obligation of any other person who has also agreed to pay it.
You may, without notice, release me or any of us, give up any right you may have
against any of us, extend new credit to any of us, or renew or change this note
one or more times and for any term, and I will still be obligated to pay this
loan. You may, without notice, fail to perfect your security interest in,
impair, or release the security and I will still be obligated to pay this
loan.

WAIVER - I waive (to the extent permitted by law) demand, presentment, protest,
notice of dishonor and notice of protest.

PRIVACY - I agree that from time to time you may receive credit information
about me from others, including other lenders and credit reporting agencies. I
agree that you may furnish on a regular basis credit and experience information
regarding my debt to others seeking such information. To the extent permitted
by law, I agree that you will not be liable for any claim arising from the use
of information provided to you by others or for providing such information to
others.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - I will give you any financial statements or information
that you feel is necessary. All financial statements and information I give you
will be correct and complete.

PURCHASE MONEY LOAN - If this is a purchase money loan, you may include the
name of the lender on the check or draft of the bank.

SECURED OBLIGATIONS - This security agreement secures this loan (including all
extensions, renewals, refinancings and modifications) and any other debt I have
with you now or later. Property described in this security agreement will not
secure other such debts if you fail to give any required notice of the right of
rescission with respect to the Property. Also, this security agreement will not
secure other debts if this security interest is in household goods and the other
debt is a consumer loan.

<PAGE>

This security agreement will last until it is discharged in writing.

   For the sole purpose of determining the extent of a purchase money security
interest arising under this security agreement:

(a) Payments on any nonpurchase money loan also secured by this agreement will
  not be deemed to apply to the purchase money loan; and

(b) Payments on the purchase money loan will be deemed to apply first to the
  nonpurchase money portion of the loan, if any, and then to the purchase money
  obligations in the order in which the items were acquired.

   No security interest will be terminated by application of this formula.
"Purchase money loan" means any loan the proceeds of which, in whole or in part,
are used to acquire any property securing the loan and all extensions, renewals,
consolidations and refinancings of such loan.

PROPERTY - The word "Property" as used here, includes all property that is
listed in the security agreement on page 1. If a general description is used,
the word Property includes all my property fitting the general description.
Property also means all benefits that arise from the described Property
(including all proceeds, insurance benefits, payments from other interest,
dividends, stock splits and voting rights). It also means property that now or
later is attached to, is a part of, or results from the Property.

OWNERSHIP AND DUTIES TOWARD PROPERTY - Unless a co-owner(s) of the Property
signed a third party agreement, I represent that I own all the Property. I will
defend the Property against any other claim. I agree to do whatever you require
to perfect your interest and keep your priority. I will not do anything to harm
your position.

   I will keep the Property in my possession (except if pledged and delivered to
you). I will keep it in good repair and use it only for its intended purposes. I
will keep it at my address unless we agree otherwise in writing.

   I will not try to sell or transfer the Property, or permit the Property to
become attached to any real estate, without your written consent. I will pay all
taxes and charges on the Property as they become due. I will inform you of any
loss or damage to the Property. You have the right of reasonable access in order
to inspect the Property.

INSURANCE - I agree to buy insurance on the Property against the risks of loss
or damage for the amounts you require and to furnish you continuing proof of
coverage. I will name you as loss payee on any such policy. You may require
added security on this loan if you agree that insurance proceeds may be used to
repair or replace the Property. I agree that if the insurance proceeds do not
cover the amounts I still owe you, I will pay the difference. I will buy the
insurance from a firm authorized to do business in Arkansas. The firm will be
reasonably acceptable to you. I will keep the insurance until all debts secured
by this agreement are paid. If I fail to obtain or maintain this insurance, or
name you as a loss payee, you may obtain insurance to protect your interest in
the Property. This insurance may include coverages not required by me. This
insurance may be written by a company other than one I would choose. It may be
written at a rate higher than a rate I could obtain if I purchased the property
insurance required by this Contract. You will add the premium for this insurance
to the amount I owe you. Any amount you pay will be due immediately. This amount
will earn finance charges from the date paid.

DEFAULT AND REMEDIES - If I am in default, in addition to the remedies listed in
the note portion of this document and subject to any of the limitations in the
"REAL ESTATE SECURITY" paragraph, you may (after giving notice and waiting a
period of time, if required by law):

(a) Pay taxes or other charges, or purchase any required insurance , if I fail
   to do these things (but you are not required to do so). You may add the
   amount you pay to this loan and accrue interest on that amount at the
   interest rate disclosed on page 1 until paid in full;

(b) Require me to gather the Property and any related records and make it
   available to you in a reasonable fashion;

(c) Take immediate possession of the Property, but in doing so you may not
   breach the peace or unlawfully enter onto my premises. You may sell, lease or
   dispose of the Property as provided by law. You may apply what you receive
   from the sale of the Property to your expenses and then to the debt. If what
   you receive from the sale of the Property is less than what I owe you, you
   may take me to court to recover the difference (to the extent permitted by
   law); and

(d) Keep the property to satisfy the debt.

   I agree that when you must give notice to me of your intended sale or
disposition of the Property, the notice is reasonable if it is sent to me at my
last known address by first class mail 10 days before the intended sale or
disposition. I agree to inform you in writing of any change in my address.

FILING - A copy of this security agreement may be used as a financing statement
when allowed by law.

                        THIRD PARTY AGREEMENT

   For the purposes of the provisions within this enclosure, "I," "me" or "my"
means the person signing below and "you" means the Lender identified on page 1.

   I agree to give you a security interest in the Property that is described on
page 1. I agree to the terms of this note and security agreement but I am in no
way personally liable for payment of the debt. This means that if the Borrower
defaults, my interest in the secured Property may be used to satisfy the
Borrower's debt. I agree that you may, without releasing me or the Property from
this Third Party Agreement and without notice or demand upon me, extend new
credit to any borrower, renew or change this note or security agreement one or
more times an for any term, or fail to perfect your security interest in,
impair, or release any security (including guaranties) for the obligations of
any borrower.

   I HAVE RECEIVED A COMPLETED COPY OF THIS NOTE AND SECURITY
AGREEMENT.

                         NOTICE TO COSIGNER

   You (the cosigner) are being asked to guaranty this debt. Think carefully
before you do. If the borrower doesn't pay the debt, you will have to. Be sure
you can afford to pay if you have to, and that you want to accept this
responsibility.

   You may have to pay up to the full amount of the debt if the borrower does
not pay. You also may have to pay late fees or collection costs, which increase
this amount.

   The creditor can collect this debt from you without first trying to collect
from the borrower. The creditor can use the same collection methods against you
that can be used against the borrower, such as suing you, garnishing your wages,
etc. If this debt is over in default, that fact may become part of your credit
record.

   This notice is not the contract that makes you liable for the debt.
