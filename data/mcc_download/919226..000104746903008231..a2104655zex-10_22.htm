accepts employment with the Company as Vice President and General Manager of the Company's Container Division. During the Employment Term (as hereinafter defined), Executive will have the title,

by the Company Without Cause, or Voluntary Termination by the Executive for Good Reason.</U> If the Company terminates the
Executive's employment other than for Cause, or the Executive voluntarily terminates his employment for Good Reason, in addition to the benefits payable under (a), the Company will pay the following
amounts and provide the following benefits: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Base Salary and annual bonus that the Company would have paid under the Agreement had the Executive's employment continued to the end of the Employment Term. For
this purpose, annual bonus will be determined as the highest of (A)&nbsp;the actual bonus paid for the fiscal year immediately preceding such termination, (B)&nbsp;the target bonus for the fiscal
year in which such termination occurs, or (C)&nbsp;the actual bonus attained for the fiscal year in which such termination occurs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued
coverage under the Company's medical, dental, life, disability, pension, profit sharing and other executive benefit plans through the end of the Employment
Term, at the same cost to the Executive as in effect on the date of the Executive's termination. If the Company determines that the Executive cannot participate in any benefit plan because he is not
actively performing services for the Company, the Company may provide such benefits under an alternate arrangement, such as through the purchase of an individual insurance policy that provides similar
benefits or, if applicable, through a nonqualified pension or profit sharing plan. To the extent that the Executive's compensation is necessary for determining the amount of any such continued
coverage or benefits, such compensation (Base Salary and annual bonus) through the end of the Employment Term shall be at the highest rate in effect during the 12-month period immediately
preceding the Executive's termination of employment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company will provide the Executive with reimbursement for club dues on the same basis on which the Executive was receiving such reimbursement prior to his
employment termination through the end of the Employment Term; and the Company will bear the cost of such reimbursement, at the same level in effect immediately prior to the Executive's employment
termination. Reimbursement otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to this paragraph shall be reduced to the extent comparable benefits are actually received by or made available to the
Executive without cost during the 36&nbsp;month period following the Executive's employment termination. The Executive shall report to the Company any such benefits actually received by or made
available to the Executive. </FONT></P>

Reason.</U> For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following without the Executive's
consent: (i)&nbsp;assigning duties to the Executive that are materially inconsistent with those of the position of Vice President and General Manager for similar companies in similar industries
(except to the extent the Company promotes the Executive to a higher executive position); (ii)&nbsp;requiring the Executive to report to other than the Company's President and Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer or the Company's Board; (iii)&nbsp;the failure of the Company to pay any portion of the Executive's compensation within 10&nbsp;days of
the date such compensation is due; (iv)&nbsp;the Company requires the Executive to relocate his principal business office to a location not within 50 miles of either the Company's principal business
office located in the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area, or the Company's principal business office located in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area (provided, that, the Company's requiring the
Executive to relocate his principal office from Chicago to St. Louis, or from St. Louis to Chicago, will not constitute Good Reason); or (v)&nbsp;the Company's failure to continue in effect any cash
or stock-based incentive or bonus plan, pension plan, welfare benefit plan or other benefit plan, program or arrangement, unless the aggregate value of all such arrangements provided to the Executive
after such discontinuance is not materially less than the aggregate value as of the Effective Date. The Executive's termination for a Good Reason under clause&nbsp;(i) or (ii)&nbsp;above must be
preceded by written notice to the Company and an opportunity to cure the alleged deficiencies. For purposes of this paragraph, "Company" shall mean the Company and, following any Change in Control,
the Surviving Corporation or, if applicable, the Parent Corporation (as those terms are defined in Section&nbsp;6(d)). </FONT></P>

For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean the Executive's: (i)&nbsp;willful and continued failure to substantially perform
his duties as an executive of the Company (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to
the Executive by the Board, which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that the Executive has not substantially performed his duties, and which gives the Executive at
least 30&nbsp;days to cure such alleged deficiencies, (ii)&nbsp;willful misconduct, which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise, or (iii)&nbsp;engaging
in egregious misconduct involving serious moral turpitude </FONT></P>

plans, at the same cost to the Executive as in effect on the date of the Change in Control (or, if lower, as in effect at any time thereafter). If the Company determines that the Executive cannot
participate in any benefit plan because he is not actively performing services for the Company, the Company may provide such benefits under an alternate arrangement, such as through the purchase of an
individual insurance policy that provides similar benefits. The amount of such continued coverage shall be determined, if applicable, by adding 36 additional months of age and service to the
Executive's actual age and service as of the Executive's termination date and as if the Executive earned compensation during such 36-month period at the rate in effect during the
12-month period immediately preceding his termination date. The Executive's eligibility for any retiree medical or life coverage following such termination date shall also be determined by
