Board of Directors recognizes that it is essential, in the best interests of the Corporation, that the Corporation retain the continuing dedication of the Executive
to his office and employment and that this can best be accomplished if the personal uncertainty facing the Executive in the event of a

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Board of Directors further believes that the service of the Executive to the Corporation requires that the Executive receive fair treatment, particularly in the
event of a termination of employment or loss of office following a material change in the ownership or the Executive's role within the organization of the Corporation where the Executive does not
receive an offer of employment within the Corporation, an affiliate, associate or successor of the Corporation comparable to or better than his present employment; </FONT></P>
