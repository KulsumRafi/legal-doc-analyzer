                                SUPPLY AGREEMENT

This Supply Agreement (hereinafter the "Agreement") is made and entered into by

     WHEREAS, Buyer wishes to assure itself of an ongoing business relationship
with Seller, which is beneficial to Buyer in terms of assuring that Buyer has
access in sufficient quantities to the Seller's latest products and technology
in the Buyer's business, and other complementary benefits; and

     WHEREAS, Buyer previously entered into a Supply Agreement with Seller,
dated as of May 1, 1998; and subsequently revised and extended April 30, 2002,
June 21, 2002, October 22, 2002 and November 26, 2002 (the "Existing Supply
Agreement"); and

     WHEREAS, Buyer and Seller now desire to enter into this Agreement, pursuant
to which Buyer will purchase certain of its requirements of the Products from
Seller, in replacement of the Existing Supply Agreement, in order to extend the
term of the relationship between Buyer and Seller, and to put into effect for
the term hereof (as defined in Section 11) the current pricing structure as

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of Ten Dollars ($10.00) and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

     1.   Requirements Contract - For the term hereof (as defined in Section

          must be purchased from Seller.

     2.   Definition of Products - For purposes of this Agreement, the parties
          agree that the following are the defined "Products" referenced in this
          Agreement;

               a)   All coin-operated or card-operated washing machines and
                    front load washers;

               b)   All coin-operated or card-operated dryers, stacked dryers,
                    and tumbler dryers; and

               c)   All new replacement and new repair parts for any and all of
                    Seller's coin-operated or card-operated washing machines,
                    dryers, frontload washers, stacked dryers and tumbler dryers
                    owned by, leased to or serviced by Buyer.

     3.   Price - The prices to be charged Buyer will be **OMITTED PURSUANT TO
          CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST**

          All prices are stated on an FOB shipping point basis, except Seller
          will prepay freight on orders of 42 or more route style products of
          Seller's washers and dryers (21 or more for route style stacked
          dryers) for shipments within the continental United States and, for
          shipments into Mexico, will prepay freight to a destination point
          selected by Buyer on the U.S. - Mexican border. For shipments of home
          style products to Appliance Warehouse, Seller will prepay freight on
          shipments of 12 units or more. For shipments of all products for
          distribution, seller will prepay freight on shipments of full
          truckloads of equipment [number of units will vary depending on size
          and mix of models].

          The current prices to be charged Buyer for replacement and repair
          parts are those set forth in Seller's published parts price lists,
          stated as either a net price or a suggested list price; however, if
          such price is listed as a suggested list price, Buyer shall be charged
          suggested list price less a **OMITTED PURSUANT TO CONFIDENTIAL
          TREATMENT REQUEST**

          Seller reserves the right to select the carrier and shipping point for
          Products, as long as current transit times are not materially
          affected. Payment terms shall be **OMITTED PURSUANT TO CONFIDENTIAL
          TREATMENT REQUEST**; provided, however, that Seller retains the right
          to adjust payment terms in the event that Buyer fails to maintain its
          timeliness of payment in all material respects (and after notice there
          is no cure within thirty (30) days).

     4.   Rights with Respect to Future Prices - Seller shall have the right to
          change the prices charged Buyer for Products, except for "Special"
          models, upon sixty (60) days prior written notice. The percentage
          increases in prices by Seller shall not exceed the percentage price
          increases which are implemented with respect to Seller's other
          customers as documented by Seller's published manufacturer's list

          prices. **OMITTED PURSUANT TO CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST**

     5.   Competitive Product Subject to the terms hereof and in consideration
          of Seller's agreement to provide significant discount pricing, Buyer
          agrees to purchase at least ** OMITTED PURSUANT TO CONFIDENTIAL
          TREATMENT REQUEST ** of its needed Products from Seller during the
          term of the Agreement. In addition, if Seller is unable to deliver
          Products which Buyer has ordered within ten (10) days of the date such
          Products would be shipped in the ordinary course of Seller's business,
          Buyer has the right to instead purchase a like number of pieces of
          equipment of comparable grade and quality from any other person;
          provided that any such failures to deliver Products within 45 days
          from the date such Products were ordered shall be deemed to be a
          Default hereunder. In the event Buyer requires certain items of
          laundry equipment with respect to which none of the Products
          manufactured by Seller substantially conform to the specifications of
          such equipment as required by Buyer, then, notwithstanding the
          provisions contained in the first sentence of this Section 5, Buyer
          shall be free to purchase such equipment from any other person.

          In the event, Buyer receives a proposal from a customer specifying
          certain equipment other than Seller's and after a good faith effort to
          convince the customer to purchase Buyers equipment customer demands
          other equipment, such equipment will be excluded from the **OMITTED
          PURSUANT TO CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST** requirement.

     6.   Technical Support - Seller will commit resources to work directly with
          Buyer on projects mutually beneficial to both parties, including but
          not limited to audit control, electronic display, card-actuated
          washers and dryers and stacked frontload washer/dryer combinations.
          This is required by Buyer to ensure timely response to competitive new
          product developments and to allow Buyer to be more competitive by
          offering more efficient customer friendly laundry equipment services.

     7.   Forecasting and Logistics - Three business days prior to the beginning
          of each month, the Buyer shall provide Seller a rolling 90 day
          forecast of monthly requirements for each of the product categories,
          as defined in Section 2 (a) of the Seller's route business except that
          the first 30 days of the forecast shall be by model. Quantities
          provided in the forecast will not be binding on Buyer but only serve
          to evidence the good faith estimate of future requirements.

          Buyer and Seller will work cooperatively and use their good faith
          efforts to optimize order processing and distribution logistics using
          the following guidelines:

               a)   The locations listed below will order in full truckload
                    quantities:

                    Cranbury, NJ     Glendale, CA

                    Union City, CA

               b)   Intermodel shipments (truckloads on trains) will be made to
                    these locations with the associated estimated transit time:

                       Location      Transit Time

                    Union City, CA     3-4 days

               c)   Buyer must order in increments of 6 for topload washers,
                    electric dryers, and gas dryers and in increments of 3 for
                    stacked dryers - gas and stacked dryers - electric.

     8.   Product Reliability - Buyer will share, with Seller, service history
          and product reliability data which is readily available to Buyer
          concerning the performance of Seller's products.

     9.   Warranty - All Products sold to Buyer shall be sold to Buyer with
          Seller's standard commercial limited parts warranties, unless
          otherwise specified by Seller and mutually agreed to in writing by
          Buyer in advance of any sales; except, however, the Speed Queen
          branded route and homestyle Washers, Dryers and Stack Dryers shipped
          by Seller to Buyer on or after January 27, 1997 shall be sold to Buyer
          without warranty, provided, however, that Seller shall reimburse Buyer
          for any cost of material incurred by Buyer which is attributable to
          Seller's verified "Epidemic Failure" of component parts, as well as
          labor allowances to be agreed upon by Seller and Buyer. An "Epidemic
          Failure" of a component part occurs when there is in excess of a
          **OMITTED PURSUANT TO CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST** failure rate
          for the preceding twelve (12) months for that component based on
          quantities shipped to Buyer. Seller will extend standard warranty on
          all electronic control boards of Money Master, Net Master and MDC
          products. Seller will continue to extend standard warranty on all
          distribution-style products.

          Buyer reserves the right to purchase the Speed Queen branded Washers,
          Dryers and Stack Dryers with Seller's standard commercial limited
          parts warranties by paying the extra amount specified in Exhibit B
          upon sixty (60) days written notice. If the Buyer chooses to buy with
          warranty during the term of this Agreement, then the Buyer may not
          make another election to buy without warranty during the remainder
          of the Agreement.

     10.  Default and Arbitration - Each of the following shall constitute an
          Event of Default under this Agreement:

**Multiple asterisks throughout this Agreement indicate that the portion of this
document so marked has been omitted as a confidential portion of this document

                                        4

          a)   Default in the payment when due of any amount owed to either
               Party by the other under this Agreement, if such failure
               continues for a period of thirty (30) days after payment was due;

          b)   Default in the obligation to obtain all Products from Seller in
               the manner set forth in Sections 1, 2 and 5, if such failure
               continues for a period of thirty (30) days after notice by Seller
               of such default; and

          c)   Default in any of Seller's obligations to Buyer hereunder.

     Upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default hereunder,
     Seller, in the case of an Event of Default under clause A or B of this
     Section 10, and Buyer, in the case of an Event of Default under clause A or
     C of this Section 10, shall have the non- exclusive right to commence
     appropriate proceedings in any state court located in New York, New York,
     or in the federal courts for the Southern District of New York, Buyer and
     Seller hereby agreeing that it irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of
     such courts and waives, to the fullest extent such party may effectively do
     so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such
     action or proceeding. The foregoing notwithstanding, if there is a dispute
     arising out of any of the other terms of this Agreement, such dispute shall
     be immediately submitted to arbitration in New York, New York, by a retired
     judge provided by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service in
     accordance of the commercial rules then in effect of the American
     Arbitration Association, and any award of such arbitration shall be final
     and binding upon the parties.

     11.  Term

               CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST** commencing on **OMITTED PURSUANT

               PURSUANT TO CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST**.

          b)   Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon the
               occurrence of a "Change of Control" (as hereafter defined)

               specifying a termination date of not less than 120 days following
               the later of the date upon which such "Change of Control"
               occurred or the date of such notice. For purposes of this
               Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have occurred
               upon the earliest of the following events: (i) upon the sale,
               transfer or other disposition, on a cumulative basis subsequent
               to the date of this Agreement, of equity securities in a party

               exercise actual control over the direction and management of
               Buyer or CLC; or (iii) the sale or other disposition of all or
               substantially all of the assets of Buyer; provided, however, that
               no Change of Control hereunder shall be deemed to have occurred
               following the sale or issuance by Buyer or CLC of any class of
               equity securities if such securities are sold in a transaction
               pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared

          or to such other address as each party may designate for itself by
          like notice.

     13.  Choice of Law - This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
          State of New York.

     14.  Successors and Assigns - This Agreement shall be binding upon and
          inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
          successors, legal representatives, and assigns. This Agreement may not
          be assigned, transferred or otherwise conveyed by Seller without
          Buyer's prior written consent in the event the proposed assignee or
          transferee is a manufacturer, seller or distributor of Products. Such
          consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or unduly
          delayed in the event the proposed assignee or transferee is not a
          manufacturer, seller or distributor of Products. This Agreement may
          not be assigned, transferred or otherwise conveyed by Buyer without
          Seller's prior written consent, which consent shall not be
          unreasonably withheld, conditioned or unduly delayed.

     15.  Counterparts Clause; Telecopy Execution - This Agreement may be
          executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be an original
          and all of which shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
          Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile
          shall be equally as effective as delivery of a manually executed
          counterpart of this Agreement. Any party delivering an executed
          counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile shall also deliver a
          manually executed counterpart of this Agreement, but the failure to
          deliver a manually executed counterpart shall not affect the validity,
          enforceability, and binding effect of this Agreement.

     16.  Future Acquisitions - Buyer may, in the future, acquire other route
          businesses from independent operators and operate such either under a
          new wholly-owned subsidiary (if, for example, such acquisition is
          structured as a stock purchase with the acquired corporation not
          thereafter being merged into one of the entities comprising Buyer) or
          under one of Buyer's existing operating entities (if, for example,
          such acquisition is structured as. an asset purchase). In the event
          that Buyer consummates any such future acquisitions up to a limit of
          $50 million in the aggregate, Buyer or its applicable subsidiary shall
          remain entitled to the same benefits hereunder as if such person were
          a party, as an additional "Buyer," to this Agreement, and in the event
          any such acquisition results in a new wholly-owned or controlled
          subsidiary of Buyer, Buyer shall cause such new subsidiary up to a
          limit of $50 million of acquisitions for such subsidiaries to execute
          an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Seller, adopting
          the terms of this Agreement as a "Buyer" hereunder and agreeing to be
          bound by all the terms and provisions hereof; provided, however, that
          the foregoing shall not require Buyer or any such new subsidiary to
          take any action for acquisitions in excess of $50 million and that is
          prohibited by, or would otherwise result in a default under or breach
          of, any

          party and, provided further that, until such time as any such new
          subsidiary has adopted this Agreement, Buyer shall cause such new
          subsidiary to abide and be bound by the terms hereof in the same
          manner as if such new subsidiary were a party hereto. However, in the
          event Buyer's new subsidiary is already a party to a non-cancelable
          supply agreement (exclusive of a supply agreement which was entered
          into by such new subsidiary in contemplation of Buyer's acquisition or
          formation of such new subsidiary), Buyer is not bound to cause such
          new subsidiary to execute an agreement adopting the terms of this
          Agreement or to abide and be bound by the terms hereof in any manner.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, Buyer shall use reasonable
          efforts to obtain the cancellation or termination of any provision
          preventing a new subsidiary from becoming a party to this Agreement,
          provided that Buyer shall not be obligated to expend funds or take any
          other action adverse to Buyer's interests in order to obtain such
          cancellation or termination, and further provided that upon the
          expiration of any such restrictive provision, Buyer shall cause such
          new subsidiary to join in and become a party to this Agreement.

     17.  Incorporation of Schedules - All Exhibits and Schedules attached
          hereto are by this reference incorporated herein and made a part
          hereof for all purposes as fully set forth herein

     18.  Section Headings - Section headings contained in this Agreement are
          for convenience and reference only and shall not be deemed a part of
          this Agreement.

     19.  Severability - If for any reason whatsoever, any one or more of the
          provisions of this Agreement shall be held or deemed to be
          inoperative, unenforceable or invalid as applied to any particular
          case or in all cases, such circumstances shall not have the effect of
          rendering such provision invalid in any other case or of rendering any
          of the other provisions of this Agreement inoperative, unenforceable
          or invalid.

     20.  Confidentiality - Each of Buyer and Seller shall maintain, and shall
          cause each of their respective employees and officers to maintain, the
          confidentiality of this Agreement and of all other confidential
          proprietary information concerning the parties hereto and their
          respective businesses which is obtained by either party in connection
          with the negotiation and performance of the transactions contemplated
          herein; provided, however, that each of Buyer and Seller, and their
          respective officers and employees, may disclose information concerning
          this Agreement or any other such non-public information to their
          respective external accountants and attorneys, or as may be required
          by any applicable law (including, without limitation, the reporting
          obligations of either Buyer or Seller under the Securities Act of
          1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the rules and
          regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission), or
          by any order of any judicial or administrative proceeding. In
          addition, each of Buyer and Seller may disclose any such non-public
          information (i) pursuant to any law, rule, regulation, direction,
          request or order of any judicial, administrative or regulatory

          authority or proceeding (whether or not having the force or effect of
          law), or (ii) to (a) any person providing financing to either such
          party hereto, (b) any rating agency or comparable body in connection
          with any financing provided to either party hereto, or (c) any
          prospective or actual successor or assignee of either party hereto,
          provided that each such person to whom disclosure is made pursuant to
          this clause (ii) is informed of the confidential nature of such
          information in a manner consistent with the practice of the party
          making such disclosure when such party is making disclosure of its own
          confidential or proprietary information to persons of a similar
          nature. The foregoing notwithstanding, each of Buyer and Seller agree
          that they shall use the information contained in this Agreement, and
          any other confidential proprietary information which they obtain
          concerning the other party, only for the purpose of performing their
          duties and obligations under this Agreement, and that they shall not
          use or exploit such information for their own benefit, or for the
          benefit of any other person, without the other party's prior written
          consent.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall be responsible
          for any breach of this confidentiality provision by any of their
          respective representatives, agents, advisors or providers of
          financing. With respect to any information to be disclosed pursuant to
          applicable law, legal process or by any order of any judicial,
          regulatory or administrative proceeding, the disclosing party will
          promptly notify the non-disclosing party thereof and cooperate with
          the non-disclosing party to the extent legally permissible if such
          non-disclosing party should seek to obtain an order or other reliable
          assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded designated
          portions of the confidential information.

     21.  Complete Agreement - This Agreement, those documents expressly
          referred to herein and other documents of even date herewith (i)
          embody the complete agreement and understanding among the parties, and
          (ii) supersede and preempt any prior agreements (including the
          Existing Supply Agreement), summaries of terms and conditions,
          understandings, or representations by or among the parties, written or
          oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.
          No waiver of any provision hereof shall be effective unless set forth
          by written instrument and executed by the parties hereto.
