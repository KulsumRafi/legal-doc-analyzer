                                 AMENDMENT NO. 1
                                     TO THE
                            TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT
                           DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
                   (AMENDED AND RESTATED AS OF AUGUST 1, 2001)


1.       Section 3.6(b) is amended to read as follows:

                  (b)      Each Eligible Employee, whose compensation is payable
         under an employment agreement with an Employing Company which provides
         for deferred compensation, may elect to have transferred to and
         deferred under his or her Deferred Compensation Account in the Plan the
         balance, in whole or in part, of the compensation previously deferred
         under such agreement, subject to the terms thereof. Such an election
         can be made at any time, but only once in the Eligible Employee's
         lifetime. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Eligible Employee who has
         made an election to defer compensation under an employment agreement
         may, prior to the date that such compensation would be payable but for
         such election, make a subsequent election directing that the deferral
         be made under the Plan instead of under the employment agreement.

2.       Section 4.4 is amended to read as follows:

         4.4      CHANGES IN INVESTMENT DIRECTION. A Participant or Inactive
         Participant may make one Investment Direction in each calendar quarter,
         separately with respect to either or both new deferrals or previous
         deferrals and any earnings thereon; provided, however, that one
         additional Investment Direction may be made in the fourth quarter of
         2001, also separately with respect to either or both new deferrals or
         previous deferrals and any earnings thereon.

3.       Items 1 and 2 are effective October 15, 2001.
