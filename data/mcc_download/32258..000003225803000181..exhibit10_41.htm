work with Titan&rsquo;s attorneys and representatives, to prepare
for and provide deposition and/or trial testimony and to take
whatever other steps are necessary to assist&nbsp; in the handling
of such legal matters and prosecution/defense of such claims.&nbsp;
Demarco further agrees that he will make himself available to
consult with Titan business people in connection with the
transition of his business responsibilities as well as such other
business matters that may be reasonably requested by Titan. Titan
will reimburse Demarco for any reasonable travel expenses incurred
on its behalf and at its advance written request in rendering
assistance required by this Section 5, provided that Demarco
submits documentation in a form acceptable to Titan to substantiate
such expenses.&nbsp; The Parties agree that the request of Titan
for Demarco cooperation will not unreasonably interfere with
Demarco&rsquo;s employment with a third party.</font></p>

Titan&rsquo;s proprietary information and the facts and terms of
this Agreement from disclosure), may be the subject of an action
for injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction as well

disputes about the validity, interpretation, or effect of this

California&nbsp; before an experienced arbitrator who either is a
retired judge or is licensed to practice law in the State of
California and who has been selected in accordance with this
provision.&nbsp; The arbitrator may not modify or change this
Agreement in any way.&nbsp; The Parties and any other Released
Party who agrees to arbitrate an arbitrable dispute under this
paragraph agree to submit to personal jurisdiction in San Diego

for them.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face=

arbitrator shall be selected as follows:&nbsp; JAMS shall give each
party a list of 11 arbitrators drawn from its panel of employment
or commercial dispute arbitrators who meet the requirements set
forth above.&nbsp; Each party may strike all names on the list it
deems unacceptable.&nbsp; If only one common name remains on the
lists of both parties, that individual shall be designated as the
Arbitrator.&nbsp; If more than one common name remains on the lists
of both parties, the parties shall strike names alternately from
the list of common names until only one remains.&nbsp; The party
who did not initiate the claim shall strike first.&nbsp; If no
common name exists on the lists of both parties, JAMS shall furnish
an additional list, from which the parties shall strike
alternately, with the party initiating the claim striking first,
until only one name remains.&nbsp; That person shall be designated
as the arbitrator (subject to full disclosure of conflicts that may
disqualify that arbitrator).&nbsp; Striking decisions must be made
and communicated to the other party and JAMS within 10 calendar
days after the date of the transmittal communication relaying the
arbitrators remaining for selection.&nbsp; In the event a party
does not make a timely strike, the other party may select the
arbitrator from the names remaining.</font></p>

itself, including the fees of the arbitrator, the cost of any
