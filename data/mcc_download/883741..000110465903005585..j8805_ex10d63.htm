utilized such information to Fitzwater&#146;s satisfaction for the purpose of making

intent to resell by reason of any foreseeable specific contingency or

anticipated change in market values, or any change in NextNet&#146;s condition, or

effective upon execution by all parties (the &#147;<u>Effective Date</u>&#148;).&#160; Notwithstanding the foregoing, if within 91

days of the execution of this Agreement, Zamba becomes a debtor under the

Bankruptcy Code or makes any assignment for the benefit of its creditors and

Fitzwater&#160; is required to return the

Termination Cash Payment to Zamba or its successor or assignee, then the

release set forth in Section 6 of this Agreement shall become void and the Note

shall not have been terminated but will remain in full force and effect as if

this Agreement had not been entered into by the parties.&#160; The purpose of the foregoing is to allow

Fitzwater to seek all potential remedies and damages from Zamba in the event

Zamba becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy case (either voluntarily or

involuntarily) or makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors and the

consideration for this Agreement fails because the Termination Cash Payment is

required to be returned by Fitzwater.&#160;

In the absence of either such event within the 91-day period or the

return of the Termination Cash Payment, however, the release set forth in

Section 6 of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and the Note

shall remain terminated.</font></p>
