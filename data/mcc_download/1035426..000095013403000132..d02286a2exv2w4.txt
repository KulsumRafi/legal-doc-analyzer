                      AMENDED AND RESTATED PROMISSORY NOTE


$6,331,000.00                                                    October 1, 2002


This Note is an amendment to and restatement of that certain promissory note,
dated February 14, 2002, made by the Borrower in the principal amount of
$8,575,000.00 (the "ORIGINAL NOTE"). Effective as of the date hereof, this
Amended and Restated Promissory Note shall be deemed to replace the Original
Note in its entirety. This Amended and Restated Promissory Note is not intended
to be, nor shall it be construed as, a novation of the Original Note.


FOR VALUE RECEIVED, CRESCENT OPERATING, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"BORROWER"), promises to pay to the order of CRESCENT REAL ESTATE EQUITIES
LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Delaware limited partnership (the "HOLDER"), the
principal sum of SIX MILLION THREE HUNDRED THIRTY-ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
($6,331,000.00) or if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all
advances made by the Holder to the Borrower from time to time under this Amended
and Restated Note (the "Note"), together with interest thereon as set forth in
this Note.

1.       Advances.

         (a)      Advances under Original Note with Respect to Budget. The
                  Holder agreed under the Original Note that, so long as no
                  Event of Default (as defined in Section 6) had occurred and
                  was continuing under the Original Note, and subject to Section
                  5.05 of the Settlement Agreement (as defined below), the
                  Holder would make an advance to the Borrower for each month
                  listed in the budget attached hereto as SCHEDULE A (the
                  "BUDGET") in the amount specified as "NET CASH" for such month
                  in the Budget; subject to reduction with respect to any
                  particular month to the extent that the amounts advanced to
                  the Borrower in prior months pursuant to this Section 1(a)
                  exceeded the amount used to pay "Permitted Expenses" (as
                  defined below) incurred by "Eligible Entities" (as defined
                  below) in accordance with the Budget. As required under the
                  Original Note, the advances made to the Borrower pursuant to
                  this Section 1(a) were used by Borrower to pay Permitted
                  Expenses, to the extent the Eligible Entities were unable to
                  do so from their own resources (after all such resources had
                  been applied to the payment of Permitted Expenses).

                  When used in this Note, "SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT" means the
                  Settlement Agreement, dated as of February 14, 2002, entered
                  into by and among the Holder, Crescent Real Estate Equities
                  Company, the Borrower, Rosestar Management LLC, Canyon Ranch
                  Leasing, L.L.C., Wine Country Hotel, LLC d/b/a Vintage
                  Resorts, LLC, Rosestar Southwest, LLC and COI Hotel Group,
                  Inc., as amended on the date hereof by that certain First
                  Amendment to Settlement Agreement, and "BUSINESS DAY" shall
                  have the meaning set forth in Section 1.01 of the Settlement
                  Agreement.

                  "PERMITTED EXPENSES" are the reasonable and necessary
                  documented out-of- pocket operating expenses of the types, and
                  including the categories, of expenses set forth on SCHEDULE A
                  to be incurred by the Eligible Entities, including expenses of
                  the Transferors (as such term is defined in the Settlement
                  Agreement) incurred in connection with the Settlement
                  Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including
                  without limitation, the fees and expenses of attorneys,
                  accountants and investment bankers), but do not include
                  expenses attributed to, related to or incurred by Crescent

                  (other than Crescent Machinery Company, a Texas corporation,
                  and its subsidiaries).

                  Borrower hereby agrees and acknowledges that, as of the date
                  of this Note, (i) Holder has advanced the entire $3,200,000.00
                  to Borrower pursuant to this Section 1(a), (ii) Holder has no
                  obligation to advance any additional amounts to Borrower
                  pursuant to this Section 1(a), and (iii) Borrower has not
                  repaid any portion of such amount or any interest accrued
                  thereon. Borrower further agrees and acknowledges that
                  interest shall continue to accrue on the $3,200,000 from and
                  after the date of this Note, at the rate, and on the terms,
                  specified in Sections 1(d) and 2 of this Note.

         (b)      Advances under Original Note with Respect to Specific
                  Expenditures. The Holder agreed, in the Original Note, that so
                  long as no Event of Default (as defined in Section 6) had
                  occurred and was continuing under the Original Note, the
                  Holder would make advances to the Borrower, prior to February
                  13, 2003, and within three Business Days of Holder's receipt
                  of Borrower's written request for an advance of funds for a
                  "PERMITTED PURPOSE" set forth on SCHEDULE B; provided that
                  with respect to any Permitted Purpose the maximum amount of
                  funds that Holder was required to advance with respect to such
                  Permitted Purpose was the maximum amount specified on SCHEDULE
                  B with respect to that Permitted Purpose.

                  The Borrower hereby agrees and acknowledges that, as of the
                  date of this Note, the Holder has advanced an aggregate of
                  $431,000.00 to the Borrower pursuant to SCHEDULE B, which
                  advances consist of the amounts set forth in the following
                  table, with each advance being made for the Permitted Purpose
                  set forth opposite such amount, and further agrees and
                  acknowledges that the Borrower has repaid no portion of such
                  amounts or any interest accrued thereon.

                  The Borrower agrees and acknowledges that interest shall
                  continue to accrue on each of the foregoing amounts advanced
                  for a Permitted Purpose (excluding interest thereon) from and
                  after the date of this Note, at the rate, and on the terms,
                  specified in Sections 1(d) and 2 of this Note.


                  The Borrower further agrees and acknowledges (i) that SCHEDULE
                  B has been retained as an attachment to this Note solely for
                  historical purposes in referencing the Original Note, (ii)
                  that SCHEDULE B is of no further force or effect under this
                  Note, and (iii) that, from and after the date of this Note,
                  the Holder has no obligation to make any advances to the
                  Borrower for any Permitted Purpose set forth in SCHEDULE B.

         (c)      Advances with Respect to Specific Expenditures. So long as no
                  Event of Default (as defined in Section 6) has occurred and is
                  continuing under this Note, prior to the Maturity Date (as
                  defined in Section 3) the Holder shall make advances to the
                  Borrower within three Business Days of Holder's receipt of
                  Borrower's written request for an advance of funds for a
                  "RETAINED PERMITTED PURPOSE" set forth on SCHEDULE C; provided
                  that, with respect to any Retained Permitted Purpose, the
                  maximum amount of funds that Holder shall be required to
                  advance with respect to such Retained Permitted Purpose shall
                  be the maximum amount specified on SCHEDULE C with respect to
                  that Retained Permitted Purpose.

                  Each request for an advance under this Section 1(c) shall
                  specify (i) the Retained Permitted Purpose for which funds are
                  being requested, (ii) the amount being requested and (iii)
                  such other information as Holder may reasonably request to
                  confirm that the funds are to be used for a Retained Permitted
                  Purpose contemplated by Holder and Borrower, and also shall
                  contain a representation and warranty of the Borrower that the
                  aggregate amount of funds requested for such Retained
                  Permitted Purpose (including the amount of the current
                  request) does not exceed the maximum amount that the Borrower
                  may request for such Retained Permitted Purpose as set forth
                  in SCHEDULE C. The Borrower shall use advances made under this
                  Section 1(c) solely for the Retained Permitted Purpose for
                  which such advance was requested.

                  In no event will the aggregate amount of advances made
                  pursuant to this Section 1(c) exceed $2,700,000.00.

         (d)      General Provisions Relating to Advances. Each advance made
                  under this Note shall bear interest from the date made until
                  paid as set forth in this Note.

                  Advances that have been repaid may not be reborrowed. The
                  Holder shall be under no obligation to make any advance the
                  proceeds of which would be used by Borrower to evaluate,
                  threaten or commence or continue legal actions against Holder
                  or any its affiliates.

         (e)      Acknowledgment of Amounts Outstanding. Borrower hereby
                  acknowledges and agrees that, as of the date of this Note, (i)
                  the $3,200,000.00 principal amount outstanding as a result of
                  the advances from the Holder pursuant to Section 1(a), plus
                  (ii) the $431,000.00 principal amount outstanding as a result
                  of the advances from the Holder for the Permitted Purposes
                  specified in the table set forth in Section 1(b), plus (iii)
                  accrued interest from the date of each advance made to
                  Borrower pursuant to Section 1(a) or 1(b), equals
                  $3,674,821.86. For purposes hereof, all such amounts shall be
                  deemed to have been made under this Note, except that interest
                  thereon shall accrue from the date each such advance was
                  originally made.

2.       Interest Rate; Payment of Interest. Interest shall accrue and be
         payable on the unpaid principal balance of this Note at the rate of
         2.75% per annum and shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360
         days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
         first day but excluding the last day). If the rate of interest provided
         in this Note would exceed the maximum legal rate of interest under
         applicable law for the indebtedness evidenced by this Note, then the
         rate of interest on this Note shall be automatically reduced, effective
         on and as of the date of this Note, to the highest rate of interest
         that would not exceed such maximum legal rate and any amounts paid in
         excess of such maximum shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments of
         the principal of this Note (or refunded to Borrower to the extent the
         principal of this Note has been repaid in full).

         All interest on this Note shall be payable in full on the Maturity Date
         (as defined in Section 3).

3.       Payment of Principal; Prepayment. Unless sooner paid in full, the
         entire unpaid principal balance of this Note, together with all
         outstanding and unpaid accrued interest, and any other amounts due
         hereunder, shall be due and payable on March 31, 2003 (the "MATURITY
         DATE"). Borrower may prepay this Note in whole or in part at any time
         without premium or penalty; any prepayment shall be applied first to
         the accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of this Note to
         be prepaid and then to the principal payable under this Note.

4.       Payments Generally. All payments shall be made in U.S. dollars.
         Payments shall be made to the address of Holder specified pursuant to
         Section 12. Any payment of principal or interest hereunder that is not
         paid within five Business Days of the date on which it is due in
         accordance with the terms of this Note shall bear interest at a rate of
         5.75% per annum until paid, and such interest shall be payable on
         demand. If any payments to be made by Borrower hereunder shall become
         due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on
         the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be
         included in computing any interest in respect of such payment.

5.       Collection Costs. Borrower shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
         and expenses incurred by Holder in enforcing this Note, including
         without limitation all such costs and expenses incurred by Holder in or
         relating to any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings of Borrower and
         any attorney's fees, expenses and costs reasonably incurred in
         connection with any of the foregoing (collectively, "COLLECTION
         COSTS").

6.       Default. The occurrence of any of the following events shall be an
         "EVENT OF DEFAULT":

                  excess of $1,000,000, either individually or in the aggregate,

                  order shall continue unsatisfied, unstayed and unbonded for a
                  period of 30 days; provided, however, that a judgment or order
                  fully covered by insurance, which coverage has not been
                  disputed by the insurer, shall not be considered a default;

                  they become due;

         immediately due and payable without any demand or other action on the
         part of the Holder; provided that, upon approval in a bankruptcy
         proceeding instituted by the Borrower and issuance of an order of the
         bankruptcy court reasonably acceptable to Holder, Holder shall be
         obligated to advance funds to the Borrower on the terms set forth in
         this Note as though the related Event of Default had not occurred.

8.       Certain Waivers. Borrower waives presentment, notice of dishonor,
         protest and notice of protest, demand and notice of nonpayment of this
         Note.

9.       Preservation of Holder Rights; Modifications. No failure on the part of
         Holder to exercise any right or remedy hereunder, whether before or
         after the occurrence of a default or Event of Default, shall constitute
         a waiver thereof, and no waiver of any past Event of Default shall
         constitute a waiver of any future default or Event of Default or of any
         other default or Event of Default. No failure to accelerate the
         indebtedness evidenced hereby by reason of any Event of Default
         hereunder, or indulgence granted from time to time, shall be construed
         to be a waiver of the right to insist upon prompt payment or as a
         waiver of any other right, or be construed so as to preclude the
         exercise of any right that Holder may have under applicable law, this
         Note, any other agreement or otherwise; and Borrower hereby expressly
         waives the benefit of any statute or rule of law or equity that would
         produce a result contrary to or in conflict with the foregoing. This
         Note may not be changed or any provision hereof waived or modified
         orally, but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against
         whom such agreement is sought to be enforced.

10.      Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
         ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS

11.      VENUE; JURISDICTION; JURY TRIAL WAIVER. THE HOLDER AND THE BORROWER

                  LOCATED IN TEXAS;

                  THIS NOTE, THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER
                  THIS NOTE, AND ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THE HOLDER, ON THE ONE
                  HAND, AND THE BORROWER, ON THE OTHER, SHALL BE A COURT OF
                  COMPETENT JURISDICTION LOCATED IN TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS;
                  PROVIDED THAT IF NO COURT IN TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS, WILL
                  ACCEPT JURISDICTION OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING, THE PARTY
                  INITIATING THE PROCEEDING SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO RE-INSTITUTE
                  SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY OTHER STATE OR FEDERAL COURT OF
                  COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE STATE OF TEXAS; AND

         (c)      IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN ANY ACTION OR
                  PROCEEDING BASED UPON, OR RELATED TO, THE SUBJECT MATTER OF
                  THIS NOTE AND AGREE THAT THE FOREGOING WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY
                  IS KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY, AND VOLUNTARILY MADE BY THE
                  HOLDER AND THE BORROWER AND THE BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
                  NEITHER THE HOLDER NOR ANY PERSON ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE
                  HOLDER HAS MADE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OF FACT TO INDUCE THIS
                  WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY OR IN ANY WAY TO MODIFY OR NULLIFY ITS
                  EFFECT, AND THE HOLDER AND THE BORROWER FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE
                  THAT THEY HAVE BEEN REPRESENTED IN THE NEGOTIATION AND
                  EXECUTION OF THIS NOTE AND IN THE MAKING OF THIS WAIVER BY
                  INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, SELECTED BY THEIR OWN FREE WILL,
                  AND THAT THEY HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS WAIVER
                  WITH COUNSEL, AND THE HOLDER AND THE BORROWER FURTHER
                  ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE MEANING AND
                  RAMIFICATION OF THIS PROVISION.

12.      Notices. Any notice or demand required or permitted by or in connection
         with this Note shall be in writing and shall be made as provided in
         Section 10.01 of the Settlement Agreement.

13.      Severability. In case any provision (or any part of any provision)
         contained in this Note shall for any reason be held to be invalid,
         illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or
         unenforceability shall not affect any other provision (or remaining
         part of the affected provision) of this Note, but this Note shall be
         construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision (or
         part thereof) had never been contained herein but only to the extent
         such provision (or part thereof) is invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

14.      Successors and Assigns. This Note shall be binding on the parties
         hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided that no
         assignment of this Note may be made without the consent of the other
         party hereto.

15.      Section Headings; Interpretation. The section and subsection headings
         contained herein are for reference purposes only and shall not in any
         way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Note. The parties
         hereto are sophisticated and have been represented by lawyers
         throughout this transaction who have carefully negotiated the
         provisions hereof. As a consequence, the parties agree that any
         presumptions relating to the interpretation of contracts against the
         drafter of any particular clause should not be applied in this case and
         therefore waive its effects.

16.      Entire Agreement. This Note, the Secured Note, the Security Agreement,
         and the Settlement Agreement, together with the other agreements
         contemplated thereby, shall constitute the complete agreement of the
         parties hereto with respect to the subject matters referred to herein
         and supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, promises,
         covenants, agreements or representations of every kind or nature
         whatsoever with respect thereto, all of which have become merged and
         finally integrated into this Note and such agreements. Each of the
         parties understands that in the event of any subsequent litigation,
         controversy or dispute concerning any terms, conditions or provisions
         of this Note, no party shall be permitted to offer or introduce any
         oral evidence concerning any other oral promises or oral agreements
         between the parties relating to the subject matter of this Note not
         included or referred to herein and not reflected by a writing.


                IN WITNESS WHEREOF, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Borrower executes this Note under seal as of the date first written above.
