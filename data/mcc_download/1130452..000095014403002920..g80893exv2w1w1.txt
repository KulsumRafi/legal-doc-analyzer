          Pension Plans and the BellSouth Qualified Pension Plans may occur in
          multiple transfers with the final transfer from all applicable Pension
          Plans to be made no later than September 30, 2002. Notwithstanding the

          the minimum required transfer amount under Code Section 414(l), which
          shall be determined and certified by Chicago Consulting Actuaries."

Pension Transition Benefits

         -        SBC Wireless Employees (other than former Ameritech employees)
                  pension benefits equal to six months of transition credits

                  Incentive Award Deferral Plan ("SIAD") shall be eligible to
                  participate in a Newco deferred compensation plan that is
                  substantially identical to the SBC SIAD Plan; however, SBC
                  will fund the historic liability as of the Contribution Date
                  for this Plan.

         -        SBC Wireless Employees who had accrued a benefit under
                  nonqualified pension make up plan sponsored by SBC or any of
                  its Affiliates shall participate in substantially identical
                  plans adopted by Newco; however, SBC will fund the historic
                  liability as of the Contribution Date for this Plan and SBC
                  shall fund, on an annual basis, the annual liability
                  associated with these Newco Plans until such time that Newco
                  adopts a nonqualified pension make up plan for the benefit of
                  its employees generally.

         -        SBC Wireless Employees who participated in the SBC
                  Supplemental Retirement Income Plan sponsored by SBC shall
                  participate in a substantially identical plan adopted by
                  Newco; however, SBC will fund the Economic Liability for this
                  Newco Plan for a period of five years.

Life Insurance Plans

         -        SBC Wireless Employees who are participating in supplemental
                  executive life insurance plans prior to the Contribution Date
                  will be eligible for the greater of the life insurance benefit
                  under the SBC life insurance plans or the Newco supplemental
                  life insurance plan, and, in either case, such coverage shall
                  be provided by Newco; provided, however, there are two SBC
                  Wireless Employees who are retirement eligible as of the
                  Contribution Date and their supplemental executive life
                  insurance coverage shall be provided by SBC (and not by
                  Newco).
