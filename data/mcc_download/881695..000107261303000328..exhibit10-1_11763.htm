          designated at all times to act as the chair of the R&amp;D Committee (the
          &#147;R&amp;D Committee Chair&#148;). The R&amp;D Committee shall adopt such
          standing rules as shall be necessary for its work. A quorum of the R&amp;D
          Committee shall exist whenever there is present at a meeting at least one (1)
          representative appointed by each party. Members of the R&amp;D Committee may

          Representation by proxy shall not be allowed. In addition, each party may, at
          its discretion, invite non-voting employees, and with the consent of the other
          party, consultants or vendors, to attend the meetings of the R&amp;D Committee.

          the assumption that the First Female Product will be a 510(k) Product and not a

          accordance with Section&nbsp;10.4(b), or elect to continue participating in such
          development and commercialization for such product. In the event that Gillette

          parties shall cooperate in good faith to agree upon a revised R&amp;D Plan and
          additional R&amp;D Payments required to implement and carry out such revised

          Costs, which result from or relate to classification of such product as a PMA

          Gillette desires an Estimate of the Manufacturing Costs that would be incurred
          by Palomar in connection with the Manufacture of CUT Female Products, Gillette
          shall provide to Palomar the Product Specifications on or before the later of

          event that as of such date the R&amp;D Period has not been extended past the

          that as of such date the R&amp;D Period has been extended past the nine
          hundredth twelfth (912th) day after the Effective Date. Palomar shall provide to
          Gillette, not later than thirty (30) days after the receipt of such Product
          Specifications, a good faith Estimate as to all Costs that would be incurred by
          Palomar in connection with the Manufacture of CUT Female Products. In the event
          that Gillette elects to have Palomar supply the CUT Female Product for use by
          Gillette in CUTs, Gillette shall so notify Palomar in writing not later than ten
          (10) days after the last day of the R&amp;D Period (such notice,
          the&nbsp;&#147;Ten-Day Notice&#148;). In the event that Gillette does not so

          will supply the CUT Female Product for use by Gillette in CUTs, then Gillette

          <U>Introduction</U>. The parties understand and agree that Palomar shall
          disclose to Gillette a substantial amount of Palomar Technology developed before
          the Effective Date. The parties further understand and agree that Palomar has
          expended significant effort and capital to develop such Palomar Technology and
          without it, the parties would not be able to commercialize Female Products in
          the time-frame or manner contemplated by this Agreement. Gillette shall pay
          Palomar the TTPs set forth in this Section&nbsp;6.1(e), the Development
          Completion Payments set forth in Section&nbsp;6.1(d), the Annual Exclusivity
          Collaboration Payments set forth in Section&nbsp;6.1(g), the Failure to Launch
          Payments set forth in Section&nbsp;2.1(b), and the lump-sum payments set forth
          in Section&nbsp;6.2(a) as partial reimbursement for Palomar&#146;s development
          and disclosure of such Palomar independently-developed technology. By means of
          the TTPs, the parties mutually agree that they have shared equitably the risk
          involved in determining the value of such Palomar Technology and the risk
          involved in developing and commercializing Female Products (including the risk
          involved in creating a new market sector). </FONT></P>

          <U>TTPs</U>. On a Female Product-by-Female Product basis, Gillette shall pay to
          Palomar on account of sales or distributions of each such product by Gillette or
          any of its agents or (sub)licensees, TTPs in the amount of four percent (4%) of

          (2%). Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise expressly provided in
          Section&nbsp;6.1(g), 6.1(h) or ARTICLE VIII, all such TTPs shall be
          non-creditable and non-refundable and there shall be no right of set-off with
          respect thereto, except in the event that an audit confirms that Gillette had
          overpaid Palomar as provided in Section&nbsp;6.8, whereupon any over-payment
          shall be addressed as provided in that Section. </FONT></P>

          reasonable efforts, it is unable to comply with such obligations because of
          actions taken or not taken by such Third Party licensor. For example and without

          <U>Joint Patents Exclusively Licensed to Gillette under
          Section&nbsp;4.1(a)(i)</U>. For any infringement of one or more Joint Patents
          that are subject to the license contained in Section&nbsp;4.1(a)(i) and that
          occurs during the Gillette Exclusive License Period, the following provisions of
          this Section&nbsp;8.4(b)(i) shall apply: If either party determines that any
          Joint Patent is being or was infringed by a Third Party&#146;s activities during
          the Gillette Exclusive License Period and such infringement falls (in whole or
          in part) within the scope of such license grant, it shall notify the other party
          in writing and provide it with any evidence of such infringement that is
          reasonably available. To the extent that any such infringement falls within the
          scope of the Gillette Exclusive Licenses, and only to such extent, Gillette, at
          Gillette&#146;s sole expense, shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
          remove any such infringement with respect to any Joint Patent (but no other
          infringement with respect to any Joint Patent) by appropriate steps, including
          filing an infringement suit or taking other similar action. In the event that
          Gillette fails within ninety (90) days following notice of such infringement to
          remove such infringement or file an infringement lawsuit, Palomar shall have the
          right (but not the obligation) to do so at Palomar&#146;s sole expense;
          <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if Gillette has commenced negotiations
          with an alleged infringer for discontinuance of such infringement within such
          ninety (90) day period, Gillette shall have an additional ninety (90) days to
          conclude its negotiations before Palomar may bring suit for such infringement.
          The party not enforcing the applicable Joint Patent (A) shall provide reasonable
          assistance to the other party, including providing access to relevant
          non-privileged documents and other evidence, making its employees available at
          reasonable business hours, and joining the action to the extent necessary to
          allow the enforcing party to maintain the action, and (B) provided that in the
          case of Gillette as the non-enforcing party, Gillette may recover its reasonable
          out-of-pocket costs and expenses pursuant to Section 8.4(e) and (C) provided
          that in the case of Palomar as the non-enforcing party, Gillette shall pay
          Palomar&#146;s reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and shall have right to off-set
          the full amount of them according to the procedure set forth in the proviso to
          the second to last full sentence and the last full sentence of
          Section&nbsp;8.4(a)(ii) with the phrase &#147;fifty percent (50%) of the total
          costs and expenses&#148; to be read to refer instead to all of such reasonable
          out-of-pocket expenses for such purposes. The other party shall have the right
          to participate or otherwise be involved in any suit prosecuted by the enforcing
          party at such other party&#146;s sole cost and expense, which cost and expense
          may be recovered by such other party as provided in Section&nbsp;8.4(e). If the
          other party elects to so participate or be involved, the enforcing party shall
          provide the other party and its counsel with an opportunity to consult with the
          enforcing party and its counsel regarding the prosecution of such suit
          (including reviewing the contents of any non-privileged correspondence, legal
          papers or other documents related thereto), and the enforcing party shall accede
          to reasonable requests of the other party regarding such enforcement. </FONT></P>

which cost and expense may be recovered by Palomar from recoveries made by
Gillette on a pro rata basis with Gillette&#146;s reasonable cost and expense
related to such suit. If Palomar elects to so participate or be involved,

          <U>Joint Patents Exclusively Licensed to Palomar</U>. Pursuant to this
Agreement, Gillette has granted to Palomar certain exclusive license(s) with
respect to Joint Patents, which are in effect as of the Effective Date or shall
become effective upon certain termination events. Those exclusive license grants
are contained in Sections&nbsp;4.2(d), 10.7(b)(v), 10.7(c)(v), 10.7(d)(v) and
10.8(a)(v) (the &#147;Palomar Exclusive Licenses&#148;). The following
provisions of this Section&nbsp;8.4(b)(iii) shall apply to the enforcement of
the Joint Patents during the period that any one or more of the Palomar
Exclusive Licenses are in effect (the&nbsp;&#147;Palomar Exclusive License
Period&#148;). If Gillette determines that any Joint Patent is being or was
infringed by a Third Party&#146;s activities during the Palomar Exclusive
License Period for any Palomar Exclusive License and such infringement falls (in
whole or in part) within the scope of such Palomar Exclusive License, Gillette
shall notify Palomar in writing and provide it with any evidence of such
infringement that is reasonably available. Palomar shall have the first right
(but not the obligation), at its sole expense, to attempt to remove such
infringement, including filing an infringement suit or taking other similar
action. In the event that Palomar fails within ninety (90) days following notice
of such infringement to remove such infringement or file an infringement
lawsuit, Gillette shall have the right (but not the obligation) to do so at
Gillette&#146;s sole expense if Gillette reasonably concludes that such
infringement is materially affecting Gillette&#146;s commercialization of the
Female Product(s); provided, however, that if Palomar has commenced negotiations
with an alleged infringer for discontinuance of such infringement within such
ninety (90) day period, Palomar shall have an additional ninety (90) days to
conclude its negotiations before Gillette may bring suit for such infringement.
The party not enforcing the applicable Joint Patents (A) shall provide
reasonable assistance to the other party, including providing access to relevant
non-privileged documents and other evidence, making its employees available at

allow the enforcing party to maintain the action. In the event that Gillette is
the enforcing party, it shall reimburse Palomar for Palomar&#146;s reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Palomar in connection with
providing such assistance to Gillette. The party not enforcing the applicable
Joint Patent(s) shall have the right to participate or otherwise be involved in

          to proceed with respect to such infringement, but only to the extent that such
          infringement falls within the scope of the Gillette Exclusive Licenses. If with

          the actions specified by those Sections in a manner consistent with the MGH
          Agreements, but Palomar shall not be deemed to be in breach of its obligations

          insufficient to cover the totality of such costs and expenses, and in the case
          in which Gillette is responsible for such costs and expenses subject to a right

          is not addressed by either Section&nbsp;8.4(b)(i), 8.4(b)(ii) or 8.4(b)(iii),
          the parties shall meet to discuss how to proceed with respect to such
          infringement. For avoidance of doubt, it is understood that any infringement of
          any Joint Patent that is subject to those Sections shall not be subject to this
          Section&nbsp;8.4(g)(ii) even in the event that the party(ies) having rights to
          enforce any such Joint Patent under those Sections declines to do so. If the

          such Joint Patent and initiate an action with respect to such infringement, at

          including providing access to relevant non-privileged documents and other
          evidence, making its employees available at reasonable business hours, and

          non-enforcing party for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
          by the non-enforcing party to provide such reasonable assistance. In no event
          shall this Section&nbsp;8.4(g)(ii) be construed or applied in any way to limit

          take the actions specified by this Section 8.4(g)(ii) in a manner consistent
          with the MGH Agreements, but Palomar shall not be deemed to be in breach of its

          in any country such that Gillette cannot Exploit the Female Product(s) in such
          country without infringing such Patent or (y) as a result of any claim made
          against Gillette or sublicensees alleging that the Exploitation of the Female
          Product(s) by Gillette or any of its sublicensees infringes or misappropriates
          any Patent or any other intellectual property right of a Third Party in any
          country, a judgment is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction from which
          no appeal is taken within the time permitted for appeal, such that Gillette
          cannot Exploit the Female Product(s) in such country without infringing the
          Patent or other proprietary rights of such Third Party, then, in either case,
          Gillette shall have the right (but not the obligation) to negotiate and obtain a
          license from such Third Party as necessary for Gillette and its sublicensees to
          Exploit the Female Product(s) in such country. In the event that Gillette

          any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss provided (i)&nbsp;it obtains
          the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
          unreasonably withheld), and (ii)&nbsp;include as an unconditional term thereof
          the giving by the Third Party to such Indemnified Party of a release from all
          liability in respect to such Third Party Claim. The indemnifying party shall not
          be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a Loss by an Indemnified
          Party that is reached without the written consent of the indemnifying party,
          unless the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ
          counsel in accordance with Section&nbsp;11.3(b). In the event that (i)&nbsp;an
          Indemnified Party seeks indemnification from the indemnifying party under this
          ARTICLE XI for a Third Party Claim, and (ii)&nbsp;the indemnifying party shall
          have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
          hereunder with respect thereto, no Indemnified Party shall admit any liability
          with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim
          without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party. </FONT></P>
