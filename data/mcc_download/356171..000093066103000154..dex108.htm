after such election the aggregate present value of the Agreement Payments or any other payments equals the Reduced Amount), and shall advise the EMPLOYER in writing of his election within 20 business days of his receipt of notice. If no such
election is made by Employee within such 20-day period, EMPLOYER may elect which and how much of the Contract Payments or any other payments shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such election the Aggregate present value of the Contract
Payments equals the Reduced Amount) and shall notify Employee promptly of such election. For purposes of this Section, present value shall be determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code. All determinations made by the Certified
Public Accountants shall be binding upon EMPLOYER and Employee and the payment to Employee shall be made within 20 days of sale of EMPLOYER. EMPLOYER may suspend for a period of up to 30 days after the sale of EMPLOYER the Payment and any other
payments or benefits due to Employee until the Certified Public Accountants finish the determination and Employee (or EMPLOYER, as the case may be) elects how to reduce the Contract Payments or any other payments, if necessary. As promptly as
