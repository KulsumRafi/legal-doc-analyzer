"OPTIONAL TERMINATION NOTICE") to the Trustee, the Servicer and the
Administrator in which the Company declares that the Series 2000-2 Revolving

thereof; PROVIDED that no such termination or reduction shall be permitted if,
after giving effect thereto and to any reduction in the Series 2000-2 Invested
Amount on such date, the Series 2000-2 Invested Amount would exceed the Purchase
Limit then in effect.

          (b) [Reserved]

any such deficiency.

To the extent that funds on deposit in the Series 2000-2 Collection Sub-account
at any such date are insufficient to pay the Utilization Fee due on such date,
the Servicer shall so notify the Company and the Company shall immediately pay
the Administrator the amount of any such deficiency.

          (d) Calculations of per annum rates and fees under this Supplement
shall be made on the basis of a 360- (or 365-/366-, in the case of interest on
the Floating Tranche based on the Base Rate) day year with respect to Commitment
Fees, Utilization Fees and interest rates. Each determination of the Euro-Rate
by the Administrator shall be conclusive and binding upon each of the parties

          Section 3.1 of the Agreement and each other section of Article III of
the Agreement relating to another Series shall read in their entirety herein as
provided in the Agreement. Article III of the Agreement (except for Section 3.1

          SECTION 3A.3. ALLOCATIONS. The Servicer shall apply and distribute the
portion of the Aggregate Daily Collections allocated to the Series 2000-2
Interests pursuant to Article III of the Agreement (the "SERIES 2000-2
COLLECTIONS"):

          (a)  On each Business Day during the Series 2000-2 Revolving Period,
an amount equal to the Accrued Interest Expense shall be set aside for
distribution in accordance with Section 3A.6(a) on the next occurring
Distribution Date. The balance of such Series 2000-2 Collections (the
"REINVESTMENT AMOUNT" shall be distributed by the Servicer to such accounts or
such persons as the Company may direct in writing (which directions may consist
of standing instructions provided by the Company that shall remain in effect
until changed by the Company in writing);; PROVIDED that such distribution shall
be made only if no Early Amortization Event or Potential Early Amortization
Event has occurred and is continuing and only to the extent that, if after
giving effect to such distribution, the Series 2000-2 Target Receivables Amount
would not exceed the Series 2000-2 Allocated Receivables Amount; PROVIDED
FURTHER that if the Company or the Servicer, on behalf of the Company, shall
have given the Administrator irrevocable prior written notice (effective upon
receipt) when required under Section 2.7(a), the Servicer may withdraw all or a
portion of such amounts on deposit in the Series 2000-2 Collection Subaccount
and apply such withdrawn amounts toward the reduction of the Series 2000-2
Invested Amount and the Series 2000-2 Subordinated Interest Amount in accordance
with Section 2.7.

          (b)  On each Business Day during the Series 2000-2 Amortization Period
(including Distribution Dates), funds deposited in the Series 2000-2 Collection
Subaccount shall be set aside for distribution in accordance with
Section 3A.6(b). Except as set forth in Section 3A.6(b), no amounts on deposit

Agreement.

          SECTION 3A.4. DETERMINATION OF SERIES 2000-2 MONTHLY INTEREST. (a) On
or before the Business Day preceding each Distribution Date, the Administrator
shall notify the Servicer and the Trustee of the Series 2000-2 Monthly Interest
for the Accrual Period ending on the related Distribution Date. From time to
time, for purposes of determining the Rate Periods applicable to the different
portions of the Series 2000-2 Funded Amount and of calculating Discount with
respect thereto, the Administrator shall allocate the Series 2000-2 Funded
Amount to one or more tranches (each a "FUNDING TRANCHE"). At any time, each
Funding Tranche shall have only one Rate Period and one Rate Type. In addition,
at any time when the Series 2000-2 Funded Amount is not divided into more than
one portion, "Funding Tranche" means 100% of the Series 2000-2 Invested Amount.

          (b)  From time to time the Administrator shall notify the Servicer and
the Trustee of the number of Funding Tranches and the Rate Type of each Funding

          (c)  On each Distribution Date, the Servicer shall determine the
excess, if any (the "INTEREST SHORTFALL"), of (i) the Series 2000-2 Monthly
Interest for the Accrual Period ending on such Distribution Date OVER (ii) the
amount which will be available to be distributed to the Purchasers on such
Distribution Date in respect thereof pursuant to this Supplement. If the
Interest Shortfall with respect to any Distribution Date is greater than zero,
an additional amount ("ADDITIONAL INTEREST") equal to the product of (A) the
number of days until such Interest Shortfall shall be repaid DIVIDED BY 365 (or
366, as the case may be), (B) the Base Rate PLUS 2.0% and (C) such Interest
Shortfall (or the portion thereof which has not been paid to the Committed
Purchaser) shall be payable as provided herein with respect to the VFC
Certificates on each Distribution Date following such Distribution Date to but
excluding the Distribution Date on which such Interest Shortfall is paid to the
VFC Certificateholders.

          (d)  Any reduction in the Series 2000-2 Invested Amount on any
Business Day shall be allocated in the following order of priority:

          FIRST, to reduce the Unallocated Balance, as appropriate; and

          SECOND, to reduce the portion of the Series 2000-2 Invested Amount
allocated to Eurodollar Tranches in such order as the Company may select in
order to minimize costs payable pursuant to Section 7.4.

          SECTION 3A.5. DETERMINATION OF SERIES 2000-2 MONTHLY PRINCIPAL.
PAYMENTS OF SERIES 2000-2 PRINCIPAL. The amount (the "SERIES 2000-2 MONTHLY
PRINCIPAL PAYMENT") distributable from the Series 2000-2 Collection Subaccount
on each Distribution Date during the Series 2000-2 Amortization Period, as

account on the immediately preceding Settlement Report Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the Series 2000-2 Monthly Principal Payment on any Distribution Date shall
not exceed the Series 2000-2 Invested Amount on such Distribution Date.

following shall be exclusively applicable to the VFC Certificates:

          SECTION 4A.1. DISTRIBUTIONS. (a) On each Distribution Date, the
Trustee shall distribute to the Administrator and the Administrator shall
further distribute to the Committed Purchaser the amount to be distributed to
the Committed Purchaser pursuant to Article III.

          (b)  All allocations and distributions hereunder shall be in

Exhibit F setting forth, among other things, the Default Ratio, Delinquency
Ratio and Dilution Ratio and the components of the calculation thereof, and the

shall have no obligation whatsoever to verify the accuracy of any information
contained within the Monthly Settlement Statement, including any calculations
contained therein. A copy of any such items may be obtained by any holder of a
Certificate upon a written request delivered to the Trustee at the Corporate

Settlement Statement with all such instructions contained therein on the
Settlement Report Date shall satisfy the Servicers obligation to provide written
instructions.

beginning with calendar year 2003, the Company on behalf of the Trustee shall
furnish, or cause to be furnished, to the Committed Purchaser, a statement
prepared by the Company containing the aggregate amount distributed to the
Committed Purchaser for such calendar year or the applicable portion thereof,
together with such other information as is required to be provided by an issuer
of indebtedness under the Internal Revenue Code and such other customary
information as the Company deems necessary or desirable to enable the Purchasers
to prepare their tax returns. Such obligation of the Company shall be deemed to
have been satisfied to the extent that substantially comparable information
shall have been prepared by the Servicer and provided to the Trustee or the
Administrator and to the Committed Purchaser, in each case pursuant to any
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code as from time to time in effect.

the occurrence of an Early Amortization Event with respect to Series 2000-2, the
Company or the Servicer, as the case may be, shall give prompt written notice
thereof to the Trustee and the Administrator. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after its receipt of notice of the occurrence of an Early
Amortization Event with respect to Series 2000-2, the Trustee shall give notice
to the Administrator.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                             CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

          SECTION 7.1 ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if
any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for any Affected Party to make or
maintain its portion of the VFC Certificateholder's Interest (or funding thereof
through a Program Support Agreement) in any Eurodollar Tranche and such Affected
Party shall notify in writing the Administrator, the Trustee and the Company,
then the portion of each Eurodollar Tranche applicable to such Affected Party
shall thereafter be calculated by reference to the Base Rate. If any such change
in the method of calculating interest occurs on a day which is not the last day
of the Rate Period with respect to any Eurodollar Tranche, the Company shall pay
to the Administrator for the account of such Affected Party the amounts, if any,
as may be required pursuant to Section 7.4.

          SECTION 7.2 INCREASED COSTS. If any Change in Law (except with respect
to Taxes which shall be governed by Section 7.3) shall:

                  (i)  impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
     deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
     account of, or credit extended by, any Affected Party (except any such
     reserve requirement reflected in the Euro-Rate); or

                 (ii)  impose on any Affected Party or the London interbank
     market any other condition affecting the Transaction Documents or the
     funding of Eurodollar Tranches by such Affected Party;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Affected Party of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar
Tranches (or maintaining its obligation to do so) or to reduce any amount
received or receivable by such Affected Party

                                       37
<Page>

hereunder or under any Program Support Agreement (whether principal, interest or
otherwise), then the Company will pay to such Affected Party such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Affected Party for both increased
costs and maintenance of bargained for yield.

          (a) If any Affected Party determines that any Change in Law regarding
capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such Affected Party's capital or the capital of any corporation controlling
such Affected Party as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under any
Program Support Agreement to a level below that which such Affected Party or
such corporation could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration such Affected Party's or such corporation's policies with respect
to capital adequacy), then from time to time, the Company shall pay to such
Affected Party such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Affected Party for both increased costs and bargained for yield.

          (b) A certificate of an Affected Party setting forth in reasonable
detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Affected Party as
specified in subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 7.2 shall be delivered to
the Company (with a copy to the Administrator) and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error provided that such Certificate is delivered in good faith and in
a manner generally consistent with such Affected Party's standard practice. The
agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Supplement and
the Agreement and the payment of all amounts payable hereunder and thereunder
for a period of nine months.

          (c) Failure or delay on the part of any Affected Party to demand
compensation pursuant to this Section 7.2 shall not constitute a waiver of such
Affected Party's right to demand such compensation; PROVIDED that the Company
shall not be required to compensate an Affected Party pursuant to this Section
7.2 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to
the date that such Affected Party notifies the Company of the Change in Law
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Affected Party's
intention to claim compensation therefor; PROVIDED FURTHER that, if the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

          (d) For avoidance of doubt any increase in cost and/or reduction in
yield caused by regulatory capital allocation adjustments due to Financial
Accounting Standards Board's Interpretation 46 (or any future statement or
interpretation issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or any
successor thereto) shall be covered by this Section 7.2.

          SECTION 7.3 TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Company hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; PROVIDED that if the Company
shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such
payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after
making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section 7.3) the Administrator or the Committed
Purchaser receives an amount equal to the sum that it would have received had no
such

                                       38
<Page>

deductions been made, (ii) the Company shall make such deductions and (iii) the
Company shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (b) In addition, the Company shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (c) Subject to paragraph (e) of this Section 7.3, the Company shall
indemnify the Administrator and the Committed Purchaser within the later of 10
days after written demand therefor and the Distribution Date next following such
demand for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
Administrator or the Committed Purchaser on or with respect to any payment by or
on account of any obligation of the Company hereunder or under any other
Transaction Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or
asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 7.3) and any
penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the
Company by the Administrator or the Committed Purchaser shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. The agreements in this subsection shall survive the
termination of this Supplement and the Agreement and the payment of all amounts
payable hereunder and thereunder.

          (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by the Company to a Governmental Authority, the Company shall
deliver to the Administrator the original or a certified copy of a receipt
issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the
return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrator.

          (e) The Administrator and the Committed Purchaser shall (but with
respect to any Indemnified Tax or Other Tax arising from a Change in Law, only
to the extent the Administrator or such Purchaser is legally able to do so)
deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrator) such properly
completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law and reasonably
requested by the Company on the later of (i) 30 Business Days after such request
is made and the applicable forms are provided to the Committed Purchaser or (ii)
30 Business Days before prescribed by applicable law as will permit such
payments to be made without withholding or with an exemption from or reduction
of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes. Failure to timely provide such
documentation to the Company shall relieve the Company of any indemnification
responsibility under this Section 7.3.

          (f) If the Administrator or the Committed Purchaser receives a refund
solely in respect of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, it shall pay over such
refund to the Company to the extent that such Administrator or Purchaser has
already received indemnity payments or additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 7.3 with respect to such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to
the refund, net of all out-of-pocket expenses and without interest (other than

                                       39
<Page>

interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall, upon request of the
Administrator or the Committed Purchaser, repay such refund (plus interest or
other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the
Administrator or the Committed Purchaser if the Administrator or the Committed
Purchaser is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
Nothing contained herein shall require the Administrator or the Committed
Purchaser to make its tax returns (or any other information relating to its
taxes which it deems confidential) available to the Company or any other Person.

          SECTION 7.4 BREAK FUNDING PAYMENTS. The Company agrees to indemnify
the Committed Purchaser and to hold the Committed Purchaser harmless from any
loss or expense which the Committed Purchaser may sustain or incur as a
consequence of (a) default by the Company in making a borrowing of a Eurodollar
Tranche after the Company has given irrevocable notice requesting the same in
accordance with the provisions of this Supplement, or (b) default by the Company
in making any prepayment in connection with a Decrease after the Company has
given irrevocable notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.7 or (c) the making of a prepayment of a Eurodollar Tranche or CP Tranche
prior to the termination of the Rate Period for such Eurodollar Tranche or CP
Tranche, as applicable. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the
amount so prepaid or not so borrowed, for the period from the date of such
prepayment or of such failure to borrow to the last day of the Rate Period (or
in the case of a failure to borrow the Rate Period that would have commenced on
the date of such prepayment or of such failure) in each case at the Euro-Rate or
CP Rate, as applicable, for such Eurodollar Tranche or CP Tranche, as
applicable, provided for herein over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably
determined by the Committed Purchaser) which would have accrued to the Committed
Purchaser on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable
period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market. This covenant
shall survive the termination of this Supplement and the Agreement and the
payment of all amounts payable hereunder and thereunder. A certificate as to any
additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence, showing in
reasonable detail the calculation thereof, submitted by the Committed Purchaser
to the Company shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          SECTION 7.5 MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS. (a) If any Liquidity Purchaser
requests compensation under Section 7.2, or if the Company is required to pay
any additional amount to any such Liquidity Purchaser or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Alternate Investor pursuant to Section 7.3,
then such Liquidity Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to designate a
different lending office for funding or booking its obligations under this
Supplement and the Agreement or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder
to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such
Liquidity Purchaser, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or
reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be, in
the future and (ii) would not subject such Liquidity Purchaser to any
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such
Liquidity Purchaser. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by any Liquidity Purchaser in connection with any such
designation or assignment.

                                       40
<Page>

          (b) If any Liquidity Purchaser requests compensation under
Section 7.2, or if the Company is required to pay any additional amount to such
Liquidity Purchaser or any Governmental Authority for the account of such
Liquidity Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.3, or if such Liquidity Purchaser
defaults in its obligations under the Liquidity Agreement, then the Company may,
at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Liquidity Purchaser and the
Administrator require such Liquidity Purchaser to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 11.11), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Liquidity
Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may
be another Liquidity Purchaser, if a Liquidity Purchaser accepts such
assignment); PROVIDED that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written
consent of the Administrator, (ii) such Liquidity Purchaser shall have received
payment of all amounts payable to it hereunder and under the Liquidity
Agreement, from the assignee or the Company (in the case of all amounts payable
hereunder) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim
for compensation under Section 7.2 or payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 7.3, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or
payments. A Liquidity Purchaser shall not be required to make any such
assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such
Liquidity Purchaser or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to
require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
