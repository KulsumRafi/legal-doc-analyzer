instruments or agreements referred to therein or a waiver of any Event of
Default under the Credit Agreement, whether or not known to the Agent or the

such U.S. Guarantor is a party and all of the Collateral, as the case may be,
described therein do, and shall continue to, secure the payment of all of the
Secured Obligations (in each case, as defined in the Security and Pledge
Agreement).

invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity
or enforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability
of such provision in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions of this
Amendment in any jurisdiction.
