face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT made this 24th day of December 2002, between Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (&#147;Jacobs&#148;) and Richard J. Slater (&#147;Slater&#148;).</font></p>
<p> <font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Slater has been employed as a senior executive by Jacobs and Jacobs wishes to acknowledge that Slater&#146;s contributions to the growth and
prosperity of Jacobs over his years of service have been many and varied.</font></p> <p> <font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Jacobs and Slater have agreed that Slater will
transition from his executive role into a support, advice and consulting role, and ultimately retire from Jacobs at the end of 2006.</font></p> <p> <font size=2
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Jacobs considers that it is essential to retain the occasional services of Slater as an employee during the term of this Agreement and Slater agrees to
perform such services as may be reasonably requested of him from time to time during that period.</font></p> <p> <font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration
of the promises and the agreements contained herein it is agreed as follows: </font></p> <p> <font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slater will continue in a
senior executive capacity through December 31, 2002, with such duties and responsibilities as may from time to time be mutually agreed to between the CEO of Jacobs and Slater.&#160; As of January 1, 2003, the parties agree that Slater will no longer
continue in a senior executive capacity and will not be re-elected as an executive officer at the Annual Meeting of the Board of Directors in February 2003.&#160; </font></p> <p><font size=2
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From and after January 1, 2003 through the end of the term of this Agreement, Slater will perform such duties and responsibilities as
may from time to time be mutually agreed to between the CEO of Jacobs and Slater.&#160; Slater shall be based in, and his primary workplace and office located in, Pasadena, California except for reasonable required travel on Jacobs&#146;
business.&#160; From and after January 1, 2003, for the base compensation set forth in Paragraph 3 below, Slater agrees to perform services up to two (2) days per month.&#160; Any unused hours in any month will not accumulate and will not roll into
any subsequent months.&#160; In the event Jacobs and Slater agree on any additional services to be performed in any month in excess of two (2) days, in addition to the compensation being paid in accordance with Paragraph 3, Slater shall also receive
the additional compensation set forth in Paragraph 4.</font></p>

  <p> <font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In consideration for Slater agreeing to be available to perform services under this
Agreement, Slater will be paid a base salary payable in accordance with Jacobs&#146; standard practices and procedures as follows:&#160; a) From January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003, Slater&#146;s base salary shall remain the same as in effect
as of the date hereof; and b) From January 1, 2004 through the end of the term of this Agreement, Slater&#146;s base salary shall be $10,000 per month. </font></p> <p> <font size=2
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all hours worked in any month in excess of two (2) days, Slater will be paid at a rate of $500.00 per hour.</font></p> <p><font
size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Slater will be entitled to continue during the term of this Agreement to participate in all benefits currently
being provided to Slater as of the date hereof, including but not limited to, life insurance, disability insurance, health insurance, ESP, EDP, employee stock purchase plan and Section 401(k) plan, in accordance with their respective terms and
conditions (the &#147;Jacobs Benefits&#148;).&#160; With regard to EDP and ESP, at Slater&#146;s option, extension of the EDP and ESP Plans, year-by-year, up to June 1, 2011 will be made by Jacobs; provided, however, such request must be made in
writing and provided to Jacobs, except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 17(c), no later than December 31, 2005.&#160; Slater will continue to be able to exercise any previous stock option grants during the term of this Agreement and thereafter in
accordance with the terms of the respective grants and of the Jacobs 1999 Stock Incentive Plan.&#160; Slater will not be eligible to receive any stock option grants in FY 2003 and thereafter.</font></p> <p> <font size=2
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slater acknowledges that while he will continue to be a member of the Jacobs Incentive Plan for Officers and Key Managers (the
&#147;Bonus Plan&#148;) for Fiscal Year 2002 and therefore will be eligible to receive a full Bonus Award in Fiscal Year 2002, that for FY 2003 he will be eligible to receive a full Bonus Award, that for FY 2004 he will receive only a partial Bonus
Award covering one-fourth (1/4th) of the year and that he will not be a member of the Bonus Plan in Fiscal Year 2005 and thereafter and therefore will not be eligible to receive any Bonus Award in Fiscal Year 2005 and thereafter.&#160; Slater will
be entitled to receive the future installments of his Fiscal Year 2001, 2002 and 2003 Bonus Awards and the partial 2004 Bonus Award in accordance with the terms of the Bonus Plan.</font></p> <p><font size=2
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of the death of Slater during the term of this Agreement:&#160; (1) Jacobs agrees that for the remainder of the term of
this Agreement that it will continue to pay to Slater&#146;s Beneficiaries, as he may from time to time designate:&#160; (i) the amount that Slater would have received as base salary pursuant to Paragraph 3 above, subject to standard withholdings
and taxes; (ii) on or about the time when bonus payments are customarily made, the amount Slater would have received as bonus installment payments under the Bonus Plan, if any, subject to standard withholdings and taxes; and (iii) to pay any
compensation earned pursuant to Paragraph 4; and (2) all Jacobs Benefits being provided to Slater shall cease and Slater&#146;s beneficiaries shall have such survivorship rights in accordance with each plan&#146;s respective terms and
conditions.&#160; Slater hereby designates his wife, Marie Christine Slater, as his Beneficiary.</font></p> <p> <font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Effective as of January 1, 2004, Slater agrees that his employment will be converted to Modified Full-Time Status.&#160; At such time Slater shall also convert to Limited Benefits Only (LBO) status and will no longer accrue vacation and will not be
eligible for holiday or sick pay.&#160; However, all other benefits that Slater was participating in at the time of such conversion would continue, including but not limited to, health, disability and life insurance coverages.&#160; On the date of
such conversion, all of Slater&#146;s accrued vacation would be paid to him in full.&#160; </font></p>
