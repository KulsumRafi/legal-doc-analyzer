              combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of Kendle

              employee). Also, an Eligible employee may not purchase Common
              Shares hereunder if and to the extent, for any calendar year, such
              employee's aggregate rights to purchase stock for such calendar
              year under all employee stock purchase plans of Kendle would
              exceed $25,000 of the fair market value of such stock (with such
              fair market value determined in the manner provided by Section
              423(b)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code).


         3.   Section 13.3 is added to the Plan, to immediately follow Section
              13.2 and shall read in its entirety as follows:

              Notwithstanding any other provision contained within this Plan,
              the maximum number of Common Shares which may be purchased by an
              Eligible employee during a Purchase Period shall be limited to not
              more than 5,000 shares.

         Except as modified in items 1, 2 and 3 above, all other provisions of
the Plan shall remain unchanged. This Amendment Number 1 to the Plan shall
become effective only upon the approval (by written consent or otherwise) of
Kendle's Board of Directors or an authorized subcommittee thereof.

                            KENDLE INTERNATIONAL INC.
                        1997 DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION PLAN

This Amendment No. 2 is made and effective as of November 8, 2001 to the 1997

circumstances:

         A.   Kendle International Inc. (the "Company") desires to amend the

              up to fifty percent (50%) of the compensation payable thereunder
              in the form of cash; and

         B.   On November 8, 2001, the Board of Directors of the Company
              approved amending the Plan as set forth below.

NOW, THEREFORE, the Plan is amended as follows:

1.       Definitions. All capitalized terms used herein, unless specifically
         defined in this Amendment, shall have the meanings given to them in the
         Plan.

2.       Amendment.

              2.1          The caption paragraph of the Plan is hereby amended
                           and restated to read in its entirety as follows:

                           "This Directors' Compensation Plan has been adopted
                           by the Board of Directors of Kendle International
                           Inc. in order to align further the interests of the

                           Common Shares of the Company."

              2.2          Section 2 of the Plan is hereby amended and restated
                           to read in its entirety as follows:

                           "2. PAYMENT TERMS

                           The meeting fees set forth in Section 1 above shall
                           be paid by the Company quarterly, in arrears, as soon
                           as practicable following the end of each quarter in
                           the form of Company Common Shares. Notwithstanding
                           the foregoing, a Director may elect to receive not

                           to be paid hereunder in the form of cash. Such
                           election may be made only once per year, in advance,
                           and will be effective for the entire ensuing calendar
                           year.

                           The number of Common Shares to be issued shall be
                           determined by dividing the dollar amount of the fee
                           by the average of the per share Fair Market Value of
                           the Common Shares, as defined in Section 3, for the
                           ten trading days prior to the end of each quarter.
                           The resulting number shall then be rounded up to the
                           nearest share."

3.       Affirmation. Except as amended hereby, the Plan remains unchanged and
         in full force and effect.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amendment has been executed as of November 8, 2001.
