February 26, 2002 is entered into by and between MacroPore, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) and Ari Bisimis, an individual (&#147;Pledgor&#148;).</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

Company a full-recourse promissory note evidencing such loan (the &#147;Note&#148;) and
has agreed to pledge all of the Stock to the Company as security for the
payment of the Note.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:1.0in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">WHEREAS, Pledgor is a director and officer of the

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:1.0in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing
facts, the parties hereto agree as follows:</font></p>

all of Pledgor&#146;s obligations under the Note and for Pledgor&#146;s performance of
all of its obligations under this Agreement.</font></p>

Pledgor shall forthwith deliver to the Company the Collateral together
with stock powers in form attached hereto as <u>Exhibit A</u>, duly executed in

Company agrees to cooperate with Pledgor and to use commercially reasonable

including, but not limited to, by entering into a securities account control
agreement with the securities intermediary, if any, holding the Collateral on
account for Pledgor.</font></p>

purchase or carry any margin stock.</font></p>

Pledgor, sell or otherwise assign, give an option or options to purchase or
dispose of and deliver the Collateral (or contract to do so), or any part
thereof.&#160; Such disposition may be made
in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange,
broker&#146;s board or at any of the Company&#146;s offices or elsewhere upon such terms

received by the Company (which cash proceeds shall be applied by the Company
against Pledgor&#146;s obligations under the Note) and after all of Pledgor&#146;s
obligations under the Note have been paid in full.&#160; In case of any sale of all or any part of the Collateral on
credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the
Company until the selling price is paid by the purchaser thereof, but the

pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of such failure, the Collateral may
again be sold as herein provided.</font></p>
