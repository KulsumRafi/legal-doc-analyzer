        ARTICLE II: SALE AND CONVEYANCE OF MORTGAGE LOANS; POSSESSION OF
     MORTGAGE FILES; BOOKS AND RECORDS; DELIVERY OF MORTGAGE LOAN DOCUMENTS

     Section 2.01 SALE AND CONVEYANCE OF MORTGAGE LOANS.

     The Seller agrees to sell and the Purchaser agrees to purchase, from time
to time, those certain Mortgage Loans identified in the Purchase Advice (as
defined in the Purchaser Guide), on the price and terms set forth herein. The
Purchaser, on any Funding Date, shall be obligated to purchase only such
Mortgage Loans set forth in the applicable Purchase Advice, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

     The Purchaser will purchase Mortgage Loan(s) from the Sellers, from time to
time on such Funding Dates as may be agreed upon by the Purchaser and the
applicable Seller, provided that in the event that the Purchaser wishes to
terminate the purchase of any particular Mortgage Loan product line set forth in
the Cendant Guide, the Purchaser shall give the Sellers 60 days prior written
notice of such termination, and shall purchase, in accordance with its ordinary
practice and pursuant to the terms hereof, Mortgage Loans of such product
originated by a Seller during such notice period. The closing shall, at the
Purchaser's option be either: by telephone, confirmed by letter or wire as the
parties shall agree; or conducted in person at such place, as the parties shall
agree. On the Funding Date and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Seller will sell, transfer, assign, set over and convey to the
Purchaser, without recourse except as set forth in this Agreement, and the
Purchaser will purchase, all of the right,


                                      -11-
<PAGE>

title and interest of the applicable Seller in and to the Mortgage Loans being
conveyed by it hereunder, as identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule.

     Examination of the Mortgage Files may be made by the Purchaser or its
designee as follows. No later than five Business Days prior to the Funding Date,
Seller will deliver to the Purchaser or Custodian Legal Documents required
pursuant to Schedule B-1. Upon the Purchaser's request, Seller shall make the
Credit Documents available to the Purchaser for review, at the applicable
Seller's place of business and during reasonable business hours. If the
Purchaser makes such examination prior to the Funding Date and identifies any
Mortgage Loans that do not conform to the Cendant Guide, such Mortgage Loans
will be deleted from the Mortgage Loan Schedule at the Purchaser's discretion.
The Purchaser may, at its option and without notice to the Seller, purchase all
or part of the Mortgage Loans without conducting any partial or complete
examination. The fact that the Purchaser has conducted or has failed to conduct
any partial or complete examination of the Mortgage Loan files shall not affect
the Purchaser's rights to demand repurchase, substitution or other relief as
provided herein.

     On the Funding Date and in accordance with the terms herein, the Purchaser
will pay to the Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
Purchase Price, together with interest at the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate from
the Cut-Off Date to the Funding Date, according to the instructions to be
provided, respectively, by Cendant Mortgage and the Trust.

     The Purchaser shall be entitled to all scheduled principal due after the
Cut-Off Date, all other recoveries of principal collected after the Funding Date
and all payments of interest on the Mortgage Loans (minus that portion of any
such payment which is allocable to the period prior to the Funding Date). The
principal balance of each Mortgage Loan as of the Funding Date is determined
after application of payments of principal due on or before the Funding Date
whether or not collected. Therefore, payments of scheduled principal and
interest prepaid for a due date beyond the Funding Date shall not be applied to
the principal balance as of the Funding Date. Such prepaid amounts shall be the
property of the Purchaser. The Seller shall hold any such prepaid amounts for
the benefit of the Purchaser for subsequent remittance by the Seller to the
Purchaser. All scheduled payments of principal due on or before the Funding Date
and collected by Seller after the Funding Date shall belong to Seller.

     Section 2.02 POSSESSION OF MORTGAGE FILES.

     Upon the sale of any Mortgage Loan, the ownership of such Mortgage Loan,
including the Mortgage Note, the Mortgage, the contents of the related Mortgage
File and all rights, benefits, payments, proceeds and obligations arising
therefrom or in connection therewith, shall then be vested in the Purchaser, and
the ownership of all records and documents with respect to such Mortgage Loan
prepared by or which come into the possession of the Seller shall immediately
vest in the Purchaser and, to the extent retained by the Seller, shall be
retained and maintained, in trust, by the Seller at the will of the Purchaser in
a custodial capacity only. The contents of such Mortgage File not delivered to
the Purchaser or the Purchaser's designee are and shall be held in trust by the
Seller for the benefit of the Purchaser as the owner thereof and the Sellers'
possession of the contents of each Mortgage File so retained is at the will of
the Purchaser for the sole purpose of servicing the related Mortgage Loan, and
such retention and


                                      -12-
<PAGE>

possession by the Seller is in a custodial capacity only. Mortgage Files shall
be maintained separately from the other books and records of the Seller. Each
Seller shall release from its custody of the contents of any Mortgage File only
in accordance with written instructions from the Purchaser, except where such
release is required as incidental to the Servicer's servicing of the Mortgage
Loans or is in connection with a repurchase of any such Mortgage Loan pursuant
to SECTION 3.04.

     Any documents released to a Seller or the Servicer in connection with the
foreclosure or servicing of any Mortgage Loan shall be held by such Person in
trust for the benefit of the Purchaser in accordance with this SECTION 2.02.
Such Person shall return to the Purchaser such documents when such Person's need
therefor in connection with such foreclosure or servicing no longer exists
(unless sooner requested by Purchaser); PROVIDED that, if such Mortgage Loan is
liquidated, then, upon the delivery by a Seller or the Servicer to the Purchaser
of a request for the release of such documents and a certificate certifying as
to such liquidation, the Purchaser shall promptly release and, to the extent
necessary, deliver to such Person such documents.

     At the option of Purchaser, the Mortgage Files shall be held by the
Custodian in accordance with the terms of the Custodial Agreement.

     Section 2.03 BOOKS AND RECORDS.

     The sale of each of its Mortgage Loans shall be reflected on the applicable
Seller's balance sheet and other financial statements as a sale of assets by the
applicable Seller. Record title to each Mortgage and the related Mortgage Note
as of the applicable Funding Date shall be in the name of the Purchaser or as
the Purchaser shall designate. Each Seller shall be responsible for maintaining,
and shall maintain, a complete set of books and records for the Mortgage Loans
it conveyed to the Purchaser which shall be clearly marked to reflect the sale
of each Mortgage Loan to the Purchaser and the ownership of each Mortgage Loan
by Purchaser.

     Section 2.04 DEFECTIVE DOCUMENTS; DELIVERY OF MORTGAGE LOAN DOCUMENTS.

     Subsequent to the Funding Date, if the Purchaser or either Seller finds any
document or documents constituting a part of a Mortgage File to be defective or
missing in any material respect (in this Section 2.04, a "DEFECT"), the party
discovering such Defect shall promptly so notify the other parties. If the
Defect pertains to the Mortgage Note or the Mortgage, then the applicable Seller
shall have a period of 45 days within which to correct or cure any such defect
after the earlier of such Seller's discovery of same or such Seller being
notified of same. If such Defect can ultimately be cured but is not reasonably
expected to be cured within such 45 day period, such Seller shall have such
additional time as is reasonably determined by Purchaser to cure or correct such
Defect provided that such Seller has commenced curing or correcting such Defect
and is diligently pursuing same. If the Defect pertains to any other document
constituting a part of a Mortgage File, then such Seller shall have a period of
90 days within which to correct or cure any such Defect after the earlier of
such Seller's discovery of same or such Seller being notified of same. If such
Defect can ultimately be cured but is not reasonably expected to be cured within
the 90 day period, then such Seller shall have such additional time as is
reasonably determined by the Purchaser to cure or correct such Defect provided
such Seller has commenced


                                      -13-
<PAGE>

curing or correcting such Defect and is diligently pursuing same. Cendant
Mortgage hereby covenants and agrees that, if any material Defect cannot be
corrected or cured, the related Mortgage Loan shall automatically constitute,
upon the expiration of the applicable cure period described above and without
any further action by any other party, a Defective Mortgage Loan, whereupon
Cendant Mortgage shall repurchase such Mortgage Loan by paying to the Purchaser
the Repurchase Price therefor in accordance with Section 3.04(3).

     The applicable Seller will, with respect to each Mortgage Loan to be
purchased by the Purchaser, deliver and release to the Purchaser the Legal
Documents as set forth in Section 2.01. If the applicable Seller cannot deliver
an original Mortgage with evidence of recording thereon, original assumption,
modification and substitution agreements with evidence of recording thereon or
an original intervening assignment with evidence of recording thereon within the
applicable time periods, then such Seller shall promptly deliver to the
Purchaser such original Mortgages and original intervening assignments with
evidence of recording indicated thereon upon receipt thereof from the public
recording official, except in cases where the original Mortgage or original
intervening assignments are retained permanently by the recording office, in
which case, such Seller shall deliver a copy of such Mortgage or intervening
assignment, as the case may be, certified to be a true and complete copy of the
recorded original thereof.

     If the original Mortgage was not delivered pursuant to the preceding
paragraph, then the applicable Seller shall use its best efforts to promptly
secure the delivery of such originals and shall cause such originals to be
delivered to the Purchaser promptly upon receipt thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the original Mortgage, original assumption, modification, and
substitution agreements, the original of any intervening assignment or the
original policy of title insurance is not so delivered to the Purchaser within
180 days following the Funding Date, then, upon written notice by the Purchaser
to Cendant Mortgage, the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, then elect (by
providing written notice to Cendant Mortgage) to treat such Mortgage Loan as a
Defective Mortgage Loan, whereupon Cendant Mortgage shall repurchase such
Mortgage Loan by paying to the Purchaser the Repurchase Price therefor in
accordance with Section 3.04(3). The fact that the Purchaser has conducted or
failed to conduct any partial or complete examination of the Mortgage Files
shall not affect its right to demand repurchase or any other remedies provided
in this Agreement.

     At the Purchaser's request, the Assignments shall be promptly recorded in
the name of the Purchaser or in the name of a Person designated by the Purchaser
in all appropriate public offices for real property records. If any such
Assignment is lost or returned unrecorded because of a defect therein, then the
applicable Seller shall promptly prepare a substitute Assignment to cure such
defect and thereafter cause each such Assignment to be duly recorded. All
recording fees related to such a one-time recordation of the Assignments to or
by a Seller shall be paid by the applicable Seller.

     Section 2.05 TRANSFER OF MORTGAGE LOANS.

     Subject to the provisions of this Section 2.05, the Purchaser shall have
the right, without the consent of the Sellers, at any time and from time to
time, to assign any of the Mortgage Loans and all or any part of its interest
under this Agreement and designate any person to exercise any


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

rights of the Purchaser hereunder, and the assignees or designees shall accede
to the rights and obligations hereunder of the Purchaser with respect to such
Mortgage Loans. The Sellers recognize that the Mortgage Loans may be divided
into "packages" for resale ("MORTGAGE LOAN PACKAGES").

     All of the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the
Purchaser and any such assignees or designees. All references to the Purchaser
shall be deemed to include its assignees or designees. Utilizing resources
reasonably available to the Seller without incurring any cost except the
Seller's overhead and employees' salaries, the applicable Seller shall cooperate
in any such assignment of the Mortgage Loans and this Agreement; provided that
the Purchaser shall bear all costs associated with any such assignment of the
Mortgage Loans and this Agreement other than such Seller's overhead or
employees' salaries.

     The Servicer and the Purchaser acknowledge that the Servicer shall continue
to remit payments to the Purchaser on the Remittance Date after the transfer of
the Mortgage Loans, unless the Servicer was notified in writing of the new
record owner of the Mortgage Loans prior to the immediately preceding Record
Date, in which case, the Servicer shall remit to the new record owner (or
trustee or master servicer, as the case may be) of the Mortgage Loans.

     Any prospective assignees of the Purchaser who have entered into a
commitment to purchase any of the Mortgage Loans may review and underwrite the
Servicer's servicing and origination operations, upon reasonable prior notice to
the Servicer, and the Servicer shall cooperate with such review and underwriting
to the extent such prospective assignees request information or documents that
are reasonably available and can be produced without unreasonable expense or
effort. The Servicer shall make the Mortgage Files related to the Mortgage Loans
held by the Servicer available at the Servicer's principal operations center for
review by any such prospective assignees during normal business hours upon
reasonable prior notice to the Servicer (in no event less than 5 Business Days
prior notice). The Servicer may, in its sole discretion, require that such
prospective assignees sign a confidentiality agreement with respect to such
information disclosed to the prospective assignee which is not available to the
public at large and a release agreement with respect to its activities on the
Servicer's premises.

     The Servicer shall keep at its servicing office books and records in which,
subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Servicer shall
note transfers of Mortgage Loans. The Purchaser may, subject to the terms of
this Agreement, sell and transfer, in whole or in part, any or all of the
Mortgage Loans; PROVIDED that no such sale and transfer shall be binding upon
the Servicer unless such transferee shall agree in writing to an Assignment,
Assumption and Recognition Agreement, in substantially the form of EXHIBIT 2.05
attached hereto, and an executed copy of such Assignment, Assumption and
Recognition Agreement shall have been delivered to the Servicer. The Servicer
shall evidence its acknowledgment of any transfers of the Mortgage Loans to any
assignees of the Purchaser by executing such Assignment, Assumption and
Recognition Agreement. The Servicer shall mark its books and records to reflect
the ownership of the Mortgage Loans by any such assignees, and the previous
Purchaser shall be released from its obligations hereunder accruing after the
date of transfer to the extent such obligations relate to Mortgage Loans sold by
the Purchaser. This Agreement shall be binding


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

upon and inure to the benefit of the Purchaser and the Servicer and their
permitted successors, assignees and designees.

existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, and has all licenses necessary to carry on its business now being
conducted and is licensed, qualified and in good standing under the laws of each
state where a Mortgaged Property is located or is otherwise exempt under
applicable law from such qualification or is otherwise not required under
applicable law to effect such qualification; no demand for such qualification
has been made upon the Seller by any state having jurisdiction and in any event
the Seller is or will be in compliance with the laws of any such state to the
extent necessary to enforce each Mortgage Loan and with respect to Cendant
Mortgage, service each Mortgage Loan in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

     (2) DUE AUTHORITY. Cendant Mortgage had the full power and authority and
legal right to originate the Mortgage Loans that it originated, if any. The
Seller had the full power and authority and legal right to acquire the Mortgage
Loans that it acquired. The Seller has the full power and authority to hold each
Mortgage Loan, to sell each Mortgage Loan and to execute, deliver and perform,
and to enter into and consummate, all transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Seller has duly authorized the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, has duly executed and delivered this Agreement,
and this Agreement, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Purchaser, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, insolvency,
moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally
or the rights of creditors of banks and to the general principles of equity

     (3) NO CONFLICT. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
acquisition or origination, as applicable, of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller,
the sale of the Mortgage Loans, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or the fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, will not conflict with or result in a breach of

Seller or its property is subject, or impair the ability of the Purchaser to
realize on the Mortgage Loans.

adverse effect on the ability of the Seller to perform under this Agreement,
nor, to the best of the Seller's knowledge, has any event occurred which, with
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under any such
agreement, contract, instrument or indenture and have a material adverse effect
on the ability of the Seller to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

investigation pending or, to the best of the Seller's knowledge, threatened,
against the Seller, which, either in any one instance or in the aggregate, if
determined adversely to the Seller would adversely affect the sale of the
Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser or the execution, delivery or enforceability of
this Agreement or result in any material liability of the Seller, or draw into
question the validity of this Agreement, or have a material adverse effect on
the financial condition of the Seller.

     (9) NO CONSENT REQUIRED. No consent, approval, authorization or order of
any court or governmental agency or body is required for the execution, delivery

specifically relies in purchasing such Mortgage Loan. Such representations and
warranties speak as of the Funding Date unless otherwise indicated, but shall
survive any subsequent transfer, assignment or conveyance of such Mortgage

<PAGE>

     (4) PAYMENTS CURRENT. All payments required to be made up to and including
the Funding Date for such Mortgage Loan under the terms of the Mortgage Note
have been made, such that such Mortgage Loan is not delinquent 30 days or more
on the Funding Date, and has not been so delinquent in the twelve months prior
to the Funding Date.

     (5) NO OUTSTANDING CHARGES. There are no delinquent taxes, insurance
premiums, assessments, including assessments payable in future installments, or
other outstanding charges affecting the Mortgaged Property related to such
Mortgage Loan.

     (6) ORIGINAL TERMS UNMODIFIED. The terms of the Mortgage Note and the
Mortgage related to such Mortgage Loan have not been impaired, waived, altered
or modified in any material respect, except as specifically set forth in the
related Mortgage Loan Schedule.

     (7) NO DEFENSES. The Mortgage Note and the Mortgage related to such
Mortgage Loan are not subject to any right of rescission, set-off or defense,
including the defense of usury, nor will the operation of any of the terms of
such Mortgage Note and such Mortgage, or the exercise of any right thereunder,
render such Mortgage unenforceable, in whole or in part, or subject to any right
of rescission, set-off or defense, including the defense of usury and no such
right of rescission, set-off or defense has been asserted with respect thereto.

     (8) HAZARD INSURANCE. (a) All buildings upon the Mortgaged Property related
to such Mortgage Loan are insured by an insurer acceptable to FNMA or FHLMC
against loss by fire, hazards of extended coverage and such other hazards as are
customary in the area where such Mortgaged Property is located, pursuant to
insurance policies conforming to the requirements of either SECTION 5.10 or
SECTION 5.11. All such insurance policies (collectively, the "HAZARD INSURANCE
POLICY") contain a standard mortgagee clause naming the originator of such
Mortgage Loan, its successors and assigns, as mortgagee. Such policies are the
valid and binding obligations of the insurer, and all premiums thereon due to
date have been paid. The related Mortgage obligates the Mortgagor thereunder to
maintain all such insurance at such Mortgagor's cost and expense, and on such
Mortgagor's failure to do so, authorizes the holder of such Mortgage to maintain
such insurance at such Mortgagor's cost and expense and to seek reimbursement
therefor from such Mortgagor; or (b) in the case of a condominium or PUD project
that is not covered by an individual policy, the condominium or PUD project is
covered by a "master" or "blanket" policy and there exists and is in the
Servicer's Mortgage File a certificate of insurance showing that the individual
unit that secures the first mortgage or share loan is covered under such policy.
The insurance policy contains a standard mortgagee clause naming the originator
of such Mortgage Loan (and its successors and assigns), as insured mortgagee.
Such policies are the valid and binding obligations of the insurer, and all
premiums thereon have been paid. The insurance policy provides for advance
notice to the Seller or Servicer if the policy is canceled or not renewed, or if
any other change that adversely affects the Seller's interests is made; the
certificate includes the types and amounts of coverage provided, describes any
endorsements that are part of the "master" policy and would be acceptable
pursuant to the FNMA Guide.

     (9) COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. All requirements of any federal, state
or local law (including usury, truth in lending, real estate settlement
procedures, consumer credit


                                      -21-
<PAGE>

protection, equal credit opportunity or disclosure laws) applicable to the
origination and servicing of such Mortgage Loan have been complied with in all
material respects.

     (10) NO SATISFACTION OF MORTGAGE. The Mortgage related to such Mortgage
Loan has not been satisfied, canceled or subordinated, in whole or in part, or
rescinded, and the related Mortgaged Property has not been released from the
lien of such Mortgage, in whole or in part, nor has any instrument been executed
that would effect any such release, cancellation, subordination or rescission.
The Seller has not waived the performance by the Mortgagor of any action, if the
Mortgagor's failure to perform such action would cause the Mortgage Loan to be
in default, nor has the Seller waived any default resulting from any action or
inaction by the Mortgagor.

     (11) VALID FIRST LIEN. The Mortgage related to such Mortgage Loan is a
valid, subsisting and enforceable perfected first lien on the related Mortgaged
Property, including all improvements on the related Mortgaged Property, which
Mortgaged Property is free and clear of any encumbrances and liens having
priority over the first lien of the Mortgage subject only to (a) the lien of
current real estate taxes and special assessments not yet due and payable, (b)
covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other
matters of the public record as of the date of recording of such Mortgage which
are acceptable to mortgage lending institutions generally, are referred to in
the lender's title insurance policy and do not adversely affect the market value
or intended use of the related Mortgaged Property, and (c) other matters to
which like properties are commonly subject which do not individually or in the
aggregate materially interfere with the benefits of the security intended to be
provided by such Mortgage or the use, enjoyment, or market value of the related
Mortgaged Property.

     (12) VALIDITY OF DOCUMENTS. The Mortgage Note and the Mortgage related to
such Mortgage Loan are genuine and each is the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the maker thereof, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and general equitable principles (regardless whether such
enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     (13) VALID EXECUTION OF DOCUMENTS. All parties to the Mortgage Note and the
Mortgage related to such Mortgage Loan had legal capacity to enter into such
Mortgage Loan and to execute and deliver the related Mortgage Note and the
related Mortgage and the related Mortgage Note and the related Mortgage have

     (14) FULL DISBURSEMENT OF PROCEEDS. Such Mortgage Loan has closed and the
proceeds of such Mortgage Loan have been fully disbursed prior to the Funding
Date; PROVIDED that, with respect to any Mortgage Loan originated within the
previous 120 days, alterations and repairs with respect to the related Mortgaged

such Mortgage Loan, and, if so, such funds are held in escrow by the Seller, a

state wherein the related Mortgaged Property is located.

     (17) TITLE INSURANCE. (a) Such Mortgage Loan is covered by an ALTA lender's
title insurance policy or short form title policy acceptable to FNMA and FHLMC

lender's title insurance policy acceptable to FNMA and FHLMC), issued by a title
insurer acceptable to FNMA and FHLMC and qualified to do business in the
jurisdiction where the related Mortgaged Property is located, insuring (subject
to the exceptions contained in clauses (11)(a) and (b) above) the Seller or
Servicer, and its successors and assigns, as to the first priority lien of the
related Mortgage in the original principal amount of such Mortgage Loan and in
the case of ARM Loans, against any loss by reason of the invalidity or
unenforceability of the lien resulting from the provisions of such Mortgage
providing for adjustment to the applicable Note Rate and Monthly Payment.
Additionally, such lender's title insurance policy affirmatively insures against
encroachments by or upon the related Mortgaged Property or any interest therein
or any other adverse circumstance that either is disclosed or would have been
disclosed by an accurate survey. The Seller or Servicer is the sole insured of
such lender's title insurance policy, and such lender's title insurance policy

Mortgage (including the Seller) has done, by act or omission, anything that
would impair the coverage of such lender's insurance policy, and, there is no
act, omission, condition, or information that would impair the coverage of such

unit mortgage in a condominium or PUD project related to such Mortgage Loan

acceleration existing under the Mortgage, the Mortgage Note, or any other
agreements, documents, or instruments related to such Mortgage Loan; (b) there
is no event that, with the lapse of time, the giving of notice, or both, would

Mortgagor(s) with respect to such Mortgage Loan is (1) not in default under any
other Mortgage Loan or (2) the subject of an Insolvency Proceeding; (d) no event
of acceleration has previously occurred, and no notice of default has been sent,

with, the lien of the related Mortgage.

     (20) LOCATION OF IMPROVEMENTS; NO ENCROACHMENTS. As of the date of

benefits of the security provided thereby, including, (a) in the case of a
Mortgage designated as a deed of trust, by trustee's sale, and (b) in the case
of a Mortgage, otherwise by judicial foreclosure. There is no homestead or other
exemption available to the Mortgagor which would interfere with the right to
sell the Mortgaged Property at a trustee's sale or the right to foreclose the
Mortgage subject to applicable federal and state laws and judicial precedent
with respect to bankruptcy and right of redemption.

default by the related Mortgagor.

     (29) LTV; PRIMARY MORTGAGE INSURANCE POLICY. If such Mortgage Loan had a
Loan-to-Value Ratio of more than 80% at origination, and is not originated under
an additional collateral mortgage loan program, such Mortgage Loan is and will

which insures the Seller or Servicer, its successors and assigns and insureds in
the amount set forth on the Mortgage Loan Schedule. No action, inaction, or
event has occurred and no state of facts exists that has, or will result in the
exclusion from, denial of, or defense to coverage. All provisions of such
Primary Insurance Policy have been and are being complied with, such policy is
in full force and effect, and all premiums due thereunder have been paid. Any
related Mortgage subject to any such Primary Insurance Policy obligates the
Mortgagor thereunder to maintain such insurance for the time period required by

of origination, the Loan-to-Value Ratio of such Mortgage Loan is as specified in
the applicable Mortgage Loan Schedule.

association, a savings bank, a commercial bank, credit union, insurance company
or an institution which is supervised and examined by a federal or state
authority, or a mortgagee approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development pursuant to Sections 203 and 211 of the National Housing Act (a "HUD
APPROVED MORTGAGEE"), and was so at the time such Mortgage Loan was originated
(Cendant Mortgage or such other entity, the "ORIGINATOR") or (c) closed in the
name of a loan broker under the circumstances described in the following
sentence. If such Mortgage Loan was originated through a loan broker, such
Mortgage Loan met the Originator's underwriting criteria at the time of
origination and was originated in accordance with the Originator's policies and
procedures and the Originator acquired such Mortgage Loan from the loan broker
contemporaneously with the origination thereof. The Mortgage Loans that the
Trust is selling to Purchaser were originated by or on behalf of Cendant
Mortgage and subsequently assigned to the Trust.

     (35) ACCEPTABLE INVESTMENT. There is no circumstance or condition with
respect to the related Mortgage File, Mortgage, Mortgaged Property, Mortgagor or
Mortgagor's credit standing, including but not limited to `limited income
documentation programs' whereby the lending decision is based upon factors other
than the Mortgagor's income, that can reasonably be expected to cause private
institutional investors to regard such Mortgage Loan as an unacceptable
investment, cause such Mortgage Loan to become delinquent, or adversely affect
the value or marketability of such Mortgage Loan.

     (36) TRANSFER OF MORTGAGE LOANS. The Assignment is in recordable form and
is acceptable for recording under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
Mortgaged Property is located.

     (37) PREDATORY LENDING REGULATIONS; HIGH COST LOANS. None of the Mortgage
Loans are classified as (a) "high cost" loans under the Home Ownership and
Equity Protection Act of 1994 or (b) "high cost," "threshold," or "predatory"
loans under any other applicable state, federal or local law.

     Section 3.04 REPURCHASE.

     (1) It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties set
forth in SECTIONS 3.01, 3.02 and 3.03 shall survive the sale of the Mortgage
Loans to the Purchaser and shall inure to the benefit of the Purchaser,
notwithstanding any restrictive or qualified endorsement on any Mortgage Note or
Assignment or the examination of any Mortgage File.

     (2) Upon discovery by either of the Sellers or the Purchaser of a breach of

contained in SECTIONS 3.01, 3.02 or 3.03 that materially and adversely affects
the value


                                      -26-
<PAGE>

of a Mortgage Loan (a "DEFECTIVE MORTGAGE LOAN"; PROVIDED that "Defective
Mortgage Loan" shall also include any Mortgage Loan treated or designated as
such in accordance with SECTION 2.04) within which to correct or cure such
breach. If such breach can ultimately be cured but is not reasonably expected to
be cured within the 60-day period, then the applicable Seller shall have such
additional time, if any, as is reasonably determined by the Purchaser to cure
such breach provided that the Seller has commenced curing or correcting such
breach and is diligently pursuing same. Each Seller hereby covenants and agrees
with respect to each Mortgage Loan conveyed by it that, if any breach relating
thereto cannot be corrected or cured within the applicable cure period or such
additional time, if any, as is reasonably determined by the Purchaser, then such
Seller shall, at the direction of the Purchaser, repurchase the Defective
Mortgage Loan at the applicable Repurchase Price.

     (4) Any repurchase of a Defective Mortgage Loan required hereunder shall be
accomplished by payment of the applicable Repurchase Price within 3 Business
Days of expiration of the applicable time period referred to above in paragraph

Purchaser's Account. It is understood and agreed that the obligations of a
Seller (a) set forth in this SECTION 3.04(4) to cure any breach of such Seller's
representations and warranties contained in SECTION 3.03 or to repurchase the
Defective Mortgage Loan(s) and (b) set forth in SECTION 9.01 to indemnify the
Purchaser in connection with any breach of a Seller's representations and
warranties contained in SECTION 3.03 shall constitute the sole remedies of the
Purchaser respecting a breach of such representations and warranties.

     (5) The parties further agree that, in recognition of the Trust's rights
against Cendant Mortgage with respect to the Mortgage Loans acquired by it from
Cendant Mortgage and conveyed to the Purchaser hereunder, the Purchaser shall
have the right to cause Cendant Mortgage to repurchase directly any Defective
Mortgage Loan (other than as a result of a breach by the Trust of SECTION 3.03
(3) or 3.03(15) hereof, in which case the Purchaser shall have the right to
cause the Trust to repurchase directly the Defective Mortgage Loan) acquired
hereunder by the Purchaser from the Trust.

     Section 3.05 CERTAIN COVENANTS OF EACH SELLER AND THE SERVICER.

     Without incurring undue effort or any cost except the Seller's overhead or
employees' salaries, each Seller shall take reasonable steps to assist the
Purchaser, if the Purchaser so requests, in securitizing the Mortgage Loans and
selling undivided interests in such Mortgage Loans in a public offering or
private placement or selling participating interests in such Mortgage Loans,
which steps may include, (a) providing any information relating to the Mortgage
Loans reasonably necessary to assist in the preparation of any disclosure
documents, (b) providing information relating to delinquencies and defaults with
respect to the Servicer's servicing portfolio (or such portion thereof as is
similar to the Mortgage Loans), (c) entering into any other servicing, custodial
or other similar agreements, that are consistent with the provisions of this
Agreement, and which contain such provisions as are customary in securitizations
rated "AAA" (including a securitization involving a REMIC) (a "SECURITIZATION"),
and (d) providing as of the date of such securitization representations and
warranties as to the Seller and the Mortgage Loans, which are consistent with
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, but modified, if
necessary, to reflect changes since the Funding Date. In connection with such a


                                      -27-
<PAGE>

Securitization, the Purchaser may be required to engage a master servicer or
trustee to determine the allocation of payments to and make remittances to the
certificateholders, at the Purchaser's sole cost and expense. In the event that
a master servicer or trustee to determine the allocation of payments to and make
remittances to the certificateholders is requested by the Purchaser, the
Servicer agrees to service the Mortgage Loans in accordance with the reasonable
and customary requirements of such Securitization, which may include the
Servicer's acting as a subservicer in a master servicing arrangement. With
respect to the then owners of the Mortgage Loans, the Servicer shall thereafter
deal solely with such master servicer or trustee, as the case may be with
respect to such Mortgage Loans which are subject to the Securitization and shall
not be required to deal with any other party with respect to such Mortgage
Loans. The cost of such securitization shall be borne by the Purchaser, other
than the Seller's overhead or employees' salaries.

               ARTICLE IV: REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
                  PURCHASER AND CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO FUNDING

     Section 4.01 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

     The Purchaser represents, warrants and covenants to the Seller that as of
each Funding Date or as of such date specifically provided herein:

     (1) DUE ORGANIZATION. The Purchaser is an entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, and has all licenses necessary to carry on its business now being
conducted and is licensed, qualified and in good standing under the laws of each
state where a Mortgaged Property is located or is otherwise exempt under
applicable law from such qualification or is otherwise not required under
applicable law to effect such qualification; no demand for such qualification
has been made upon the Purchaser by any state having jurisdiction and in any
event the Purchaser is or will be in compliance with the laws of any such state
to the extent necessary to enforce each Mortgage Loan.

     (2) DUE AUTHORITY. The Purchaser had the full power and authority and legal
right to acquire the Mortgage Loans that it acquired. The Purchaser has the full
power and authority to hold each Mortgage Loan, to sell each Mortgage Loan and
to execute, deliver and perform, and to enter into and consummate, all
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser has duly authorized
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement, and this Agreement, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Seller, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership,
conservatorship, insolvency, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally or the rights of creditors of banks and to the
general principles of equity (whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law);

     (3) NO CONFLICT. None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
acquisition or origination, as applicable, of the Mortgage Loans by the
Purchaser, the purchase of the Mortgage Loans, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or the


                                      -28-
<PAGE>

fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
will conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of the Purchaser's organizational documents and bylaws or any legal
restriction or any agreement or instrument to which the Purchaser is now a party
or by which it is bound, or constitute a default or result in an acceleration
under any of the foregoing, or result in the violation of any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment or decree to which the Purchaser or its property is
subject, or impair the ability of the Purchaser to realize on the Mortgage
Loans, or impair the value of the Mortgage Loans.

     (4) ABILITY TO PERFORM. The Purchaser does not believe, nor does it have
any reason or cause to believe, that it cannot perform each and every covenant
contained in this Agreement.

     (5) NO MATERIAL DEFAULT. The Purchaser is not in material default under any
agreement, contract, instrument or indenture of any nature whatsoever to which
the Purchaser is a party or by which it (or any of its assets) is bound, which
default would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Purchaser to
perform under this Agreement, nor, to the best of the Purchaser's knowledge, has
any event occurred which, with notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a
default under any such agreement, contract, instrument or indenture and have a
material adverse effect on the ability of the Purchaser to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

     (6) NO CHANGE IN BUSINESS. There has been no change in the business,
operations, financial condition, properties or assets of the Purchaser since the
date of the Purchaser's financial statements that would have a material adverse

     (1) The Servicer, as independent contract servicer, shall service and
administer the Mortgage Loans and REO Property from and after each Funding Date
in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Mortgage Loans, applicable
law and the terms and provisions of this Agreement for and on behalf of, and in
the best interests of, the Purchaser (without taking into account any
relationship the Servicer may have with any Mortgagor or other Person, the
participation, if any, of the Servicer in any financing provided in connection
with the sale of any Mortgaged Property, or the Servicer's obligation to advance
any expenses or incur any costs in the performance of its duties hereunder) in
accordance with a standard that is not less than the higher of (a) the same
care, skill, prudence and diligence with which it services similar assets held
for its own or its Affiliates' account and (b) the same care, skill, prudence
and diligence with which it services similar assets for third party
institutional investors, in each case giving due consideration to customary and
usual standards of practice of prudent institutional mortgage loan servicers
utilized with respect to mortgage loans comparable to the Mortgage Loans.
Subject to the foregoing standards, in connection with such servicing and
administration, the Servicer shall seek to maximize the timely recovery of
principal and interest on the Mortgage Notes; PROVIDED that nothing contained
herein shall be construed as an express or implied guarantee by the Servicer of
the collectibility of payments on the Mortgage Loans or shall be construed as
impairing or adversely affecting any rights or benefits specifically provided by
this Agreement to the Servicer, including with respect to Servicing Fees.

     (2) To the extent consistent with SECTION 5.01(1) and further subject to
any express limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Servicer (acting alone
or, solely in the circumstances permitted hereunder, acting through a
subservicer) shall have full power and authority to do or cause to be done any
and all things that it may deem necessary or desirable in connection with such
servicing and administration, including the power and authority (a) to execute
and deliver, on behalf of the Purchaser, customary consents or waivers and other
instruments and documents (including estoppel certificates), (b) to consent to
transfers of any Mortgaged Property and assumptions of the Mortgage Notes and
related Mortgages, (c) to submit claims to collect any Insurance Proceeds and
Liquidation Proceeds, (d) to consent to the application of any Insurance
Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds to the restoration of the applicable Mortgaged
Property or otherwise, (e) to bring an action in a court of law, including an
unlawful detainer action, to enforce rights of the Purchaser with respect to any
Mortgaged Property, (f) to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Purchaser,
documents relating to the management, operation, maintenance, repair, leasing,
marketing and sale of any Mortgaged Property or any REO Property, and (g) to
effectuate foreclosure or other conversion of the ownership of the Mortgaged
Property securing any Mortgage Loan; PROVIDED that the Servicer shall not take
any action not provided for in this Agreement that is materially inconsistent
with or materially prejudices the interest of the Purchaser in any Mortgage Loan
or under this Agreement. If reasonably requested by the Servicer, the Purchaser
shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of attorney and other documents
reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to service and
administer the Mortgage Loans and the REO Properties, including documents
relating to the foreclosure, receivership, management, operation, maintenance,
repair, leasing, marketing and sale (in foreclosure or otherwise) of any
Mortgaged Property or any REO Property. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall limit the ability of the Servicer to lend money to (whether on a secured
or unsecured basis), and otherwise generally engage in any kind of business or
dealings with, any


                                      -31-
<PAGE>

Mortgagor as though the Servicer were not a party to this Agreement or to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

     (3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:

          (a) the Servicer acknowledges that the Purchaser or its designee will
     retain title to, and ownership of, the Mortgage Loans and the REO
     Properties and that the Servicer does not hereby acquire any title to,
     security interest in, or other rights of any kind in or to any Mortgage
     Loan or REO Property or any portion thereof;

          (b) the Servicer shall not file any lien or any other encumbrance on,
     exercise any right of setoff against, or attach or assert any claim in or
     on any Mortgage Loan or REO Property, unless authorized pursuant to a
     judicial or administrative proceeding or a court order;

          (c) the Servicer shall, in servicing the Mortgage Loans, follow and
     comply with the servicing guidelines established by FNMA, PROVIDED that the
     Servicer shall specifically notify the Purchaser in writing and obtain the
     Purchaser's written consent prior to the Servicer taking any of the
     following actions: (1) modifying, amending or waiving any of the financial
     terms of, or making any other material modifications to, a Mortgage Loan,
     except the Servicer may, upon the Mortgagor's request, accept a principal
     prepayment and re-amortize the then remaining principal balance over the
     then remaining term of the loan (resulting in a lower scheduled monthly
     payment but not change in the maturity date); (2) selling any Specially
     Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property; (3) making, with respect to any
     Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property, Servicing Advances
     (irrespective of whether non-recoverable); PROVIDED that the Servicer shall
     not be required to so advise the Purchaser to the extent that each related
     Servicing Advance as to the related Mortgaged Property or REO Property is
     not in excess of $10,000; (4) forgiving principal or interest on, or
     permitting to be satisfied at a discount, any Mortgage Loan; (5) accepting
     substitute or additional collateral, or releasing any collateral, for a
     Mortgage Loan. If the Purchaser has not approved or rejected in writing any
     proposed action(s) recommended by the Servicer to be taken hereunder within
     20 Business Days of the date such recommendation is made, then the
     Purchaser shall be deemed to have rejected such recommended action(s) and
     the Servicer shall not take any such action(s);

          (d) the Servicer shall notify the Purchaser of any modification,
     waiver or amendment of any term of any Mortgage Loan and the date thereof
     and shall deliver to the Purchaser, for deposit in the related Mortgage
     File, an original counterpart of the agreement relating to such
     modification, waiver or amendment promptly following the execution thereof;

          (e) the Servicer shall remain primarily liable for the full
     performance of its obligations hereunder notwithstanding any appointment by
     the Servicer of a subservicer or subservicers hereunder; and

          (f) the Purchaser may at any time and from time to time, in its sole
     discretion, upon 10 Business Days written notice to the Servicer, terminate
     the Servicer's servicing obligations hereunder with respect to (1) any REO
     Property or (2) any Mortgage Loan that, in accordance with the Purchaser's
     internal credit classification criteria, has been classified as


                                      -32-
<PAGE>

     "doubtful" or a "loss." Upon the effectiveness of any such termination of
     the Servicer's servicing obligations with respect to any such REO Property
     or Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall deliver all agreements, documents, and
     instruments related thereto to the Purchaser, in accordance with applicable
     law.

     Section 5.02 COLLECTION OF MORTGAGE LOAN PAYMENTS.

     Continuously from the date hereof until the principal and interest on all
Mortgage Loans are paid in full, the Servicer will proceed diligently to collect
all payments due under each Mortgage Loan when the same shall become due and
payable and shall, to the extent such procedures shall be consistent with this
Agreement and the terms and provisions of any related Primary Insurance Policy,
follow such collection procedures as it follows with respect to mortgage loans
comparable to the Mortgage Loans, which procedures shall in any event comply
with the servicing standards set forth in SECTION 5.01. Furthermore, the
Servicer shall ascertain and estimate annual ground rents, taxes, assessments,
fire and hazard insurance premiums, mortgage insurance premiums, and all other
charges that, as provided in the Mortgages, will become due and payable to the
end that the installments payable by the Mortgagors will be sufficient to pay
such charges as and when they become due and payable.

     Section 5.03 COLLECTION OF MORTGAGE LOAN PAYMENTS.

     The Servicer shall, within five (5) calendar days following each Record
Date, deliver to the Purchaser monthly reports (substantially in the form of

Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans. In addition, the Servicer shall, within one
(1) Business Day following the occurrence of any foreclosure sale with respect

substantially in the form of EXHIBIT 5.03(C) attached hereto.

     Section 5.04 ESTABLISHMENT OF COLLECTION ACCOUNT; DEPOSITS IN COLLECTION
ACCOUNT.

     The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received
pursuant to each Mortgage Loan separate and apart from any of its own funds and
general assets and shall establish and maintain one or more Collection Accounts,
in the form of time deposit or demand accounts constituting Eligible Accounts,
with any funds in excess of the current FDIC established insurance limits
invested in Permitted Investments. The creation of any Collection Account shall
be evidenced by a certification in the form of EXHIBIT 5.04-1 attached hereto,
in the case of an account established with the Servicer, or a letter agreement
in the form of EXHIBIT 5.04-2 attached hereto, in the case of an account held by
a depository other than the Servicer. In either case, a copy of such

          servicing procedures, the related Mortgage or applicable law;

     (6)  any Monthly Advances in accordance with SECTION 6.03;

     (7)  any amounts required to be deposited by the Servicer pursuant to
          Section 5.11 in connection with the deductible clause in any blanket
          hazard insurance policy, such deposit to be made from the Servicer's
          own funds without reimbursement therefor;

     (8)  any amounts required to be deposited by the Servicer pursuant to
          Section 5.16(ii) in connection with any losses on Permitted
          Investments;

     (9)  any amounts required to be deposited in the Collection Account

          reimbursement therefor.

     The foregoing requirements for deposit in the Collection Account shall be
exclusive, it being understood and agreed that, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, payments in the nature of late payment charges and assumption
fees, to the extent permitted by Section 7.01, need not be deposited by the
Servicer in the Collection Account and shall be retained by the Servicer as
additional compensation.

     The Servicer may, from time to time in accordance with the provisions
hereof, withdraw amounts from the Collection Account for the following purposes
(without duplication):

     (1)  to reimburse itself for unreimbursed Monthly Advances and Servicing

          interest with respect to which any such Monthly Advance was made, it
          being understood that, in the case of any such reimbursement, the
          Servicer's right thereto shall be prior to the rights of the
          Purchaser, except that, where a Seller or the Servicer is required to
          repurchase a Mortgage Loan pursuant to SECTIONS 2.04, 3.04 and/or 7.02
          the Servicer's right to such reimbursement shall be subsequent and
          subordinate to the payment to the Purchaser of the applicable
          Repurchase Price pursuant to such section and all other amounts
          required to be paid to the Purchaser with respect to such Mortgage
          Loan;

          otherwise relating to the Mortgage Loan, it being understood that, in

          prior to the rights of the Purchaser, except that, where a Seller or
          the Servicer is required to repurchase a Mortgage Loan pursuant to
          SECTIONS 2.04, 3.04 and/or 7.02, the Servicer's right to such
          reimbursement shall be subsequent and subordinate to the payment to
          the Purchaser of the applicable Repurchase Price and all other amounts
          required to be paid to the Purchaser with respect to such Mortgage
          Loan;

     (4)  to pay to itself, solely out of the interest portion of the Monthly
          Payment actually received with respect to a Mortgage Loan during the
          period ending on the most recent Determination Date, the Servicing Fee
          with respect to such Mortgage Loan;

     (5)  to pay to itself as additional servicing compensation (a) any interest
          earned on funds in the Collection Account (all such interest to be

          acceleration exists or would exist but for the lapse of time, the
          giving of notice, or both;

          amounts constitute part of the Repurchase Price to be remitted to the
          Purchaser);

     (7)  to remove any amounts deposited into the Collection Account in error;
          and

     The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received

maintain one or more Escrow Accounts, in the form of time deposit or demand
accounts. The creation of any Escrow Account shall be evidenced by a
certification in the form shown on EXHIBIT 5.06-1 attached hereto, in the case
of an account established with the Servicer, or a letter agreement in the form
shown on EXHIBIT 5.06-2 attached hereto, in the case of an account held by a
depository other than the Servicer, such depository having been consented to by
the Purchaser. In either case, a copy of such certification or letter agreement
shall be furnished to the Purchaser.

     The Servicer shall deposit in each Escrow Account on a daily basis, and
retain therein, (i) all Escrow Payments collected on account of the related
Mortgage Loans for the purpose of effecting timely payment of any such items as
required under the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) all Insurance Proceeds or
Condemnation Proceeds which are to be applied to the restoration or repair of
any Mortgaged Property. The Servicer shall make withdrawals therefrom only to
effect such payments as are required under SECTIONS 5.07 and/or 5.08. The
Servicer shall be entitled to retain any interest paid on funds deposited in the
Escrow Account by the depository institution other than interest on escrowed
funds required by law to be paid to the Mortgagor and, to the extent required by
law, the Servicer shall pay interest on escrowed funds to the Mortgagor
notwithstanding that the Escrow Account is non-interest bearing or that interest
paid thereon is insufficient for such purposes, without any right of
reimbursement therefor. The Servicer shall be responsible for ensuring that the
administrator of the Escrow Account complies with all applicable laws, and shall
indemnify and hold the Purchaser harmless with respect to the administration of
such Accounts.

     Section 5.07 PERMITTED WITHDRAWALS FROM ESCROW ACCOUNTS.

     Withdrawals from any Escrow Account may be made by the Servicer only (i) to
effect timely payments of ground rents, taxes, assessments, water rates, hazard
insurance premiums, Primary Insurance Policy premiums, if applicable, and
comparable items constituting Escrow Payments for the related Mortgage, (ii) to
reimburse the Servicer for any Servicing Advance made by the Servicer with
respect to a related Mortgage Loan but only from amounts received on the related
Mortgage Loan that represent late payments or collections of Escrow Payments
thereunder, (iii) to refund to the Mortgagor any funds as may be determined to
be overages, (iv) if permitted by applicable law, for transfer to the Collection
Account in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (v) for application to
restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property in


                                      -36-
<PAGE>

accordance with the terms of the related Mortgage Loan, (vi) to pay to the
Servicer, or to the Mortgagor to the extent required by law, any interest paid
on the funds deposited in the Escrow Account, (vii) to reimburse a Mortgagor in
connection with the making of the Payoff of the related Mortgage Loan or the
termination of all or part of the escrow requirement in connection with the
Mortgage Loan, (viii) to remove any amounts deposited into the Escrow Account in
error; or (ix) to clear and terminate the Escrow Account on the termination of
this Agreement.

     Section 5.08 PAYMENT OF TAXES, INSURANCE AND OTHER CHARGES; MAINTENANCE OF
PRIMARY INSURANCE POLICIES; COLLECTIONS THEREUNDER.

     With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall maintain accurate
records reflecting the status of ground rents, taxes, assessments, water rates
and other charges which are or may become a lien upon the Mortgaged Property and
the status of Primary Insurance Policy premiums and fire and hazard insurance
coverage and shall obtain, from time to time, all bills for the payment of such
charges, including renewal premiums, and shall effect payment thereof prior to
the applicable penalty or termination date and at a time appropriate for
securing maximum discounts allowable, employing for such purpose deposits of the
Mortgagor in the Escrow Account which shall have been estimated and accumulated
by the Servicer in amounts sufficient for such purposes, as allowed under the
terms of the Mortgage and applicable law. If a Mortgage does not provide for
Escrow Payments, then the Servicer shall require that any such payments be made
by the Mortgagor at the time they first become due. The Servicer assumes full
responsibility for the timely payment of all such bills and shall effect timely
payments of all such bills irrespective of the Mortgagor's faithful performance
in the payment of same or the making of the Escrow Payments and shall make
advances from its own funds to effect such payments but shall be entitled to
reimbursement thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     The Servicer shall maintain in full force and effect a Primary Insurance
Policy, conforming in all respects to the description set forth in SECTION
3.03(29), issued by an insurer described in that Section, with respect to each
Mortgage Loan for which such coverage is required. Such coverage will be
maintained until the Loan-to-Value Ratio of the related Mortgage Loan is reduced
to 75% or less in the case of a Mortgage Loan having a Loan-to-Value Ratio at
origination in excess of 80% or until such time, if any, as such insurance is
required to be released in accordance with the provisions of applicable law
including, but not limited to, the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998. The
Servicer shall assure that all premiums due under any Primary Insurance Policy
are paid in a timely manner, but, shall be entitled to reimbursement pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement for premiums paid by the Servicer on behalf of any
Mortgagor who is obligated to pay such premiums but fails to do so. The Servicer
shall not cancel or refuse to renew any Primary Insurance Policy in effect on
the Funding Date that is required to be kept in force under this Agreement
unless a replacement Primary Insurance Policy for such canceled or nonrenewed
policy is obtained from and maintained with an insurer that satisfies the
standards set forth in SECTION 3.03. The Servicer shall not take any action
which would result in noncoverage under any applicable Primary Insurance Policy
of any loss which, but for the actions of the Servicer, would have been covered
thereunder. In connection with any assumption or substitution agreement entered
into or to be entered into pursuant to SECTION 7.01, the Servicer shall promptly
notify the insurer under the related Primary Insurance Policy, if any, of such
assumption or substitution of liability in accordance with the terms of such
policy and


                                      -37-
<PAGE>

shall take all actions which may be required by such insurer as a condition to
the continuation of coverage under the Primary Insurance Policy. If such Primary
Insurance Policy is terminated as a result of such assumption or substitution of
liability, then the Servicer shall obtain, and, except as otherwise provided
above, maintain, a replacement Primary Insurance Policy as provided above.

     In connection with its activities as servicer, the Servicer agrees to
prepare and present, on behalf of itself and the Purchaser, claims to the
insurer under any Primary Insurance Policy in a timely fashion in accordance
with the terms of such policies and, in this regard, to take such action as
shall be necessary to permit recovery under any Primary Insurance Policy
respecting a defaulted Mortgage Loan. Pursuant to SECTION 5.04, any amounts
collected by the Servicer under any Primary Insurance Policy shall be deposited
in the Collection Account, subject to withdrawal in accordance with SECTION
5.05.

     Section 5.09 TRANSFER OF ACCOUNTS.

     The Servicer may transfer the Collection Account or any Escrow Account to a
different depository institution from time to time; PROVIDED that (i) no such
transfer shall be made unless all certifications or letter agreements required
under SECTION 5.04 have been executed and delivered by the parties thereto; and
(ii) concurrently upon any such transfer, the Servicer shall give written notice
thereof to the Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Collection Account and each Escrow Account shall at all times
constitute Eligible Accounts.

     To the extent that at any time the funds in either the Collection Account
or the Escrow Account should exceed the FDIC maximum insurance limit, (the
"EXCESS AMOUNT"), the Servicer shall put such Excess Amount into Permitted
Investments, which funds shall be brought back into the Collection Account or
Escrow Account, as the case may be, for distribution to the Purchaser on the
related Remittance Date.

     Section 5.10 MAINTENANCE OF HAZARD INSURANCE.

     The Servicer shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage Loan fire and
hazard insurance with extended coverage as is customary in the area where the
Mortgaged Property is located in an amount that is at least equal to the lesser
of (a) the maximum insurable value of the improvements securing such Mortgage
Loan and (b) the greater of (1) the Unpaid Principal Balance of such Mortgage
Loan or (2) an amount such that the proceeds thereof shall be sufficient to
prevent the Mortgagor and/or the loss payee from becoming a co-insurer.

     If any Mortgaged Property is in an area identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency as having special flood hazards and such flood insurance has
been made available, then the Servicer will cause to be maintained a flood
insurance policy meeting the requirements of the current guidelines of the
National Flood Insurance Program with a generally acceptable insurance carrier,
in an amount representing coverage not less than the lesser of (a) the
outstanding principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan or (b) the maximum
amount of insurance which is available under the Flood Disaster Protection Act
of 1973, as amended.


                                      -38-
<PAGE>

     The Servicer shall also maintain on each REO Property fire, hazard and
liability insurance, and to the extent required and available under the Flood
Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, flood insurance with extended
coverage in an amount which is at least equal to the lesser of (a) the maximum
insurable value of the improvements which are a part of such property and (b)
the Unpaid Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan at the time it became
an REO Property plus accrued interest at the Note Rate and related Servicing
Advances.

     All such policies shall be endorsed with standard mortgagee clauses with
loss payable to the Servicer, or upon request to the Purchaser, and shall
provide for at least 30 days prior written notice of any cancellation, reduction
in the amount of, or material change in, coverage to the Servicer. The Servicer
shall not interfere with the Mortgagor's freedom of choice in selecting either
his insurance carrier or agent, PROVIDED that the Servicer shall not accept any
such insurance policies from insurance companies unless such companies (a)
currently reflect (1) a general policyholder's rating of B+ or better and a
financial size category of III or better in Best's Key Rating Guide, or (2) a
general policyholder's rating of "A" or "A-" or better in Best's Key Rating
Guide, and (b) are licensed to do business in the state wherein the related
Mortgaged Property is located. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer may
accept a policy underwritten by Lloyd's of London or, if it is the only coverage
available, coverage under a state's Fair Access to Insurance Requirement (FAIR)
Plan. If a hazard policy becomes in danger of being terminated, or the insurer
ceases to have the ratings noted above, the Servicer shall notify the Purchaser
and the related Mortgagor, and shall use its best efforts, as permitted by
applicable law, to obtain from another qualified insurer a replacement hazard
insurance policy substantially and materially similar in all respects to the
original policy. In no event, however, shall a Mortgage Loan be without a hazard
insurance policy at any time, subject only to

     Pursuant to SECTION 5.04, any amounts collected by the Servicer under any
such policies other than amounts to be deposited in the Escrow Account and
applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property or REO Property,
or released to the Mortgagor in accordance with the Servicer's normal servicing
procedures, shall be deposited in the Collection Account within one Business Day
after receipt, subject to withdrawal in accordance with SECTION 5.05. Any cost
incurred by the Servicer in maintaining any such insurance shall not, for the
purpose of calculating remittances to the Purchaser, be added to the unpaid
principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan, notwithstanding that the terms
of such Mortgage Loan so permit.

     It is understood and agreed that no earthquake or other additional
insurance need be required by the Servicer of the Mortgagor or maintained on
property acquired in respect of the Mortgage Loan, other than pursuant to such
applicable laws and regulations as shall at any time be in force and as shall
require such additional insurance.

     Section 5.11 MAINTENANCE OF MORTGAGE IMPAIRMENT INSURANCE POLICY.

     If the Servicer obtains and maintains a blanket policy issued by an issuer
that has a Best's Key rating of A+:V insuring against hazard losses on all of
the Mortgage Loans, then, to the extent such policy provides coverage in an
amount equal to the amount required pursuant to SECTION 5.10 and otherwise
complies with all other requirements of SECTION 5.10, it shall conclusively be
deemed to have satisfied its obligations as set forth in SECTION 5.10, it being


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

understood and agreed that such policy may contain a deductible clause, in which
case the Servicer shall, if there shall not have been maintained on the related
Mortgaged Property or REO Property a policy complying with SECTION 5.10 and
there shall have been one or more losses which would have been covered by such
policy, deposit in the Collection Account the amount not otherwise payable under
the blanket policy because of such deductible clause; PROVIDED that the Servicer
shall not be entitled to obtain reimbursement therefor. In connection with its
activities as servicer of the Mortgage Loans, the Servicer agrees to prepare and
present, on behalf of the Purchaser, claims under any such blanket policy in a
timely fashion in accordance with the terms of such policy. Upon request of the
Purchaser, the Servicer shall cause to be delivered to the Purchaser a certified
true copy of such policy and a statement from the insurer thereunder that such
policy shall in no event be terminated or materially modified without 30 days'
prior written notice to the Purchaser.

     Section 5.12 FIDELITY BOND; ERRORS AND OMISSIONS INSURANCE.

     The Servicer shall maintain, at its own expense, a blanket fidelity bond
and an errors and omissions insurance policy, with broad coverage with
responsible companies that would meet the requirements of FNMA and FHLMC on all
officers, employees or other Persons acting in any capacity with regard to the
Mortgage Loan to handle funds, money, documents and papers relating to the
Mortgage Loans. The Fidelity Bond and errors and omissions insurance shall be in
the form of the "Mortgage Banker's Blanket Bond" and shall protect and insure
the Servicer against losses, including losses arising by virtue of any Mortgage
Loan not being satisfied in accordance with the procedures set forth in SECTION
7.02 and/or losses resulting from or arising in connection with forgery, theft,
embezzlement, fraud, errors and omissions and negligent acts of or by such
Persons. Such Fidelity Bond shall also protect and insure the Servicer against
losses in connection with the failure to maintain any insurance policies
required pursuant to this Agreement and the release or satisfaction of a
Mortgage Loan without having obtained payment in full of the indebtedness
secured thereby. No provision of this SECTION 5.12 requiring the Fidelity Bond
and errors and omissions insurance shall diminish or relieve the Servicer from
its duties and obligations as set forth in this Agreement. The minimum coverage
under any such bond and insurance policy shall be at least equal to the
corresponding amounts required by FNMA in the FNMA Guide and by FHLMC in the
FHLMC Servicing Guide. The Servicer shall cause to be delivered to the Purchaser
on or before the Funding Date: (i) a certified true copy of the Fidelity Bond
and insurance policy; (ii) a written statement from the surety and the insurer
that such Fidelity Bond or insurance policy shall in no event be terminated or
materially modified without 30 days prior written notice to the Purchaser; and
(iii) written evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser that such
Fidelity Bond or insurance policy provides that the Purchaser is a beneficiary
or loss payee thereunder.

     Section 5.13 MANAGEMENT OF REO PROPERTIES.

     (1) If title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired in foreclosure or by
deed in lieu of foreclosure (each, an "REO PROPERTY"), the deed or certificate
of sale shall be taken in the name of the Purchaser or the Person (which may be
the Servicer for the benefit of the Purchaser) designated by the Purchaser, or
in the event the Purchaser or such Person is not authorized or permitted to hold
title to real property in the state where the REO Property is located, or would


                                      -40-
<PAGE>

be adversely affected under the "doing business" or tax laws of such state by so
holding title, the deed or certificate of sale shall be taken in the name of
such Person or Persons as shall be consistent with an opinion of counsel
obtained by the Servicer from an attorney duly licensed to practice law in the
state where the REO Property is located. The Servicer (acting alone or through a
subservicer), on behalf of the Purchaser, shall, subject to SECTION 5.01(3)(c),
dispose of any REO Property pursuant to SECTION 5.14. Unless an appraisal
prepared by an MAI Appraiser who is Independent in accordance with the
provisions of 12 C.F.R. 225.65 shall have been obtained in connection with the
acquisition of such REO Property, promptly following any acquisition by the
Purchaser (through the Servicer) of an REO Property, the Servicer shall obtain a
narrative appraisal thereof (at the expense of the Purchaser) in order to
determine the fair market value of such REO Property. The Servicer shall
promptly notify the Purchaser of the results of such appraisal. The Servicer
shall also cause each REO Property to be inspected promptly upon the acquisition
of title thereto and shall cause each REO Property to be inspected at least
annually thereafter, and Servicer shall be entitled to be reimbursed for
expenses in connection therewith in accordance with this Agreement. The Servicer
shall make or cause to be made a written report of each such inspection. Such
reports shall be retained in the Servicer's Mortgage File and copies thereof
shall be forwarded by the Servicer to the Purchaser. The Servicer shall also
furnish to the Purchaser the applicable reports required under SECTION 8.01.

     (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if a REMIC
election has been or is to be made with respect to the arrangement under which
the Mortgage Loans and the REO Properties are held, then the Servicer shall
manage, conserve, protect and operate each REO Property in a manner that does
not cause such REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within
the meaning of Section 86OG(a)(8) of the Code or result in the receipt by such
REMIC of any "income from non-permitted assets" within the meaning of Section
86OF(a)(2)(B) or any "net income from foreclosure property" within the meaning
of Section 86OG(c)(2) of the Code (or comparable provisions of any successor or
similar legislation).

     (3) The Servicer shall deposit and hold all revenues and funds collected
and received in connection with the operation of each REO Property in the
Collection Account, and the Servicer shall account separately for revenues and
funds received or expended with respect to each REO Property.

     (4) The Servicer shall have full power and authority, subject only to the
specific requirements and prohibitions of this Agreement (and, in particular,
SECTION 5.01(3)(c)), to do any and all things in connection with any REO
Property as are consistent with the servicing standards set forth in SECTION
5.01. In connection therewith, the Servicer shall deposit or cause to be
deposited on a daily basis in the Collection Account all revenues and
collections received or collected by it with respect to each REO Property,
including all proceeds of any REO Disposition. Subject to SECTION 5.15(4), the
Servicer shall withdraw (without duplication) from the Collection Account, but
solely from the revenues and collections received or collected by it with
respect to a specific REO Property, such funds necessary for the proper
operation, management and maintenance of such REO Property, including the
following:

          (a) all insurance premiums due and payable in respect of such REO
     Property;


                                      -41-
<PAGE>

          (b) all real estate taxes and assessments in respect of such REO
     Property that may result in the imposition of a lien thereon;

          (c) all customary and reasonable costs and expenses necessary to
     maintain, repair, appraise, evaluate, manage or operate such REO Property
     (including the customary and reasonable costs incurred by any "managing
     agent" retained by the Servicer in connection with the maintenance,
     management or operation of such REO Property);

          (d) all reasonable costs and expenses of restoration improvements,
     deferred maintenance and tenant improvements; and

          (e) all other reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable
     attorneys' fees, that the Servicer may suffer or incur in connection with
     its performance of its obligations under this SECTION (other than costs and
     expenses that the Servicer is expressly obligated to bear pursuant to this
     Agreement).

To the extent that amounts on deposit in the Collection Account are insufficient
for the purposes set forth in clauses (a) through (e) above, the Servicer shall,
subject to SECTION 6.04, advance the amount of funds required to cover the
shortfall with respect thereto. The Servicer shall promptly notify the Purchaser
in writing of any failure by the Servicer to make a Servicing Advance of the
type specified in clauses (a) or (b) above (irrespective of whether such
Servicing Advance is claimed to be non-recoverable by the Servicer pursuant to
SECTION 6.04).

     (5) Following the consummation of an REO Disposition, the Servicer shall
remit to the Purchaser, in accordance with SECTION 6.01, any proceeds from such
REO Disposition in the Collection Account following the payment of all expenses
and Servicing Advances relating to the subject REO Property.

     Section 5.14 SALE OF SPECIALLY SERVICED MORTGAGE LOANS AND REO PROPERTIES.

     Subject to SECTION 5.01 (and, specifically, SECTION 5.01(3)(c)) and SECTION
5.15, the Servicer shall offer to sell any REO Property no later than the time
determined by the Servicer to be sufficient to result in the sale of such REO
Property on or prior to the purchase date specified in SECTION 5.15(iii). In
accordance with the servicing standards set forth in SECTION 5.01, the Servicer
shall solicit bids and offers from Persons for the purchase of any Specially
Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property and, upon receipt thereof, promptly (but
in any event within 3 Business Days) present such bids and offers to the
Purchaser. The Servicer shall not accept any bid or offer for any Specially
Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property except in compliance with SECTION
5.01(3)(c). The Purchaser may reject any bid or offer if the Purchaser
determines the rejection of such bid or offer would be in the best interests of
the Purchaser. If the Purchaser rejects any bid or offer, the Servicer shall, if
appropriate, seek an extension of the 2 year period referred to in SECTION 5.15.

     Subject to SECTION 5.01 (and, specifically, SECTION 5.01(3)(c)) and SECTION
5.15, the Servicer shall act on behalf of the Purchaser in negotiating and
taking any other action necessary or appropriate in connection with the sale of
any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO


                                      -42-
<PAGE>

Property, including the collection of all amounts payable in connection
therewith. The terms of sale of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO
Property shall be in the sole discretion of the Purchaser. Any sale of a
Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or any REO Disposition shall be without
recourse to, or representation or warranty by, the Purchaser or the Servicer,
and, if consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, then the
Servicer shall have no liability to the Purchaser with respect to the purchase
price therefor accepted by the Purchaser. The proceeds of any sale after
deduction of the expenses of such sale incurred in connection therewith shall be
promptly deposited in (a) if such sale is an REO Disposition, in the Collection
Account in accordance with SECTION 5.13 and (b) in any other circumstance, the
Collection Account in accordance with SECTION 5.04.

     Section 5.15 REALIZATION UPON SPECIALLY SERVICED MORTGAGE LOANS AND REO
PROPERTIES.

     (1) Subject to SECTION 5.01(3)(c), the Servicer shall foreclose upon or
otherwise comparably convert the ownership of properties securing such of the
Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans as come into and continue in default and as to
which (a) in the reasonable judgment of the Servicer, no satisfactory
arrangements can, in accordance with prudent lending practices, be made for
collection of delinquent payments pursuant to SECTION 5.01 and (b) such
foreclosure or other conversion is otherwise in accordance with SECTION 5.01.
The Servicer shall not be required to expend its own funds in connection with
any foreclosure or towards the restoration, repair, protection or maintenance of
any property unless it shall determine that such expenses will be recoverable to
it as Servicing Advances either through Liquidation Proceeds or through
Insurance Proceeds (in accordance with SECTION 5.05) or from any other source
relating to the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan. The Servicer shall be required
to advance funds for all other costs and expenses incurred by it in any such
foreclosure proceedings; PROVIDED that it shall be entitled to reimbursement
thereof from the proceeds of liquidation of the related Mortgaged Property, as
contemplated by Section 5.05.

     (2) Upon any Mortgaged Property becoming an REO Property, the Servicer
shall promptly notify the Purchaser thereof, specifying the date on which such
Mortgaged Property became an REO Property. Pursuant to its efforts to sell such
REO Property, the Servicer shall, either itself or through an agent selected by
it, protect and conserve such REO Property in accordance with the servicing
standards set forth in SECTION 5.01 and may, subject to SECTION 5.01(3)(c) and
incident to its conservation and protection of the interests of the Purchaser,
rent the same, or any part thereof, for the period to the sale of such REO
Property.

     (3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Purchaser shall not, and the Servicer shall not on the Purchaser's behalf,
acquire any real property (or personal property incident to such real property)
except in connection with a default or a default that is imminent on a Mortgage
Loan. If the Purchaser acquires any real property (or personal property incident
to such real property) in connection with such a default, then such property
shall be disposed of by the Servicer in accordance with this SECTION and SECTION
5.14 as soon as possible but in no event later than 2 years after its
acquisition by the Servicer on behalf of the Purchaser, unless the Servicer
obtains, at the expense of the Purchaser, in a timely fashion an extension from
the Internal Revenue Service for an additional specified period.


                                      -43-
<PAGE>

     (4) Any recommendation of the Servicer to foreclose on a defaulted Mortgage
Loan shall be subject to a determination by the Servicer that the proceeds of
such foreclosure would exceed the costs and expenses of bringing such a
proceeding. The income earned from the management of any REO Property, net of
reimbursement to the Servicer for Servicing Advances and fees for work-out
compensation in accordance with the FHLMC Servicing Guide, incurred with respect
to such REO Property under Section 5.13, shall be applied to the payment of the
costs and expenses set forth in SECTION 5.13(4), with any remaining amounts to
be promptly deposited in the Collection Account in accordance with SECTION 5.13.

     (5) If, in the exercise of its servicing obligations with respect to any
Mortgaged Property hereunder, the Servicer deems it is necessary or advisable to
obtain an Environmental Assessment, then the Servicer shall so obtain an
Environmental Assessment, it being understood that all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by the Servicer in connection with any such Environmental
Assessment (including the cost thereof) shall be deemed to be Servicing Advances
recoverable by the Servicer pursuant to SECTION 5.13(4). Such Environmental
Assessment shall (a) assess whether (1) such Mortgaged Property is in material
violation of applicable Environmental Laws or (2) after consultation with an
environmental expert, taking the actions necessary to comply with applicable
Environmental Laws is reasonably likely to produce a greater recovery on a net
present value basis than not taking such actions, and (b) identify whether (1)
any circumstances are present at such Mortgaged Property relating to the use,
management or disposal of any hazardous materials for which investigation,
testing, monitoring, containment, clean-up or remediation could be required
under any federal, state or local law or regulation, or (2) if such
circumstances exist, after consultation with an environmental expert, taking
such actions is reasonably likely to produce a greater recovery on a present
value basis than not taking such actions. (The conditions described in the
immediately preceding clauses (a) and (b) shall be referred to herein as
"ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO FORECLOSURE.") If any such Environmental
Assessment so warrants, the Servicer is hereby authorized to and shall perform
such additional environmental testing as it deems necessary and prudent to
establish the satisfaction of the foregoing Environmental Conditions Precedent
to Foreclosure or to proceed in accordance with SUBSECTION (vi) or (vii), as the
case may be, below (such additional testing thereafter being included in the
term "ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT").

     (6) If an Environmental Assessment deemed necessary or advisable by the
Servicer in accordance with SUBSECTION 5 of this SECTION 5.15 establishes that
any of the Environmental Conditions Precedent to Foreclosure is not satisfied
with respect to any Mortgaged Property, but the Servicer in good faith
reasonably believes that it is in the best economic interest of the Purchaser to
proceed against such Mortgaged Property and, if title thereto is acquired, to
take such remedial, corrective or other action with respect to the unsatisfied
condition or conditions as may be prescribed by applicable law to satisfy such
condition or conditions, then the Servicer shall so notify the Purchaser. If,
pursuant to SECTION 5.01(3)(c), the Purchaser has notified the Servicer in
writing to proceed against such Mortgaged Property, then the Servicer shall so
proceed. The cost of any remedial, corrective or other action contemplated by
the preceding sentence in respect of any of the Environmental Conditions
Precedent to Foreclosure that is not satisfied shall not be an expense of the
Servicer and the Servicer shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds
or otherwise incur any financial liability in connection with any such action.


                                      -44-
<PAGE>

     (7) If an Environmental Assessment deemed necessary or advisable by the
Servicer in accordance with SUBSECTION 5 of this SECTION 5.15 establishes that
any of the Environmental Conditions Precedent to Foreclosure is not satisfied
with respect to any Mortgaged Property and, in accordance with SECTION
5.01(3)(c), the Purchaser elects or is deemed to have elected not to proceed
against such Mortgaged Property, then the Servicer shall, subject to SECTION
5.01(3)(c), take such action as it deems to be in the best economic interest of
the Purchaser (other than proceeding against the Mortgaged Property or directly
or indirectly becoming the owner or operator thereof) as determined in
accordance with the servicing standard set forth in SECTION 5.01 and is hereby
authorized at such time as it deems appropriate to release such Mortgaged
Property from the lien of the related Mortgage.

     (8) Prior to the Servicer taking any action with respect to the use,
management or disposal of any hazardous materials on any Mortgaged Property, the
Servicer shall request the approval of the Purchaser in accordance with SECTION
5.01(3)(c) and, if such action is approved by the Purchaser, (a) keep the
Purchaser apprised of the progress of such action; and (b) take such action in
compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws.

     Section 5.16 INVESTMENT OF FUNDS IN THE COLLECTION ACCOUNT.

     The Servicer may direct any depository institution which holds a Collection
Account to invest the funds in the Collection Account in one or more Permitted
Investments bearing interest. All such Permitted Investments shall be held to
maturity, unless payable on demand. In the event amounts on deposit in the
Collection Account are at any time invested in a Permitted Investment payable on
demand, the Servicer shall:

          (a) consistent with any notice required to be given thereunder, demand
     that payment thereon be made on the last day such Permitted Investment may
     otherwise mature hereunder in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) all
     amounts then payable thereunder and (2) the amount required to be withdrawn
     on such date; and

          (b) demand payment of all amounts due thereunder promptly upon
     determination by the Servicer or notice from the Purchaser that such
     Permitted Investment would not constitute a Permitted Investment in respect
     of funds thereafter on deposit in the Collection Account.

All income and gain realized from investment of funds deposited in the
Collection Account shall be for the benefit of the Servicer and shall be subject
to its withdrawal in accordance with SECTION 5.05. The Servicer shall deposit in
the Collection Account the amount of any loss incurred in respect of any
Permitted Investment immediately upon realization of such loss.

     Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, if any default
occurs in the making of a payment due under any Permitted Investment, or if a
default occurs in any other performance required under any Permitted Investment,
the Purchaser may elect to take such action, or instruct the Servicer to take
such action, as may be appropriate to enforce such payment or performance,
including the institution and prosecution of appropriate proceedings, at the
expense of the Servicer.


                                      -45-
<PAGE>

     Section 5.17 MERS.

     In the case of each MERS Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall, as soon as
practicable after the Purchaser's request (but in no event more than 30 days
thereafter with respect to each Mortgage Loan that was a MERS Mortgage Loan as
of the Funding Date, or 90 days thereafter with respect to each Mortgage Loan
that was a MERS Eligible Mortgage Loan as of the Funding Date and subsequent to
the Funding Date becomes a MERS Mortgage Loan), the Servicer shall take such
actions as are necessary to cause the Purchaser to be clearly identified as the
owner of each MERS Mortgage Loan on the records of MERS for purposes of the
system of recording transfers of beneficial ownership of mortgages maintained by
MERS. Each of the Purchaser and the Servicer shall maintain in good standing its
membership in MERS. In addition, Each of the Purchaser and the Servicer shall
comply with all rules, policies and procedures of MERS, including the Rules of
Membership, as amended, and the MERS Procedures Manual, as amended. With respect
to all MERS Mortgage Loans serviced hereunder, the Servicer shall promptly
notify MERS as to any transfer of beneficial ownership or release of any
security interest in such Mortgage Loans. The Servicer shall cooperate with the
Purchaser and any successor owner or successor servicer to the extent necessary
to ensure that any transfer of ownership or servicing is appropriately reflected
on the MERS system.

     Section 5.18 NOTIFICATION OF ADJUSTMENTS.

     With respect to each Mortgage Loan that is an ARM Loan, the Servicer shall
adjust the Note Rate on the related Rate Adjustment Date in compliance with the
requirements of applicable law and the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note. The
Servicer shall execute and deliver any and all necessary notices required under
applicable law and the terms of the related Mortgage Note and Mortgage regarding
the Note Rate adjustments. The Servicer shall promptly, upon written request
therefor, deliver to the Purchaser such notifications and any additional
applicable data regarding such adjustments and the methods used to calculate and
implement such adjustments. Upon the discovery by the Servicer or the receipt of
notice from the Purchaser that the Servicer has failed to adjust a Note Rate in
accordance with the terms of the related Mortgage Note, the Servicer shall
immediately deposit in the Custodial Account from its own funds the amount of
any interest loss or deferral caused the Purchaser thereby.

                   ARTICLE VI: REPORTS; REMITTANCES; ADVANCES

     Section 6.01 REMITTANCES

     (1) On each Remittance Date, the Servicer shall remit to the Purchaser (a)
all amounts credited to the Collection Account as of the close of business on
the preceding Determination Date (including (i) the amount of any Payoff,
together with interest thereon at the related Remittance Rate to the end of the
month in which prepayment of the related Mortgage Loan occurs and (ii) all
proceeds of any REO Disposition net of amounts payable to the Servicer pursuant
to SECTION 5.13), net of charges against or withdrawals from the Collection
Account in accordance with SECTION 5.05, which charges against or withdrawals
from the Collection Account the Servicer shall make solely on such Remittance
Date, plus (b) all Monthly Advances, if any, which the Servicer is obligated to
remit pursuant to SECTION 6.03; PROVIDED that the Servicer shall


                                      -46-
<PAGE>

not be required to remit, until the next following Remittance Date, any amounts
attributable to Monthly Payments collected but due on a Due Date or Dates
subsequent to the preceding Determination Date.

     (2) All remittances made to the Purchaser on each Remittance Date will be
made to the Purchaser or Purchaser's designee by wire transfer of immediately
available funds accordingly to the instructions that will be provided by
Purchaser to the Servicer.

     (3) With respect to any remittance received by the Purchaser after the
Business Day on which such payment was due, the Servicer shall pay to the
Purchaser interest on any such late payment at an annual rate equal to the rate
of interest as is publicly announced from time to time by Citibank, N.A., New
York, New York, as its prime lending rate, adjusted as of the date of each
change, plus two percentage points, but in no event greater than the maximum
amount permitted by applicable law. Such interest shall be paid by the Servicer
to the Purchaser on the date such late payment is made and shall cover the
period commencing with the Business Day on which such payment was due and ending
with the Business Day on which such payment is made, both inclusive. Such
interest shall be remitted along with such late payment. Neither the payment by
the Servicer nor the acceptance by the Purchaser of any such interest shall be
deemed an extension of time for payment or a waiver by the Purchaser of any
Event of Default.

     Section 6.02 REPORTING.

     On or before the 5th calendar day (or, if such day is not a Business Day,
on the immediately succeeding Business Day) of each month during the term
hereof, the Servicer shall deliver to the Purchaser monthly accounting reports
in the form of EXHIBITS 6.02(A) through 6.02(G) attached hereto with respect to
the most recently ended Monthly Period. Such monthly accounting reports shall
include information as to the aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance of all Mortgage
Loans, the scheduled amortization of all Mortgage Loans, any delinquencies and
the amount of any Principal Prepayments as of the most recently ended Record
Date. The Purchaser may assess penalty fees in accordance with FNMA guidelines
for late or incorrect reporting.

     The Servicer shall provide the Purchaser with such information concerning
the Mortgage Loans as is necessary for the Purchaser to prepare its federal
income tax return as the Purchaser may reasonably request from time to time.

     Section 6.03 MONTHLY ADVANCES BY THE SERVICER.

     (1) Not later than the close of business on the Business Day immediately
preceding each Remittance Date, the Servicer shall deposit in the Collection
Account an amount equal to all Monthly Payments not previously advanced by the
Servicer (with interest adjusted to the Remittance Rate) that were due on a
Mortgage Loan and delinquent at the close of business on the related
Determination Date. The Servicer may reduce the total amount to be deposited in
the Collection Account as required by the foregoing sentence by the amount of
funds in the Collection Account which represent Prepaid Monthly Payments.


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

     (2) The Servicer's obligations to make Monthly Advances as to any Mortgage
Loan will continue through the last Monthly Payment due prior to the payment in
full of the Mortgage Loan, or through the Remittance Date prior to the
Remittance Date for the remittance of all Liquidation Proceeds and other
payments or recoveries (including Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds)
with respect to the Mortgage Loan; PROVIDED that such obligation shall cease if
the Servicer furnishes to the Purchaser an Officers' Certificate evidencing the
determination by the Servicer in accordance with SECTION 6.04 that advances with
respect to such Mortgage Loan are non-recoverable.

     Section 6.04 NON-RECOVERABLE ADVANCES.

     The determination by the Servicer that any Monthly Advance or Servicing
Advance, if made, would constitute a non-recoverable advance shall be evidenced
by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Purchaser detailing the reasons for
such determination, with copies of a relevant appraisal by an MAI Appraiser who
is Independent and, if such reports are to be used to determine that any Monthly
Advance or Servicing Advance would be a non-recoverable advance, all engineers'
reports, environmental reports or other information relevant thereto that
support such determination. Such Officers' Certificate shall set forth the
Servicer's considerations in reaching its conclusion that such advance is
non-recoverable, and such conclusion shall be based upon, in addition to the
above-described appraisal and reports, income and expense statements, rent
rolls, occupancy, property inspections, servicer inquiries and other information
of similar nature that support the Servicer's conclusion that such advance is
non-recoverable. The Purchaser shall have a period of 45 days following the
later of (i) the receipt by the Purchaser of such Officers' Certificate and all
documentation supplied by the Servicer relating thereto and (ii) the receipt by
the Purchaser of such other related documentation or information as shall have
been reasonably requested by the Purchaser within 30 days following the delivery
of such Officers' Certificate, to approve, by the exercise by the Purchaser of
its reasonable credit judgment, the subject Monthly Advance or Servicing Advance
as a non-recoverable advance. Only if the Purchaser has so approved any Monthly
Advance or Servicing Advance as non-recoverable shall the Servicer be entitled
to reimbursement for such non-recoverable advance (solely to the extent made) as
provided in SECTION 5.05 or SECTION 5.13, as applicable. The Servicer shall also
deliver to the Purchaser from time to time upon request copies of any appraisals
and other reports or information of the type described in this SECTION 6.04 that
it possesses relative to any Mortgaged Property.

     Section 6.05 ITEMIZATION OF SERVICING ADVANCES.

     The Servicer shall provide the Purchaser with an itemization of all
Servicing Advances incurred or made by the Servicer hereunder not less than
quarterly and at such other times as the Purchaser may from time to time
reasonably request.

                    ARTICLE VII: GENERAL SERVICING PROCEDURE

     Section 7.01 ENFORCEMENT OF DUE-ON-SALE CLAUSES, ASSUMPTION AGREEMENTS.


                                      -48-
<PAGE>

     (1) The Servicer will, to the extent it has knowledge of any conveyance or
prospective conveyance by any Mortgagor of the Mortgaged Property (whether by
absolute conveyance or by contract of sale, and whether or not the Mortgagor
remains or is to remain liable under the Mortgage Note and/or the Mortgage),
exercise its rights to accelerate the maturity of such Mortgage Loan under any
"due-on-sale" clause applicable thereto; PROVIDED that the Servicer shall not
exercise any such rights if prohibited by law from doing so or if the exercise
of such rights would impair or threaten to impair any recovery under the related
Primary Insurance Policy, if any.

     (2) If the Servicer is prohibited from enforcing such "due-on-sale" clause,
then the Servicer will enter into an assumption agreement with the Person to
whom the Mortgaged Property has been conveyed or is proposed to be conveyed,
pursuant to which such Person becomes liable under the Mortgage Note and, to the
extent permitted by applicable state law, the Mortgagor remains liable thereon.
(For purposes of this SECTION 7.01, the term "assumption" is deemed to also
include a sale of the Mortgaged Property subject to the Mortgage that is not
accompanied by an assumption or substitution of liability agreement.) If any
Mortgage Loan is to be assumed, then the Servicer shall inquire into the
creditworthiness of the proposed transferee and shall use the same underwriting
criteria for approving the credit of the proposed transferee that are used with
respect to underwriting mortgage loans of the same type as the Mortgage Loans.
Where an assumption is allowed, the Servicer, with the prior written consent of
the primary mortgage insurer, if any, and subject to the conditions of SECTION
7.01(3), shall, and is hereby authorized to, enter into a substitution of
liability agreement with the Person to whom the Mortgaged Property is proposed
to be conveyed pursuant to which the original mortgagor is released from
liability and such Person is substituted as mortgagor and becomes liable under
the related Mortgage Note. Any such substitution of liability agreement shall be
in lieu of an assumption agreement. In no event shall the Note Rate, the amount
of the Monthly Payment or the final maturity date be changed. The Servicer shall
notify the Purchaser that any such substitution of liability or assumption
agreement has been completed by forwarding to the Purchaser the original of any
such substitution of liability or assumption agreement, which document shall be
added to the related Purchaser's Mortgage File and shall, for all purposes, be
considered a part of such Purchaser's Mortgage File to the same extent as all
other documents and instruments constituting a part thereof. Any fee collected
by the Servicer for entering into an assumption or substitution of liability
agreement shall be retained by the Servicer as additional compensation for
servicing the Mortgage Loans.

     (3) If the credit of the proposed transferee does not meet such
underwriting criteria, then the Servicer shall, to the extent permitted by the
Mortgage or the Mortgage Note and by applicable law, accelerate the maturity of
the Mortgage Loan.

     Section 7.02 SATISFACTION OF MORTGAGES AND RELEASE OF MORTGAGE FILES.

     Upon the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, the Servicer will
immediately notify the Purchaser by a certification of a Servicing Officer,
which certification shall include a statement to the effect that all amounts
received or to be received in connection with such payment which are required to
be deposited in the Collection Account pursuant to SECTION 5.04 have been or
will be so deposited and shall request delivery to it of the Purchaser's
Mortgage File held by the


                                      -49-
<PAGE>

Purchaser or its designee. Upon receipt of such certification and request, the
Purchaser shall promptly release the related mortgage documents to the Servicer
and the Servicer shall promptly prepare and process any satisfaction or release.
No expense incurred in connection with any instrument of satisfaction or deed of
reconveyance shall be chargeable to the Collection Account.

     If the Servicer satisfies or releases a Mortgage without having obtained
payment in full of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage, or should it
otherwise take such action which results in a reduction of the coverage under
the Primary Insurance Policy, if any, then the Servicer shall promptly give
written notice thereof to the Purchaser, and, within 10 Business Days following
written demand therefor from the Purchaser to the Servicer, the Servicer shall
repurchase the related Mortgage Loan by paying to the Purchaser the Repurchase
Price therefor by wire transfer of immediately available funds directly to the
Purchaser's Account.

     From time to time and as appropriate for the servicing or foreclosure of
the Mortgage Loan, including for this purpose collection under any Primary
Insurance Policy, the Purchaser or Purchaser's designee shall, upon request of
the Servicer and delivery to the Purchaser of a servicing receipt signed by a
Servicing Officer, release the Purchaser's Mortgage File held by the Purchaser
to the Servicer. Such servicing receipt shall obligate the Servicer to return
the related Mortgage documents to the Purchaser when the need therefor by the
Servicer no longer exists, unless the Mortgage Loan has been liquidated and the
Liquidation Proceeds relating to the Mortgage Loan have been deposited in the
Collection Account or the Purchaser's Mortgage File or such document has been
delivered to an attorney, or to a public trustee or other public official as
required by law, for purposes of initiating or pursuing legal action or other
proceedings for the foreclosure of the Mortgaged Property either judicially or
nonjudicially, and the Servicer has delivered to the Purchaser a certificate of
a Servicing Officer certifying as to the name and address of the Person to which
such Purchaser's Mortgage File or such document was delivered and the purpose or
purposes of such delivery. Upon receipt of a certificate of a Servicing Officer
stating that such Mortgage Loan was liquidated and the Liquidation Proceeds were
deposited in the Collection Account, the servicing receipt shall be released by
the Purchaser to the Servicer.

     Section 7.03 SERVICING COMPENSATION.

     As compensation for its services hereunder, the Servicer shall be entitled
to retain from interest payments actually collected on the Mortgage Loans the
amounts provided for as the Servicing Fee. The Servicing Fee in respect of a
Mortgage Loan for a particular month shall become payable only upon the receipt
by the Servicer from the Mortgagor of the full Monthly Payment in respect of
such Mortgage Loan. Additional servicing compensation in the form of assumption
fees, as provided in SECTION 7.01, late payment charges and other servicer
compensation for modifications, short sales, and other services not to exceed
those fees described in the FHLMC Servicing Guide shall be retained by the
Servicer to the extent not required to be deposited in the Collection Account.
The Servicer shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection
with its servicing activities hereunder and shall not be entitled to
reimbursement therefor except as specifically provided for herein.

     Section 7.04 ANNUAL STATEMENT AS TO COMPLIANCE.


                                      -50-
<PAGE>

     The Servicer will deliver to the Purchaser on or before March 31 of each
year, beginning with March 31, 2002, an Officers' Certificate stating that (i) a
review of the activities of the Servicer during the preceding calendar year and
of performance under this Agreement has been made under such officers'
supervision, (ii) the Servicer has fully complied with the provisions of this
Agreement and (iii) to the best of such officers' knowledge, based on such
review, the Servicer has fulfilled all of its obligations under this Agreement
throughout such year, or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any
such obligation, specifying each such default known to such officers and the
nature and status thereof.

     Section 7.05 ANNUAL INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS' SERVICING
REPORT.

     On or before March 31 of each year beginning March 31, 2002, the Servicer
at its expense shall cause a firm of independent public accountants which is a
member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to furnish a
statement to the Purchaser to the effect that such firm has examined certain
documents and records relating to the servicing of the mortgage loans generally
that include a sampling of the Mortgage Loans, the provisions of ARTICLE VI have
been complied with and, on the basis of such an examination conducted
substantially in accordance with the Uniform Single Attestation Program for
Mortgage Bankers, such servicing has been conducted in compliance with this
Agreement, except for (i) such exceptions as such firm shall believe to be
immaterial, and (ii) such other exceptions as shall be set forth in such
statement.

     Section 7.06 PURCHASER'S RIGHT TO EXAMINE SERVICER RECORDS.

     The Purchaser shall have the right to examine and audit, during business
hours or at such other times as are reasonable under applicable circumstances,
upon five days advance notice any and all of (i) the credit and other loan files
relating to the Mortgage Loans or the Mortgagors, (ii) any and all books,
records, documentation or other information of the Servicer (whether held by the
Servicer or by another) relating to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans and
(iii) any and all books, records, documentation or other information of the
Servicer (whether held by the Servicer or by another) that are relevant to the
performance or observance by the Servicer of the terms, covenants or conditions
of this Agreement. The Servicer shall be obligated to make the foregoing
information available to the Purchaser at the site where such information is
stored; PROVIDED that the Purchaser shall be required to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by the Servicer in making such information
available.

              ARTICLE VIII: REPORTS TO BE PREPARED BY THE SERVICER

     Section 8.01 THE SERVICER'S REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

     (1) ELECTRONIC FORMAT. If requested by the Purchaser or its designee, the
Servicer shall supply any and all information regarding the Mortgage Loans and
the REO Properties, including all reports required to be delivered pursuant to
this SECTION 5.03, SECTION 6.02 and SECTION 8.01, to the Purchaser in electronic
format reasonably acceptable to Purchaser.

operating income (including rental income) and operating expenses pertaining to
each REO Property for the previous month, together with rent rolls, operating

     (3) ADDITIONAL REPORTS; FURTHER ASSURANCES. On or before the 3rd Business

of this Agreement such periodic, special or other reports, information or
documentation, whether or not provided for herein, as shall be reasonably
requested by the Purchaser with respect to Mortgage Loans or REO Properties
(provided the Purchaser shall have given the Servicer reasonable notice and
opportunity to prepare such reports, information or documentation), including
any reports, information or documentation reasonably required to comply with any
regulations of any governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the
Purchaser, all such reports or information to be as provided by and in
accordance with such applicable instructions and directions as the Purchaser may
reasonably request. If any of such reports are not customarily prepared by the
Servicer or require that the Servicer program data processing systems to create
the reports, then the Purchaser shall pay to the Servicer a fee mutually agreed
to by the Purchaser and the Servicer taking into account the Servicer's actual
time and cost in preparing such reports. The Servicer agrees to execute and
deliver all such instruments and take all such action as the Purchaser, from
time to time, may reasonably request in order to effectuate the purposes and to
carry out the terms of this Agreement.

     Section 8.02 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

     The Servicer understands that, in connection with marketing the Mortgage
Loans, the Purchaser may make available to any prospective purchaser of the
Mortgage Loans the Servicer's audited financial statements for its fiscal year
1999 and its audited financial statements for fiscal year 2000, together with
any additional statements provided pursuant to the next sentence. During the
term hereof, the Servicer will deliver to the Purchaser audited financial

statements are available upon request to the public at large.

     The Servicer also agrees to make available upon reasonable notice and

a knowledgeable financial or accounting officer for the purpose of answering
questions respecting recent developments affecting the Servicer or the financial
statements of the Servicer which may affect, in any material respect, the

                                      -52-
<PAGE>

permit any prospective purchasers upon reasonable notice and during normal

service the Mortgage Loans in accordance with this Agreement.

                            ARTICLE IX: THE SELLERS

     Section 9.01 INDEMNIFICATION; THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

     The Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser, its directors, officers, agents, employees, and assignees (each, an
"INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against any costs, damages, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, irrespective of whether or not incurred in
connection with the defense of any actual or threatened action, proceeding, or
claim), fines, forfeitures, injuries, liabilities or losses ("LOSSES") suffered
or sustained in any way by any such Person, no matter how or when arising
(including Losses incurred or sustained in connection with any judgment, award,
or settlement), in connection with or relating to (i) a breach by a Seller of
any of its representations and warranties contained in ARTICLE III or (ii) a
breach by a Seller of any of its covenants and other obligations contained
herein, provided that in either case Cendant Mortgage shall not be required to
indemnify any Indemnified Party for Losses in connection with or relating to a
breach by the Trust of the representations contained in SECTIONS 3.03(3) or
3.03(15) hereof. The Servicer shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified
Party from and against any Losses suffered or sustained in any way by any such
Person, no matter how or when arising (including Losses incurred or sustained in
connection with any judgment, award, or settlement), in connection with or
relating to (i) a breach by the Servicer of any of its representations and
warranties contained in ARTICLE III or (ii) a breach by the Servicer of any of
its covenants and other obligations contained herein including any failure to
service the Mortgage Loans in compliance with the terms hereof.

     The Sellers or the Servicer shall immediately (i) notify the Purchaser if a
claim is made by a third party with respect to this Agreement, any Mortgage Loan
and/or any REO Property (ii) assume the defense of any such claim and pay all
expenses in connection therewith, including attorneys' fees, and (iii) promptly
pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment, award, or decree that may be entered
against it or the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim. Nothing contained
herein shall prohibit the Indemnified Party, at its expense, from retaining its
own counsel to assist in any such proceedings or to observe such proceedings;
PROVIDED that neither Seller shall be obligated to pay or comply with any
settlement to which it has not consented. All amounts required to be paid or
reimbursed by a Seller hereunder shall be paid or reimbursed as and when
incurred by the Indemnified Party upon demand therefor by such Indemnified
Party.

     Section 9.02 MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION OF THE SELLER.

     Each Seller will keep in full effect its existence, rights and franchises
as a corporation or a Delaware business trust, as applicable, under the laws of
the state of its organization and will obtain and preserve its qualification to
do business as a foreign entity in each jurisdiction in


                                      -53-
<PAGE>

which such qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the validity and
enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Mortgage Loans and to perform its
duties under this Agreement.

     Any Person into which a Seller may be merged or consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation (including by
means of the sale of all or substantially all of such Seller's assets to such
Person) to which the Seller shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the
business of the Seller, shall be the successor of the Seller hereunder, without
the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of
the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding; PROVIDED
that, unless otherwise consented to by the Purchaser, the successor or surviving
Person, in the case of a merger or consolidation, etc. of the Servicer, shall be
an institution qualified to service mortgage loans on behalf of FNMA and FHLMC
in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.02(1), shall not cause a rating
on any security backed by a Mortgage Loan to be downgraded and shall satisfy the
requirements of Section 12.01 with respect to the qualifications of a successor
to such Seller.

     Section 9.03 LIMITATION ON LIABILITY OF THE SELLERS AND OTHERS.

     Neither the Sellers nor any of the officers, employees or agents of the
Sellers shall be under any liability to the Purchaser for any action taken or
for refraining from the taking of any action in good faith pursuant to this
Agreement or pursuant to the express written instructions of the Purchaser, or
for errors in judgment made in good faith; PROVIDED that this provision shall
not protect the Sellers or any such Person against any breach of warranties or
representations made herein, or failure to perform its obligations in compliance
with any standard of care set forth in this Agreement, or any liability which
would otherwise be imposed by reasons of willful misfeasance, bad faith,
negligence or any breach in the performance of the obligations and duties
hereunder. The Sellers and any officer, employee or agent of the Sellers may
rely in good faith on any document of any kind reasonably believed by the
Sellers or such Person to be genuine and prima facie properly executed and
submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising hereunder.

     The Sellers shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or
defend any legal action that is not incidental to their duties hereunder and
which in their opinion may involve them in any expense or liability; PROVIDED
that the Sellers may in their discretion undertake any such action that it may
deem necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement and the rights and
duties of the parties hereto. In such event, the legal expenses and costs of
such action and any liability resulting therefrom shall be expenses, costs and
liabilities for which the Sellers shall be entitled to be reimbursed therefor
out of the Collection Account. This indemnity shall survive the termination of
this Agreement.

     Section 9.04 SERVICER NOT TO RESIGN.

     With respect to the retention by Cendant Mortgage of the servicing of the
Mortgage Loans and the REO Properties hereunder, Cendant Mortgage acknowledges
that the Purchaser has acted in reliance upon Cendant Mortgage's Independent
status, the adequacy of its servicing facilities, plant, personnel, records and
procedures, its integrity, reputation and financial standing and the continuance
thereof. Consequently, Cendant Mortgage shall not assign the servicing


                                      -54-
<PAGE>

rights retained by it hereunder to any third party nor resign from the
obligations and duties hereby imposed on it except (i) with the written approval
of the Purchaser, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, or (ii) 30
Business Days following any determination that its duties hereunder are no
longer permissible under applicable law and such incapacity cannot be cured by
Cendant Mortgage. Any determination permitting the transfer of the servicing
rights or the resignation of Cendant Mortgage under SUBSECTION (ii) hereof shall
be evidenced by an opinion of counsel to such effect delivered to the Purchaser,
which opinion of counsel shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Purchaser.

                               ARTICLE X: DEFAULT

     Section 10.01 EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

     In case one or more of the following events shall occur and be continuing:

     (1) any failure by the Servicer to remit to the Purchaser any payment
required to be made under the terms of this Agreement which continues unremedied
for a period of 3 Business Days unless such failure to remit is due to a cause
beyond the Servicer's control, including an act of God, act of civil, military
or governmental authority, fire, epidemic, flood, blizzard, earthquake, riot,
war, or sabotage, PROVIDED that the Servicer gives the Purchaser notice of such
cause promptly and uses commercially reasonable efforts to correct such failure
to remit and does so remit within 2 Business Days following the end of the
duration of the cause of such failure to remit; or

     (2) any failure on the part of a Seller/Servicer duly to observe or perform
in any material respect any of the covenants or agreements on the part of such
Seller/Servicer set forth in this Agreement which continues unremedied for a

requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the applicable
Seller/Servicer by the Purchaser; PROVIDED that such 45-day period shall not
begin with respect to any failure to cure or repurchase in accordance with
SECTIONS 2.04 and/or 3.04 until the expiration of the cure periods provided for
in SECTIONS 2.04 and/or 3.04, as applicable;

     (3) any filing of an Insolvency Proceeding by or on behalf of a
Seller/Servicer, any consent by or on behalf of a Seller/Servicer to the filing
of an Insolvency Proceeding against a Seller/Servicer, or any admission by or on
behalf of a Seller/Servicer of its inability to pay its debts generally as the
same become due;

     (4) any filing of an Insolvency Proceeding against a Seller/Servicer that

Mortgage Loans for FNMA or FHLMC; or


                                      -55-
<PAGE>

     (7) any sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by a
Seller/Servicer of all or substantially all of its property or assets to a
Person who does not meet the qualifications enumerated or incorporated by
reference into SECTION 9.02, any assignment by a Seller/Servicer of this
Agreement or any of a Seller's/Servicer's rights or obligations hereunder except
in accordance with SECTION 9.04, or any action taken or omitted to be taken by a
Seller/Servicer in contemplation or in furtherance of any of the foregoing,
without the consent of the Purchaser;

then, and in each and every such case, so long as an Event of Default shall not
have been remedied, the Purchaser, by notice in writing to the Sellers may, in
addition to whatever rights the Purchaser may have at law or in equity to
damages, including injunctive relief and specific performance, terminate all the
rights and obligations of the Sellers under this Agreement and in and to the
Mortgage Loans and the proceeds thereof subject to SECTION 12.01, without the
Purchaser's incurring any penalty or fee of any kind whatsoever in connection
therewith; PROVIDED that, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under
SUBSECTION (3), (4) or (5) of this SECTION 10.01, this Agreement and all
authority and power of the Sellers hereunder (whether with respect to the
Mortgage Loans, the REO Properties or otherwise) shall automatically cease. On
or after the receipt by the Sellers of such written notice, all authority and
power of the Sellers under this Agreement (whether with respect to the Mortgage
Loans or otherwise) shall cease.

                            ARTICLE XI: TERMINATION

     Section 11.01 TERM AND TERMINATION.

     (1) The servicing obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement may be
terminated as provided in Section 10.01 hereof.

     (2) In any case other than as provided under SUBSECTION (1) hereof, the
respective obligations and responsibilities of the Sellers hereunder shall

any such event, the Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser in effecting
the termination of the Servicer's servicing responsibilities hereunder,
including the transfer to the Purchaser or its designee for administration by it
of all cash amounts which shall at the time be contained in, or credited by the
Servicer to, the Collection Account and/or the Escrow Account or thereafter
received with respect to any Mortgage Loan or REO Property.
