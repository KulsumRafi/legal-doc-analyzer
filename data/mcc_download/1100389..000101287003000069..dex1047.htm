a distraction to the Employee and can cause the Employee to consider alternative employment opportunities. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the
continued dedication and objectivity of the Employee, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control of the Company. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV STYLE="text-indent:4%"><FONT
