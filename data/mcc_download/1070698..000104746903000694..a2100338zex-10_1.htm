the foregoing persons may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereto) arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in
each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such Holder expressly for use in connection with
such registration; and each such Holder will pay, as incurred, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any person indemnified pursuant to this Section&nbsp;5.5(b), in connection with

such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and

considerations; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> that in no event shall any contribution by a Holder under this Section&nbsp;5.5(d) exceed the net proceeds from the offering

statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge,
access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. </FONT></P>
