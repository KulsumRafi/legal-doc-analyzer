<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CLAIMS PROCEDURES FOR MEDICAL AND DENTAL BENEFITS</B>: &nbsp;Providers of medical and dental services and supplies may file claims in writing or electronically with the Administrative Manager (via the managed care organization in which the providers participate, if applicable).&nbsp; Claims filed by participants for reimbursement of medical and dental expenses must be filed in writing with the Administrative Manager.&nbsp; Medicare Explanation of Benefit forms must accompany medical claims submitted on behalf of Medicare Retirees.&nbsp; Claims must include a claim form prescribed by the Trustees.&nbsp; Claim forms may be obtained from the Administrative Manager or from the Human Resources Office of Paul Mueller Company.&nbsp; The Trustees may, at their own expense, require an independent medical examination to be performed by a Physician selected by the Trustees.&nbsp; </P>

<FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Medical and Dental Benefits provided under the Plan for Covered Expenses with respect to which a health care provider has allowed a discount to the Plan, in accordance with a discount agreement between the provider and the Trustees, will be paid directly to the Hospital, Physician or Dentist.&nbsp; All other Medical and Dental Benefits will be paid to you (or to an alternate payee pursuant to the terms of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order), except that you may assign payment of Benefits directly to the Hospital, Physician, or other person or institution rendering services or furnishing supplies for which Benefits are payable under the Plan.&nbsp; The Trustees are not required to inquire into the validity of any such assignment, and any payment made in good faith by the Trustees discharges the obligation of the Trustees to the extent of such payment.&nbsp; The Plan will also honor any assignment of rights made by or on your behalf as&nbsp;required by Medicaid.&nbsp; In addition, if Medicaid makes payments which this Plan has a legal liability to make, the Plan will reimburse Medicaid for those payments, but only to the extent it&nbsp;is required to do so by State statute.&nbsp; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any unassigned Medical and Dental Benefits for services rendered, that are unpaid at your death will be paid to the Beneficiary you designated under your Life Insurance under the Plan.&nbsp; If you are incompetent, any unassigned Medical and Dental Benefits payable during your lifetime will be paid to your Life Insurance Beneficiary or, if you have not designated one, to the person or institution who is caring for you.&nbsp; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Administrative Manager will make a decision with respect to a claim for Medical and Dental Benefits within 30 days after receipt of the claim, unless matters beyond the control of the plan require an extension of time for processing.&nbsp; If such an extension of time is required, written notice of the extension will be sent to the claimant prior to termination of the 30-day period.&nbsp; The extension notice will indicate the circumstances requiring an extension of time and&nbsp;the date by which the Plan expects to render a final decision.&nbsp; In no event will this date be more than 15 days after the end of the initial 30-day period.&nbsp; If the extension of time is necessary due to the claimant's failure to submit all the information necessary to decide the claim, the&nbsp;claimant will be notified of the additional information needed and will be given 45 days to provide the information.&nbsp; (The Plan's time limits are tolled while the Plan is waiting for you to provide the information.)&nbsp; </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">VOLUNTARY PREDETERMINATION PROGRAM</B>: &nbsp;The Plan does not require that you or your health care provider obtain precertification prior to receiving health care services or supplies nor does it provide reduced benefits if you fail to obtain precertification.&nbsp; The Plan offers a voluntary predetermination program that you or your health care provider may use to determine whether the Plan considers health care services or supplies that have not yet been provided to you to be medically necessary and appropriate.&nbsp; If you participate in this voluntary predetermination program and a service or supply is determined to be medically necessary and appropriate, when your claim is submitted after the service or supply is provided, your claim will not be denied on the basis of medical necessity and appropriateness.&nbsp; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no penalty for failure to request a predetermination.&nbsp; However, if you receive health care services or supplies without obtaining a predetermination, you risk learning after receiving the services or supplies, that they are not covered under the Plan because they are not considered medically necessary and appropriate.&nbsp; <B>Unless you obtain a predetermination, medical necessity will be decided when a claim is filed after the service or supply has been provided.&nbsp; In such a case, you may be entirely responsible for the cost of any non-covered services or supplies.&nbsp;</B> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you do not request a predetermination or if the predetermination is that the service is not medically necessary, then a claim submitted after services are provided will be reviewed without regard to whether you participated in the voluntary predetermination program or to any negative determination made as part of that program.&nbsp; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How to Obtain Predetermination</B> -- To predetermine whether a hospitalization or a surgical procedure or other outpatient procedure is considered medically necessary and appropriate, contact Benefit Consultants, Inc. (BCI) at (800) 434-4620.&nbsp; BCI may refer your request to an independent medical consultant to determine the medical necessity and appropriateness of the service.&nbsp; You and your physician will be informed of the decision.&nbsp; </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concurrent Review</B> -- If you obtained a predetermination of hospital admission, BCI will perform periodic reviews of your medical progress and will check with your physician and/or hospital.&nbsp; If BCI determines the continued stay to be medically necessary and appropriate, your claim will not be denied on that basis.&nbsp; </FONT></TD>
