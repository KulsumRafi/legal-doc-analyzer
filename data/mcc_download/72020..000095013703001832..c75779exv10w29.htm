safeguarding its customer and partner relationships. In light of the

does not constitute and shall not be construed, interpreted, or treated in
any respect as an admission of any liability or wrongdoing by Nicor. Mr.
Cali further agrees that this agreement shall not be admissible in any
proceeding without Nicor&#146;s written consent, except for a proceeding
instituted by Mr.&nbsp;Cali or Nicor alleging a breach of this agreement, any
proceeding in which a defense is asserted based on any provisions of this
agreement, or as otherwise required by law. Mr.&nbsp;Cali also agrees that, if
any taxing body determines that amounts should have been withheld from the
payments provided for in this agreement, he acknowledges and assumes all
responsibility for the payment of all such taxes and agrees to indemnify
and hold Nicor harmless for the payment of any such taxes, the failure to
withhold, and any related interest or penalties.</FONT></TD>

Nicor will have no adequate remedy at law. Mr.&nbsp;Cali agrees that if he
breaches any of the provisions of this agreement, Nicor shall be entitled
to injunctive relief, its actual attorneys&#146; fees and costs associated with
such action, and all such further relief as a court of competent
jurisdiction may deem just and proper.</FONT></TD>
