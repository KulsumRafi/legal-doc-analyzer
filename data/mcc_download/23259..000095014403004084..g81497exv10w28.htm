<FONT size="2">THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of the
10th day of March, 2003 by and between <B>CT COMMUNICATIONS,

<B><FONT size="2">WHEREAS, </FONT></B><FONT size="2">the
Employee is a valued employee of the Company or one of the
Company&#146;s subsidiaries, and in order to induce the Employee
to continue employment with the Company and to enhance the
Employee&#146;s job security, the Company desires to provide
compensation to the Employee in the event the Employee&#146;s
employment is terminated following a change in control of the

products, relationships, trade secrets and confidential

Company wishes to protect its long-term interests by having the
Employee enter into non-disclosure and non-competition covenants;

are hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Employee agree as

Section&nbsp;IA(iii) hereof) occurs and if, within two years
following the Change in Control, the employment of the Employee
is terminated (A)&nbsp;by the Company other than for Cause (as
defined in Section&nbsp;IA(i) hereof), or (B)&nbsp;by the
Employee for Good Reason (as defined in Section&nbsp;IA(ii)
hereof), the Employee&#146;s Compensation (as defined in
Section&nbsp;IA(iv) hereof) shall continue to be paid in monthly
installments, subject to applicable withholdings, by the Company
for a period of twelve (12)&nbsp;months following such
termination of employment. In lieu of receiving payment of
Compensation for such 12-month period in installments, the
Employee may elect, at any time prior to the earlier to occur of
a Change in Control or action by the Board of Directors of the
Company (the &#147;Board&#148;) with respect to an event which
would, upon consummation, result in a Change in Control (which
election shall be evidenced by notice filed with the Company),
to be paid the present value of any such Compensation in a lump
sum within 30&nbsp;days of termination of the Employee&#146;s
employment under circumstances entitling such Employee to
Compensation hereunder. The calculation of the amount due shall
be made by the independent accounting firm then performing the
Company&#146;s independent audit, and such calculation,
including but not limited to any discount factor used to
determine present value, shall be conclusive.

that the Company may make to aid the Company in meeting its
obligations under this Section&nbsp;I. Nothing contained herein,
and no action taken pursuant to the provisions hereof, shall
create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a

restrictions placed upon him by this Agreement are reasonable
given the nature of the Employee&#146;s position with the

<FONT size="2">B.&nbsp;The Employee agrees that in the event of
any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of
Section&nbsp;II and III hereof by the Employee, the
Company&#146;s remedies at law would be inadequate, and the
Company shall be entitled to an injunction (without any bond or
other security being required), restraining such breach, and
costs and attorneys&#146; fees relating to any such proceeding
or any other legal action to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement, but nothing herein shall be construed to preclude the
Company from pursuing any other remedies at law or in equity
available to it for any such breach or threatened breach.
Moreover, the Employee also agrees that if the Employee breaches
any of Sections&nbsp;II or III above, the Employee shall be
required to refund to the Company and the Company shall be
entitled to recover of the Employee 90% of the amount of the
Employee&#146;s Compensation (as defined in Section&nbsp;IA(iv)
herein) for a Change in Control already paid to the Employee by
the Company under this Agreement at the time of the breach, and
the Employee shall forfeit at the time of the breach the right
to any additional payments or benefits under this Agreement,
except that if the breach occurs before the payments set forth
in Section&nbsp;IA are made, the Employee shall be entitled to
receive the first monthly payment set forth in Section&nbsp;IA,
if generally eligible under Section&nbsp;I, and nothing more. In
such case, the Employee and the Company agree that the
confidential information and non-compete obligations contained
in this Agreement shall remain valid and enforceable based upon
the consideration actually paid.

<FONT size="2">C.&nbsp;The Employee acknowledges that all of the
provisions of the Agreement are fair and necessary to protect
the interests of the Company. Accordingly, the Employee agrees
not to contest the validity or enforceability of Section&nbsp;II
or Section&nbsp;III hereof and agrees that if any court should
hold any provision of Section&nbsp;II or Section&nbsp;III hereof
to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will nonetheless
be enforceable according to their terms. Further, if any
provision or subsection is held to be overly broad as written,
the Employee agrees that a court should view the above
provisions and subsections as separable and uphold those
separable provisions and subsections deemed to be reasonable.

<FONT size="2">D.&nbsp;The Employee understands that every
provision of this Agreement is severable from each other
provision of this Agreement. Therefore, if any provision of this
Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, every other
provision of this Agreement will continue to be fully valid and
enforceable. In the event that any provision of this Agreement
is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or
unenforceable, the Employee and the Company agree that such
provision shall be enforced to the extent reasonable under the
circumstances and that all other provisions shall be enforceable
to the fullest extent permissible by law. The Employee and the
Company further agree that, if any court makes such a
determination, such court shall have the power to reduce the
duration, scope and/or area of such provisions and/or delete
specific words and phrases by &#147;blue penciling&#148; and, in
its reduced or blue penciled form, such provisions shall then be
enforceable as allowed by law.
