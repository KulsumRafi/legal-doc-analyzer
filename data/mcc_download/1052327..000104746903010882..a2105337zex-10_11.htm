<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>THIS LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is entered into on the above date between SILICON VALLEY BANK ("Silicon"),
whose address is 3003 Tasman Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054 and the borrower(s) named above (jointly and severally, the "Borrower"), whose chief executive office is located at the above address
("Borrower's Address"). The Schedule to this Agreement (the "Schedule") shall for all purposes be deemed to be a part of this Agreement, and the same is an integral part of this Agreement.
(Definitions of certain terms used in this Agreement are set forth in Section&nbsp;8 below.) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>As
set forth in the Amendment to Loan Documents of even date between Silicon and the Borrower, this Loan and Security Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the Loan and Security Agreement
dated September&nbsp;4, 2001 between Silicon and Borrower (except as otherwise provided for in the Amendment to Loan Documents). </FONT></P>

Overadvance, on demand, at the Default Rate. </FONT></P>

request to Silicon by facsimile or telephone. Loan requests received after 12:00 Noon will not be considered by Silicon until the next Business Day. Silicon may rely on any telephone request for a

in its good faith business judgment, issue or arrange for the issuance of letters of credit for the account of Borrower, in each case in form and substance satisfactory to Silicon in its sole
discretion (collectively, "Letters of Credit"). The aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit from time to time outstanding shall not exceed the amount shown on the Schedule (the "Letter of
Credit Sublimit"), and shall be reserved against Loans which would otherwise be available hereunder, and in the event at any time there are insufficient Loans available to Borrower for such reserve,
Borrower shall deposit and maintain with Silicon cash collateral in an amount at all times equal to such deficiency, which shall be held as Collateral for all purposes of this Agreement. Borrower
shall pay all bank charges (including charges of Silicon) for the issuance of Letters of Credit, together with such additional fee as Silicon's letter of credit department shall charge in connection
with the issuance of the Letters of Credit. Any payment by Silicon under or in connection with a Letter of Credit shall constitute a Loan hereunder on the date such payment is made. Each Letter of
Credit shall have an expiry date no later than thirty days prior to the Maturity Date. Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Silicon harmless from any loss, cost, expense, or liability,
including payments made by Silicon, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by Silicon arising out of or in connection with any Letters of Credit. Borrower agrees to be bound by the
regulations and interpretations of the issuer of any Letters of Credit guarantied by Silicon and opened for Borrower's account or by Silicon's interpretations of any Letter of Credit issued by Silicon
for Borrower's account, and Borrower understands and agrees that Silicon shall not be liable for any error, negligence, or mistake, whether of omission or commission, in following Borrower's
instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any modifications, amendments, or supplements thereto. Borrower understands that Letters of Credit may require Silicon to indemnify the
issuing bank for certain costs or liabilities arising out of claims by Borrower against such issuing bank. Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Silicon harmless with respect to any loss, cost,
expense, or liability incurred by Silicon under any Letter of Credit as a result of Silicon's indemnification of any such issuing bank. The provisions of this Loan Agreement, as it pertains to Letters
of Credit, and any other Loan Documents relating to Letters of Credit are cumulative. </FONT></P>

Silicon a security interest in all of the following (collectively, the "Collateral"): all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to all of the following, whether now owned or hereafter arising
or acquired and wherever located: all Accounts; all Inventory; all Equipment; all Deposit Accounts; all General Intangibles (including without limitation all Intellectual Property); all Investment
Property; all Other Property; and any and all claims, rights and interests in any of the above, and all guaranties and security for any of the above, and all substitutions and replacements for,

For purposes of the foregoing, "Debt Service Coverage" shall mean the ratio of (a)&nbsp;Borrower's earnings before Borrower's interest, depreciation and other non-cash amortization expenses less unfunded capital expenditures, all determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, to (b)&nbsp;Borrower's obligations relating to payment of interest and current maturities of principal on Borrower's outstanding long-term indebtedness and capitalized
leases, all determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, calculated upon the average of such items for the specific month for which the Debt Service Coverage is being calculated and the 2&nbsp;months
immediately preceding such month (for example, the Debt Service Coverage for the month ending November&nbsp;30, 2002 will be calculated based on the average of Borrower's earnings, interest, depreciation, etc. for the three months of September,
October and November&nbsp;2002. For the month ending December&nbsp;31, 2002, Debt Service Coverage will be calculated based on the average of Borrower's earnings, interest, depreciation, etc. for the three months of October, November and

total FX Forward Contracts at any one time outstanding may not exceed 10 times the amount of the Foreign Exchange Contract Sublimit set forth above. Silicon shall have the right to withhold, from the Loans otherwise available to Borrower under this
Agreement, a reserve (which shall be in addition to all other reserves) in an amount equal to 10% of the total FX Forward Contracts from time to time outstanding, and in the event at any time there are insufficient Loans available to Borrower for
such reserve, Borrower shall deposit and maintain with Silicon cash collateral in an amount at all times equal to such deficiency, which shall be held as Collateral for all purposes of this Agreement. Silicon may, in its discretion, terminate the FX
Forward Contracts at any time that an Event of Default occurs and is continuing. Borrower shall execute all standard form applications and agreements of Silicon in connection with the FX Forward Contracts, and without limiting any of the terms of
