                                                      DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN<br>
                                                             FOR OFFICERS<br>
                                                           February 5, 2001</h3>



         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protective Life  Corporation  (the "Company")  hereby amends the Protective Life Corporation  Deferred  Compensation  Plan for
Officers (the "Plan").</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.       Section 4(b) of the Plan is amended to read in its entirety as follows:</FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)(1)   Except as otherwise  provided in Section  4(b)(2),  if a cash  allotment is elected in whole or in part, the
         Account shall be credited  with the dollar  amount of the  allotment.  Interest (at the rate  described  below) on the Average
         Daily  Balance  (computed  as  described  below)  shall be credited to the Account as of the last day of each  calendar  month
         before and after the  termination  of the  Officer's  service  and after the  Officer's  death or  disability  until the total
         balance in the Account has been paid out in  accordance  with the  provisions of Section 5 or Section 6. The interest rate for
         each calendar month shall be the 30-Day London  Interbank  Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 75 basis points for the last business day
         of the immediately  preceding  calendar month as reported on the Bloomberg  financial news system. The "Average Daily Balance"
         shall be the quotient  obtained by dividing the sum of the closing  balance in the Account at the end of each  calendar day in
         a calendar month by the number of days in such calendar month.</FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)      An  Officer  may elect to be paid in cash,  in lieu of the  credit to his  Account  as  provided  in Section
         4(b)(1),  an amount  equal to the amount of interest  determined  as provided  in Section  4(b)(1).  The Officer may make such
         election by executing a form  prescribed  by or acceptable  to the Company and  delivering  such election form to the Company;
         provided  that any such  election  shall be effective  only with respect to interest to be  determined  after the date of such
         election.  The Company shall make payments to the Officer  pursuant to this Section  4(b)(2) as soon as practicable  after the
         end of the calendar month.</FONT></P>

         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.       Section 4(c)(2) of the Plan is amended to read in its entirety as follows:</FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)(A)    Except as otherwise  provided in Section  4(c)(2)(B),  the Account also shall be credited as of the payment
         date for each dividend on the Common Stock with additional  stock  equivalents  computed by (i) multiplying the dividend paid,
         either in cash or property  (other than Common  Stock),  upon a share of Common Stock to a shareholder of record by the number
         of stock  equivalents in the Account,  and (ii) dividing the product  thereof by the Average Closing Price of the Common Stock
         for the twenty (20) trading days ending on the day  preceding the dividend  payment date. In the case of dividends  payable in
         property,  the  amount  paid  shall be based on the fair  market  value of the  property  at the time of  distribution  of the
         dividend, as determined by a majority of the Board; provided,  however, that if a Change in Control shall have occurred,  then
         such determination shall be made by a majority of the Continuing Directors.</FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)      An Officer may elect to receive, in lieu of the credit to his Account as provided in Section 4(c)(2)(A),  an
         amount in cash or property  equal to the amount of any dividend  paid,  either in cash or property  (other than Common  Stock)
         upon a share of Common Stock to a shareholder of record,  multiplied by the number of stock  equivalents  in the Account.  The
         Officer may make such election by executing a form  prescribed by or  acceptable to the Company and  delivering  such election
         form to the Company;  provided that any such  election  shall be  applicable  only with respect to dividend  record dates that
         occur after the date of such  election.  The Company  shall make payments to the Officer  pursuant to this Section  4(c)(2)(B)
         as soon as practicable after the applicable dividend payment date.</FONT></P>









         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has executed this document as of February 5, 2001.</FONT></P>
