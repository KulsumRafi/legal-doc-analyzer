                  and pursuant to which the broker-dealer undertakes to deliver
                  the full exercise price to the Company not later than the
                  later of (A) the settlement date of the sale transaction and

                  broker-dealer the shares of Common Stock being purchased
                  pursuant to the exercise of such option. This method is known

                  Company's Board of Directors may amend, suspend or terminate
