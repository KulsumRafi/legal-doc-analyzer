serve as directors and to further align the interests of directors and stockholders in enhancing the value of the Common Stock. The Plan was originally established effective April 24, 1996 and approved by the Corporation&#146;s stockholders to
provide for (i) the payment of shares of Common Stock to certain of the directors in connection with the partial termination of the NationsBank Corporation and Designated Subsidiaries Directors&#146; Retirement Plan and (ii) the payment in Common
Stock of a portion of the Annual Retainer Fee payable to each Nonemployee Director. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

restricted stock in lieu of stock options would better align the interests of Nonemployee Directors with the interests of the Corporation&#146;s stockholders. Accordingly, this amendment and restatement of the Plan adopted at the December 10, 2002
meeting of the Board of Directors of the Corporation replaces the annual award of stock options with an award of shares of restricted stock. The Plan shall continue in effect unless and until terminated by the Board in accordance with Section 10
