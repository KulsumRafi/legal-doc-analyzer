<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference
is made to the Credit Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Credit Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrower
has advised Agent that its Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio ("FCCR") as of December&nbsp;31, 2002 was 1.09:1. Pursuant to Section&nbsp;5.4(B) of the Credit Agreement, Borrower
must maintain a FCCR of least 1.20:1, determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. A FCCR of 1.09:1 constitutes an Event of Default under Section&nbsp;6.1(b) of the Credit Agreement and
such Event of Default gives rise to cross defaults under Section&nbsp;6.1(e) of the Credit Agreement (the "FCCR Default"). Borrower has requested a waiver of the FCCR Default for the fiscal quarter
ending December&nbsp;31, 2002 and a waiver of such requirement through January&nbsp;1, 2004. In reliance upon the representations, warranties and undertakings provided by Borrower by which
Borrower has requested such waiver, each of the Lenders, by signing below, hereby waives the FCCR Default for Borrower's fiscal quarter ending December&nbsp;31, 2002 and waives the requirements of
Section&nbsp;5.4 (B)&nbsp;from January&nbsp;1, 2003 through January&nbsp;1, 2004 ("Grace Period") as set forth herein. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
effectiveness of this waiver letter (this "Letter") is subject to satisfaction of the following conditions precedent: </FONT></P>

in which case such representations and warranties are true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and except for representations and warranties relating to defaults under any

anything contained herein to the contrary, the Grace Period shall immediately terminate if (1)&nbsp;any Unmatured Default or Event of Default (other than the FCCR
Default) occurs; (2)&nbsp;Borrower fails to deliver to Agent on or before 5&nbsp;p.m. on March&nbsp;7, 2003 ("Waiver Deadline"), a waiver from any applicable Person of any default, termination
or abridgement of rights under any other document, instrument or agreement entered into by any Borrower or Guarantor with such Person that exists or that could exist or occur (after this Letter is in
effect) as a result of the FCCR Default, the waiver of such FCCR Default described herein or the waiver of the FCCR requirement described above during the Grace Period; or (3)&nbsp;Borrower's FCCR
is: (a)&nbsp;below 1.05:1 as of January&nbsp;31, 2003; (b)&nbsp;below the greater of (i)&nbsp;1.09 and (ii)&nbsp;Borrower's actual January&nbsp;31, 2003 FCCR, as of February&nbsp;28,
2003 and (c)&nbsp;thereafter, to the extent Borrower's FCCR improves as of the last day of any calendar month during the remainder of the Grace Period for the twelve month period ending on such day,
at any such day after such improvement, less than the increased amount, but in no event shall Borrower's FCCR be less than 1.09:1 if FCCR has not improved during the Grace Period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Grace Period shall automatically terminate if, at any time, on or before the Waiver Deadline, Borrower fails to diligently pursue the waivers required under clause&nbsp;(2) above or
any Person indicates any such other waiver shall not be given. For purposes of clause&nbsp;(2), agreements shall not include those agreements under which Borrower's total indebtedness is $100,000.00
or less ("Exempt Agreements"); provided, however, the aggregate indebtedness under such Exempt Agreements shall not exceed $500,000.00. The parties hereto agree that any waiver required by this
paragraph with respect to the Lenders and their respective financial subsidiaries and affiliates shall be deemed to have been delivered as required by this paragraph by virtue of the fifth to last
paragraph of this letter. </FONT></P>
