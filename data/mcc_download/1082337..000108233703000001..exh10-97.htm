the Claim using counsel of its own choice without prejudice to its right of
indemnification under this Section 5.  The Indemnitor shall pay on demand any
Indemnified Items incurred by the Indemnified Party.  Each Party shall fully
cooperate with each other in fulfilling the intent of this Section 5.  The
Indemnitor shall not settle any claim in which the Indemnified Party is named
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party; which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.  The Indemnified Party shall have the right to be
represented by counsel at its own expense in any such contest, defense,
litigation or settlement conducted by the Indemnitor.</P>

This Agreement, including any addenda, schedules, exhibits, or other documents
attached hereto or referenced herein or therein, each of which is hereby
incorporated into this Agreement and made an integral part hereof, constitutes
the entire agreement between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof
and there are no representations, warranties or commitments except as set forth
herein.  This Agreement supersedes all prior understandings, negotiations and
discussions, written or oral, of the Parties relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;8.4  <U>Governing Law</U>.  This Agreement shall be
governed by and interpreted in all respects by the Laws of the State of Delaware
without regard to any conflicts of law principles or choice of laws, which would
require the application of laws of another jurisdiction. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;8.5  <U>Provisions Severable</U>. If any provision of
this Agreement shall be or become wholly or partially invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the extent that its legal and
valid and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby, unless such enforcement is in
manifest violation of the present intention of the parties reflected in this
Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;8.6  <U>Validity; Amendment</U>.  This Agreement shall
not be valid until signed and accepted by an authorized officer of each Party.
The Parties agree that this Agreement, together with any addenda, schedules,
exhibits or other documents attached hereto, may be amended from time to time in
writing by mutual agreement of the Parties.  No Party shall be bound by any
change, alteration, amendment, modification or attempted waiver of any of the
provisions hereof unless in writing and signed by an authorized officer of the
Party against whom it is sought to be enforced.  This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;8.7  <U>Assignment; Successors</U>. Neither Party shall
assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party.
Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement will be fully binding on
each Party hereto, its successors and assigns.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;8.8  <U>Waivers; Remedies are Cumulative</U>. No waiver
of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of
any prior, concurrent or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions
hereof, and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an
authorized representative of the waiving Party. No failure or delay by a Party
to insist upon the strict performance of any term or condition under this
Agreement or to exercise any right or remedy available under this Agreement at
law or in equity, and no course of dealing between the Parties, shall imply or
otherwise constitute a waiver of such right or remedy, and no single or partial
exercise of any right or remedy by any Party will preclude any other or further
exercise thereof.  All rights with respect to a Contract, unless otherwise
provided in this Agreement, shall continue until all Contracts have been fully
paid.  All rights and remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not
alternative; and are in addition to all other available remedies at law or in
equity.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.9  <U>Announcements, Marks and Advertising</U>.  Neither
Party nor their respective Affiliates will issue any external announcements,
press releases or advertising, whether verbal or written, in any way pertaining
to the subject matter of this Agreement without first obtaining the prior
written consent of the other Party.  Without the other Party's prior written
consent, neither Party shall use or refer to any name, mark, symbol or other
trade identity of the other Party or any of their respective Affiliates in any
advertisement, press release or other communication.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;8.10  <U>Captions; Sections; Counterparts</U>. The
captions or headings in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be
considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation of any
provision of this Agreement.  Any reference to a Section in this Agreement shall
refer to all paragraphs and subparagraphs within that Section.  This Agreement
may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which together shall be
deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.11  <U>No Third Party Beneficiaries</U>.  Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended or shall be construed to create any rights in, or confer
any benefits upon, any person or entity other than the Parties to this
Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;8.12  <U>Expenses</U>. Unless specifically provided for
elsewhere in this Agreement, each Party will bear all costs and expenses

shall be paid by Household) which are imposed upon that Party based upon its
activities hereunder.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;8.13  <U>Independent Counsel and Interpretation</U>.
Each Party acknowledges that its legal counsel participated in the preparation
and drafting of this Agreement, and that each has been or has had the
opportunity to be represented by independent counsel of its own choice
throughout all negotiations which preceded the execution of this Agreement, and
that it has executed this Agreement with the consent and upon the advice of said
independent counsel.  Accordingly, it is agreed that any legal rule of
construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the

enter into this Agreement and to bind their respective principal on whose behalf
the signatory acts.</P>

Confirmation will include a reduction in the &quot;buy rate&quot; if the vehicle
meets certain Loan to Value criteria (the "LTV discount").  The &quot;buy

Differential shall equal the difference if any, between the Contract Rate for a
particular Contract and the Adjusted Buy Rate applicable to the Contract at the

formula and all such determinations shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Company. </LI></UL>

the terms of this Agreement, Company will remit to Household the full amount of
any Alliance Fee paid to Company with respect to such Contract along with the
other amounts required to be paid under this Agreement for said
