To each of the Holders named
on Schedule I attached hereto

Ladies and Gentlemen:

        ALION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation

(the "Company"), agrees with you as follows.  Certain terms used herein are

defined in section 11.

1.      DESCRIPTION OF ACQUISITION. The Company has agreed to acquire
substantially all of the assets of IIT Research Institute, a not-for-profit
Illinois corporation ("IITRI") for consideration of $117,100,000 (subject to
certain adjustments as provided in the Asset Purchase Agreement) pursuant to the
Acquisition Documents. In order to consummate the IITRI Acquisition, the holders
have agreed to accept as a portion of the purchase price in Notes and Warrants
of the Company on the terms and pursuant to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

2.      AUTHORIZATION OF SECURITIES; ETC.

                (a) The Company has authorized the issue of its 12% Senior
Subordinated Notes due December 20, 2008 (herein, together with any notes issued
in exchange therefor or replacement thereof, called the "Notes") in the
aggregate principal amount of $20,343,435.37. The Notes are to be substantially
in the form of Exhibit 2(a) attached hereto.

                (b) The Company has authorized the issue of its warrants
evidencing rights to purchase 524,228.9 shares of its Common Stock (subject to
adjustment) (herein, together with any warrants issued in exchange therefor or
replacement thereof, called the "Warrants"). The Warrants are to be
substantially in the form of Exhibit 2(b) attached hereto.

                (c) Interest on the Notes shall accrue at 12% per annum computed
on the actual number of days elapsed in any year (based on a year of twelve
30-day months and a 360 day year). The first installment of interest on the
Notes is payable on March 31, 2003, and thereafter interest is payable on the
Notes, quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of March, June, September
and December of each year, commencing March 31, 2003 and at maturity. In no
event shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid by the Company as interest and
premium on any Note exceed the highest lawful rate permissible under any law
applicable thereto.

                (d) Each Material Subsidiary of the Company and each Person, if
any, that hereafter becomes a Material Subsidiary of the Company shall
unconditionally guarantee the

Notes and all other obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, if any,
under the Operative Documents pursuant to separate guarantees, each

and supplemented from time to time, each a "Subsidiary Guarantee"; collectively
the "Subsidiary Guarantees").

3.      SALE AND PURCHASE OF SECURITIES. The Company will issue to you as
consideration under the Asset Purchase Agreement and, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of the
Company contained herein and in the other Operative Documents, you will accept
from the Company, at the Closing specified in section 4, such Securities as are
specified on that portion of Schedule I attached hereto as is applicable to you.

4.      CLOSING. The closing of the sale and delivery of the Securities
hereunder (the "Closing") shall take place at the office of Baker & McKenzie,
Chicago, on December 20, 2002 (or such other date to which you may agree) (the
"Closing Date"). At the Closing, the Company will deliver to you the Securities
in the form of one or more Notes and Warrants, in such denominations and
registered in such names as are specified on Schedule I attached hereto, and in
each case dated and, in the case of each Note, bearing interest from, the
Closing Date. If at the Closing the Company shall fail to tender the Securities
to be delivered to you thereat as provided herein, or if at the Closing any of
the conditions specified in section 5 shall not have been fulfilled to your
satisfaction, you shall, at your election, be relieved of all further
obligations under this Agreement or to close the acquisition transaction
contemplated by the Acquisition Documents, without thereby waiving any other
rights you may have by reason of such failure or such non-fulfillment.

5.      CONDITIONS TO CLOSING. Your obligation to accept the Securities to be
delivered to you hereunder at the Closing is subject to the fulfillment to your
satisfaction, prior to or at the Closing, of the following conditions:

        5.2 PERFORMANCE; NO DEFAULT. The Company shall have performed all
agreements and complied with all conditions contained herein and in the other
Operative Documents required to be performed or complied with by it prior to or
at the Closing, and at the time of the Closing, no Default or Event of Default
shall exist and no condition shall exist which has resulted in, or could
reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect.

        5.3 RELATED TRANSACTIONS.

                (a) The IITRI Acquisition shall have been consummated in
accordance with the Acquisition Documents. No material term or condition of the

other than as the same may be or may have been amended as of the Closing

        6.4 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

                (a) Pro Forma Financials. The combined, projected pro forma
balance sheet, income statements and statements of cash flow of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 6.4, present on
a pro forma basis the financial condition of the Company and such Subsidiaries
as of such date, and reflect on a pro forma basis those liabilities reflected in

the Bank Documents, and the payment or accrual of all transaction costs payable
on the Closing Date with respect to any of the foregoing. The projections and
assumptions expressed in the pro forma financials referenced in this section
6.4(a) were prepared in good faith and represent management's opinion based on
the information available to the Company at the time so furnished and, since the
preparation thereof and up to the Closing Date, there has occurred no change in
the business, financial condition, operations, or prospects of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
which has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                (b) Audited Financial Statements. Complete and accurate copies
of the audited financial statements and the audit reports related thereto of
IITRI and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at September 30, 2001 and of the

against the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries as a result of any
federal, state, local or foreign tax examination for each taxable year in
respect of which an examination has been conducted have been fully paid or
finally settled or are being contested in good faith, and no issue has been
raised by any taxing authority in any such examination which, by application of
similar principles, could reasonably be expected to result in assertion by such
taxing authority of a material deficiency for any other year not so examined
which has not been reserved for in the Company's consolidated financial
statements to the extent, if any, required by Agreement Accounting Principles.
Except as permitted pursuant to section 10.2(d), neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries anticipates any tax liability with respect to the years which
have not been closed pursuant to applicable law.

                (b) Payment of Taxes. All tax returns and reports of the Company
and its Subsidiaries required to be filed have been timely filed, and all taxes,

respective property, assets, income and franchises which are shown in such

are being contested in good faith and have been reserved for in accordance with
Agreement Accounting Principles. The Company has no knowledge of any


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

proposed tax assessment against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that will
have or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                (c) Subchapter S Status. As of the Closing Date, the Company has
executed and has caused all other Persons to execute the applicable election
forms or other filings required to be made for purposes of the Company's
election to be taxed as an "S corporation" as such term is defined in Section
1361 of the Code. Beginning with the Company's taxable year ending September 30,
2002, the Company was and as of the Closing Date remains taxable as an S
corporation. The ESOT is not subject to tax imposed under the Code with respect
to any item of income or loss of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

        6.6 LITIGATION; LOSS CONTINGENCIES. Except as set forth in Exhibit 6.6
attached hereto (the "Disclosed Litigation"), there is no action, suit,
proceeding, arbitration or, to the Company's knowledge, investigation before or
by any Governmental Authority or private arbitrator pending or, to the Company's
knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any property of any of them. Neither any of the Disclosed
Litigation nor any action, suit, proceeding, arbitration or investigation which
has commenced on or prior to the Closing Date (a) challenges the validity or the
enforceability of any material provision of the Transaction Documents or (b) has
or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no
material loss contingency within the meaning of Agreement Accounting Principles
which has not been reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the
Company prepared and delivered pursuant to section 6.4(b) for the fiscal period
during which such material loss contingency was incurred. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is (x) in violation of any applicable Requirements
of Law which violation will have or could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, or (y) subject to or in default with respect to any
final judgment, writ, injunction, restraining order or order of any nature,
decree, rule or regulation of any court or Governmental Authority which will
have or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the
Company's knowledge, neither the ESOP Fiduciary nor the ESOT Trustee has made
any assertion with respect to the ESOP or the ESOT contrary to or inconsistent
with the accuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in section 6.5(c)
or section 6.19 that could reasonably be expected to have in a Material Adverse
Effect.

        6.7 SUBSIDIARIES; CAPITALIZATION.

                (a) Exhibit 6.7(a) attached hereto (i) contains a description of
the corporate structure of the Company or its Subsidiaries; and (ii) accurately
sets forth (A) the correct legal name, the jurisdiction of incorporation and the
jurisdictions in which each of the Company and the direct and indirect
Subsidiaries of the Company are qualified to transact business as a foreign
corporation, and (B) the authorized, issued and outstanding shares of each class
of Capital Stock of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and the owners of
such shares (both as of the Closing Date and on a fully-diluted basis). Except
for (i) mandatory redemption or repurchase of Capital Stock of the Company as a
result of distributions by the ESOT to participants of the ESOP pursuant to the
ESOP Plan Documents subsequent to their termination of employment with the
Company or any Controlled Group member, (ii) the requirements of Section
401(a)(28) of the Code or any substantially similar Requirement of Law, (iii)
the Incentive Arrangements


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

disclosed on Exhibit 6.7(a), and the Warrants and the Seller Warrants, (iv) the
put and call rights contained in the Warrants and the Seller Warrants, (v) the
vesting provisions of the ESOP, or (vi) agreements otherwise disclosed on
Exhibit 6.7(a), none of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Company
or any of the Company's Subsidiaries is subject to any vesting, redemption, or
repurchase agreement, and there are no warrants or options outstanding with
respect to such Capital Stock except for the Warrants and the Seller Warrants
and except as may be in effect from time to time with respect Incentive
Arrangements. The outstanding Capital Stock of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and is not Margin Stock; and, except as provided in the Rights Agreement, the
Warrants and the Seller Warrants, not subject to any preemptive right, right of
first refusal or offer or similar right on the part of any other Person, and all
of such Capital Stock has been (or will have been) offered and issued in
accordance with all applicable laws. Except as set forth on Exhibit 6.7(a)
attached hereto and except to the extent Persons may be deemed beneficial owners
by virtue of familial relationships with a holder of Capital Stock or in
connection with a trust established for the benefit of family members by a
holder of Capital Stock, the owners of the Capital Stock indicated on Exhibit
6.7(a) attached hereto own the Capital Stock indicated on such exhibit free of
any Lien, proxy, voting agreement, voting trust, stockholders agreement (other
than the Rights Agreement) or similar agreement or restriction. Except as set
forth on Exhibit 6.7(a) attached hereto, neither the Organizational Documents
nor any other agreement, document or instrument binding on or applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its stockholders contains any
provision requiring a higher voting requirement with respect to action taken
(and/or to be taken) by its board of directors or stockholders than that which
would apply in the absence of such provision.

                (b) Except as provided in the Rights Agreement, the Warrants,
the Seller Warrants and except as set forth on Exhibit 6.7(b) attached hereto
(after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions consummated at the
Closing under the Transaction Documents), (i) there are no outstanding
securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for any Capital Stock
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and no outstanding agreements for the
purchase from, or sale or issuance by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
any of their respective Capital Stock or any securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for such Capital Stock; (ii) there are no agreements
on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, sell or
distribute any of their respective Capital Stock, other securities or assets;
(iii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation
(contingent or otherwise) to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of their
respective Capital Stock or other securities or any interest therein or to pay
any dividend or make any distribution in respect thereof; and (iv) no Person is
entitled to any rights with respect to the registration of any Capital Stock or
other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Securities
Act (or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction).

                (c) The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise in full of the Warrants immediately after the Closing is 524,228.9,
which, if then issued, would constitute 12.475% of the Common Stock (calculated
assuming the conversion, exercise and exchange of all outstanding securities
convertible into and exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock,
including, without limitation, the Warrants and the Seller Warrants). The
Company has reserved 524,228.9 shares of Common Stock solely for issuance upon
exercise of


                                      -10-
<PAGE>

the Warrants. The Company has adopted stock appreciation rights plan. The
Company has not reserved any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Company's
stock appreciation rights plan.

        6.8 ERISA.

                (a) Plan Documents. The ESOP Plan Documents identified in
Exhibit 11.1.5 to this Agreement (each as may be amended from time to time as
provided therein) are all of the material documents pursuant to which the ESOP
and ESOT are maintained by the Company, or concerning the Company's obligations
with respect to the ESOP and ESOT. The ESOT Transaction Documents identified in
Exhibit 11.1.6 to this Agreement (without any modifications or amendments
thereto), together with the ESOP Plan Documents identified in Exhibit 11.1.5 to
this Agreement (without any modifications or amendments thereto), are all duly
adopted by the Company to the extent intended to be so adopted.

                (b) Plan Events. The representations and warranties in this
section 6.8(b) are subject to the disclosures made on Exhibit 6.8(b) attached
hereto. No Benefit Plan has incurred any material accumulated funding deficiency
(as defined in Sections 302(a)(2) of ERISA and 412(a) of the Code) whether or
not waived. Neither the Company nor any member of the Controlled Group has
incurred any material liability to the PBGC which remains outstanding other than
the payment of premiums, and there are no premium payments which have become due
which are unpaid. With respect to each Benefit Plan, Schedule B to the most
recent annual report filed with the IRS with respect to such plan is complete
and accurate in all material respects. Since the date of each such Schedule B,
there has been no material adverse change in the funding status or financial
condition of the Benefit Plan relating to such Schedule B. As of the last day of
the most recent prior plan year, the market value of assets under each Benefit
Plan, other than any Multiemployer Plan, was not by a material amount less than
the present value of benefit liabilities thereunder (determined in accordance
with the actuarial valuation assumptions described therein). Neither the Company
nor any member of the Controlled Group has (i) failed to make a required
contribution or payment to a Multiemployer Plan of a material amount or (ii)
incurred a material complete or partial withdrawal under Sections 4203 or 4205
of ERISA from a Multiemployer Plan. Neither the Company nor any member of the
Controlled Group has failed to make a required installment or any other required
payment under Section 412 of the Code on or before the due date for such
installment or other payment. Neither the Company nor any member of the
Controlled Group is required to provide security of a material amount to a
Benefit Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code due to a Plan amendment
that results in an increase in current liability for the plan year. Except as
set forth on Exhibit 6.8(b), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
maintains or contributes to any employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning
of Section 3(1) of ERISA or any other arrangement which provides benefits to one
or more employees, officers, directors, or consultants after termination of
employment other than as required by Section 601 of ERISA or Section 4980(B) of
the Code or applicable law and other than any such plan or arrangement with
respect to which the Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any liability of a
material amount. Each Plan is designed to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code as currently in effect, and each trust related to any such Plan is
designed to be exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the Code
as currently in effect. With respect to each Plan, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries, the ESOP Fiduciary and, to the best knowledge of the Company, the
ESOT Trustee


                                      -11-
<PAGE>

are in compliance in all material respects with the responsibilities,
obligations and duties, if any, imposed on them by ERISA and the Code. Each Plan
and Non-ERISA Commitment complies in all material respects in form, and has been
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and, in
accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited
to ERISA and the Code. There is no material action, suit or claim pending or
threatened with respect to any Plan other than routine claims for benefits.
There have been no and there is no non-exempt prohibited transaction described
in Sections 406 of ERISA or 4975 of the Code which could reasonably be expected
to subject the Company to material liability. Neither the Company nor any member
of the Controlled Group has taken or failed to take any action which would
constitute or result in a Termination Event, which action or inaction could
reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
liability, individually or in the aggregate, in excess of $1,500,000. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary is subject to any material liability under, or to
the best of Company's knowledge, has any potential material liability under,
Sections 4063, 4064, 4069, 4204 or 4212(c) of ERISA and no other member of the
Controlled Group is subject to any liability under Sections 4063, 4064, 4069,
4204 or 4212(c) of ERISA. Except as set forth on Exhibit 6.8(c), neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has, by reason of the ESOT Transaction or
any other transaction contemplated hereby, any obligation to make any payment to
any current or former employee, director, officer or consultant pursuant to any
Plan or Non-ERISA Commitment or any obligation to make any such payment at a
time earlier than when it would be otherwise payable except for any payment to
be made upon termination of employment. For purposes of this section 6.8(b),
"material" means any amount, noncompliance or basis for liability which could
reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
liability, individually or in the aggregate, in excess of $1,500,000.

        6.9 ACCURACY OF INFORMATION. The information, exhibits and reports (i)
prepared by the Company and (ii) prepared by any other Person, in each case,
furnished by or on behalf of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to the
holders in connection with the negotiation of, or compliance with, this
Agreement and the other Operative Documents, the representations and warranties
of the Company and its Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement and the other
Operative Documents, and all certificates and documents delivered to the holders
pursuant to the terms thereof, taken as a whole, do not contain, and with
respect to the information, exhibits and reports identified in clause (ii)
above, to the best of the Company's knowledge do not contain, as of the date
furnished any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

        6.10 SECURITIES ACTIVITIES. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is engaged in the business of extending credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying Margin Stock. Margin Stock constitutes less than 25% of
the value of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

        6.11 MATERIAL AGREEMENTS. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any Contractual Obligation or subject to any charter
or other corporate restriction which individually or in the aggregate has had or
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set
forth in Exhibit 6.11, neither the Company nor any of its


                                      -12-
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries has received notice or has knowledge that (a) it is in default in
the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants
or conditions contained in any Contractual Obligation applicable to it, or (b)
any condition exists which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default with respect to any such Contractual
Obligation, in each case, except where such default or defaults, if any,
individually or in the aggregate will not have or could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        6.12 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all Requirements of Law applicable to them and their respective
businesses, in each case where the failure to so comply individually or in the
aggregate could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        6.13 ASSETS AND PROPERTIES. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
good and marketable title to all of its assets and properties (tangible and
intangible, real or personal) owned by it and a valid leasehold interest in all
of its leased assets (except insofar as marketability may be limited by any laws
or regulations of any Governmental Authority affecting such assets), and all
such assets and property are free and clear of all Liens, except Liens permitted
under section 10.3(c) of this Agreement. Substantially all of the assets and
properties owned by, leased to or used by the Company and/or each such
Subsidiary of the Company are in adequate operating condition and repair,
ordinary wear and tear excepted. Neither this Agreement, the other Operative
Documents nor any other Transaction Document, nor any transaction contemplated
under any such agreement, will affect any right, title or interest of the
Company or such Subsidiary in and to any of such assets in a manner that would
have or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        6.14 STATUTORY INDEBTEDNESS RESTRICTIONS. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is subject to regulation under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, or the
Investment Company Act of 1940, or any other foreign, federal or state statute
or regulation which limits its ability to incur indebtedness or its ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

        6.15 INSURANCE. Exhibit 6.15 attached hereto accurately sets forth as of
the Closing Date all insurance policies and programs currently in effect with
respect to the respective properties and assets and business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, specifying, for each such policy and program, (a) the amount
thereof, (b) the risks insured against thereby, (c) the name of the insurer and
each insured party thereunder, (d) the policy or other identification number
thereof, (e) the expiration date thereof, and (f) any reserves relating to any
self-insurance program that is in effect. Such insurance policies and programs
reflect coverage that is reasonably consistent with prudent industry practice,
and shall include, without limitation, property and liability (and, if
appropriate, business interruption) insurance.

and is a validly existing trust and has all the requisite powers and authority
to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents which have been or are to be
executed by it and to perform its obligations under and the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents. The execution and delivery by the

necessary actions of it and such executions and deliveries and the performance
by it of its obligations under and the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents do not contravene any provision of law and the Transaction
Documents which have been or are to be executed by it are legal, valid and
binding obligations of it enforceable against it in accordance with the terms
thereof, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, or moratorium or other similar laws relating to the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles
other than general equitable principles as may be applicable to any non-exempt
prohibited transactions described in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code. Each of such Transaction Documents is in full force and effect and no term
or condition thereof has been amended, modified or waived from the terms and
conditions contained in the Transaction Documents delivered to the holders
pursuant to Section 5.3 of this Agreement without the consent of the Required
Holders (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except to the extent
such amendment, modification or waiver could not reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect upon the holders or otherwise have a Material Adverse
Effect (true and correct copies of which have been provided to you on or prior
to the Closing). The ESOT has performed and complied with all the material
terms, provisions, agreements and conditions set forth therein and required to
be performed or complied with by the ESOT, and no unmatured default, default or
breach of any covenant by any such party exists thereunder.

                (b) No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of
each of the Transaction Documents to which the ESOT is a party do not (i)
conflict with the ESOP Plan Documents, (ii) conflict with any Requirement of

constitute, for any purpose of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, assets of the
ESOP or any other "plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code.

                (d) No Prohibited Transaction. No non-exempt prohibited
transaction described in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code has
occurred with respect to the ESOP, and neither issuance of the Notes pursuant to
this Agreement, the issuance of the Seller Notes, the loans under the Bank
Credit Agreement nor the ESOT Transaction constitute or give rise to any such
non-exempt prohibited transaction.


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

                (e) Qualification. The ESOP is qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code, and the ESOP is an employee stock ownership plan as defined in Section
4975(e)(7) of the Code.

                (f) ESOP Documents. The Company has provided each holder of
Notes a complete and accurate copy of the ESOP Plan Documents pursuant to which
the ESOP and ESOT are maintained by the Company, or which concern the Company's
obligations with respect to the ESOP and ESOT, as of the Closing Date and the
ESOT Transaction Documents as in effect on the Closing Date and the ESOP Plan
Documents and the ESOT Transaction Documents are in full force and effect and
have not been amended or modified.

                (g) Exempt Transaction. To the Company's knowledge, neither the
issuance of the Notes or the Seller Notes is for any purpose of Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code a direct or indirect loan or other transaction
between any holder of Notes or Seller Notes and the ESOT which, if it is assumed
that any holder is a "party in interest" and a "disqualified person" (as defined
in Section 3(14) of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code), is a non-exempt
prohibited transaction described in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code.

                (h) No Taxable Event. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is or shall be subject to the tax imposed by Section 4978 of the
Code with respect to any "disposition" by the ESOT of any shares of Capital
Stock of the Company.

                (i) No Investigations. To the Company's knowledge, there is no
investigation or review by any Governmental Agency, or action, suit, proceeding
or arbitration, pending or concluded, concerning any matter with respect to the
ESOP or ESOT relevant as to whether any representation set forth at section
6.5(c) or this section 6.20 was, or has or will at anytime become, inaccurate or
breached or, if were to be made at any time prior to the satisfaction of all
obligations under this Agreement and the other Operative Documents, would be
inaccurate when made (other than in respect of (A) periodic requests to the IRS
to issue a favorable determination letter to the effect that the ESOP is and
continues to be a qualified plan and employee stock ownership plan and (B)
Annual Reports (IRS Form 5500 Series) for the ESOP, and neither the ESOP
Fiduciary nor, to the best knowledge of the Company, the ESOT Trustee, has made
any assertion with respect to the ESOP or ESOT contrary to or inconsistent with
the accuracy of any such representation which assertion could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

7.      USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the loans made on the Closing Date
under the Bank Credit Agreement will be used by the Company to pay certain fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the IITRI Acquisition, this Agreement

                (a) Within five Business Days following the date upon which an
Authorized Officer of the Company first has knowledge that a Change of Control
has occurred or executes a definitive written agreement with respect to an
impending Change of Control, the Company shall give written notice of such
Change of Control (a "Change of Control Notice") to each holder of a Note, which
Change of Control Notice shall (i) describe the facts and circumstances of such
Change of Control in reasonable detail, (ii) refer to this section 8.3 and the

such Change of Control, the entire unpaid principal amount of the Notes held by
such holder, together with interest thereon to the prepayment date and, together
with the Change of Control Premium with respect to each Note prepaid (showing in
such offer the amount of interest which would be paid on such prepayment date

<PAGE>

Response Date specified in the Change of Control Notice of such holder's
acceptance of the prepayment offer contained therein, then the holder shall be
deemed to have accepted such offer. On the date that the Change of Control
Premium, if any, can be calculated, the Company shall notify each holder which
has not rejected such prepayment offer by facsimile of the Change of Control
Premium payable to such holder on the prepayment date, showing the Company's
computation thereof in reasonable detail.

Notice, the entire unpaid principal amount of the Notes held by each holder of a
Note who has accepted such prepayment offer, together with accrued and unpaid
interest thereon to the prepayment date and together with the Change of Control
Premium with respect to each such Note, shall become due and payable. Upon such
payment by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this section 8.3(b),
each such holder shall surrender the Notes held by it to the Company for
cancellation and the Notes shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding and
interest shall cease to accrue thereon.

                (c) The Company will promptly provide any holder of a Note with
all information in the possession of the Company or any Subsidiary which such
holder may reasonably request in order to enable such holder to evaluate the
effect of a Change of Control on such holder's investment in the Notes.

of any holders of the Notes to require prepayment of the Notes must be exercised
by the Response Date.

successive Changes of Control until the Notes are paid in full and no failure on
the part of any holder to exercise any right under this section 8.3 arising on
account of such Change of Control shall affect or impair any right of any holder
of Securities under this Agreement or any of the other Operative Documents
whether upon the occurrence of any other or any subsequent Change of Control or
otherwise.

        8.4 ALLOCATION OF PARTIAL PREPAYMENTS OF NOTES. In the case of each
partial prepayment of the Notes under section 8.1 and 8.2, the principal amount
to be prepaid shall be allocated among all of the Notes at the time outstanding
(excluding any Notes at the time owned by the Company or any of its Affiliates)
in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal
amounts thereof, with adjustments, to the extent practicable, to compensate for
any prior prepayments not made exactly in such proportion.

        8.5 NOTICE OF OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS OF NOTES. In the case of each
prepayment under sections 8.1 and 8.2, the Company shall give written notice
thereof to each holder of any Notes not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior
to the date fixed for such prepayment. Each such notice shall set forth: (a) the
date fixed for prepayment; (b) the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be
prepaid on such date; (c) the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by such
holder to be prepaid on such date; and (d) the amount of the accrued interest
and premium, if any, to be paid to such holder on such date (together with the
calculation of such premium, which calculation shall be satisfactory to each
holder of the Notes to be so prepaid).

<PAGE>

        8.6 MATURITY; ACCRUED INTEREST; SURRENDER, ETC. OF NOTES. In the case of
each prepayment of all or any part of any Note, the principal amount to be
prepaid shall mature and become due and payable on the date fixed for such
prepayment, together with interest on such principal amount accrued to such date
and the premium, if any, due thereon. Any Note prepaid in full shall be marked
"paid in full", surrendered to the Company at the Company's principal place of
business promptly following prepayment and canceled and shall not be reissued,

        8.7 PURCHASE OF NOTES. The Company will not, and will not permit any of
its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, purchase or otherwise acquire, or
offer to purchase or otherwise acquire, any outstanding Notes except by way of
payment or prepayment in accordance with the provisions of the Notes and this
Agreement.

        8.8 PAYMENT ON NON-BUSINESS DAYS. If any amount hereunder or under the
Notes shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall
be due on the next succeeding Business Day.

anything contained herein to the contrary, payments on the Notes and the
Subsidiary Guarantees (if any), and the rights of the holders of the Notes and
the Subsidiary Guarantees (if any), are subordinated to payments on, and the
rights of the holders of, Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the Subordination
Agreement set forth in clause (a) of the definition thereof), all as further
provided in such Subordination Agreement. To the extent the Company is not a
party to a Subordination Agreement, you agree to use reasonable efforts to

the failure to provide such copy shall not result in any liability to any holder
or otherwise effect the obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary under this
Agreement or the other Operative Documents.

                Indebtedness permitted by section 10.3(a) in connection
                therewith, on a pro forma basis using historical audited or
                reviewed unaudited financial statements obtained from the

                Acquisition and such incurrence of Indebtedness had occurred on
                the first day of the twelve-month period ending on the last day
                of the Company's most recently completed fiscal quarter, the
                Company would have been in compliance with the financial
                covenants in section 10.4 and not otherwise in Default.

interests) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in either case which is
not a Subsidiary of the Company, on terms that are less favorable to the Company

liquidate, wind-up or dissolve (or suffer any liquidation or dissolution), or
convey, lease, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, in one transaction or
series of transactions, all or substantially all of the Company's consolidated
business or property (each such transaction a "Fundamental Change"), whether now
or hereafter acquired, except (i) Fundamental Changes permitted under sections
10.3(b), 10.3(d) or 10.3(g), (ii) a Subsidiary of the Company may be merged into
or consolidated with the Company (in which case the Company shall be the
surviving corporation) or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company provided
the Company owns, directly or indirectly, a percentage of the equity of the
merged entity not less than the percentage it owned of the Subsidiary prior to
such Fundamental Change and if the predecessor Subsidiary was a Subsidiary
Guarantor, the surviving Subsidiary shall be a Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder,
(iii) any liquidation of any Subsidiary of the Company, into the Company or
another Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, and (iv) upon not less than
thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the holders of the Notes, any merger
or reincorporation of the Company or any Subsidiary solely for purposes of
reincorporation in a different jurisdiction.

involved is not prohibited under section 10.3(b) and the lease involved is not
prohibited under section 10.3(a) and any related Investment is not prohibited
under section 10.3(d).

                        in any material liability of the Company or any
                        Controlled Group member under Title IV of ERISA;

                                (E) fail to make any material contribution or
                        payment to any Multiemployer Plan which the Company or

                        installment or any other payment required under Section
                        412 of the Code on or before the due date for such
                        installment or other payment; or

                        that the Company or any Controlled Group member is
                        required to provide security to such Benefit Plan under

                means any noncompliance or basis for liability which could
                reasonably be likely to subject the Company or any of its

Notes, without the prior written consent of the Required Holders.

                (n) Fiscal Year. Neither the Company nor any of its consolidated

Documents and this Agreement, the Company will not, and will not permit any
Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause to become effective or suffer to exist
any consensual encumbrance (other than Permitted Liens) or restriction of any

distribution on its stock, or make any other Restricted Payment, pay any
Indebtedness or other obligation owed to the Company or any other Subsidiary,

standing or (ii) the sale of Equity Interests by or the merger of the Company,
the proceeds of which are used to prepay the principal, interest, premium, fees
and expenses on the


                                      -39-

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in an amount in excess of $1,500,000.

                (u) ESOP Conflict. The Company shall not permit the performance
of any of the Transaction Documents to which the ESOT is a party to conflict

with or by any Governmental Authority other than (i) filings that are made
regarding the status of the Company as an "S Corporation" as such term is
defined in Section 1361 of the Code, which filings shall have been made on or
prior to the Closing Date, (ii) filings as required by section 10.2(m) and

                (v) Assets as Plan Assets. The Company shall not permit any of
the assets of the Company to constitute, for any purpose of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code, assets of the ESOP or any other "plan" as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

                (w) Prohibited Transaction. The Company shall not permit any
material non-exempt prohibited transaction described in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code to occur with respect to the ESOP.

                (x) Non-Qualification of ESOP. The Company shall not take any
action, nor fail to take any action, the result of which action or inaction is
that the ESOP shall fail to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. The
Company shall not permit the ESOP to fail to be an employee stock ownership plan
as defined in Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code.

                (y) Excise Tax. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be

                (z) holder/ESOT Transactions. No deemed proceeds hereunder shall
for any purpose of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code be a direct
or indirect loan or other transaction between any holder and the ESOT which, if
it is assumed that the holders of Notes are "parties in interest" and
"disqualified persons" (as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA and Section 4975 of
the Code), is a non-exempt prohibited transaction described in Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

                (aa) ERISA Judgments and Determinations. There shall be no
finding, holding, ruling or other determination not subject to cure made by any
court or Governmental


                                      -40-
<PAGE>

Authority, and there shall be no assertion by the ESOP Fiduciary, or, to the
best knowledge of the Company, the ESOT Trustee, concerning any matter with
respect to the ESOP or ESOT contrary to or inconsistent with any covenant set
forth in section 10.3(s) through (z) which assertion could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                (bb) Junior Subordinated Indebtedness. The Company shall not and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to amend, supplement or modify the
terms of the Junior Subordinated Notes, or make any payment required as a result
of an amendment or change thereto, other than amendments, supplements or

of the Company that is not a Material Subsidiary and for which a waiver of any
Event of Default (or similar term within the meaning of the Bank Credit
Agreement) arising from the foregoing events has been granted to the Company by
the requisite percentage of Bank Lenders pursuant to the Bank Credit Agreement
prior to taking any of the foregoing actions; or

                (h) if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall fail to (i)

                (k) if, at any time, this Agreement or any of the other
Operative Documents shall for any reason (other than the scheduled termination
thereof in accordance with its terms) expire, fail to be in full force and
effect or be disaffirmed, repudiated, canceled, terminated or declared to be
unenforceable, null and void; or

                (l) if (i) any Plan shall fail to satisfy the minimum funding

shall have been or is reasonably expected to be filed with the PBGC or the PBGC
shall have instituted proceedings under section 4042 of ERISA to terminate or

then, in the case of any Event of Default (other than one of the character
described in subdivisions (e), (f) or (g) of this section 12.1 with respect to
the Company or any Material Subsidiary) and at the option of the Required
Holders of the Notes at the time outstanding


                                      -68-
<PAGE>

(excluding any Notes at the time owned by any of the Company or any of its
Affiliates), exercised by written notice to the Company, the principal of all
Notes shall forthwith become due and payable, together with interest accrued
thereon, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all
of which are hereby expressly waived, and the Company shall forthwith upon any
such acceleration pay to the holder or holders of all the Notes then outstanding
(i) the entire principal of and interest accrued on the Notes, and (ii) in
addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, an amount equal to the
premium that would be payable upon a prepayment of the Notes pursuant to section
8.1 at such time, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty; provided that, in
the case of an Event of Default of the character described in subdivisions (a)
or (b) of this section 12.1 and irrespective of whether all of the Notes have
been declared due and payable by the Required Holders of the Notes at the time
outstanding, any holder of Notes who or which has not consented to any waiver
with respect to such Event of Default may, at the option of such holder, by
written notice to the Company, declare all Notes then held by such holder to be,
and such Notes shall thereupon become, forthwith due and payable, together with
interest accrued thereon, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice
of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived, and the Company shall
forthwith upon any such acceleration pay to such holder (i) the entire principal
of and interest accrued on such Notes, and (ii) in addition, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, an amount equal to the premium that would be
payable upon a prepayment of the Notes pursuant to section 8.1 at such time, as
liquidated damages and not as a penalty; provided, further, that, in the case of
an Event of Default of the character described in subdivisions (e), (f) or (g)
of this section 12.1 with respect to the Company or any Material Subsidiary, the
principal of all Notes shall forthwith become due and payable, together with
interest accrued thereon (including any interest accruing after the commencement
of any action or proceeding under the federal bankruptcy laws, as now or
hereafter constituted, or any other applicable domestic or foreign federal or
state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, and any other interest that
would have accrued but for the commencement of such proceeding, whether or not
any such interest is allowed as an enforceable claim in such proceeding),
without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which
are hereby expressly waived, and the Company shall forthwith upon any such
acceleration pay to the holder or holders of all the Notes then outstanding (i)
the entire principal of and interest accrued on the Notes, and (ii) in addition,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, an amount equal to the premium that
would be payable upon a prepayment of the Notes pursuant to section 8.1 at such
time, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty.

                Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, at any time after the
occurrence of any Event of Default and of notice thereof, if any, by any holder
or holders of Notes and before any judgment, decree or order for payment of the
money due has been obtained by or on behalf of any holder or holders of the
Notes, the Required Holders of the Notes by written notice to the Company, may
rescind and annul such Event of Default and/or notice of such Event of Default
and the consequences thereof with respect to all of the Notes (including any
Notes which were accelerated pursuant to the first proviso in the preceding
paragraph by any holder or holders on account of an Event of Default of the
character described in subdivision (a) or (b) of this section 12.1) if:

                (1) the Company has paid a sum sufficient to pay


                                      -69-
<PAGE>

                        (A) all overdue installments of interest on all Notes at
                the rate specified in the Notes;

                        (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Notes
                which have become due otherwise than by such Event of Default or
                notice thereof and interest thereon at the rate for overdue
                amounts specified in such Notes; and

                        (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is
                lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate for overdue
                amounts specified in such Notes; and

                (2) all Defaults and Events of Default, other than the
                non-payment of the principal of Notes which have become due
                solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as
                provided in section 12. No such rescission shall affect any
                subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

        12.2 SUITS FOR ENFORCEMENT, ETC. In case any one or more of the Events
of Default specified in section 12.1 shall have occurred, and irrespective of
whether any Notes have become or have been declared immediately due and payable
under section 12.1, the holder of any Note may proceed to protect and enforce
its rights either by suit in equity or by action at law, or both. The Company
stipulates that the remedies at law of the holder or holders of the Securities
in the event of any default or threatened default by the Company in the
performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or
any of the other Operative Documents are not and will not be adequate and that,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, such terms may be specifically enforced
by a decree for the specific performance thereof, whether by an injunction
against a violation thereof or otherwise.

        12.3 NO ELECTION OF REMEDIES. No remedy conferred in this Agreement or
in any of the other Operative Documents upon the holder of any Security is
intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every such remedy
shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given
hereunder or thereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by
statute or otherwise.

        12.4 REMEDIES NOT WAIVED. No course of dealing between the Company
and/or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any holder of any Security,
on the other hand, and no delay by any such holder in exercising any rights
hereunder or under any of the other Operative Documents shall operate as a
waiver of any rights of any such holder.

        12.5 APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. In case any one or more of the Events of
Default specified in section 12.1 shall have occurred, all amounts to be applied
to the prepayment or payment of any Notes, shall be applied, after the payment
of all related costs and expenses incurred by the holders of the Notes
(including, without limitation, compensation to any and all trustees,
liquidators, receivers or similar officials and reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of counsel) first to premium, if any, then to interest and then to
the principal amount.

13.     REGISTRATION, TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES. Securities issued
hereunder shall be issued in registered form. The Company shall keep at its
principal executive office (which is


                                      -70-
<PAGE>

now located at the address set forth at the beginning of this Agreement),
registers in which it shall provide for the registration and transfer of the
Securities. The name and address of each holder of the Securities shall be
registered in such registers. The Company shall give to any institutional holder
of any Security promptly (but in any event within 10 days) following request
therefor, a complete and correct copy of the names and addresses of all
registered holders of the Securities issued by it and the amount and kind of
Securities held by each. Whenever any Security or Securities shall be
surrendered for transfer or exchange, the Company(ies) that issued such
Security, at its expense, will execute and deliver in exchange therefor a new
Security or Securities (in such denominations and registered in such name or
names as may be requested by the holder of the surrendered Security or
Securities), in the same aggregate unpaid principal amount (in the case of the
Notes) or exercisable for the same aggregate number of Shares (in the case of
any Warrants) or in the same aggregate number of Shares (in the case of any
Warrant Share), as applicable, as that of the Security or Securities so
surrendered. Each such new Note shall be dated and bear interest from the date
to which interest shall have been paid on the surrendered Note or dated the date
of the surrendered Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon. The Company
may treat the Person in whose name any Security is registered as the owner of
such Security for all purposes.

14.     REPLACEMENT OF SECURITIES. Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of the
loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Security and (in the case of loss,
theft or destruction) of satisfactory indemnity, and (in the case of mutilation)
upon surrender of such Security, the Company(ies) that issued such Security at
its (or their) expense, will execute and deliver in lieu of such Security a new
Security of like tenor and, in the case of any new Note, dated so as not to
result in any loss of interest. Your unsecured agreement to indemnify and/or
affidavit and that of any other institutional holder shall constitute
satisfactory indemnity and/or satisfactory evidence of loss, theft or
destruction for the purpose of this section 14.

15.     APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS. As provided in the Rights Agreement and
subject to the terms thereof, (a) the Required Holders of the Notes shall have
the right to nominate one member of the board of directors of the Company,
provided that such nominee satisfies the eligibility criteria for board members
of the Company (as in effect on the Closing Date) and provided further that the
Company's board of directors shall consist of no more than twelve members, (b)
the ESOT trustee shall vote the ESOP's shares in favor of such nominee, subject
to the trustee's fiduciary obligations, and (c) the right granted under the
Rights Agreement with respect to the nomination of one member of the board of
directors shall exist until the earlier of (i) repayment in full of the Notes or
(ii) a Qualified IPO.

16.     AMENDMENT AND WAIVER.

                (a) Any term of this Agreement and, unless explicitly provided
otherwise therein, of any of the other Operative Documents may, with the consent
of the Company, be amended, or compliance therewith may be waived, in writing
only, by the Required Holders of each class of Securities entitled to the
benefits of such term, provided that (i) without the consent of the holders of
all of the Notes at the time outstanding, no such amendment or waiver shall (A)
change the amount of the principal of or any rate of interest on or the amount
of any premium payable with respect to any of the Notes or change the payment
terms of any of the


                                      -71-
<PAGE>

Notes, or, except as provided in the Notes (and the Note Guarantees),
subordinate the obligation of the Company (or any Subsidiary Guarantor) to pay
any amount due on the Notes (or on the Note Guarantees) to any other obligation,
or (B) change the percentage of holders of Notes required to approve any such
amendment, effectuate any such waiver or accelerate payment of the Notes.
Executed or true and correct copies of any amendment, waiver or consent effected
pursuant to this section 16 shall be delivered by the Company to each holder of
Securities forthwith (but in any event not later than five days) following the
effective date thereof.

                (b) The Company will not, directly or indirectly, request or
negotiate for, or offer or pay any remuneration or grant any security as an
inducement for, any proposed amendment or waiver of any of the provisions of
this Agreement or any of the other Operative Documents unless each holder of the
Securities (irrespective of the kind and amount of Securities then owned by it)
shall be informed thereof by the Company and, if such holder is entitled to the
benefit of any such provision proposed to be amended or waived, shall be
afforded the opportunity of considering the same, shall be supplied by the
Company with sufficient information to enable it to make an informed decision
with respect thereto and, if such offer is accepted by such holder, shall be
offered and paid such remuneration and granted such security on the same terms.

                (c) In determining whether the requisite holders of Securities
have given any authorization, consent or waiver under this section 16, any
Securities owned by the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

17.     METHOD OF PAYMENT OF SECURITIES. Irrespective of any provision hereof or
of the other Operative Documents to the contrary, so long as you or any other
institutional holder shall hold any Security, all payments due on such Security
shall be made to you or such other institutional holder by the method and at the
address for such purpose specified in Schedule I attached hereto or by such
other method or at such other address as you or such institutional holder may
designate in writing (given as provided in section 20), without requiring any
presentation or surrender of such Security, except that if any Security shall be
paid, prepaid and/or repurchased in full, such Security shall be surrendered to
the Company(ies) that issued such Security promptly following such payment,
prepayment or repurchase and canceled.

18.     EXPENSES; INDEMNITY. The Company will (without duplication as to any
holder), jointly and severally, pay or cause to be paid (or reimbursed, as the
case may be) and will defend, indemnify and hold you (and each other holder of
any of the Securities) and each of your (and such other holder's) directors,
officers, employees, agents, advisors and Affiliates (each, an "Indemnitee")
harmless in respect of all reasonable costs, losses, expenses (including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees, costs, expenses and disbursements of
counsel) and damages (collectively, "Indemnified Costs") incurred by or asserted
against any Indemnitee in connection with the negotiation, execution, delivery,
performance and/or enforcement of this Agreement or any of the other Operative
Documents (including, without limitation, so-called work-outs and/or
restructurings and all amendments, waivers and consents hereunder and
thereunder, whether or not effected) and/or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby or which may otherwise be related in any way to
this Agreement or any other Operative Documents or such transactions or such
Indemnitee's relationship to the Company or any of their respective


                                      -72-
<PAGE>

Affiliates or any of their respective properties and assets arose solely and
directly as a result of the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of
such Indemnitee.

19.     TAXES. The Company will pay all taxes and fees (including interest and
penalties), including, without limitation, all issuance and documentary stamp
and similar taxes, which may be payable in respect of the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and each of the other Operative Documents.

facsimile to the party to be notified, at the address indicated for such party

24.     ASSIGNMENT; RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER.

        24.1 RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER. Subject to the provisions of this section 24,
the Notes may not be assigned to any Person that (so long as no Event of Default
described in any of Sections 11.1(a), (b), (e), (f), or (g) has occurred) is
either (a) a Competitor (provided that this limitation shall be waived with
respect to a proposed transferee if the Company determines in its reasonable
discretion that such proposed transferee does not then compete with the Company
or any entity controlled by the Company) or (b) is not a U.S. Qualified Person
at the time of assignment. In other cases, the Company shall have a right of
first offer on such assignment as follows:

                (a) First Offer.

                        (i) If the holder proposes to sell or otherwise transfer
                the Notes or any portion thereof it holds at such time
                (collectively, the "Transfer Interests") to any third party
                other than an Affiliate of such holder (other than a sale or
                transfer in connection with a Demand Registration or Piggy-Back
                Registration under the Rights Agreement), the holder is required
                to first notify the Company, by delivering to the Company a
                written notice ("Sale Notice") in accordance with section 20,
                stating the holder's bona fide intention to sell or otherwise
                transfer the Transfer Interests. The Company shall have the
                exclusive right, for a period of thirty (30) days from its
                receipt of the Sale Notice, to make an offer to purchase the
                Transfer Interests at a price to be proposed by the Company.

                        (ii) Subject to Section 24.1(c) below, if either (x) the
                Company does not deliver to the holder written notice of an
                offer to purchase the Transfer Interests ("Purchase Notice")
                within thirty (30) days after the Company's receipt of the Sale
                Notice, or (y) the holder has rejected the Company's offer, the
                holder shall be entitled to sell the Transfer Interests at a
                price which is no less than ninety percent (90%) of the last
                price offered by the Company for the Transfer Interests (the
                "Last Offer Price"), to any third party that is not an Affiliate
                of the holder at any time during the period of nine (9) months
                following the date of delivery of the Sale Notice by the holder
                to the Company, without the obligation to provide any further
                offers or notices to the Company.

                (b) Second Offer.


                                      -76-
<PAGE>

                        (i) If the holder proposes to sell or otherwise transfer
                the Transfer Interests to a third party that is not an Affiliate
                of the holder at a price that is less than ninety percent (90%)
                of the Last Offer Price (the "Proposed Sale Price"), the holder
                shall, prior to consummating such sale or transfer of the
                Transfer Interests to the third party, make an offer to the
                Company in writing and in accordance with Section 20 (the
                "Second Sale Notice"), to sell the Transfer Interests to the
                Company at the Proposed Sale Price.

                        (ii) Subject to Section 24.1(c) below, if the Company
                does not deliver to the holder written notice of acceptance of
                any offer made pursuant to Section 24.1(b)(i) within thirty (30)
                days after the Company's receipt of the Second Sale Notice, the
                Company shall be deemed to have waived its rights to purchase
                the Transfer Interests, and the holder shall be entitled to sell
                or otherwise transfer the Transfer Interests at the Proposed
                Sale Price to such unrelated third party within nine (9) months
                following the date of delivery of the Sale Notice, without the
                obligation to provide any further offers or notices to the
                Company.

                (c) If the holder proposes to sell or otherwise transfer the
Transfer Interests to a third party that is not an Affiliate of the holder at
any time after the expiry of the nine-month period referenced in Section
24.1(a)(ii) or Section 24.1(b)(ii), as the case may be, then the holder shall
again be required to comply with all the obligations and requirements contained
in Sections 24.1(a) and 24.1(b).

                (d) Payment of the Purchase Price shall be made in cash in
immediately available funds within sixty (60) days after the date (if any) that
a purchase price is agreed for the Company's purchase of the Transfer Interests.

        24.2 MINIMUM AMOUNT. The Notes may be assigned in minimum amounts of
$2,500,000 and in increments of $500,000 in excess thereof, provided that the
Holder may assign the Notes in a smaller minimum amount in connection with the
transfer of all of the remaining Notes of such Holder.

        24.3 COMPANY PRO RATA OFFER TO PURCHASE.

                (a) Notwithstanding any provision in this section 24 to the
contrary, if the Company proposes to purchase any portion of the Notes of any
Holder (the "Selling Holder") pursuant to section 24.1(a) or (b), the Company
shall provide to each holder of Notes, at least 20 days prior to the closing of
such sale, written notice, in accordance with section 20 herein, of its
intention to purchase Notes from the Selling Holder, the aggregate principal
amount of Notes proposed to be purchased from the Selling Holder, the price and
other material terms under which the sale is proposed to be made and that the
holder is entitled to sell a certain principal amount of the Notes then held by
the holder to the Company on the terms and conditions contained therein (the
"First Offer Notice").

                (b) Upon receipt of the First Offer Notice, the holder shall
have the right, exercisable upon written notice in accordance with section 20
herein to the Company (which shall provide such notice to the Selling Holder),
sent within twenty (20) days after the holder's


                                      -77-
<PAGE>

receipt of the First Offer Notice (the "Participation Notice"), to sell to the
Company an aggregate principal amount of Notes then held by the holder in an
amount no greater than:

                      A X B
                          --
                          C

where: A = the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be sold by the Selling
           Holder to the Company (the "First Offer Notes");

where: B = the aggregate principal amount of Notes then held by the holder;

where: C = the total aggregate principal of Notes then outstanding.

Any Notes sold to the Company by the holder pursuant to this section 24.3 shall
be sold at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as specified in
the First Offer Notice or any modification thereof, but in no event less
favorable than the terms and conditions of Notes sold by the Selling Holder. The
Participation Notice shall be deemed given and served on the date the Company
receives the Participation Notice. Any prepayment of Notes in accordance with
this section 24.3 shall not be subject to any Applicable Premium pursuant to
Section 8.1; provided that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to otherwise
permit the Company to initiate any discussion with respect to, or solicit, any
purchase of the Notes of any holder except in compliance with the terms of
section 8 (including, without limitation, payment of any Applicable Premium).

                (c) The Selling Holder and the Company agree that the aggregate
principal amount of First Offer Notes that the Selling Holder may sell to the
Company in the transaction will be reduced by the aggregate principal amount of
Notes necessary to permit the sale of Notes by the other holders pursuant to any
Participation Notice delivered in accordance with the provisions of section
24.3(b). The Company agrees it will not purchase and the Selling Holder agrees
that it shall not be entitled to sell to the Company any of the First Offer
Notes unless the Notes of each holder set forth in the Participation Notice are
simultaneously purchased by the Company.

                (d) If the transaction that is the subject of the First Offer
Notice delivered by the Company to the holder in accordance with section 24.3(a)
herein is terminated then the first Offer Notice and corresponding Participation
Noted shall be deemed voided.

The provisions of this section 24.3 are applicable to successive purchases of
Notes by the Company under section 24.3(a) and (b) until the Notes are paid in
full and no failure on the part of any holder to exercise any right under this
section 24.3 shall affect or impair any right of any holder of Notes under this
Agreement or any of the other Operative Documents whether upon the occurrence of
any other or any subsequent purchase by the Company or otherwise.

25.     GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. This Agreement and,
unless explicitly provided otherwise therein, each of the other Operative
Documents, including the validity hereof and thereof and the rights and
obligations of the parties hereunder and thereunder,


                                      -78-
<PAGE>

and all amendments and supplements hereof and thereof and all waivers and
consents hereunder and thereunder, shall be construed in accordance with and
governed by the domestic substantive laws of the State of Illinois without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflicts of law provision or rule that
would cause the application of the domestic substantive laws of any other
jurisdiction. The Company, to the extent that it may lawfully do so, hereby
consents to service of process, and to be sued, in the State of Illinois and
consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Illinois and the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, as well as
to the jurisdiction of all courts to which an appeal may be taken from such
courts, for the purpose of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of
any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder or with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and expressly waives any and all
objections it may have as to venue in any such courts. The Company further
agrees that a summons and complaint commencing an action or proceeding in any of
such courts shall be properly served and shall confer personal jurisdiction if
served personally or by certified mail to it at its address set forth in section
20 or as otherwise provided under the laws of the State of Illinois.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Company agrees that nothing contained
in this section 25 shall preclude the institution of any such suit, action or
other proceeding in any jurisdiction other than the State of Illinois. THE
COMPANY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR
OTHER PROCEEDING INSTITUTED BY OR AGAINST IT IN RESPECT OF ITS OBLIGATIONS
HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

26.     RULE 144A. The Company will take, or will cause to be taken, such action
as any holder of Securities may reasonably request from time to time to
facilitate any sale or disposition by any such holder of any Securities without
registration under the Securities Act and/or any applicable securities laws
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by any rule or regulation
thereunder, including, without limitation, Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

27.     MISCELLANEOUS. The headings in this Agreement and in each of the other
Operative Documents are for purposes of reference only and shall not limit or
otherwise affect the meaning hereof or thereof. This Agreement (together with
the other Operative Documents) embodies the entire agreement and understanding
between you and each of the Company and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings relating to the subject matter hereof. Each covenant contained
herein and in each of the other Operative Documents shall be construed (absent
an express provision to the contrary) as being independent of each other
covenant contained herein and therein, so that compliance with any one covenant
shall not (absent such an express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse
compliance with any other covenant. If any provision in this Agreement or in any
of the other Operative Documents refers to any action taken or to be taken by
any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall
be applicable, whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such
Person, whether or not expressly specified in such provision. In case any
provision in this Agreement or any of the other Operative Documents shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
This Agreement and, unless explicitly provided otherwise therein, each of the
other Operative Documents, may be executed in any number of counterparts and by
the parties hereto or thereto, as the case may be, on separate counterparts but
all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

represented by such holder's Notes), (ii) each holder's financial advisors and
other professional advisors who agree to hold confidential the Confidential
Information substantially in accordance with the terms of this Section 28, (iii)

legal process, (y) in connection with any litigation to which such holder is a
party or (z) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the
extent such holder may reasonably determine such delivery and disclosure to be

and remedies under its Notes and the other Operative Documents. Each holder, by
its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be
entitled to the benefits of this Section 28 as though it were a party to this
Agreement.
