                                                                    EXHIBIT 99.1

                        MORTGAGE LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENT

         THIS MORTGAGE LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is dated as of
February 11, 2003 between WACHOVIA BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (the "Seller") and
WACHOVIA COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIES, INC. (the "Purchaser").

         The Seller intends to sell and the Purchaser intends to purchase
certain multifamily and commercial mortgage loans (the "Mortgage Loans")
identified on the schedule (the "Mortgage Loan Schedule") annexed hereto as
Exhibit A. The Purchaser intends to deposit the Mortgage Loans, along with
certain other mortgage loans (the "Other Mortgage Loans"), into a trust fund
(the "Trust Fund"), the beneficial ownership of which will be evidenced by
multiple classes (each, a "Class") of mortgage pass-through certificates (the
"Certificates"). One or more "real estate mortgage investment conduit" ("REMIC")
elections will be made with respect to most of the Trust Fund. The Trust Fund
will be created and the Certificates will be issued pursuant to a Pooling and
Servicing Agreement (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), dated as of the
Cut-Off Date, among the Purchaser as depositor, Wachovia Bank, National
Association, as master servicer (in such capacity, the "Master Servicer"),
Lennar Partners, Inc., as special servicer (in such capacity, the "Special
Servicer"), and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee").
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the respective meanings set
forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

         Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:

         SECTION 1. Agreement to Purchase.

         The Seller agrees to sell, and the Purchaser agrees to purchase, the
Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule. The Mortgage Loan
Schedule may be amended to reflect the actual Mortgage Loans delivered to the
Purchaser pursuant to the terms hereof. The Mortgage Loans are expected to have
an aggregate principal balance of $523,454,245 (the "Wachovia Mortgage Loan
Balance") (subject to a variance of plus or minus 5.0%) as of the close of
business on the Cut-Off Date, after giving effect to any payments due on or
before such date, whether or not such payments are received. The Wachovia
Mortgage Loan Balance, together with the aggregate principal balance of the
Other Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-Off Date (after giving effect to any payments
due on or before such date whether or not such payments are received), is
expected to equal an aggregate principal balance (the "Cut-Off Date Pool
Balance") of $937,264,149 (subject to a variance of plus or minus 5.0%). The
purchase and sale of the Mortgage Loans shall take place on February 11, 2003 or
such other date as shall be mutually acceptable to the parties to this Agreement
(the "Closing Date"). The consideration (the "Aggregate Purchase Price") for the
Mortgage Loans shall be equal to (i) ______% of the Wachovia Mortgage Loan
Balance as of the Cut-Off Date, plus (ii) $954,640, which amount represents the
amount of interest accrued on the Wachovia Mortgage Loan Balance at the related
Net Mortgage Rate for the period from and including the Cut-Off Date up to but
not including the Closing Date.
<PAGE>
         The Aggregate Purchase Price shall be paid to the Seller or its
designee by wire transfer in immediately available funds on the Closing Date.

         SECTION 2. Conveyance of Mortgage Loans.

         (a)      Effective as of the Closing Date, subject only to receipt of
the Aggregate Purchase Price and satisfaction of the other conditions to closing
that are for the benefit of the Seller, the Seller does hereby sell, transfer,
assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Purchaser, without recourse (except
as set forth in this Agreement), all the right, title and interest of the Seller
in and to the Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule as of such
date, on a servicing released basis, together with all of the Seller's right,
title and interest in and to the proceeds of any related title, hazard, primary
mortgage or other insurance proceeds.

         (b)      The Purchaser or its assignee shall be entitled to receive all
scheduled payments of principal and interest due after the Cut-Off Date, and all
other recoveries of principal and interest collected after the Cut-Off Date
(other than in respect of principal and interest on the Mortgage Loans due on or
before the Cut-Off Date). All scheduled payments of principal and interest due
on or before the Cut-Off Date but collected after the Cut-Off Date, and
recoveries of principal and interest collected on or before the Cut-Off Date
(only in respect of principal and interest on the Mortgage Loans due on or
before the Cut-Off Date and principal prepayments thereon), shall belong to, and
shall be promptly remitted to, the Seller.

         (c)      No later than the Closing Date, the Seller shall, on behalf of
the Purchaser, deliver to the Trustee, the documents and instruments specified
below with respect to each Mortgage Loan (each a "Mortgage File"). All Mortgage
Files so delivered will be held by the Trustee in escrow at all times prior to
the Closing Date. Each Mortgage File shall contain the following documents:

         power of attorney related to the execution thereof, together with any

         office;

                  (iii)    an original or copy of any related Assignment of

         authorized representative of the title company) to issue such title
         insurance policy;

                  (viii)   any filed copies (bearing evidence of filing) or

         extent the Seller had possession of such UCC Financing Statements prior

<PAGE>
         copy of each mortgage note relating to such Companion Loan, rather than
         the original, shall be provided, and no assignments shall be provided.

         (d)      The Seller shall take all actions reasonably necessary (i) to
permit the Trustee to fulfill its obligations pursuant to Section 2.01(d) of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement and (ii) to perform its obligations described in

         SECTION 3. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Seller.

         (a)      The Seller hereby represents and warrants to and covenants
with the Purchaser, as of the date hereof, that:

                  (i)      The Seller is a national banking association
         organized and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
         the United States of America and possesses all requisite authority,
         power, licenses, permits and franchises to carry on its business as
         currently conducted by it and to execute, deliver and comply with its
         obligations under the terms of this Agreement;

                  (ii)     This Agreement has been duly and validly authorized,
         executed and delivered by the Seller and, assuming due authorization,
         execution and delivery hereof by the Purchaser, constitutes a legal,
         valid and binding obligation of the Seller, enforceable against the
         Seller in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be
         limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership,
         moratorium and other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
         rights in general and by general equity principles (regardless of
         whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
         law), and by public policy considerations underlying the securities
         laws, to the extent that such public policy considerations limit the
         enforceability of the provisions of this Agreement which purport to
         provide indemnification from liabilities under applicable securities
         laws;

                                       4
<PAGE>
                  (iii)    The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
         Seller and the Seller's performance and compliance with the terms of
         this Agreement will not (A) violate the Seller's articles of
         association or bylaws, (B) violate any law or regulation or any
         administrative decree or order to which it is subject or (C) constitute
         a material default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or
         both, would constitute a material default) under, or result in the
         breach of, any material contract, agreement or other instrument to
         which the Seller is a party or by which the Seller is bound;

                  (iv)     The Seller is not in default with respect to any
         order or decree of any court or any order, regulation or demand of any
         federal, state, municipal or other governmental agency or body, which
         default might have consequences that would, in the Seller's reasonable
         and good faith judgment, materially and adversely affect the condition
         (financial or other) or operations of the Seller or its properties or
         have consequences that would materially and adversely affect its
         performance hereunder;

                  (v)      The Seller is not a party to or bound by any
         agreement or instrument or subject to any articles of association,
         bylaws or any other corporate restriction or any judgment, order, writ,
         injunction, decree, law or regulation that would, in the Seller's
         reasonable and good faith judgment, materially and adversely affect the
         ability of the Seller to perform its obligations under this Agreement
         or that requires the consent of any third person to the execution of
         this Agreement or the performance by the Seller of its obligations
         under this Agreement (except to the extent such consent has been
         obtained);

                  (vi)     No consent, approval, authorization or order of any
         court or governmental agency or body is required for the execution,
         delivery and performance by the Seller of or compliance by the Seller
         with this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement except as have previously been obtained,
         and no bulk sale law applies to such transactions;

                  (vii)    No litigation is pending or, to the Seller's
         knowledge, threatened against the Seller that would, in the Seller's
         good faith and reasonable judgment, prohibit its entering into this
         Agreement or materially and adversely affect the performance by the
         Seller of its obligations under this Agreement; and

                  (viii)   Under generally accepted accounting principles
         ("GAAP") and for federal income tax purposes, the Seller will report
         the transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser as a sale of the
         Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser in exchange for consideration
         consisting of a cash amount equal to the Aggregate Purchase Price. The
         consideration received by the Seller upon the sale of the Mortgage
         Loans to the Purchaser will constitute at least reasonably equivalent
         value and fair consideration for the Mortgage Loans. The Seller will be
         solvent at all relevant times prior to, and will not be rendered
         insolvent by, the sale of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser. The
         Seller is not selling the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser with any
         intent to hinder, delay or defraud any of the creditors of the Seller.

         (b)      The Seller hereby makes the representations and warranties
contained in Schedule I and Schedule II hereto for the benefit of the Purchaser
and the Trustee for the benefit of the

                                       5
<PAGE>
Certificateholders as of the Closing Date, with respect to (and solely with
respect to) each Mortgage Loan, which representations and warranties are subject
to the exceptions set forth on Schedule III.

         (c)      If the Seller receives written notice of a Document Defect or
a Breach pursuant to Section 2.03(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
relating to a Mortgage Loan, then the Seller shall not later than 90 days from
receipt of such notice (or, in the case of a Document Defect or Breach relating
to a Mortgage Loan not being a "qualified mortgage" within the meaning of the
REMIC Provisions (a "Qualified Mortgage"), not later than 90 days from any party
to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement discovering such Document Defect or
Breach provided the Seller receives such notice in a timely manner), if such
Document Defect or Breach shall materially and adversely affect the value of the
applicable Mortgage Loan or the interests of the Certificateholders therein,
cure such Document Defect or Breach, as the case may be, in all material
respects, which shall include payment of actual or provable losses and any
Additional Trust Fund Expenses directly resulting therefrom or, if such Document
Defect or Breach (other than omissions solely due to a document not having been
returned by the related recording office) cannot be cured within such 90-day
period, (i) repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan at the applicable Purchase
Price not later than the end of such 90-day period or (ii) substitute a
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan for such affected Mortgage Loan not later
than the end of such 90-day period (and in no event later than the second
anniversary of the Closing Date) and pay the Master Servicer for deposit into
the Certificate Account, any Substitution Shortfall Amount in connection
therewith; provided, however, that unless the Breach would cause the Mortgage
Loan not to be a Qualified Mortgage, and if such Document Defect or Breach is
capable of being cured but not within such 90-day period and the Seller has
commenced and is diligently proceeding with the cure of such Document Defect or
Breach within such 90-day period, such Seller shall have an additional 90 days
to complete such cure (or, failing such cure, to repurchase or substitute the
related Mortgage Loan); and provided, further, that with respect to such
additional 90-day period the Seller shall have delivered an officer's
certificate to the Trustee setting forth what actions the Seller is pursuing in
connection with the cure thereof and stating that the Seller anticipates that
such Document Defect or Breach will be cured within the additional 90-day
period; and provided; further, that no Document Defect (other than with respect
to a Mortgage Note, Mortgage, title insurance policy, Ground Lease or any letter
of credit) shall be considered to materially and adversely affect the value of
the related Mortgage Loan or the interests of the Certificateholders therein
unless the document with respect to which the Document Defect exists is required
in connection with an imminent enforcement of the mortgagee's rights or remedies
under the related Mortgage Loan, defending any claim asserted by any borrower or
third party with respect to the Mortgage Loan, establishing the validity or
priority of any lien or any collateral securing the Mortgage Loan or for any
immediate significant servicing obligations. For a period of two years from the
Closing Date, so long as there remains any Mortgage File relating to a Mortgage
Loan as to which there is any uncured Document Defect or Breach, the Seller
shall provide the officer's certificate to the Trustee described above as to the
reasons such Document Defect or Breach remains uncured and as to the actions
being taken to pursue cure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of a
commitment to issue a policy of lender's title insurance as described in clause
12 of Schedule I hereof in lieu of the delivery of the actual policy of lender's
title insurance shall not be considered a Document Defect or Breach with respect
to any Mortgage File if such actual policy of insurance is delivered to the
Trustee or a Custodian on its behalf not later than the 90th day following the
Closing Date.

                                       6

         (d)      If (i) any Mortgage Loan is required to be repurchased or
substituted for in the manner described in the immediately preceding paragraph,
(ii) such Mortgage Loan is a Crossed Loan, and (iii) the applicable Document
Defect or Breach does not constitute a Document Defect or Breach, as the case
may be, as to any other Crossed Loan in such Crossed Group (without regard to
this paragraph), then the applicable Document Defect or Breach, as the case may
be, will be deemed to constitute a Document Defect or Breach, as the case may
be, as to any other Crossed Loan in the Crossed Group for purposes of this
paragraph, and the Seller will be required to repurchase or substitute for all
of the remaining Crossed Loan(s) in the related Crossed Group as provided in the
immediately preceding paragraph unless such other Crossed Loans in such Crossed
Group satisfy the Crossed Loan Repurchase Criteria and satisfy all other
criteria for substitution and repurchase of Mortgage Loans set forth herein. In
the event that the remaining Crossed Loans satisfy the aforementioned criteria,
the Seller may elect either to repurchase or substitute for only the affected
Crossed Loan as to which the related Breach or Document Defect exists or to
repurchase or substitute for all of the Crossed Loans in the related Crossed
Group. The Seller shall be responsible for the cost of any Appraisal required to
be obtained by the Master Servicer to determine if the Crossed Loan Repurchase
Criteria have been satisfied, so long as the scope and cost of such Appraisal
has been approved by the Seller (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld).
To the extent that the Seller is required to purchase or substitute for a
Crossed Loan hereunder in the manner prescribed above while the Trustee
continues to hold any other Crossed Loans in such Crossed Group, neither the
Seller nor the Purchaser shall enforce any remedies against the other's Primary
Collateral, but each is permitted to exercise remedies against the Primary
Collateral securing its respective Crossed Loans, including, with respect to the
Trustee, the Primary Collateral securing the Crossed Loans still held by the
Trustee, so long as such exercise does not impair the ability of the other party
to exercise its remedies against its Primary Collateral.

         If the exercise of remedies by one party would impair the ability of
the other party to exercise its remedies with respect to the Primary Collateral
securing the Crossed Loans held by such party, then the Seller and the Purchaser
shall forbear from exercising such remedies until the Mortgage Loan documents
evidencing and securing the relevant Crossed Loans can be modified in a manner
that complies with this Agreement to remove the threat of impairment as a result
of the exercise of remedies. Any reserve or other cash collateral or letters of
credit securing the Crossed Loans shall be allocated between such Crossed Loans
in accordance with the Mortgage Loan documents, or otherwise on a pro rata basis
based upon their outstanding Stated Principal Balances. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a Crossed Loan included in the Trust Fund is modified to terminate
the related cross-collateralization and/or cross-default provisions, as a
condition to such modification, the Seller shall furnish to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel that such modification shall not cause an Adverse REMIC
Event.

         (e)      In connection with any permitted repurchase or substitution of
one or more Mortgage Loans contemplated hereby, upon receipt of a certificate
from a Servicing Officer certifying as to the receipt of the Purchase Price or
Substitution Shortfall Amount(s), as applicable, in the Certificate Account, and
the delivery of the Mortgage File(s) and the Servicing File(s) for the related
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan(s) to the Custodian and the Master Servicer,
respectively, if applicable (i) the Trustee shall execute and deliver such
endorsements and assignments as are provided to it by the Master Servicer, in
each case without recourse, representation or warranty, as shall be necessary to
vest in the Seller, the legal and beneficial

                                       7
<PAGE>
ownership of each repurchased Mortgage Loan or substituted Mortgage Loan, as
applicable, (ii) the Trustee, the Custodian, the Master Servicer and the Special
Servicer shall each tender to the Seller, upon delivery to each of them of a
receipt executed by the Seller, all portions of the Mortgage File and other
documents pertaining to such Mortgage Loan possessed by it, and (iii) the Master
Servicer and the Special Servicer shall release to the Seller any Escrow
Payments and Reserve Funds held by it in respect of such repurchased or deleted
Mortgage Loans.

         (f)      Without limiting the remedies of the Purchaser, the
Certificateholders or the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders pursuant
to this Agreement, it is acknowledged that the representations and warranties
are being made for risk allocation purposes. This Section 3 provides the sole
remedy available to the Certificateholders, or the Trustee on behalf of the
Certificateholders, respecting any Document Defect in a Mortgage File or any
Breach of any representation or warranty set forth in or required to be made
pursuant to this Section 3.

         SECTION 4. Representations and Warranties of the Purchaser. In order to
induce the Seller to enter into this Agreement, the Purchaser hereby represents
and warrants for the benefit of the Seller as of the date hereof that:

         (a)      The Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of North Carolina. The
Purchaser has the full corporate power and authority and legal right to acquire
the Mortgage Loans from the Seller and to transfer the Mortgage Loans to the
Trustee.

         (b)      This Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed
and delivered by the Purchaser, all requisite action by the Purchaser's
directors and officers has been taken in connection therewith, and (assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Seller) this Agreement
constitutes the valid, legal and binding agreement of the Purchaser, enforceable
against the Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement
may be limited by (i) laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
receivership or moratorium, (ii) other laws relating to or affecting the rights
of creditors generally, or (iii) general equity principles (regardless of
whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

         (c)      Except as may be required under federal or state securities
laws (and which will be obtained on a timely basis), no consent, approval,

         (d)      None of the acquisition of the Mortgage Loans by the
Purchaser, the transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the Trustee, and the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement by the Purchaser, results or will
result in the creation or imposition of any lien on any of the Purchaser's
assets or property, or conflicts or will conflict with, results or will result
in a breach of, or constitutes or will constitute a default under (i) any term
or provision of the Purchaser's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, (ii) any

will report the transfer of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the Purchaser as
a sale of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser in exchange for consideration
consisting of a cash amount equal to the Aggregate Purchase Price.

         (f)      There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending
or to the knowledge of the Purchaser, threatened against the Purchaser in any
court or by or before any other governmental agency or instrumentality which
would materially and adversely affect the validity of this Agreement or any
action taken in connection with the obligations of the Purchaser contemplated
herein, or which would be likely to impair materially the ability of the
Purchaser to enter into and/or perform under the terms of this Agreement.

         (g)      The Purchaser is not in default with respect to any order or
decree of any court or any order, regulation or demand of any federal, state,

operations of the Purchaser or its properties or might have consequences that
would materially and adversely affect its performance hereunder.

         (d)      An officer's certificate from an officer of the Seller (signed

to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein related to the Mortgage Loans, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not

                                       10
<PAGE>
misleading. The "Specified Portions" of the Prospectus Supplement shall consist

Closing Date and addressed to the Purchaser, the Trustee, the Underwriters and
each of the Rating Agencies, together with such other written opinions as may be
required by the Rating Agencies; and

         (g)      Such further certificates, opinions and documents as the
Purchaser may reasonably request.

         SECTION 7. Indemnification.

         (a)      The Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser,
the Underwriters, the Initial Purchasers, their respective officers and
directors, and each person, if any, who controls the Purchaser or any
Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "1933 Act") or Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), against any and all losses, expenses
(including the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel), claims, damages
or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become
subject under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or other federal or state statutory law
or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) (i) arise out of or are
based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in (A) the Prospectus Supplement, the Memorandum, the Diskette or,
insofar as they are required to be filed as part of the Registration Statement
pursuant to the No-Action Letters, any Computational Materials or ABS Term
Sheets with respect to the Registered Certificates, or in any revision or
amendment of or supplement to any of the foregoing or (B) any items similar to
Computational Materials and ABS Term Sheets forwarded by the Seller to the
Initial Purchasers (the items in (A) and (B) above being defined as the
"Disclosure Material"), or (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements

                                       11
<PAGE>
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; but only if and to the extent that (1) any such untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission occurring in, or with
respect to, the Disclosure Material, arises out of or is based upon an untrue
statement or omission with respect to the Mortgage Loans, the related Mortgagors
and/or the related Mortgaged Properties contained in the Data File (it being
herein acknowledged that the Data File was and will be used to prepare the
Prospectus Supplement including without limitation Annex A thereto, the
Memorandum, the Diskette, any Computational Materials and ABS Term Sheets with
respect to the Registered Certificates and any items similar to Computational
Materials and ABS Term Sheets forwarded to prospective investors in the
Non-Registered Certificates), (2) any such untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission of a material fact occurring in, or
with respect to, the Disclosure Material, is with respect to, or arises out of
or is based upon an untrue statement or omission of a material fact with respect
to, the information regarding the Mortgage Loans, the related Mortgagors, the
related Mortgaged Properties and/or the Seller set forth (Y) in the Specified
Portions of each of the Prospectus Supplement and the Memorandum and (Z) on
Annex A to the Prospectus Supplement and, to the extent consistent therewith, on
the Diskette, (3) any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission occurring in, or with respect to, the Disclosure
Material, arises out of or is based upon a breach of the representations and
warranties of the Seller set forth in or made pursuant to Section 3 of this
Agreement or (4) any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission occurring in, or with respect to, the Disclosure
Material, arises out of or is based upon any other written information
concerning the characteristics of the Mortgage Loans, the related obligors on
the Mortgage Loans or the related Mortgaged Properties furnished to the
Purchaser or the Underwriters by the Seller; provided that the indemnification
provided by this Section 7 shall not apply to the extent that such untrue
statement or omission of a material fact was made as a result of an error in the
manipulation of, or in any calculations based upon, or in any aggregation of the
information regarding the Mortgage Loans, the related Mortgagors and/or the
related Mortgaged Properties set forth in the Data File or Annex A to the
Prospectus Supplement to the extent such information was not materially
incorrect in the Data File or such Annex A, as applicable, including without
limitation the aggregation of such information with comparable information
relating to the Other Mortgage Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
indemnification provided in this Section 7(a) shall not inure to the benefit of
any Underwriter or Initial Purchaser (or to the benefit of any person
controlling such Underwriter or Initial Purchaser) from whom the person
asserting claims giving rise to any such losses, claims, damages, expenses or
liabilities purchased Certificates if (x) the subject untrue statement or
omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any Disclosure Material
(exclusive of the Prospectus or any corrected or amended Prospectus or the
Memorandum or any corrected or amended Memorandum) is eliminated or remedied in
the Prospectus or the Memorandum (in either case, as corrected or amended, if
applicable), as applicable, and (y) a copy of the Prospectus or Memorandum (in
either case, as corrected or amended, if applicable), as applicable, shall not
have been sent to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the
sale of such Certificates to such person, and (z) in the case of a corrected or
amended Prospectus or Memorandum, such Underwriter or Initial Purchaser received
written notice of such correction or amendment prior to the written confirmation
of such sale. The information described in clauses (1) through (4) above is
collectively referred to as the "Seller Information". The Seller shall, subject
to clause (c) below, reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred,

                                       12
<PAGE>
for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action.
This indemnity will be in addition to any liability which the Seller may
otherwise have.

         (b)      For purposes of this Agreement, "Registration Statement" shall
mean such registration statement No. 333-83930 filed by the Purchaser on Form
S-3, including without limitation exhibits thereto and information incorporated
therein by reference; "Base Prospectus" shall mean the prospectus dated January
28, 2003, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated January 28, 2003
(the "Prospectus Supplement" and, together with the Base Prospectus, the
"Prospectus") relating to the Registered Certificates, including all annexes
thereto; "Memorandum" shall mean the private placement memorandum dated January
28, 2003, relating to the Non-Registered Certificates, including all exhibits
thereto; "Registered Certificates" shall mean the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class
A-3, Class A-4, Class B, Class C and Class D and Certificates; "Non-Registered
Certificates" shall mean the Certificates other than the Registered
Certificates; "Computational Materials" shall have the meaning assigned thereto
in the no-action letter dated May 20, 1994 issued by the Division of Corporation
Finance of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") to Kidder,
Peabody Acceptance Corporation I, Kidder, Peabody & Co. Incorporated, and Kidder
Structured Asset Corporation and the no-action letter dated May 27, 1994 issued
by the Division of Corporation Finance of the Commission to the Public
Securities Association (together, the "Kidder Letters"); "ABS Term Sheets" shall
have the meaning assigned thereto in the no-action letter dated February 17,
1995 issued by the Division of Corporation Finance of the Commission to the
Public Securities Association (the "PSA Letter" and, together with the Kidder
letters, the "No-Action Letters"); "Diskette" shall mean the diskette or compact
disc attached to each of the Prospectus and the Memorandum; and "Data File"
shall mean the compilation of information and data regarding the Mortgage Loans
covered by the Agreed Upon Procedures Letters dated January 17, 2003 and
rendered by KPMG LLP (a "hard copy" of which Data File was initialed on behalf
of the Seller and the Purchaser).

         (c)      Promptly after receipt by any person entitled to
indemnification under this Section 7 (an "indemnified party") of notice of the
commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect
thereof is to be made against the Seller (the "indemnifying party") under this
Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof;
but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from
any liability that it may have to any indemnified party under this Section 7
(except to the extent that such omission has prejudiced the indemnifying party
in any material respect) or from any liability which it may have otherwise than
under this Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified
party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent
that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly
after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel selected by the indemnifying party and reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the
defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it or them and/or other
indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to
the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall have the right to select
separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in
the defense

                                       13
<PAGE>
of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of
notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so
to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of
counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the
defense thereof, unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate
counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with
the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the
indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one
separate counsel, approved by the Purchaser and the Underwriters, representing
all the indemnified parties under Section 7(a) who are parties to such action),
(ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within
a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the
indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified
party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i)
or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall only be in respect of the counsel
referred to in such clause (i) or (iii). Unless it shall assume the defense of
any proceeding, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of
any proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with such
consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying
party shall indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or
liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

         (d)      If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is
unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 7(a) hereof or insufficient in
respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then
the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnified and indemnifying
parties in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the indemnified and indemnifying parties
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such parties.

         (e)      The Purchaser and the Seller agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 7(d) were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account
of the considerations referred to in Section 7(d) above. The amount paid or
payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and
liabilities referred to in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include, subject to
the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim, except where the indemnified party is required to bear such
expenses pursuant to this Section 7, which expenses the indemnifying party shall
pay as and when incurred, at the request of the indemnified party, to the extent
that the indemnifying party will be ultimately obligated to pay such expenses.
If any expenses so paid by the indemnifying party are subsequently determined to
not be required to be borne by the indemnifying party hereunder, the party that
received such payment shall promptly refund the amount so paid to the party
which made such payment. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

                                       14
<PAGE>
         (f)      The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this
Section 7 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i)
any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by the Purchaser,
the Underwriters, any of their respective directors or officers, or any person
controlling the Purchaser or the Underwriters, and (iii) acceptance of and
payment for any of the Certificates.

         (g)      Without limiting the generality or applicability of any other
provision of this Agreement, the Underwriters shall be third-party beneficiaries
of the provisions of this Section 7.

         SECTION 8. Costs. The Seller shall pay (or shall reimburse the
Purchaser to the extent that the Purchaser has paid) the Seller's pro rata
portion of the aggregate of the following amounts (the Seller's pro rata portion
to be determined according to the percentage that the Wachovia Mortgage Loan
Balance represents as of the Cut-Off Date Pool Balance): (a) the costs and
expenses of printing and delivering the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the
Certificates; (b) the costs and expenses of printing (or otherwise reproducing)
and delivering a preliminary and final Prospectus and Memorandum relating to the
Certificates; (c) the initial fees, costs, and expenses of the Trustee
(including reasonable attorneys' fees); (d) the filing fee charged by the
Securities and Exchange Commission for registration of the Certificates so
registered; (e) the fees charged by the Rating Agencies to rate the Certificates
so rated; (f) the fees and disbursements of a firm of certified public
accountants selected by the Purchaser and the Seller with respect to numerical
information in respect of the Mortgage Loans and the Certificates included in
the Prospectus, the Memorandum and any related Computational Materials or ABS
Term Sheets, including in respect of the cost of obtaining any "comfort letters"
with respect to such items; (g) the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
in connection with the qualification or exemption of the Certificates under
state securities or "Blue Sky" laws, including filing fees and reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel in connection therewith, in connection with the
preparation of any "Blue Sky" survey and in connection with any determination of
the eligibility of the Certificates for investment by institutional investors
and the preparation of any legal investment survey; (h) the expenses of printing
any such "Blue Sky" survey and legal investment survey; and (i) the reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters; provided, however, Seller
shall pay (or shall reimburse the Purchaser to the extent that the Purchaser has
paid) the expense of recording any assignment of Mortgage or assignment of
Assignment of Leases as contemplated by Section 2 hereof with respect to such
Seller's Mortgage Loans. All other costs and expenses in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereunder shall be borne by the party incurring such
expense.

         SECTION 9. Grant of a Security Interest. It is the express intent of
the parties hereto that the conveyance of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller to
the Purchaser as provided in Section 2 hereof be, and be construed as, a sale of
the Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the Purchaser and not as a pledge of the
Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the Purchaser to secure a debt or other
obligation of the Seller. However, if, notwithstanding the aforementioned intent
of the parties, the Mortgage Loans are held to be property of the Seller, then,
(a) it is the express intent of the parties that such conveyance be deemed a
pledge of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the Purchaser to secure a debt or
other obligation of the Seller, and (b) (i) this Agreement shall also be deemed
to be a security agreement within the meaning of Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code of the applicable jurisdiction; (ii) the conveyance provided for
in Section 2 hereof shall be deemed to be a grant by the Seller to the Purchaser
of a security interest in all of

                                       15
<PAGE>
the Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Mortgage Loans, and all
amounts payable to the holder of the Mortgage Loans in accordance with the terms
thereof, and all proceeds of the conversion, voluntary or involuntary, of the
foregoing into cash, instruments, securities or other property, including,
without limitation, all amounts, other than investment earnings, from time to
time held or invested in the Certificate Account, the Distribution Account or,
if established, the REO Account (each as defined in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement) whether in the form of cash, instruments, securities or other
property; (iii) the assignment to the Trustee of the interest of the Purchaser
as contemplated by Section 1 hereof shall be deemed to be an assignment of any
security interest created hereunder; (iv) the possession by the Trustee or any
of its agents, including, without limitation, the Custodian, of the Mortgage
Notes, and such other items of property as constitute instruments, money,
negotiable documents or chattel paper shall be deemed to be possession by the
secured party for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to
Section 9-313 of the Uniform Commercial Code of the applicable jurisdiction; and
(v) notifications to persons (other than the Trustee) holding such property, and
acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from persons (other than the Trustee)
holding such property, shall be deemed notifications to, or acknowledgments,
receipts or confirmations from, financial intermediaries, bailees or agents (as
applicable) of the secured party for the purpose of perfecting such security
interest under applicable law. The Seller and the Purchaser shall, to the extent
consistent with this Agreement, take such actions as may be necessary to ensure
that, if this Agreement were deemed to create a security interest in the
Mortgage Loans, such security interest would be deemed to be a perfected
security interest of first priority under applicable law and will be maintained
as such throughout the term of this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.

         SECTION 10. Covenants of Purchaser. The Purchaser shall provide the
Seller with all forms of Disclosure Materials (including the final form of the
Memorandum and the preliminary and final forms of the Prospectus Supplement)
promptly upon any such document becoming available.

         SECTION 11. Notices. All notices, copies, requests, consents, demands
and other communications required hereunder shall be in writing and telecopied
or delivered to the intended recipient at the "Address for Notices" specified
beneath its name on the signature pages hereof or, as to either party, at such
other address as shall be designated by such party in a notice hereunder to the
other party. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all such
communications shall be deemed to have been duly given when transmitted by
telecopier or personally delivered or, in the case of a mailed notice, upon
receipt, in each case given or addressed as aforesaid.

         SECTION 12. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive
Delivery. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this
Agreement, incorporated herein by reference or contained in the certificates of
officers of the Seller submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in
full force and effect and shall survive delivery of the Mortgage Loans by the
Seller to the Purchaser (and by the Purchaser to the Trustee).

         SECTION 13. Severability of Provisions. Any part, provision,
representation, warranty or covenant of this Agreement that is prohibited or
which is held to be void or unenforceable shall be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the

                                       16
<PAGE>
remaining provisions hereof. Any part, provision, representation, warranty or
covenant of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable or is held to be
void or unenforceable in any particular jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any particular jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To
the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties hereto waive any provision
of law which prohibits or renders void or unenforceable any provision hereof.

         SECTION 14. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but which together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

         SECTION 15. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS, DUTIES,
OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS AND DECISIONS OF NEW YORK. THE PARTIES HERETO
INTEND THAT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS
LAW SHALL APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT.

         SECTION 16. Attorneys Fees. If any legal action, suit or proceeding is

and obligations under this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover, in addition to damages or other relief, costs and expenses, attorneys'
fees and court costs (including, without limitation, expert witness fees). As
used herein, the term "prevailing party" shall mean the party which obtains the
principal relief it has sought, whether by compromise settlement or judgment. If
the party which commenced or instituted the action, suit or proceeding shall
dismiss or discontinue it without the concurrence of the other party, such other

         SECTION 17. Further Assurances. The Seller and the Purchaser agree to
execute and deliver such instruments and take such further actions as the other
party may, from time to time, reasonably request in order to effectuate the

         SECTION 18. Successors and Assigns. The rights and obligations of the
Seller under this Agreement shall not be assigned by the Seller without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser, except that any person into which the
Seller may be merged or consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any
merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Seller is a party, or any
person succeeding to all or substantially all of the business of the Seller,
shall be the successor to the Seller hereunder. The Purchaser has the right to
assign its interest under this Agreement, in whole or in part, as may be
required to effect the purposes of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and the
assignee shall, to the extent of such assignment, succeed to the rights and
obligations hereunder of the Purchaser. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Seller, the
Purchaser, the Underwriters (as intended third party beneficiaries hereof) and
their permitted successors and assigns, and the officers, directors and
controlling persons referred to in Section 7. This Agreement is

                                       17
<PAGE>
enforceable by the Underwriters and the other third party beneficiaries hereto
in all respects to the same extent as if they had been signatories hereof.

         SECTION 19. Amendments. No term or provision of this Agreement may be
waived or modified unless such waiver or modification is in writing and signed
by a duly authorized officer of the party, or third party beneficiary, against
whom such waiver or modification is sought to be enforced. No amendment to the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement which relates to defined terms contained
therein, Section 2.01(d) thereof or the repurchase obligations or any other
obligations of the Seller shall be effective against the Seller (in such
capacity) unless the Seller shall have agreed to such amendment in writing.

         SECTION 20. Accountants' Letters. The parties hereto shall cooperate
with KPMG LLP in making available all information and taking all steps
reasonably necessary to permit such accountants to deliver the letters required
by the Underwriting Agreement.

         SECTION 21. Knowledge. Whenever a representation or warranty or other
statement in this Agreement is made with respect to a Person's "knowledge," such
statement refers to such Person's employees or agents who were or are
responsible for or involved with the indicated matter and have actual knowledge
of the matter in question.

                                   SCHEDULE I

                 GENERAL MORTGAGE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

1.       The information pertaining to each Mortgage Loan set forth in the
         Mortgage Loan Schedule was true and correct in all material respects as
         of the Cut-Off Date.

2.       As of the date of its origination, such Mortgage Loan complied in all
         material respects with, or was exempt from, all requirements of
         federal, state or local law relating to the origination of such
         Mortgage Loan.

3.       Immediately prior to the sale, transfer and assignment to the
         Purchaser, the Seller had good and marketable title to, and was the
         sole owner of, each Mortgage Loan, and the Seller is transferring such
         Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, pledges, charges or
         security interests of any nature encumbering such Mortgage Loan. Upon
         consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Mortgage Loan
         Purchase Agreement, the Seller will have validly and effectively
         conveyed to the Purchaser all legal and beneficial interest in and to
         such Mortgage Loan free and clear of any pledge, lien or security
         interest.

4.       The proceeds of such Mortgage Loan have been fully disbursed and there
         is no requirement for future advances thereunder by the Mortgagee.

5.       Each related Mortgage Note, Mortgage, Assignment of Leases (if any) and
         other agreement executed in connection with such Mortgage Loan is
         legal, valid and binding obligation of the related Mortgagor (subject
         to any non-recourse provisions therein and any state anti-deficiency or
         market value limit deficiency legislation), enforceable in accordance
         with its terms, except (a) that certain provisions contained in such
         Mortgage Loan documents are or may be unenforceable in whole or in part
         under applicable state or federal laws, but neither the application of
         any such laws to any such provision nor the inclusion of any such
         provisions renders any of the Mortgage Loan documents invalid as a
         whole and such Mortgage Loan documents taken as a whole are enforceable
         to the extent necessary and customary for the practical realization of
         the rights and benefits afforded thereby and (b) as such enforcement
         may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization,
         moratorium, redemption, liquidation or other laws affecting the
         enforcement of creditors' rights generally, or by general principles of
         equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a
         proceeding in equity or at law). The related Mortgage Note and Mortgage
         contain no provision limiting the right or ability of the Seller to
         assign, transfer and convey the related Mortgage Loan to any other
         Person.

6.       As of the date of its origination, there was no valid offset, defense,
         counterclaim, abatement or right to rescission with respect to any of
         the related Mortgage Notes, Mortgage(s) or other agreements executed in
         connection therewith, and, as of the Cut-Off Date, there is no valid
         offset, defense, counterclaim or right to rescission with respect to
         such Mortgage Note, Mortgage(s) or other agreements, except in each
         case, with respect

                                      I-1
<PAGE>
         to the enforceability of any provisions requiring
         the payment of default interest, late fees, additional interest,
         prepayment premiums or yield maintenance charges.

7.       Each related assignment of Mortgage and assignment of Assignment of
         Leases from the Seller to the Trustee constitutes the legal, valid and
         binding first priority assignment from the Seller, except as such
         enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, redemption,
         reorganization, liquidation, receivership, moratorium or other laws
         relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally or by general
         principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is
         considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Each Mortgage and
         Assignment of Leases is freely assignable.

8.       Each related Mortgage is a valid and enforceable first lien on the
         related Mortgaged Property subject only to the exceptions set forth in
         paragraph (5) above and the following title exceptions (each such title
         exception, a "Title Exception", and collectively, the "Title
         Exceptions"): (a) the lien of current real property taxes, ground
         rents, water charges, sewer rents and assessments not yet due and
         payable, (b) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way,
         easements and other matters of public record, none of which,
         individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely interferes
         with the current use of the Mortgaged Property or the security intended
         to be provided by such Mortgage or with the Mortgagor's ability to pay
         its obligations under the Mortgage Loan when they become due or
         materially and adversely affects the value of the Mortgaged Property,
         (c) the exceptions (general and specific) and exclusions set forth in
         the applicable policy described in paragraph (12) below or appearing of
         record, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, materially
         interferes with the current use of the Mortgaged Property or the
         security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or with the
         Mortgagor's ability to pay its obligations under the Mortgage Loan when
         they become due or materially and adversely affects the value of the
         Mortgaged Property, (d) other matters to which like properties are
         commonly subject, none of which, individually or in the aggregate,
         materially and adversely interferes with the current use of the
         Mortgaged Property or the security intended to be provided by such
         Mortgage or with the Mortgagor's ability to pay its obligations under
         the Mortgage Loan when they become due or materially and adversely
         affects the value of the Mortgaged Property, (e) the right of tenants
         (whether under ground leases, space leases or operating leases) at the
         Mortgaged Property to remain following a foreclosure or similar
         proceeding (provided that such tenants are performing under such
         leases) and (f) if such Mortgage Loan is cross-collateralized with any
         other Mortgage Loan, the lien of the Mortgage for such other Mortgage
         Loan, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, materially and
         adversely interferes with the current use of the Mortgaged Property or
         the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or with the
         Mortgagor's ability to pay its obligations under the Mortgage Loan when
         they become due or materially and adversely affects the value of the
         Mortgaged Property. Except with respect to cross-collateralized and
         cross-defaulted Mortgage Loans, there are no mortgage loans that are
         senior or pari passu with respect to the related Mortgaged Property or
         such Mortgage Loan.

9.       UCC Financing Statements have been filed and/or recorded (or, if not
         filed and/or recorded, have been submitted in proper form for filing
         and recording), in all public places necessary at the time of the
         origination of the Mortgage Loan to perfect a valid

                                      I-2
<PAGE>
         security interest in all items of personal property reasonably
         necessary to operate the Mortgaged Property owned by a Mortgagor and
         located on the related Mortgaged Property (other than any personal
         property subject to a purchase money security interest or a sale and
         leaseback financing arrangement permitted under the terms of such
         Mortgage Loan or any other personal property leases applicable to such
         personal property), to the extent perfection may be effected pursuant
         to applicable law by recording or filing, and the Mortgages, security
         agreements, chattel Mortgages or equivalent documents related to and
         delivered in connection with the related Mortgage Loan establish and
         create a valid and enforceable lien and priority security interest on
         such items of personalty except as such enforcement may be limited by
         bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, moratorium,
         redemption, liquidation or other laws affecting the enforcement of
         creditor's rights generally, or by general principles of equity
         (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding
         in equity or at law). Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, no
         representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in
         rents or other personal property to the extent that possession or
         control of such items or actions other than the filing of UCC Financing
         Statements are required in order to effect such perfection.

10.      All real estate taxes and governmental assessments, or installments
         thereof, which would be a lien on the Mortgaged Property and that prior
         to the Cut-Off Date have become delinquent in respect of each related
         Mortgaged Property have been paid, or an escrow of funds in an amount
         sufficient to cover such payments has been established. For purposes of
         this representation and warranty, real estate taxes and governmental
         assessments and installments thereof shall not be considered delinquent
         until the earlier of (a) the date on which interest and/or penalties
         would first be payable thereon and (b) the date on which enforcement
         action is entitled to be taken by the related taxing authority.

11.      To the Seller's actual knowledge as of the Cut-Off Date, and to the
         Seller's actual knowledge based solely upon due diligence customarily
         performed with the origination of comparable Mortgage Loans by the
         Seller, each related Mortgaged Property was free and clear of any
         material damage (other than deferred maintenance for which escrows were
         established at origination) that would affect materially and adversely
         the value of such Mortgaged Property as security for the Mortgage Loan
         and to the Seller's actual knowledge as of the Cut-Off Date there was
         no proceeding pending for the total or partial condemnation of such
         Mortgaged Property.

12.      The lien of each related Mortgage as a first priority lien in the
         original principal amount of such Mortgage Loan after all advances of
         principal (as set forth on the Mortgage Loan Schedule) is insured by an
         ALTA lender's title insurance policy (or a binding commitment
         therefor), or its equivalent as adopted in the applicable jurisdiction,
         insuring the Seller, its successors and assigns, subject only to the
         Title Exceptions; the Seller or its successors or assigns is the named
         insured of such policy; such policy is assignable without consent of
         the insurer and will inure to the benefit of the Trustee as mortgagee
         of record; is in full force and effect upon the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement; all premiums thereon have
         been paid; no claims have been made under such policy and the Seller
         has not done anything, by act or omission, and the Seller has no actual
         knowledge of any matter, which would impair or diminish

                                      I-3
<PAGE>
         the coverage of such policy. The insurer issuing such policy is either
         (x) a nationally-recognized title insurance company or (y) qualified to
         do business in the jurisdiction in which the related Mortgaged Property
         is located to the extent required; such policy contains no material
         exclusions for, or affirmatively insures (except for any Mortgaged
         Property located in a jurisdiction where such insurance is not
         available) (a) access to public road (except as provided below) or (b)
         against any loss due to encroachments of any material portion of the
         improvements thereon.

13.      Except as provided below, as of the date of its origination, all
         insurance coverage required under each related Mortgage, which
         insurance covered such risks as were customarily acceptable to prudent
         commercial and multifamily mortgage lending institutions lending on the
         security of property comparable to the related Mortgaged Property in
         the jurisdiction in which such Mortgaged Property is located, and with
         respect to a fire and extended perils insurance policy, is in an amount
         (subject to a customary deductible) at least equal to the lesser of (i)
         the replacement cost of improvements located on such Mortgaged
         Property, or (ii) the initial principal balance of the Mortgage Loan,
         and in any event, the amount necessary to prevent operation of any
         co-insurance provisions; and, except if such Mortgaged Property is
         operated as a mobile home park, is also covered by business
         interruption or rental loss insurance, in an amount at least equal to
         12 months of operations of the related Mortgaged Property (or in the
         case of a Mortgaged Property without any elevator, 6 months), all of
         which was in full force and effect with respect to each related
         Mortgaged Property; and, except as provided below, as of the Cut-Off
         Date, to the actual knowledge of the Seller, all insurance coverage
         required under each Mortgage, which insurance covers such risks and is
         in such amounts as are customarily acceptable to prudent commercial and
         multifamily mortgage lending institutions lending on the security of
         property comparable to the related Mortgaged Property in the
         jurisdiction in which such Mortgaged Property is located, is in full
         force and effect with respect to each related Mortgaged Property; all
         premiums due and payable through the Closing Date have been paid; and
         no notice of termination or cancellation with respect to any such
         insurance policy has been received by the Seller; and except for
         certain amounts not greater than amounts which would be considered
         prudent by an institutional commercial mortgage lender with respect to
         a similar Mortgage Loan and which are set forth in the related
         Mortgage, any insurance proceeds in respect of a casualty loss, will be
         applied either (i) to the repair or restoration of all or part of the
         related Mortgaged Property or (ii) the reduction of the outstanding
         principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, subject in either case to
         requirements with respect to leases at the related Mortgaged Property
         and to other exceptions customarily provided for by prudent
         institutional lenders for similar loans. The Mortgaged Property is also
         covered by comprehensive general liability insurance against claims for
         personal and bodily injury, death or property damage occurring on, in
         or about the related Mortgaged Property, in an amount customarily
         required by prudent institutional lenders.

         The insurance policies contain a standard mortgagee clause naming the
         Seller, its successors and assigns as loss payee, in the case of a
         property insurance policy, and additional insured in the case of a
         liability insurance policy and provide that they are not terminable
         without 30 days prior written notice to the Mortgagee (or, with respect
         to non-payment, 10 days prior written notice to the Mortgagee) or such
         lesser period as

                                      I-4
<PAGE>
         prescribed by applicable law. Each Mortgage requires that the Mortgagor
         maintain insurance as described above or permits the Mortgagee to
         require insurance as described above, and permits the Mortgagee to
         purchase such insurance at the Mortgagor's expense if Mortgagor fails
         to do so.

14.      Except as provided below, (a) other than payments due but not yet 30
         days or more delinquent, to the Seller's actual knowledge, based upon
         due diligence customarily performed with the servicing of comparable
         mortgage loans by prudent institutional lenders, there is no material
         default, breach, violation or event of acceleration existing under the
         related Mortgage or the related Mortgage Note, and to the Seller's
         actual knowledge no event (other than payments due but not yet
         delinquent) which, with the passage of time or with notice and the
         expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a material
         default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, provided, however,
         that this representation and warranty does not address or otherwise
         cover any default, breach, violation or event of acceleration that
         specifically pertains to any matter otherwise covered by any other
         representation and warranty made by the Seller in any of paragraphs
         (10) (15) (19) and (21) of this Schedule I or in any paragraph of
         Schedule II, and (b) the Seller has not waived any material default,
         breach, violation or event of acceleration under such Mortgage or
         Mortgage Note, except for a written waiver contained in the related
         Mortgage File being delivered to the Purchaser, and pursuant to the
         terms of the related Mortgage or the related Mortgage Note and other
         documents in the related Mortgage File no Person or party other than
         the holder of such Mortgage Note may declare any event of default or
         accelerate the related indebtedness under either of such Mortgage or
         Mortgage Note.

15.      As of the Closing Date, each Mortgage Loan is not, and in the prior 12
         months (or since the date of origination if such Mortgage Loan has been
         originated within the past 12 months), has not been, 30 days or more
         past due in respect of any Scheduled Payment.

16.      Except with respect to ARD Loans, which provide that the rate at which
         interest accrues thereon increases after the Anticipated Repayment
         Date, the Mortgage Rate (exclusive of any default interest, late
         charges or prepayment premiums) of such Mortgage Loan is a fixed rate.

17.      Each related Mortgage does not provide for or permit, without the prior
         written consent of the holder of the Mortgage Note, each related
         Mortgaged Property to secure any other promissory note or obligation
         except as expressly described in such Mortgage.

18.      Each Mortgage Loan is directly secured by a Mortgage on a commercial
         property or a multifamily residential property, and either (a)
         substantially all of the proceeds of such Mortgage Loan were used to
         acquire, improve or protect the portion of such commercial or
         multifamily residential property that consists of an interest in real
         property (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections
         1.856-3(c) and 1.856-3(d)) and such interest in real property was the
         only security for such Mortgage Loan as of the Testing Date (as defined
         below), or (b) the fair market value of the interest in real property
         which secures such Mortgage Loan was at least equal to 80% of the
         principal amount of the Mortgage Loan (i) as of the Testing Date, or
         (ii) as of the Closing Date. For purposes of the

                                      I-5
<PAGE>
         previous sentence, (A) the fair market value of the referenced interest
         in real property shall first be reduced by (1) the amount of any lien
         on such interest in real property that is senior to the Mortgage Loan,
         and (2) a proportionate amount of any lien on such interest in real
         property that is on a parity with the Mortgage Loan, and (B) the
         "Testing Date" shall be the date on which the referenced Mortgage Loan
         was originated unless (1) such Mortgage Loan was modified after the
         date of its origination in a manner that would cause a "significant
         modification" of such Mortgage Loan within the meaning of Treasury
         Regulations Section 1.1001-3(b), and (2) such "significant
         modification" did not occur at a time when such Mortgage Loan was in
         default or when default with respect to such Mortgage Loan was
         reasonably foreseeable. However, if the referenced Mortgage Loan has
         been subjected to a "significant modification" after the date of its
         origination and at a time when such Mortgage Loan was not in default or
         when default with respect to such Mortgage Loan was not reasonably
         foreseeable, the Testing Date shall be the date upon which the latest
         such "significant modification" occurred. The Mortgage Loan documents
         with respect to each Defeasance Loan do not allow such Defeasance Loan
         to be defeased prior to two years after the Startup Date.

19.      One or more environmental site assessments or updates thereof were
         performed by an environmental consulting firm independent of the Seller
         and the Seller's affiliates with respect to each related Mortgaged
         Property during the 18-months preceding the origination of the related
         Mortgage Loan, and the Seller, having made no independent inquiry other
         than to review the report(s) prepared in connection with the
         assessment(s) referenced herein, has no actual knowledge and has
         received no notice of any material and adverse environmental condition
         or circumstance affecting such Mortgaged Property that was not
         disclosed in such report(s). If any such environmental report
         identified any Recognized Environmental Condition (REC), as that term
         is defined in the Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments:
         Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process Designation: E 1527-00,
         as recommended by the American Society for Testing and Materials
         (ASTM), with respect to the related Mortgaged Property and the same
         have not been subsequently addressed in all material respects, then
         either (i) an escrow greater than 100% of the amount identified as
         necessary by the environmental consulting firm to address the REC is
         held by the Seller for purposes of effecting same (and the borrower has
         covenanted in the Mortgage Loan documents to perform such work), (ii)
         the related borrower or other responsible party having financial
         resources reasonably estimated to be adequate to address the REC is
         required to take such actions or is liable for the failure to take such
         actions, if any, with respect to such circumstances or conditions as
         have been required by the applicable governmental regulatory authority
         or any environmental law or regulation, (iii) the borrower has provided
         an environmental insurance policy, (iv) an operations and maintenance
         plan has been or will be implemented or (v) such conditions or
         circumstances were investigated further and based upon such additional
         investigation, a qualified environmental consultant recommended no
         further investigation or remediation. All environmental assessments or
         updates that were in the possession of the Seller and that relate to a
         Mortgaged Property insured by an environmental insurance policy have
         been delivered to or disclosed to the environmental insurance carrier
         issuing such policy prior to the issuance of such policy.

20.      Each related Mortgage and Assignment of Leases, together with
         applicable state law, contains customary and enforceable provisions for
         comparable mortgaged properties similarly situated such as to render
         the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the
         practical realization against the Mortgaged Property of the benefits of
         the security, including realization by judicial or, if applicable,
         non-judicial foreclosure, subject to the effects of bankruptcy or
         similar law affecting the right of creditors and the application of
         principles of equity.

21.      At the time of origination and, to the actual knowledge of Seller as of
         the Cut-Off Date, no Mortgagor is a debtor in, and no Mortgaged
         Property is the subject of, any state or federal bankruptcy or
         insolvency proceeding.

22.      Each Mortgage Loan is a whole loan (except with respect to the AB
         Mortgage Loans) and contains no equity participation by the lender or
         shared appreciation feature and does not provide for any contingent or
         additional interest in the form of participation in the cash flow of
         the related Mortgaged Property or, other than the ARD Loans, provide
         for negative amortization. The Seller holds no preferred equity
         interest.

23.      Subject to certain exceptions, which are customarily acceptable to
         prudent commercial and multifamily mortgage lending institutions
         lending on the security of property comparable to the related Mortgaged
         Property, each related Mortgage or loan agreement contains provisions
         for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of
         such Mortgage Loan if, without complying with the requirements of the
         Mortgage or loan agreement, (a) the related Mortgaged Property, or any
         controlling interest in the related Mortgagor, is directly transferred
         or sold (other than by reason of family and estate planning transfers,
         transfers by devise, descent or operation of law upon the death of a
         member, general partner or shareholder of the related Borrower and
         transfers of less than a controlling interest in a mortgagor, or a
         substitution or release of collateral within the parameters of
         paragraph (26) below), or (b) the related Mortgaged Property is
         encumbered in connection with subordinate financing by a lien or
         security interest against the related Mortgaged Property, other than
         any existing permitted additional debt.

24.      Except as set forth in the related Mortgage File, the terms of the
         related Mortgage Note and Mortgage(s) have not been waived, modified,
         altered, satisfied, impaired, canceled, subordinated or rescinded in
         any manner which materially interferes with the security intended to be
         provided by such Mortgage.

25.      Except as provided below, each related Mortgaged Property was inspected
         by or on behalf of the related originator or an affiliate during the 12
         month period prior to the related origination date.

26.      Since origination, no material portion of the related Mortgaged
         Property has been released from the lien of the related Mortgage in any
         manner which materially and adversely affects the value of the Mortgage
         Loan or materially interferes with the security intended to be provided
         by such Mortgage, and, except with respect to Mortgage Loans (a) which
         permit defeasance by means of substituting for the Mortgaged Property
         (or, in the case of a Mortgage Loan secured by multiple Mortgaged
         Properties, one or more of

                                      I-7
<PAGE>
         such Mortgaged Properties) U.S. Treasury obligations sufficient to pay
         the Mortgage Loans (or portions thereof) in accordance with their
         terms, (b) where a release of the portion of the Mortgaged Property was
         contemplated at origination and such portion was not considered
         material for purposes of underwriting the Mortgage Loan, (c) where
         release is conditional upon the satisfaction of certain underwriting
         and legal requirements and the payment of a release price that
         represents adequate consideration for such Mortgaged Property or the
         portion thereof that is being released, or (d) which permit the related
         Mortgagor to substitute a replacement property in compliance with REMIC
         Provisions, the terms of the related Mortgage do not provide for
         release of any portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the
         Mortgage except in consideration of payment in full therefor.

27.      Except as provided below, to the Seller's actual knowledge, based upon
         a letter from governmental authorities, a legal opinion, an endorsement
         to the related title policy, or based upon other due diligence
         considered reasonable by prudent commercial conduit mortgage lenders in
         the area where the applicable Mortgaged Property is located, as of the
         date of origination of such Mortgage Loan and as of the Cut-Off Date,
         there are no material violations of any applicable zoning ordinances,
         building codes and land laws applicable to the Mortgaged Property or
         the use and occupancy thereof which (a) are not insured by an ALTA
         lender's title insurance policy (or a binding commitment therefor), or
         its equivalent as adopted in the applicable jurisdiction, or a law and
         ordinance insurance policy or (b) would have a material adverse effect
         on the value, operation or net operating income of the Mortgaged
         Property.

28.      To the Seller's actual knowledge based on surveys and/or the title
         policy referred to herein obtained in connection with the origination
         of each Mortgage Loan, none of the material improvements which were
         included for the purposes of determining the appraised value of the
         related Mortgaged Property at the time of the origination of the
         Mortgage Loan lies outside of the boundaries and building restriction
         lines of such property (except Mortgaged Properties which are legal
         non-conforming uses), to an extent which would have a material adverse
         affect on the value of the Mortgaged Property or related Mortgagor's
         use and operation of such Mortgaged Property (unless affirmatively
         covered by title insurance) and no improvements on adjoining properties
         encroached upon such Mortgaged Property to any material and adverse
         extent (unless affirmatively covered by title insurance).

29.      With respect to at least 95% of such Seller's Mortgage Loans (by
         balance) having a Cut-Off Date Balance in excess of 1% of the Initial
         Pool Balance, the related Mortgagor has covenanted in its
         organizational documents and/or the Mortgage Loan documents to own no
         significant asset other than the related Mortgaged Property or
         Mortgaged Properties, as applicable, and assets incidental to its
         ownership and operation of such Mortgaged Property, and to hold itself
         out as being a legal entity, separate and apart from any other Person.

30.      No advance of funds has been made other than pursuant to the loan
         documents, directly or indirectly, by the Seller to the Mortgagor and,
         to the Seller's actual knowledge, no

                                      I-8
<PAGE>
         funds have been received from any Person other than the Mortgagor, for
         or on account of payments due on the Mortgage Note or the Mortgage.

31.      As of the date of origination and, to the Seller's actual knowledge, as
         of the Cut-Off Date, there was no pending action, suit or proceeding,
         or governmental investigation of which it has received notice, against
         the Mortgagor or the related Mortgaged Property the adverse outcome of
         which could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect
         such Mortgagor's ability to pay principal, interest or any other
         amounts due under such Mortgage Loan or the security intended to be
         provided by the Mortgage Loan documents or the current use of the
         Mortgaged Property.

32.      As of the date of origination, and, to the Seller's actual knowledge,
         as of the Cut-Off Date, if the related Mortgage is a deed of trust, a
         trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, has
         either been properly designated and serving under such Mortgage or may
         be substituted in accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law.

33.      The Mortgage Loan and the interest (exclusive of any default interest,
         late charges or prepayment premiums) contracted for complied as of the
         date of origination with, or is exempt from, applicable state or
         federal laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to usury.

34.      The related Mortgage Note is not secured by any collateral that secures
         a Mortgage Loan that is not in the Trust Fund and each Mortgage Loan
         that is cross-collateralized is cross-collateralized only with other
         Mortgage Loans sold pursuant to this Agreement.

35.      The improvements located on the Mortgaged Property are either not
         located in a federally designated special flood hazard area or the
         Mortgagor is required to maintain or the mortgagee maintains, flood
         insurance with respect to such improvements and such policy is in full
         force and effect.

36.      All escrow deposits and payments required pursuant to the Mortgage Loan
         as of the Closing Date required to be deposited with the Seller in
         accordance with the Mortgage Loan documents have been so deposited, are
         in the possession, or under the control, of the Seller or its agent and
         there are no deficiencies in connection therewith.

37.      To the Seller's actual knowledge, based on the due diligence
         customarily performed in the origination of comparable mortgage loans
         by prudent commercial and multifamily mortgage lending institutions
         with respect to the related geographic area and properties comparable
         to the related Mortgaged Property, as of the date of origination of the
         Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgagor, the related lessee, franchisor or
         operator was in possession of all material licenses, permits and
         authorizations then required for use of the related Mortgaged Property,
         and, as of the Cut-Off Date, the Seller has no actual knowledge that
         the related Mortgagor, the related lessee, franchisor or operator was
         not in possession of such licenses, permits and authorizations.

38.      The origination (or acquisition, as the case may be), servicing and
         collection practices used by the Seller with respect to the Mortgage
         Loan have been in all respects legal and

                                      I-9
<PAGE>
         have met customary industry standards for servicing of commercial
         mortgage loans for conduit loan programs.

39.      Except for Mortgagors under Mortgage Loans the Mortgaged Property with
         respect to which includes a Ground Lease, the related Mortgagor (or its
         affiliate) has title in the fee simple interest in each related
         Mortgaged Property.

40.      Except as provided below, the Mortgage Loan documents for each Mortgage
         Loan provide that each Mortgage Loan is non-recourse to the related
         Mortgagor except that the related Mortgagor accepts responsibility for
         fraud and/or other intentional material misrepresentation. Furthermore,
         except as provided below, the Mortgage Loan documents for each Mortgage
         Loan provide that the related Mortgagor shall be liable to the lender
         for losses incurred due to the misapplication or misappropriation of
         rents collected in advance or received by the related Mortgagor after
         the occurrence of an event of default and not paid to the Mortgagee or
         applied to the Mortgaged Property in the ordinary course of business,
         misapplication or conversion by the Mortgagor of insurance proceeds or
         condemnation awards or breach of the environmental covenants in the
         related Mortgage Loan documents.

41.      Subject to the exceptions set forth in paragraph (5), the Assignment of
         Leases set forth in the Mortgage or separate from the related Mortgage
         and related to and delivered in connection with each Mortgage Loan
         establishes and creates a valid, subsisting and enforceable lien and
         security interest in the related Mortgagor's interest in all leases,
         subleases, licenses or other agreements pursuant to which any Person is
         entitled to occupy, use or possess all or any portion of the real
         property.

42.      With respect to such Mortgage Loan, any prepayment premium constitutes
         a "customary prepayment penalty" within the meaning of Treasury
         Regulations Section 1.860G-1(b)(2).

43.      If such Mortgage Loan contains a provision for any defeasance of
         mortgage collateral, such Mortgage Loan permits defeasance (a) no
         earlier than two years after the Closing Date, (b) only with substitute
         collateral constituting "government securities" within the meaning of
         Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(8)(i) in an amount sufficient
         to make all scheduled payments under the Mortgage Note and (c) only to
         facilitate the disposition of the Mortgaged Property and not as a part
         of an arrangement to collateralize a REMIC offering with obligations
         that are not real estate mortgages. In addition, if such Mortgage
         contains such a defeasance provision, it provides (or otherwise
         contains provisions pursuant to which the holder can require) that an
         opinion be provided to the effect that such holder has a first priority
         perfected security interest in the defeasance collateral. The related
         Mortgage Loan documents permit the lender to charge all of its expenses
         associated with a defeasance to the Mortgagor (including rating
         agencies' fees, accounting fees and attorneys' fees), and provide that
         the related Mortgagor must deliver (or otherwise, the Mortgage Loan
         documents contain certain provisions pursuant to which the lender can
         require) (i) an accountant's certification as to the adequacy of the
         defeasance collateral to make payments under the related Mortgage Loan
         for the remainder of its term, (ii) an Opinion of Counsel that the
         defeasance complies with all

                                      I-10
<PAGE>
         applicable REMIC Provisions, and (iii) assurances from the Rating
         Agencies that the defeasance will not result in the withdrawal,
         downgrade or qualification of the ratings assigned to the Certificates.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, some of the Mortgage Loan documents may
         not affirmatively contain all such requirements, but such requirements
         are effectively present in such documents due to the general obligation
         to comply with the REMIC Provisions and/or deliver a REMIC Opinion of
         Counsel.

44.      To the extent required under applicable law as of the date of
         origination, and necessary for the enforceability or collectability of
         the Mortgage Loan, the originator of such Mortgage Loan was authorized
         to do business in the jurisdiction in which the related Mortgaged
         Property is located at all times when it originated and held the
         Mortgage Loan.

45.      Neither the Seller nor any affiliate thereof has any obligation to make
         any capital contributions to the Mortgagor under the Mortgage Loan.

46.      Except with respect to the Companion Loan of any AB Mortgage Loan, none
         of the Mortgaged Properties are encumbered, and none of the Mortgage
         Loan documents permit the related Mortgaged Property to be encumbered
         subsequent to the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the
         holder thereof, by any lien securing the payment of money junior to or
         of equal priority with, or superior to, the lien of the related
         Mortgage (other than Title Exceptions, taxes, assessments and contested
         mechanics and materialmens liens that become payable after the after
         the Cut-Off Date of the related Mortgage Loan).

                                   SCHEDULE II

                   GROUND LEASE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         With respect to each Mortgage Loan secured by a leasehold interest
(except with respect to any Mortgage Loan also secured by a fee interest in the
related Mortgaged Property), the Seller represents and warrants the following
with respect to the related Ground Lease:

1.       Such Ground Lease or a memorandum thereof has been or will be duly
         recorded no later than 30 days after the Closing Date and such Ground
         Lease permits the interest of the lessee thereunder to be encumbered by
         the related Mortgage or, if consent of the lessor thereunder is
         required, it has been obtained prior to the Closing Date.

2.       Upon the foreclosure of the Mortgage Loan (or acceptance of a deed in
         lieu thereof), the Mortgagor's interest in such ground lease is
         assignable to the mortgagee under the leasehold estate and its assigns
         without the consent of the lessor thereunder (or, if any such consent
         is required, it has been obtained prior to the Closing Date).

3.       Such Ground Lease may not be amended, modified, canceled or terminated
         without the prior written consent of the mortgagee and any such action
         without such consent is not binding on the mortgagee, its successors or
         assigns, except termination or cancellation if (a) an event of default
         occurs under the Ground Lease, (b) notice thereof is provided to the
         mortgagee and (c) such default is curable by the mortgagee as provided
         in the Ground Lease but remains uncured beyond the applicable cure
         period.

4.       To the actual knowledge of the Seller, at the Closing Date, such Ground
         Lease is in full force and effect and other than payments due but not
         yet 30 days or more delinquent, (a) there is no material default, and
         (b) there is no event which, with the passage of time or with notice
         and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a
         material default under such Ground Lease.

5.       The ground lease or ancillary agreement between the lessor and the
         lessee requires the lessor to give notice of any default by the lessee
         to the mortgagee. The ground lease or ancillary agreement further
         provides that no notice given is effective against the mortgagee unless
         a copy has been given to the mortgagee in a manner described in the
         ground lease or ancillary agreement.

6.       The ground lease (a) is not subject to any liens or encumbrances
         superior to, or of equal priority with, the Mortgage, subject, however,
         to only the Title Exceptions or (b) is subject to a subordination,
         non-disturbance and attornment agreement to which the mortgagee on the
         lessor's fee interest in the Mortgaged Property is subject.

7.       A mortgagee is permitted a reasonable opportunity (including, where
         necessary, sufficient time to gain possession of the interest of the
         lessee under the ground lease) to cure any curable default under such
         Ground Lease before the lessor thereunder may terminate such Ground
         Lease.

                                      II-1
<PAGE>
8.       Such Ground Lease has an original term (together with any extension
