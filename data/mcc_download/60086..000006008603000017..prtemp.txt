  This will confirm our agreement that the Employment Agreement is amended as

  2.  You shall be paid a basic salary (the "Basic Salary") for your services
under and pursuant to the Employment Agreement at the rate of $800,000 per
annum for the extension period January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003.
Basic Salary shall be payable in accordance with the Company's customary
payroll practices for executives as in effect from time to time, and shall be
subject to such increases as the Board of Directors of the Company, in its
sole discretion, may from time to time determine. Such Basic Salary shall be
exclusive of fees received by you as a director and as a member of Committees
of the Boards of Directors of other corporations, including subsidiaries,
affiliates and investees of the Company.

  3.  In addition to receipt of Basic Salary under the Employment Agreement,
you shall participate in and shall receive incentive compensation under the

  4.  Incentive based compensation awarded in relation to applicable years
under the Compensation Plan shall be included in the computation of

from time to time.

  Except as herein modified or amended, the Employment Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect.

  If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, would you please
sign the enclosed duplicate copy of this Letter Agreement at the place
