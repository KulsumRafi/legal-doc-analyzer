                                 FIRST AMENDMENT
                                       TO
                           LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT

         This First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement is entered into as
of December 16, 2002 (the "Amendment"), by and between COMERICA BANK -
CALIFORNIA ("Bank") and AVISTAR COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION ("Borrower").

                                    RECITALS

         Borrower and Bank are parties to that certain Loan and Security
Agreement dated as of February 27, 2002, as amended (the "Agreement"). The
parties desire to amend the Agreement in accordance with the terms of this
Amendment.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

         1.       The following defined terms in Section 1.1 of the Agreement
are hereby added or amended to read as follows:

                           "Average Quarterly Balance" means the amount derived
         from adding the ending balance under the Revolving Line for each day in
         the quarter and dividing by the number of days in the quarter.

                           "Revolving Line" means a credit extension of up to
         Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000).

                           "Revolving Maturity Date" means December 15, 2003.

         2.       Section 2.1(a)(i) of the Agreement is hereby amended in its
entirety to read as follows:

                                    (i)      Subject to and upon the terms and
         conditions of this Agreement, Borrower may request Advances in an
         aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed the Revolving Line. Subject
         to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, amounts borrowed
         pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) may be repaid and reborrowed at any
         time prior to the Revolving Maturity Date, at which time all Advances
         under this Section 2.1(a) shall be immediately due and payable.
         Borrower may prepay any Advances without penalty or premium.

         3.       A new Section 2.1(c) is hereby added to the Agreement to read
as follows:

                  (c)      Foreign Exchange Sublimit. Provided that there is
         availability under the Revolving Line, Borrower may enter into foreign
         exchange forward contracts with the Bank under which Borrower commits
         to purchase from or sell to Bank a set amount of foreign currency more
         than one business day after the contract date (each, a "FX Forward
         Contract"). Availability under the Revolving Line shall be reduced by
         the Bank's exposure in connection with all outstanding FX Forward
         Contracts (collectively, the "FX Reserve"). Bank may terminate and/or
         demand cash security for the FX Forward Contracts if an Event of
         Default occurs or upon or after the Revolving Maturity Date. The terms
         and conditions (including repayment and fees) of such FX Forward
         Contracts shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Bank's
         standard forms of application and agreement for FX Forward Contracts,
         which Borrower hereby agrees to execute as a condition precedent to
         Bank's entry into any FX Forward Contract. Notwithstanding any of the
         foregoing, in no event shall the aggregate amount of all FX Forward
         Contracts entered into by Bank be such that the FX Reserve exceeds
         $25,000.

                                       1
