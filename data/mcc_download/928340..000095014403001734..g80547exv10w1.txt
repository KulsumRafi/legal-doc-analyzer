                  (d)      All accrued interest on the amount of such
                           Prepayment is paid at the same time.

SECTION 7.6

                                                                              16

         The foregoing notwithstanding, neither the requirement to provide the
Bank with at least five (5) Business Days notice nor the requirement that
Prepayments shall be in multiples of five hundred thousand Dollars ($500,000.00)
shall apply to any Prepayment resulting from the application by the Bank to the
outstanding principal of the relevant Loan of any casualty insurance proceeds or
compensation for compulsory acquisition by a Governmental Authority of any
Property.

SECTION 7.7       BUSINESS DAY

         Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due, or
whenever the last day of an Interest Period would otherwise occur, on a day
other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made, and the last day of such
Interest Period shall occur, on the next succeeding Business Day, and such
extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment
of interest, provided, however, if such extension would cause payment of
interest on or principal of loan portions to be made in the next following
calendar month, such payment shall be made on the preceding Business Day.

SECTION 7.8       INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION - FOREIGN CURRENCY

         This Loan Agreement is an international financial transaction.
Therefore, the payment in Dollars is an essential part of this contract and the
Borrower expressly undertakes to make all payments under this contract only in
said currency, this being an essential condition for the granting of the Loans,
The Borrower also acknowledges that its obligation to make payments in Dollars
will not be affected for any reason whatsoever and that it will not claim any
excuse or justification and waives expressly any right, advantage, exception,
defence, claim, counterclaim, suit or demand to or for paying in any other
currency, or to deliver a lesser amount or suspend payments or object to the
right of the Bank to be paid in Dollars.

SECTION 8.1       TAXES

                  (a)      Subject to clause 6.5(d) and 7.4, all payments to be
                           made by the Borrower to the Bank pursuant to this
                           Agreement or the Security Documents shall he made
                           free and clear of and without deduction for or on
                           account of Tax, unless such Borrower is required to
                           make such a payment subject to the deduction or
                           withholding of Tax (other than a tax imposed on the
                           net income of the Bank), and in which case the sum
                           payable by the Borrower in respect of which such
                           deduction or withholding is required to be made shall
                           be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that,
                           after the making of such deduction or withholding,
                           the Bank receives and retains (free from any
                           liability in respect of any such deduction or
                           withholding) a net sum equal to the sum which it
                           would have received and so retained had no such
                           deduction or withholding been made or required to be
                           made.

                  (b)      Without prejudice to the provisions of Section
                           8.l(a), if the Bank is required to make any payment
                           on account of Tax or otherwise (not being a Tax
                           imposed on its net income of the Bank) on or in
                           relation to any sum received or receivable hereunder
                           by the Bank (including, without limitation, any sum
                           received or receivable under this Section 8) or any
                           liability in respect of any such payment is asserted,
                           imposed, levied or assessed against the Bank, the
                           Borrower shall, upon demand of the Bank, promptly
                           indemnify the Bank against such payment or liability,
                           together with any interest, penalties and expenses
                           payable or incurred in connection therewith.

                  (c)      If the Bank intends to make a claim pursuant to
                           Section 8.l(b), then it shall; (i) notify the
                           Borrower of the event by reason of which it is
                           entitled to do so; and (ii) use commercially
                           reasonable efforts to file any

                                                                              18

                           certificate or document reasonably requested by the
                           Borrower if the making of such filing would avoid the
                           need for or reduce the amount of any such indemnity
                           payment or additional amount which may thereafter
                           accrue and such filing change is not, in the
                           determination of the Bank, inconsistent with that
                           Bank's internal policies.

SECTION 8.2       TAX RECEIPTS

                  (a)      If, at any time, the Borrower is required by law to
                           make any deduction or withholding from any sum
                           payable by it hereunder (or if thereafter there is
                           any (change in the rates at which or the manner in
                           which such deductions or withholdings are
                           calculated), it shall promptly notify the Bank.

                  (b)      If the Borrower makes any payment hereunder in
                           respect of which it is required to make any deduction
                           or withholding, it shall pay the full amount
                           required to be deducted or withheld to the relevant
                           taxation or other authority within the time allowed
                           for such payment under applicable law and shall
                           deliver to the Bank, upon the Bank's request, an
                           original receipt (or a certified copy thereof) issued
                           by such authority evidencing the payment to such
                           authority of all amounts so required to be deducted
                           or withheld in respect of such payment.

SECTION 9.1       INCREASED COSTS

                  (a)      If, by reason of;

                           (i)      The introduction of or any future change
                                    (including, without limitation, any change
                                    by way of imposition or increase of any

                                                                              19

                                    interpretation of any Cayman law or
                                    regulation, or

                           (ii)     The compliance with any future guideline or
                                    request from any central bank or other
                                    Governmental Authority (whether or not
                                    having the force of law),

                           there shall be any increase in the cost to the Bank
                           of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining
                           any of the Loans made to the Borrower hereunder,
                           including any increase in the cost of making
                           continuing or maintaining the Loans as LIBO Rate
                           Loans and including, without limitation, and any such
                           cost (i) results from (a) the imposition or amendment
                           of any Tax; or (b) the imposition or amendment of any
                           reserve, special deposit or similar requirement
                           against assets of, liabilities of, deposits with or
                           for the account of, or loans by the Bank, other than
                           a requirement resulting from or specifically
                           attributable to any change in the constitution or
                           financial condition of the Bank, and (ii) results in
                           an increase in cost or reduction in profit to the
                           Bank by an amount reasonably deemed material by the
                           Bank, then the Borrower shall, from time to time on
                           demand of the Bank, promptly pay it the Bank amounts
                           sufficient to indemnify the Bank against such
                           increased cost; provided, however, that the Bank is
                           then seeking reimbursement with respect to
                           substantially all other similar loans it has
                           outstanding to other borrowers of a class similar to
                           the Borrower.

                  (b)      If the Bank intends to make a claim pursuant to
                           Section 9.l(a), it shall promptly notify the Borrower
                           of the event by reason of which it is entitled to do
                           so, such notice to state, in reasonable detail, the
                           reasons therefore and the additional amount required
                           fully to compensate the Bank for such

                                                                              20

SECTION 9.2       ILLEGALITY

         If, at any time, it is unlawful for the Bank to make, fund or allow to
remain outstanding all or any of the Loans made by it hereunder, then the Bank
shall, promptly after becoming aware of the same, deliver to the Borrower a
certificate to that effect and the Bank shall not thereafter be obliged to make
any Advances hereunder and the amount of the Loans remaining available for
drawing shall be immediately reduced to zero.

                      LIBOR, FIXED RATE FUNDING PROVISIONS

SECTION 10.1      LIBO RATE LENDING UNLAWFUL

         If the Bank shall determine (which determination shall, so long as the
Bank shall then be taking the same action with respect to substantially all
other similar loans it may have outstanding to other borrowers, upon notice
thereof to the Borrower be conclusive and binding on the Borrower) that the
introduction of, or any change in, or in the interpretation of, any Cayman
Islands law makes it unlawful, or Governmental Authority asserts that it is
unlawful, for the Bank to make, continue, or maintain any Loan as, or to convert
any Loan into, a LIBO Rate Loan, the obligations of the Bank to make, continue,
maintain or convert such Loan shall, upon such determination, forthwith be
suspended until the Bank shall notify the Borrower that the circumstances
causing such suspension no longer exist, and all LIBO Rate Loans shall
automatically convert into loans on which interest shall be calculated and
accrue at the Alternative Rate or at the Substitute Basis as hereinafter
provided, which conversion shall be effective at the end of the then current
Interest Periods with respect thereto or sooner, if required by such law or
assertion.

SECTION 10.2      ALTERNATIVE INTEREST RATES

                                                                              21
<PAGE>
         If the principle London, England office of The Bank of Nova Scotia
determines that at 1 1:OO a.m. two (2) Business Days prior to an Interest
Period, no LIBO Rate is quoted for the proposed duration of such Interest Period
for an applicable Advance, then:

                  (a)      The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such
                           event specifying in reasonable detail the
                           circumstances of such event;

                  (b)      the duration of that Interest Period shall be one (1)
                           month or less, such that it shall not end after the
                           Repayment Date; and

                  (c)      the rate of interest applicable to such Advance
                           during such Interest Period shall be the rate per
                           annum which is the sum of the Applicable Margin and
                           the rate per annum determined by the Bank to be the
                           arithmetic mean (rounded upwards, if not already such
                           a multiple, to the nearest whole multiple of
                           one-hundredth of one percent(100(th) of 1%) of the
                           rate or rates of the Bank which express as a
                           percentage rate per annum the Bank's lowest cost
                           alternate source of funding for commercial loans
                           comparable to such Advance during such Interest
                           Period,

         provided, however, that (b) and (c) shall not apply if the Bank and the
Borrower agree on a Substitute Basis in accordance with Section 10.3.

SECTION 10.3      SUBSTITUTE LENDING RATE

         If, (i) the event mentioned in Section 10.2 occurs, or (ii) by reason
of circumstances affecting the London Interbank Market during any period of
three (3) consecutive Business Days, no LIBO Rate is published in the London
Interbank Market, then:

                  (a)      The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such
                           event specifying in

                                                                              22
<PAGE>
                           reasonable detail the circumstances of such event;

                  (b)      if the Bank or Borrower so requires, within five
                           (5)days of such notification, the Bank and the
                           Borrower shall enter into negotiations with a view to
                           agreeing a Substitute Basis, (i) for determining the
                           rates of interest from time to time applicable to the
                           affected Advances, and/or (ii) upon which the
                           Advances may be maintained thereafter and any such
                           Substitute Basis that is agreed shall take effect in
                           accordance with its terms and be binding on each
                           party hereto; and

                  (c)      if the Bank and Borrower have not reached agreement
                           on the last day of the then current Interest Period
                           applicable to the affected Advance, the Alternative
                           Rate shall thereafter apply to the affected Advance
                           until such time as the condition which resulted in
                           the change of interest rate pursuant to Section 10.2
                           no longer exists. The Bank agrees to give the
                           Borrower prompt notice as to the non-existence of
                           such condition and the Borrower shall thereafter have
                           the right to borrow at a rate fixed to the LIBO Rate.

SECTION 10.4      FUNDING LOSSES

         In the event the Bank shall incur any loss or expense (including any
loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or re-employment of
deposits or other funds acquired by the Bank to make, continue or maintain any
portion of the principal amount of any Loan as, or to convert any portion of the
principal amount of any loan into, a LIBO Rate Loan) as a result of:

                  (a)      Any conversion or repayment or Prepayment of the
                           principal amount of any Fixed Rate Loans and/or LIBO

                           day of the Interest Period applicable thereto;

                                                                              23
<PAGE>
                  (b)      any Loans not being made as LIBO Rate Loans or Fixed
                           Rate Loans in accordance with the Draw down Notice
                           therefore due to the acts or omissions of the
                           Borrower;

                  (c)      any Loans not being continued as, or converted into,
                           LIBO Rate Loans or Fixed Rate Loans in accordance

                           Matters"); provided, that the Borrower shall not have
                           any obligation under this Section to any Indemnitee
                           with respect to any Indemnified Matter caused by or

                           investigation, litigation or proceeding set forth in

                           remedial, removal or response action. In the event
                           that such Indemnitee requests the Borrower to defend
                           against such investigation, litigation or proceeding
                           or requested remedial, removal or response action,
                           the Borrower shall promptly do so with legal counsel
                           of the Borrower's choice reasonably acceptable to the
                           Bank, and such Indemnitee shall have the right to
                           participate in such defence. If however there is a
                           conflict of interest between the Bank and the
                           Borrower, then the Bank shall be entitled, for the
                           cost of the Borrower, to appoint legal counsel of its
                           choice. No action taken by legal counsel chosen by

                           defending against any such investigation, litigation
                           or proceeding or requested remedial, removal or
                           response action shall vitiate or in any way impair
                           the Borrower's obligation hereunder to indemnify and
                           hold harmless such Indemnitee.

                  (d)      The Borrower shall give the Bank reasonable prior
                           notice of any proposed settlement, compromise or
                           similar disposition by the Borrower of any
                           investigation, litigation or proceeding pursuant to
                           which the Borrower has an obligation to defend, and
                           take reasonable and due cognisance of any of the
                           Bank's views.

                  (e)      The obligations of the Borrower under this Section
                           15.12 shall survive the repayment of the Loan.

                           of action arose prior to the Bank

                                                                              47

         Except in the instances set forth in subsections a) and b) above, in

so, at its election, but without the obligation so to do, give such notices
and/or cause such work to be performed at the Property and/or take any and all
other actions as the Bank shall deem necessary or advisable in order to comply
with all Environmental Laws, and any amounts paid as a result thereof, together

the Borrower to the Bank and until paid shall be added to and become a part of

                           such proceedings. The Bank, at its election and in
                           its discretion, may participate in any such
                           proceedings and the Borrower from time to time shall
                           deliver to the Bank all instruments requested by it
                           to permit such participation. All expropriation
                           payments in relation to the Property or any portion
                           thereof, shall be paid in accordance with the
                           provisions of this Section. All expropriation
                           payments in relation to the Property, or any part of
                           the foregoing, are hereby assigned to and shall be
                           paid to the Bank. The: Borrower, upon the request by

                           charges or encumbrances of any kind or nature

                           to give proper receipts and acquittances therefore
                           and in the Bank's sole discretion to apply the same
                           toward the payment of the Loans, notwithstanding the
                           fact that the Loans may not then be due and payable,
                           or to the purchase of replacement assets and
                           property.

                           expropriated by any Governmental Authority, or if any
                           part thereof shall be so expropriated and the
                           Borrower cannot feasibly continue to operate its
                           business with the part thereof not so expropriated
                           (the foregoing being referred to as a "Complete
                           Taking"), then, any payment payable in connection
                           therewith shall be paid to the Bank and applied as

                           maturity date charges, if any; second, to accrued and
                           unpaid interest; third, to the reduction of the
                           principal amount of the Loans; fourth, to any other

                           of any payment remaining thereafter shall be paid to
                           the Borrower.

                           event, if any claim with priority to the security
                           interest created by the Security Documents shall be
                           upheld by any court of competent jurisdiction or

                           iii) any other material agreement or instrument to
                           which Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party, and such
                           failure has a Material Adverse Effect on the
                           Borrower;

                  (r)      without the prior written consent of the Bank, the
                           Borrower ceases to carry on the business it carries
                           on at the date hereof or enters into any unrelated
                           business;

                  (s)      there is a change in the Borrower or any Subsidiary
                           which has a Material Adverse Effect; and

                  (t)      Any part of the Bridge Loan remains outstanding and
                           unpaid to the Bank at the end of the six (6) month

                           (30) Business Days from the end of such term, been
                           up-stamped by the amount of the Bridge Loan which
                           remains outstanding at that time.

SECTION 17.2      ACCELERATION

                  (a)      If any Event of Default occurs, the Bank may, at its
                           option, and without notice to the Borrower, after
                           expiration of any applicable cure period; a) declare
                           the balance owing under the Loans to be immediately
                           due and payable including any accrued interest,
                           commission, costs and any other

                                                                              59

                           amounts due pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;
                           and b) declare that any undrawn portion of the Loans
                           shall be cancelled; provided, however, that in the

                           relief with respect to the Borrower under the
                           applicable laws of Cayman regarding bankruptcy,
                           reorganization or judicial administration, the
                           balance of the Loans, together with interest and all
                           such amounts shall automatically become and be due

                           Period of three months or less.

                  (c)      Thereafter the Bank may proceed to exercise all its
                           rights and recourses granted to it by the law, to
                           enforce collection by summary proceedings or
                           otherwise, to foreclose any and all warranties,
                           without being required to present any request,
                           demand, protest or notification of any kind and to
                           enforce any Guarantee at its option.

SECTION 17.3      SET OFF

                           Bank, following an Event of Default, the Bank may, at
                           its option, combine, consolidate or merge all or any
                           of the Borrower's accounts with any liabilities to
                           the Bank, and may set off or transfer any sum
                           standing to the credit of any such accounts in or
                           towards the satisfaction of any of the Borrower's
                           liabilities to the Bank under this Agreement, and may
                           do so notwithstanding that the balance on such
                           accounts and liabilities may not

                                                                              60

                           on behalf of the Borrower by any branch of the Bank
                           wheresoever situated shall be treated as if such
                           accounts, monies or investments were held by the Bank
                           and the rights of the Bank under sub section (a)
                           above shall apply to such accounts, monies or
                           investments as if they were held by the Bank.

                           any part thereof, as to which the certificate of the
                           Bank shall, in

                                                                              61

                           the absence of manifest error, be conclusive; and

                  (c)      such indemnity shall include all reasonable legal

SECTION 18.1      COSTS AND EXPENSES

                  (a)      The Borrower shall forthwith on demand of the Bank
                           and whether or not the Loans are disbursed, pay to
                           the Bank such amounts as are necessary fully to
                           reimburse the Bank for all the customary costs,
                           charges and expenses (including, without limitation,
                           external and in house legal fees and expenses),
                           communication, travel and all other out-of-pocket
                           expenses incurred in the preparation, execution,

                           Agreement ( including the costs of a Receiver) and
                           the Security Documents.

                  (b)      In addition to the amount contemplated in sub-section

                           the registration, recording and other like
                           governmental fees, if any, to which this Agreement,
                           the Security Documents or any other document or
                           instrument issued in relation herewith may be subject
                           or give rise to.

                                                                              62

                           the Bank, reimburse the Bank for all expenses

                           Environmental Laws, policies or guidelines which may
                           have occurred or as a result of any environmental
                           remedial action taken by the Bank on behalf of the
                           Borrower. In the event that the Borrower does not
                           provide immediate reimbursement, the Bank shall be
                           entitled to add all expenses arising pursuant hereto
                           to the principal outstanding under the Loans and all
                           amounts arising hereunder shall apply mutatis
                           mutandis to the provisions of this Agreement relating
                           to outstanding principal.

                           such expenses.

                  (e)      The obligations of the Borrower under this Section
                           shall survive the repayment of the Loans and the

                           payable hereunder.

SECTION 18.2      NO JOINT VENTURE

         Nothing herein contained shall constitute or be construed to be or to
create a joint venture and or a partnership between the Borrower and the Bank.
The Bank does not assume and shall not bear any business risks directly or
indirectly related to the Borrower.

SECTION 18.3      BANK'S OPTION RIGHT TO PAY OR PERFORM IN BORROWER'S STEAD

         The Borrower agrees that, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default
the Bank shall have the right without notice to the Borrower to advance all or
any part of amounts owing or to perform any or all required actions. No such
advance or performance shall be deemed to have cured such

                                                                              63
<PAGE>
default by the Borrower or any Event of Default with respect thereto. All sums
advanced and all expenses incurred by the Bank in connection with such advances
or actions, and all other sums advanced or expenses incurred by the Bank
hereunder or under applicable law (whether required or optional and whether
indemnified hereunder or not) shall bear interest at the post-maturity rate as .
set out in Section 6.4 hereof, be reimbursed by Borrower, and shall be secured
by the Charge and Debenture. The Borrower hereby appoints the Bank its true and
lawful attorney-in-fact to make the payments and effect the performance
contemplated by the aforesaid provisions of this Section in the name and on
behalf of the Borrower. This power, being coupled with an interest, shall be
irrevocable so long as any amounts shall remain unpaid.

SECTION 18.4      ASSIGNMENT, PARTICIPATION BY THE BANK

         The Bank may, at no cost to the Borrower, assign to one or more banks
or other Persons, or may grant participations to one or more banks or other

obligations under the Security Documents.

SECTION 18.5      PUBLICITY

                  The Bank shall, upon obtaining the prior written consent of
the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, have the
right to publicize that it has granted financing to the Borrower.

SECTION 18.6      SEVERABILITY

         Any provision of this Agreement that is held to be inoperative,
unenforceable or invalid in whole or in part as to any party or in any
jurisdiction shall, as to that party or jurisdiction, be inoperative,
unenforceable or invalid to such extent without affecting the remaining
provisions or the operation, enforceability or validity of that provision as to
the other party or in any other

                                                                              64
<PAGE>
jurisdiction and to this end, the provisions of this Agreement are declared to
be severable.

SECTION 18.7      NO WAIVER, CUMULATIVE REMEDIES

                  (a)      No failure or delay by the Bank in exercising any
                           right, remedy, power or privilege under this
                           Agreement or any of the other Security Documents
                           shall operate as a waiver thereof. The partial or
                           single exercise of any right, remedy, power or
                           privilege under this Agreement or any of the other
                           Security Documents shall not operate as a waiver or
                           as an estoppel regarding any rights under the same.
                           All rights and remedies provided in this Agreement
                           and the other Security Documents are cumulative and
                           may be exercised contemporaneously or successively,
                           and are in addition and not exclusive of any other
                           rights and remedies provided by law.

                  (b)      Any waiver by either party of a breach of any part of
                           this Agreement caused by the other party will not
                           operate as or be interpreted as a waiver of any other
                           breach. The failure of a party to insist on strict
                           adherence to any term of the Agreement on one or more
                           occasions is not to be considered to be a waiver of
                           any of its rights under this Agreement or to deprive
                           that party of the right to insist upon strict
                           adherence to that term or any other term in the
                           future. No waiver shall be of any effect unless it is
                           in writing and authenticated by the waiving party.

SECTION 18.8      SURVIVAL

         All representations and warranties made by the Borrower in this
Agreement and the other Security Documents, its covenants and undertakings
therein, shall survive the execution of the same and the disbursements of the
Loans, and shall continue in full force and effect until the Loans are

                                                                              65
<PAGE>
paid in full, all for a period exceeding such payment in the cases so
established in this Agreement.

SECTION 18.9      JUDGMENT CURRENCY

         If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court or for any other
purpose hereunder it is necessary to convert an amount due hereunder in the
currency in which it is due (the "Original Currency") into another currency (the
"Judgement Currency"), the rate of exchange applied shall be that at which, in
accordance with normal banking procedures, the Bank could purchase, in the New
York foreign exchange market, at the Bank's option, the Original Currency with
the Judgement Currency on the date two Business Days preceding that on which
judgment is given. The Borrower agrees that its obligation in respect of any
Original Currency due from it to the Bank shall, notwithstanding any judgment of
payment in such other currency, be discharged only to the extent that, on the
Business Day following receipt of any sum so paid or adjudged to be due
hereunder in the Judgement Currency, the Bank may, in accordance with normal
banking procedures, purchase, in the New York foreign exchange markets, the
Original Currency with the amount of the Judgement Currency so paid or so
adjudged to be due; and, if the amount of the Original Currency so purchased is
less than the amount originally due in the Original Currency, the Borrower
agrees as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such payment or judgment
to indemnify the Bank against such loss.

SECTION 18.10     NOTICES

         All notices, requests, consents, demands, directions, agreements or
other instruments or communications between the Bank and the Borrower required
to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be; (a) sent by private
courier service, next day delivery, or by telefax, or other similar form of
rapid transmission, confirmed by sending (by private courier service, next day
delivery) written confirmation; or (b) personally delivered to the receiving
party or, if not an individual, to an officer or general partner of the
