         COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, INC., a Delaware corporation, having its

         corporation organized under the laws of Geneva, and having its
         principal place of business at 29 Route de l'Aeroport, Case Postale
         105, CH-1215, Geneva 15, Switzerland, (collectively "Supplier")
         ("Supplier"), effective as of December 16, 2002, (the "Effective
         Date"). The parties hereby agree as follows:

1.       SCOPE OF AGREEMENT

         1.1      General. This Agreement specifies the terms and conditions
                  under which Supplier will sell, license, and support the OEM
                  Products listed in Exhibit (A) to this Agreement. The OEM
                  Products are regarded as "Original Equipment Manufacturer"
                  products that will either be sold separately or incorporated
                  into HP Products for resale worldwide under HP's private label
                  or [*] under Supplier's label, as set forth herein. The OEM
                  Products and the HP Products will be marketed, serviced, and
                  supported by HP's field organization and channel partners,
                  subject to the marketing, service, and support obligations of
                  Supplier pursuant to this Agreement.

         1.2      Eligible Purchasers. This Agreement enables HP [*] to purchase
                  OEM Products from Supplier under the terms of this Agreement
                  or any subsequent Product Addendum. The terms and conditions
                  of this Agreement will control and take precedence over any
                  conflicting terms in a Product Addendum unless a subsequently
                  executed OEM Product addendum specifically refers to and
                  amends a term of this Agreement.

         1.3      Term Of Agreement. This Agreement will commence as of the
                  Effective Date and continue for a two-year period (the
                  "Term"), unless terminated earlier under the terms of this
                  Agreement. [*] This Agreement may be terminated at the end of
                  the initial Term or at the end of any subsequent renewal
                  period if one party provides the other at least [*] prior
                  written notice of its intent to terminate.

         1.4      [*] Volume. [*] in this Agreement [*] HP to purchase any [*]
                  quantity of OEM Products. This Agreement sets forth the terms
                  and conditions during the Term which govern Orders and
                  acknowledgments for OEM Products. Any Order or acknowledgment
                  or other legally binding volume commitment for Product which
                  is entered during the Term will remain governed by this
                  Agreement notwithstanding expiration or termination of this
                  Agreement for any reason. Unless otherwise agreed, if HP
                  fails, for any reason or no reason, to purchase committed
                  volume, Supplier's sole and exclusive remedy will be to [*],
                  except that HP will have [*] within which to purchase Product
                  at the then current volume

                  requirements at the time of manufacture, HP and Supplier will

                  requirements. HP's right of inspection will apply as well[*].
                  Supplier will inform [*] of HP's right to inspect, and, if
                  necessary, use all reasonable efforts to secure such rights
                  for HP.

                  (6)      [*].

         9.2      OEM Product [*] Warranties. Supplier represents and warrants
                  with regard to all OEM Products (including Software and
                  Documentation to the extent included with, licensed, or
                  distributed in conjunction with OEM Products) that, subject to
                  the terms and conditions of Article (15) herein, not to
                  Supplier's reasonable knowledge, violate or infringe any third
                  party Intellectual Property Rights and Supplier warrants that
                  it is not aware of any facts upon which such claim could be
                  made. If Supplier learns of any claim or any facts upon which
                  claim could be made, it will promptly notify HP of such
                  information.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a breach of this Section 9.2 in
                  no way constitutes a material breach of the Agreement. If
                  Supplier breaches this intellectual property warranty, HP may
                  immediately [*] and may immediately cancel any unfilled
                  accepted Orders without liability, such remedies being in
                  addition to any other remedies provided by this Agreement, or
                  otherwise available to HP under law or equity, subject to the
                  limitation of liability in Article (23) below. If a U.S.
                  District Court or any court worldwide adjudges that Product,
                  or any item or part thereof, infringes any United States
                  Patent or any patent worldwide, irrespective of whether
                  further right of appeal lies available to Supplier, or if
                  Product or use is enjoined at any stage of the proceedings,
                  any unfilled Accepted Orders [*] without liability for HP.
                  Supplier will have responsibility and is obligated for a
                  breach of the foregoing warranty to the extent that any
                  Product is used in an infringing system and the Product does
                  not have a substantially non-infringing use.

         9.3      Warranty Periods. All warranties set forth in Sections 9.1 and
                  9.2 above will [*] payment by HP. The warranties set forth in
                  Sections 9.1(2) and 9.1(5) are effective upon Delivery, are
                  continuing, and will remain in effect for the longer of
                  Supplier's normal warranty period or as stated in Exhibit (H)
                  following acceptance of the OEM Product. All warranties set
                  forth in Section 9.2 are effective at Delivery, are
                  continuing, and will remain in effect [*].

         9.4      Software and Documentation Warranty. If Product includes or
                  constitutes Software, Supplier provides additional warranties,
                  and warrants Software and related Documentation as set forth
                  in Exhibit (I).

         9.5      Services and Support Warranty. Supplier warrants that all
                  Services and Support will be provided in a professional and

                  possessing suitable expertise in the subject matter.

                  comply with Applicable Law in its performance under this
                  Agreement.

         9.7      Warranty Exclusions. The warranties specifically set forth in
                  Section 9.1(1-5) will not apply to any OEM Product or Parts to
                  the extent such OEM Product or Parts: (i) have been improperly
                  installed, repaired, altered, or otherwise modified (other
                  than by Supplier or Supplier's authorized Subcontractors);
                  (ii) have been subjected to misuse, abuse, negligence or
                  accident; (iii) have been used in a manner contrary to
                  Specifications or Supplier's written instructions or
                  Documentation; (iv) are comprised of materials provided or a
                  design stipulated by HP and not approved by Supplier in

                  may have waived Section 9.1 in a particular instance), and do
                  not cover normal wear and tear.

         9.8      DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT,
                  SUPPLIER MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
                  REGARDING PRODUCT INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
                  ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

         9.9      [*] Warranty. In addition to the warranties specified above,
                  Supplier warrants to HP all OEM Products [*] against [*] for a
                  period of [*] after [*] of such OEM Product unit. An [*]
                  means:

                  (a)      unit failures that (i) are caused by [*] failure or
                  defect, provided that such failure or defect is attributable
                  to Supplier, and (ii) [*] [*] of the [*] (as listed in Exhibit
                  (H), Section 4.1), [*] [*] [*] , or;

                  (b)      the occurrence of more than one failure classified as
                  a Hazard Class (2) or higher safety incident defined as (i) a
                  [*] condition that is likely to produce [*] bodily injury or

                  standard, license, or testing agency evaluation, or;

                  significant risk to the health or safety of individuals who
                  operate the OEM Product or to the continuous business
                  operations of companies or organizations that employ the OEM
                  Product for an intended or reasonably foreseeable use.

10.      SUPPORT SERVICES

         10.1     General. Supplier will provide trained HP support personnel
                  with Support for the OEM Products as specified in Exhibit (D).
                  Supplier will maintain such number of qualified personnel as
                  is necessary to provide timely and knowledgeable maintenance
                  and support service in accordance with the terms and
                  conditions of Exhibit (D). Supplier warrants that all Support
                  will be provided in a professional and workmanlike manner. HP
                  will provide direct maintenance and support to HP's customers
                  with respect to the use of the OEM Product as distributed with
                  HP Products. Supplier and HP will maintain and support each
                  OEM Product distributed by HP for [*] and [*] after the date
                  of last Shipment Date by Supplier to [*] [*] of each OEM
                  Product unit. HP acknowledges that Supplier may independently
                  offer and provide support services to OEM Product customers;
                  however, in no event may Supplier use HP Confidential
                  Information or HP Property to direct or provide such support
                  without HP's prior consent. Response times and problem
                  classification for the OEM Products are as set forth in
                  Exhibit (D).

         10.2     New HP Products. Upon request by HP, Supplier will use
                  reasonable efforts to provide HP with the OEM Products adapted
                  for use with new releases of HP Products within timeframes and
                  at such additional costs, if any, to be negotiated by the
                  parties, provided that HP makes available to Supplier such HP
                  Property as may be reasonably necessary for Supplier to
                  develop any adaptation.

         10.3     New Product Supply Assurance. Supplier agrees that, during the
                  term of the Agreement and any extensions thereof, any such
                  newer products will be made available to HP for shipment [*]
                  the [*] date made [*] by Supplier to [*] with [*] volumes of
                  OEM Products (as measured over Supplier's most recent [*]),
                  and shall be made available to HP in [*] quantity to
                  accommodate all HP Orders within Forecast designating such
                  newer products. In the event of any allocated OEM product
                  status initiated by Supplier, Supplier will [*] give all HP
                  Orders [*] and [*] than that given to Supplier's [*] with [*]
                  volumes of OEM Products (as measured over Supplier's most
                  [*]), with such [*] to be made on a [*] between HP and
                  Supplier's [*].

         10.4     HP Property. HP may, at HP's sole election, provide to
                  Supplier HP Property under the terms of an HP Equipment Loan
                  Agreement attached as Exhibit (E) to this Agreement, solely
                  for use in Supplier's manufacturing, testing, adapting and

                  supporting the OEM Products. All HP Property will be clearly
                  segregated from Supplier's property and identified as the sole
                  property of HP. HP Property may not be transferred, assigned,
                  loaned or otherwise encumbered in any way. HP Property may be
                  provided to third parties for fulfillment of Supplier's
                  obligations hereunder only upon HP's prior written consent. HP
                  property will be returned to HP, [*], upon termination of this
                  Agreement.

         10.5     Substitute Products. If Supplier develops any generally
                  available products that are to replace the OEM Product(s) or
                  that are the same or substantially similar to the OEM Products
                  available under this Agreement, HP will have the right to
                  substitute the newer products at [*] as the substantially
                  similar OEM Products for all subsequent purchases under this
                  Agreement. Such substitute products must be compatible with
                  the current version of the OEM Products.

         10.6     Failure Rate. Notwithstanding that the warranties given in
                  Section 9.1 above apply to [*] of the hardware components of
                  OEM Products, Supplier and HP acknowledge that a failure rate
                  equivalent to the rates as measured over [*] set forth in
                  Section 4.1 of Exhibit (H) is expected. If the actual failure
                  rate for OEM Products exceeds this expected rate, Supplier
                  will provide additional engineering and technical support
                  needed to bring the actual failure rate within the specified
                  failure rate.

         10.7     Class Failure Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any of the
                  following events: (i) a failure rate exceeding[*]; (ii) [*];
                  or (iii) a safety standard change under Section 7.5 above
                  (each referred to as a "Class Failure"), HP will have the
                  following additional remedies for a [*] period after [*] of
                  such OEM Product unit(s):

                  (1)      In the event of a Class Failure, Supplier will use
                           its reasonable efforts to provide a initial root
                           cause analysis, failure analysis, and corrective
                           action plan to HP no later than [*] following the
                           receipt of the Class Failure part. HP will make
                           available such information and assistance as
                           reasonably required to allow Supplier to conduct its
                           root cause analysis and provide its corrective action
                           plan.

                  (2)      If, after review of the root cause analysis and
                           corrective action plan, [*] determines in its [*]
                           opinion that the Class Failure necessitates [*] may
                           then elect to have the OEM products: (i) returned to
                           Supplier for repair or replacement; (ii) repaired or
                           replaced by Supplier in the field; or (iii) repaired
                           or replaced by HP in the field, including products in
                           distributor inventory and HP's installed base. [*]
                           perform a field repair, [*] the appropriate
                           replacement OEM products, spares, or upgrades [*]

                           and will, within [*] after completion[*]. Supplier
                           will give such OEM products, spares, or upgrades
                           Supplier's [*] [*] [*].

         10.8     Survival Of Support Obligations. Supplier's maintenance and
                  support obligations specified in this Article (10), and in the
                  Support Terms in Exhibit (D) will run for the Term and any
                  additional periods under Section 1.3 above and will continue
                  for a period of [*] after the date of last Shipment Date by
                  Supplier to [*] [*] of each OEM Product unit. This obligation
                  includes, without limitation, making necessary Parts available
                  to HP as further provided in the Support Terms.

11.      OBSOLESCENCE AND MANUFACTURING RIGHTS

         11.1     [*] Rightst. In the event HP becomes entitled to terminate
                  this Agreement [*] in accordance with Article (20) hereunder,
                  then Supplier shall [*] [*] to [*] purchase orders [*] OEM
                  Products at the [*] [*] Supplier can demonstrate to HP's
                  reasonable satisfaction that its performance is no longer
                  impaired. This Section is not intended to [*] [*] a
                  royalty-free license to use, manufacture, sell or import the
                  Products. Instead, it is intended to permit [*] [*] Products
                  [*] [*] in limited circumstances; under such circumstances,
                  [*] will [*] [*] [*] set forth hereunder for the OEM Products
                  ordered pursuant to this Section.

         11.2     [*] Rights. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
                  Agreement and specifically that of Section 19.1 below,
                  Supplier acknowledges its obligation to manufacture, supply,
                  and support the OEM Products [*]. If, however, after [*] of
                  such products, Supplier seeks to discontinue the supply or
                  support of any OEM Product (a "Discontinued Product"),
                  Supplier will give notice to HP no less than [*] in advance of
                  the last date the Discontinued Product can be ordered. After
                  receipt of notice of discontinuance, HP may, at its option:

                  (1)      [*] [*] [*] [*] as set forth in [*] above if during
                           [*] such product discontinuance event occurs, or;

                  (2)      In accordance with the terms and conditions of this
                           Section 11.2, place orders for any demand during the
                           [*] of such notice for delivery of Discontinued
                           Products prior to the end of the notice period. To
                           the extent that such orders exceed HP's previous
                           Forecast for such Discontinued Products, the orders
                           shall be non-cancelable. Supplier shall accept only

                  (i)      any [*];

                  (ii)     any combination of any [*] with an [*] in an
                  application which is intended by Supplier or reasonably
                  inferable as intended by Supplier from Specifications,
                  Supplier's written designs or Documentation, where there is no
                  substantial non-infringing use of the indemnified Product
                  other than as part of that combination;

                  (iii)    any [*];

                  (iv)     any [*];

                  (vii)    anything else (including [*]) provided as part of
                           [*];

                  or use of any of the foregoing, constitutes an [*] "IP
                  Claim"). Supplier will have the same duty [*] as set forth in
                  the previous sentence in cases where any of the following

                  [*] [*] ; (b) [*] is a direct infringer; (e) [*] is a
                  contributory infringer; or (d) [*] has induced infringement.
                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Supplier
                  will pay [*] incurred by Indemnitees and will pay any[*].

         15.2     HP's Duty to Notify. HP will give Supplier [*] notice of any
                  IP Claim. If Supplier assumes defense of such IP Claim without
                  reservation of rights, HP will provide Supplier the authority,
                  information and reasonable assistance (at [*] expense)
                  necessary to defend. Supplier will control defense, and HP
                  will not settle such IP Claim without Supplier's consent, [*];
                  provided that if Supplier does not diligently pursue
                  resolution of such IP Claim or fails to provide HP, upon
                  request at any time and from time to time, with reasonable
                  assurance that it will diligently pursue resolution, then HP
                  may, without in any way limiting its other rights and
                  remedies, defend the claim [*]. Any settlement or compromise
                  Supplier desires to enter into will be [*]. HP and any other
                  Indemnitee may, in its or their discretion, participate in the
                  defense of such IP Claim.

         15.3     Actions After Injunction or Order. If the use or combination
                  of any Product is enjoined, if the combination of any Product
                  with an HP Product is enjoined where such combination is
                  intended by Supplier or reasonably inferable from
                  Specifications, Supplier's written designs or Documentation or
                  if a court or government agency enters an injunction or order
                  forbidding the importing of any Product or preventing the
                  Delivery of any Product to HP (any of which Product being
                  referred to as "Infringing Product"), Supplier [*], as may be
                  reasonable under the facts and circumstances and within a [*]
                  time, [*], and having reviewed its options with HP:

                  Product acceptable to HP and of equivalent form, fit, function
                  and performance;

                  15.3.3   Modify the Infringing Product to be non-infringing,

                  and performance from a third party supplier on HP's approved
                  vendor list at the time of the infringement and pay to HP the
                  sum of: (a) [*].

                  If none of the foregoing options is commercially achievable,
                  HP may return the affected Product, and Supplier will [*] with
                  respect thereto.

                  In addition to the above, Supplier will pay HP [*]. If a
                  change in any Product or the use thereof is required due to an
                  IP Claim, Supplier will [*] HP for its [*] in procuring a
                  reasonable substitute product, including [*].

         15.4     Limitations. Nothing in this Article (15) applies to any
                  Product or Parts to the extent such Product or Parts (i) have
                  been improperly installed, repaired, altered or otherwise
                  modified (other than by Supplier or Supplier's authorized
                  Subcontractors), (ii) have be subjected to misuse, abuse,
                  negligence or accident, (iii) have been used in a manner
                  contrary to Specifications or Supplier's written instructions
                  or Documentation or (iv) are comprised of materials provided
                  or a design stipulated by HP and not approved by Supplier in
                  writing to the extent that the claim arises from Supplier's
                  compliance with a Unique Specification; provided that all
                  implementations of that Unique Specification necessarily
                  constitute or require an unauthorized use or infringement of a
                  third party Intellectual Property Right and Supplier is
                  unaware of such unauthorized use or infringement; and provided
                  further that Supplier (a) has not [*] such Unique
                  Specification, (b) has not provided [*] such Unique
                  Specification or (c) has not [*] to such Unique Specification.
                  To the extent that any of the foregoing limitations would
                  otherwise apply, it will not apply where the Product is
                  claimed to be an unauthorized use, misappropriation or
                  infringement on account of a manufacturing process used by
                  Supplier unless HP has required Supplier to use in manufacture
                  of such Product the particular manufacturing steps that
                  resulted in such claim.

                  objection. The parties acknowledge that they are knowledgeable

                  Supplier will afford HP, and HP's duly appointed agents,
                  reasonable [*] for trade compliance audit purposes and further
                  agrees to respond in a timely manner to HP's requests for
                  production of trade control records and to comply with all
                  [*].

                  shipping documentation for each Supplier site and each
                  shipment from such site. Supplier is responsible for knowing
                  and understanding shipping documentation standards applied in
                  the normal course of international business and for knowing
                  and understanding additional requirements outlined in HP

                  Supplier is responsible for ensuring that commercial
                  documentation accurately reflects the actual price paid or
                  payable between HP and Supplier's site. It is Supplier's
                  responsibility that each of its sites reconciles its financial
                  records against commercial documentation in order to validate
                  HP's use of transaction value, whenever possible, for
                  declarations to Customs. When transaction value cannot be
                  applied, Supplier will apply sequentially the World Trade

                  not importer of record and Supplier obtains duty drawback
                  rights to Product, Supplier will, [*], provide HP with
                  documents required by the customs authorities of the country
                  of receipt to prove importation and to transfer duty drawback
                  rights to HP if HP has paid [*] deposit of the subject duties.

                  manufactured to HP's functional specification, HP will assist
                  the Supplier in the export of the commodities by providing

                  security guidelines or TAPA[*] security requirements will be
                  considered by HP as negligence and failure on the part of

19.      FORCE MAJEURE EVENTS

         19.1     Delaying Causes. Neither party will be liable for any delay in
                  performance under this Agreement caused by any act of God or
                  other cause beyond Supplier's reasonable control and without
                  Supplier's fault or negligence including but not limited to
                  fire, flood, war, embargo, riot or an unforeseeable
                  intervention of any government authority, which causes
                  complete business interruption (a "Delaying Cause"). A
                  Delaying Cause does not include delays in transportation, [*]
                  or economic considerations or inefficiencies. No Delaying
                  Cause will suspend or excuse either party's obligations as set
                  forth in Articles 15, 21, and 22.

         19.2     Occurrence of a Delaying Cause. Any party whose performance is
                  affected by a Delaying Cause will notify the other party [*]
                  upon commencement of a Delaying Cause and will provide its
                  best estimate of the expected duration of such occurrence.
                  Upon notice to Supplier during pendency of a Delaying Cause,
                  HP may [*] unfilled Accepted Orders [*]. Any party whose
                  performance is affected by a Delaying Cause will exercise
                  reasonable diligence to overcome and effect cessation of the
                  Delaying Cause and to mitigate effects thereof. Performance of
                  the parties' respective obligations to purchase and sell
                  Product will be suspended to the extent affected by, and for
                  the duration of, a Delaying Cause, and during pendency of a
                  Delaying Cause affecting Supplier's ability to make timely
                  Delivery, HP may purchase replacement Product elsewhere and
                  [*]. If, however, Supplier's performance is delayed for
                  reasons set forth above for a cumulative period of [*]
                  calendar days or more, HP, notwithstanding any other provision

                  under this Agreement once the Delaying Cause ceases, and HP
                  may, upon written notice not later than [*] following such
                  cessation, extend the Term up to the length of time the
                  Delaying Cause endured.

                           provision of this Agreement with additional failure

                  HP under this Agreement, HP may procure, upon such terms and
                  in such manner as HP reasonably deems appropriate, products
                  and services substantially similar in functionality to the OEM
                  Product and services as to which this Agreement is terminated.
                  Supplier agrees to continue the performance of this Agreement
                  to the extent not terminated under the provisions of this
                  Section.

         20.4     Purchase Hold. If any Eligible Purchaser having the right to
                  purchase an OEM Product under this Agreement or under any
                  other agreement with Supplier believes in good faith that an
                  OEM Product is defective, then, irrespective of any other
                  rights provided HP hereunder, HP may implement a [*]. Such [*]

                  taken sufficient action to correct the defect or given
                  sufficient assurances that such defect will be corrected [*].

         20.5     Escalated Resolution Process. In the event of any dispute
                  arising from or regarding the subject matter of this
                  Agreement, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith an
                  equitable resolution of the disputed matter. If the parties
                  are not able to resolve the dispute within [*] of first
                  written communication of the dispute, then the parties agree
                  to escalate such resolution process to their respective
                  Escalation Management as designated in Exhibit (G). The
                  Escalation Management shall meet within [*] of escalation to
                  resolve the disputed matter. If the dispute is not resolved
                  within an additional [*] period from the end of the [*] period
                  set forth above, then either HP or Supplier may commence
                  legal, equitable, or other action upon providing the other
                  party not less than [*] prior written notice of such intent.

21.      CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

         21.1     Confidential Information. During the Term, a party (the
                  "Recipient") may receive or have access to certain information
                  of the other party (the "Discloser") that is marked as
                  "Confidential Information," including, though not limited to,
                  information or data concerning the Discloser's products or
                  product plans, business operations, strategies, customers and
                  related business information. The Recipient will protect the
                  confidentiality of Confidential Information with the same
                  degree of care as the Recipient uses for its own similar
                  information, but not less than reasonable care. Confidential
                  Information may only be used by those employees of the
                  Recipient who have a need to know such information for
                  purposes related to this Agreement. Supplier will, upon HP's
                  written request, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
                  any entity or person designated by HP to enter into a
                  nondisclosure agreement which affords materially comparable
                  protections for HP's Confidential Information as the
                  Confidential Disclosure Agreement referenced in Exhibit (F).
                  The parties acknowledge that all Technical Information and
                  Forecasts are deemed Confidential Information to be protected
                  for a term of [*] from date of disclosure.

         21.2     Exclusions. The foregoing confidentiality obligations will not
                  apply to any information that: (a) is known by the Recipient
                  prior to disclosure; (b) was developed by the Recipient prior
                  to disclosure or is subsequently developed independently and
                  without reference to the disclosure; (c) is or becomes
                  publicly available through no fault of the Recipient; (d) is
                  rightfully received from a third party with no duty of
                  confidentiality; (e) is disclosed by the Recipient with the
                  Discloser's written approval or; (f) is disclosed under
                  operation of law.

                  Employer's Liability Insurance in an amount keeping with the
                  law of the nation, state, territory or province having
                  jurisdiction over Supplier's employees wherever work is to be
                  performed under this Agreement [*].

                  General Liability Insurance: Supplier will maintain
                  Comprehensive or Commercial General Liability Insurance
                  (including but not limited to premises and operations,
                  products and completed operations, broad form contractual
                  liability, broad form property damage and personal injury
                  liability) with a minimum limit of [*] combined single limit
                  per occurrence and [*] in the aggregate, for claims of bodily
                  injury, including death, and property damage that may arise
                  from use of the Products or acts or omissions of Supplier
                  under this Agreement. Each policy obtained by Supplier will
                  [*] a loss covered thereunder.

                  Claims Made Coverage. If any policies have "claims made"
                  coverage, Supplier will maintain such coverages [*]. Any such
                  coverage must have a retroactive date no later than the date
                  upon which work commenced under this Agreement.

                  Additional Requirements. All deductibles on policies providing
                  coverage will be paid by Supplier. In the event Supplier is
                  self insured for matters described in Article (14), Supplier
                  agrees to respond to any claims or losses made against or
                  incurred by HP in the same fashion as if insurance had been
                  purchased with the same or broader coverage terms than what is
                  generally available to similar Supplier's. In no event will
                  the coverages or limits of any insurance required under this
                  Article, or the lack or unavailability of any other insurance,
                  be deemed to limit or diminish Supplier's obligations or
                  liability to HP under this Agreement. In addition, where
                  allowed by law [*].

                  All insurance policies will be written by a company authorized
                  to do business in the territory and jurisdiction where the
                  project is located. In no event will the coverage or limits of
                  any insurance maintained by Supplier under this Article, or
                  the lack or unavailability of any other insurance, limit or
                  diminish in any way Supplier's obligations or liability to HP
                  under this Agreement. All insurance policies will be written
                  with appropriately licensed and financially responsible
                  insurers

                  Certificate of Insurance. Supplier will furnish Certificates
                  of Insurance acceptable to HP before any Work is commenced
                  hereunder by Supplier. The Certificate of Insurance will
                  provide that there will be no cancellation or reduction of
                  coverage without [*] prior written notice to HP.

         22.2     Indemnity. Supplier will, to the maximum extent permitted by
                  law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless HP [*] [*] from and
                  against any and all claims, liability, loss or damage for
                  bodily injury, occupational sickness or disease or death of
                  any person, including any employee of Supplier or any
                  Subcontractor, or for any physical damage to property, or loss
                  of use thereof, (i) to the extent [*] or (ii) which is
                  proximately caused by the negligence, strict liability or
                  other fault of, or breach of this Agreement [*] by, Supplier,
                  [*] and its and their employees, agents [*], in whole or in
                  part or jointly with HP. In the event any claim, liability,
                  loss or damage is caused by the joint or concurrent
                  negligence, strict liability or other fault of Supplier and
                  HP, except to the extent due to HP's passive negligence or
                  HP's failure to manage or supervise Supplier, [*] and its and
                  their employees, agents [*], or HP's failure to oversee or
                  control Supplier's performance under this Agreement [*] and
                  its and their employees, agents [*], then such claim,
                  liability, loss or damage, and costs of defense will be borne
                  by Supplier and HP in proportion to its respective degree of
                  fault. Supplier will [*] defend any suit, action or other
                  proceeding asserting a claim covered hereunder, and Supplier
                  will pay [*]. Supplier will not have any obligation to defend,
                  indemnify or hold harmless hereunder when the occurrence
                  giving rise to such claim, charge, liability, loss or damage
                  is caused solely by the negligence, strict liability or other
                  fault of HP. Supplier's obligations to defend, indemnify and
                  hold harmless hereunder will not be limited or otherwise
                  affected by any insurance, self-insurance or retention of risk
                  which it may carry or assume.

         22.3     HP's Duty to Notify. HP will give Supplier [*] notice of any
                  such claim or action for which Supplier is obligated to
                  indemnify under Section 22.2. If Supplier assumes defense of
                  such claim or action without reservation of rights, HP will
                  provide Supplier the authority, information and reasonable
                  assistance (at Supplier's expense) necessary to defend.
                  Supplier will control defense, and HP will not settle any such
                  claim or action without Supplier's consent [*]; provided that
                  if Supplier does not diligently pursue resolution of the claim
                  or fails to provide HP, upon request at any time and from time
                  to time, with reasonable assurance that it will diligently
                  pursue resolution, HP may, without in any way limiting its
                  other rights and remedies, defend the claim and collect [*]
                  doing so from Supplier. Any settlement or compromise Supplier
                  desires to enter into will be subject to HP's approval. HP and
                  any other Indemnitee may, in its or their discretion,
                  participate in the defense of such claim or action.

23.      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

         UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY
         [*] OF THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF ANY PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR IN
         FURTHERANCE OF THE PROVISIONS OR OBJECTIVES OF THIS AGREEMENT,
         REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED ON TORT, WARRANTY,
         CONTRACT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
         OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, THE PARTIES WILL BE
         RESPONSIBLE FOR [*] INCLUDED IN AN AWARD OR SETTLEMENT OF A THIRD PARTY
         CLAIM UNDER [*]. EXCEPT FOR THE PARTIES' RESPECTIVE OBLIGATIONS UNDER
         [*], THE PARTIES' RESPECTIVE AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
         SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE [*] OF (i) USD [*], OR (ii) [*] UNDER THIS
         AGREEMENT IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENTS GIVING RISE TO THE
         IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY.

24.      TERMINATION

         24.1     Outstanding Orders. All accepted Orders issued prior to the
                  expiration of this Agreement must be fulfilled pursuant to and
                  subject to the terms of this Agreement, even if the Delivery
                  Dates are after expiration. Upon termination of this Agreement
                  for Supplier's breach, HP may cancel any outstanding Order or
                  require Orders to be fulfilled even if a Delivery Date is
                  after the date of termination. If this Agreement is terminated
                  due to HP's breach, then HP will reimburse Supplier for its
                  reasonable direct costs to rework HP-customized OEM Product
                  units [*] [*] back to Supplier's standard product, as
                  described in Exhibit (A-1) attached hereto. Such reimbursement
                  costs shall specifically exclude any costs for Supplier's
                  excess materials used in connection with the customization of
                  OEM Products.

         24.2     Return Of HP Property. Supplier must return all HP Property to
                  HP upon expiration or termination. All such property must be
                  in good condition, normal wear and tear excepted. HP will
                  determine the manner and procedure for return. HP will bear
                  all return freight costs if return is due to HP convenience or
                  an uncured breach by HP. Otherwise, Supplier will bear all
                  such costs.

         24.3     Surviving Provisions. Notwithstanding the expiration or early
                  termination of this Agreement, the provisions regarding [*]
                  Confidentiality in Article (21), [*] Limitation of Liability
                  in Article (23), and the Miscellaneous provisions below will
                  each survive in accordance with their terms.

25.      MISCELLANEOUS

         25.1     Notices. All notices to be given under this Agreement must be
                  in writing addressed to the receiving party's designated
                  recipient specified in Exhibit (G). Notices are validly given
                  upon the earlier of confirmed receipt by the receiving party
                  or three days after dispatch by courier or certified mail,
                  postage prepaid, properly addressed to the receiving party.
                  Notices may also be delivered by telefax and will be validly
                  given upon oral or written confirmation of receipt. Either
                  party may change its address for purposes of notice by giving
                  notice to the other party in accordance with these provisions.

         25.2     Independent Contractors. The relationship of the parties
                  established under this Agreement is that of independent
                  contractors and neither party is a partner, employee, agent or
                  joint-venturer of or with the other. Nothing in this Agreement
                  precludes either party from independently developing,
                  manufacturing, selling or supporting products similar to the
                  OEM Products.

         25.3     Assignment. Neither party may, directly or indirectly, in
                  whole or in part, either by operation of law or otherwise,
                  assign or transfer this Agreement or delegate any of its
                  obligations under this Agreement without the other party's
                  written consent, which such consent shall not be unreasonably
                  withheld or untimely delayed. Any attempted assignment,
                  transfer, or delegation without such prior written consent
                  will be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, HP or its
                  permitted successive assignees or transferees may assign or
                  transfer this Agreement or delegate any rights or obligations
                  hereunder without consent: (1) to any entity controlled by, or
                  under common control with, HP, or its permitted successive
                  assignees or transferees; or (2) in connection with a merger,
                  reorganization, transfer, sale of assets or product lines, or
                  change of control or ownership of HP, or its permitted
                  successive assignees or transferees. Without limiting the
                  foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to
                  the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and
                  assigns.

         25.4     No Waiver. The waiver of any term, condition, or provision of
                  this Agreement must be in writing and signed by an authorized
                  representative of the waiving party. Any such waiver will not
                  be construed as a waiver of any other term, condition, or
                  provision except as provided in writing, nor as a waiver of
                  any subsequent breach of the same term, condition, or
                  provision. Other than as expressly agreed herein, all remedies
                  of a party provided herein, together with all remedies
                  available at law or in equity, shall be cumulative.

         25.5     Headings. The Section headings used in this Agreement

                  are for convenience of reference only. They will not limit or
                  extend the meaning of any provision of this Agreement, and
                  will not be relevant in interpreting any provision of this
                  Agreement.

         25.6     Publicity. Subject to the terms and conditions of Article (21)
                  above, neither party may publicize or disclose to any third
                  party, without the written consent of the other party, the
                  existence or terms of this Agreement except as required under
                  applicable federal securities laws. In the event that Supplier
                  becomes aware that disclosure is likely to be required by
                  operation of law, Supplier shall promptly provide HP with
                  ample notice and opportunity to seek a protective order.
                  Supplier agrees that in the event that disclosure to the SEC
                  is likely, Supplier shall promptly file a request for
                  confidential treatment. Without limiting the generality of the
                  foregoing sentence, no press releases regarding the subject
                  matter, content, or existence of this Agreement may be made
                  without the prior mutual written consent of each party.

         25.7     Severability. If any provision in this Agreement is held
                  invalid or unenforceable by a body of competent jurisdiction,
                  such provision will be construed, limited or, if necessary,
                  severed to the extent necessary to eliminate such invalidity
                  or unenforceability. The parties agree to negotiate in good
                  faith a valid, enforceable substitute provision that most
                  nearly effects the parties' original intent in entering into
                  this Agreement or to provide an equitable adjustment in the
                  event no such provision can be added. The other provisions of
                  this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

         25.8     Subcontractors and Subsidiaries. Each party unconditionally
                  guarantees to the other party the performance of all
                  obligations by any of its subcontractors and Subsidiaries
                  under the Agreement (including, without limitation, payment
                  obligations), as amended from time to time, or any other
                  obligation of any subcontractors or Subsidiary to the other
                  party, now existing or hereafter arising. If either party's
                  subcontractors or Subsidiary does not perform such obligation,
                  such party shall immediately perform such obligation.

         25.9     Entire Agreement. This Agreement comprises the entire
                  understanding between the parties with respect to its subject
                  matters and supersedes any previous or contemporaneous
                  communications, representations, or agreements, whether oral
                  or written. For purposes of construction, this Agreement will
                  be deemed to have been drafted by both parties. No
                  modification of this Agreement will be binding on either party
                  unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative
                  of each party.

         25.10    Governing Law. This Agreement and each Order and
                  Acknowledgment will be governed in all respects by California
                  law without reference to any choice or

                  conflict of laws provisions of California or the law of any
                  other jurisdiction. The parties hereby submit to the
                  jurisdiction of the courts of California or any court of the
                  United States sitting in California with subject matter
                  jurisdiction, and waive any venue objections against the
                  United States District Court for the Northern District of
                  California and the Superior and Municipal Courts of the State
                  of California, in any litigation arising under this Agreement.
                  The parties exclude application of the 1980 United Nations
                  Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods,
                  if applicable.

         25.11    Authority of Signatory. If HP or Supplier executes this
                  Agreement by agent or representative, such agent or
                  representative by his/her act of signing this Agreement
                  individually warrants and represents to the parties, and HP
                  and Supplier warrant and represent respectively to each other,
                  that he/she is authorized to execute, acknowledge and deliver
                  this Agreement on behalf of HP or Supplier, as the case may
                  be, and thereby to bind the respective party to the same.

         99.999 percent.

         The core-to-edge SAN model uses redundant fabrics, hot-pluggable
         components, and multiple data paths to help ensure high availability
         across the fabric. In addition, Brocade Fabric Shortest Path First
         (FSPF) enables the fabric to automatically isolate problems and reroute
         traffic around failed links onto alternate paths. As a result, the
         SilkWorm 3900 provides a SAN infrastructure solution that is designed
         to meet the most demanding business continuance requirements.

         INDUSTRY-LEADING PERFORMANCE

         The SilkWorm 3900 provides numerous business advantages for
         organizations that want to increase application performance and
         operational productivity. It can deliver up to 128 Gbit/sec of
         aggregated throughput, with 32 ports capable of 2 Gbit/sec full-duplex
         performance. To achieve even higher performance, organizations can use
         Brocade ISL Trunking, which combines as many as four ISLs into a single
         logical ISL with up to 8 Gbit/sec throughput.

         Fibre Channel speed is also possible at longer distances for remote
         operations. By leveraging the Brocade Extended Fabrics feature and
         Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) technology, storage networks
         can span up to 100 km over Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) at high
         speed--significantly enhancing disaster recovery operations.

         A DESIGN TO LEVERAGE INTELLIGENCE IN THE FABRIC

         To help maximize IT investments and reduce costs, the SilkWorm 3900 is
         designed to leverage the industry's only intelligent fabric services

                            BROCADE / HP CONFIDENTIAL

         The SilkWorm 3900 is designed to provide the highest level of SAN
         fabric security to help organizations safeguard their critical
         information. For example, Brocade Zoning logically groups a SAN fabric
         into secure zones to help ensure that SAN-attached devices can access
         only their authorized storage resources. Advanced Zoning provides even
         more control over the fabric through robust hardware-enforced zoning by
         WWN. These capabilities enable organizations to simplify administration
         while significantly increasing their control over data access.

2.       Hewlett-Packard's Product Requirements

2.1      Sourcing Material as Logical Units

All material shall be sourced as individual logical units as defined in section
3. A logical unit is one that will be consumed as a single item within a single
process area or not consumed within the process area and can be set aside
without impacting the integrity of the end product. See section 3 for definition
and declaration of consumable and non-consumable material.

All logical units must be labeled ( human readable and 3x9 barcode for scanning)
with a part number, serial number (if applicable) and quantity (if shipped in
bulk). See bar code information for more details. Individual part labeling is
applicable to all parts except when individual labeling is impractical (e.g.
screws, nuts, bolts, etc.).

ESD sensitive parts and material are to be packaged and labeled per industry
standards.

Shipping cartons shall not contain mixed logical units. Each shipping carton may
contain a maximum of one purchase order line item or part number.

2.2      Bar Code Requirements

         -    -    The bar code symbol bar shall be Code 39 (also known as "Code
              3 of 9") as specified by the AIM Uniform Symbology Specification
              Code 39.

         -    -    The symbol bar shall start with a minimum "Quiet Zone" of .25
              inches and an asterisk "Start" character ( * in Code 39) where
              applicable (no adjacent labels). The symbol shall end in the
              asterisk followed again by a minimum .25 inches of "Quiet Zone".

         -    -    The bar code height shall be .125 inches (minimum).

2.3      Power Cords

Power cords have strict sourcing requirements. Power cords may only be sourced
from HP specified vendors and only under the HP part number. No other power cord
shall be considered. Because of these requirements, it is not necessary to
include power cords with the 3200 switch.

1.       Scope of Document

This document describes the expectations of how HP expects to receive the 2Gb
Network Switch and all parts, devices and components associated with the switch.
Typical expectations described in this document are:

     -   Part Numbering and Cross Referencing

     -   Configuration and revision

     -   Labeling

     -   Packaging

This document supercedes any specification described in the Supplier's Product
Specification Documentation.

2.       Hewlett-Packard's Product Requirements

2.1      Sourcing Material as Logical Units

All material shall be sourced as individual logical units as defined in section
3. A logical unit is one that will be consumed as a single item within a single
process area or not consumed within the process area and can be set aside
without impacting the integrity of the end product. See section 3 for definition
and declaration of consumable and non-consumable material.

All logical units must be labeled (human readable and 3x9 barcode for scanning )
with a part number, serial number (if applicable) and quantity (if shipped in
bulk). See bar code information for more details. Individual part labeling is
applicable to all parts except when individual labeling is impractical (e.g.
screws, nuts, bolts, etc.).

ESD sensitive parts and material are to be packaged and labeled per industry
standards.

Shipping cartons shall not contain mixed logical units. Each shipping carton may
contain a maximum of one purchase order line item or part number.

2.2      Bar Code Requirements

         -   -    The bar code symbol bar shall be Code 39 (also known as "Code
             3 of 9") as specified by the AIM Uniform Symbology Specification
             Code 39.

         -   -    The symbol bar shall start with a minimum "Quiet Zone" of .25
             inches and an asterisk "Start" character
             ( * in Code 39) where applicable (no adjacent labels). The symbol
             shall end in the asterisk followed again by a minimum .25 inches of
             "Quiet Zone".

         -   -    The bar code height shall be .125 inches (minimum).

         2.3      Power Cords
Power cords have strict sourcing requirements. Power cords may only be sourced
from HP specified vendors and only under the HP part number. No other power cord
shall be considered. Because of these requirements, it is not necessary to
include power cords with the 3200 switch.

5.3      3800 Product Label

         HP's part number label will replace the 3800 Product Label. This label
will not necessarily use the same label size and font and content of the 3800
label. The intent is to have a label which fits in the dimple on the top rear of
the switch which fully fits in the depression and contains HP's part number and
bar code of HP's part number.

         CONTENT
                  HP Part Number Human Readable (either [*] or [*])
                           Bar code (3x9) of HP part Number

         requirements will be considered a material breach of the Agreement.

1.2      Right to Accept Over Shipments. If Supplier ships more Product than is
         covered by the corresponding Accepted Order, the amount of the over
         shipment may be either retained by HP for application against future

         limited to, any transportation, import, or export related expenses or
         duties, (in which case Supplier [*] will redeliver such Product to HP
         on the correct Delivery Date; or (ii) retain such Product and make

         available to HP, at law or in equity, consistent with the terms of this
         Agreement. If Delivery occurs more than [*] in advance of the Delivery
         Date, HP may either return the affected Product, or any portion
         thereof, or retain same with payment with respect thereto due as though

         written confirmation thereof within [*] of Supplier's receipt of said
         Change Order and HP will provide Supplier with an Order confirming such
         change within [*] of receiving Supplier's confirmation.

in Exhibit (E). The loan period for such units will have a term of [*] unless
otherwise agreed between the parties.

In the event HP requires OEM Product prototype units exceeding the above-stated
quantity to be provided by Supplier, or elects to keep loaned units past the
applicable loan period, HP may purchase such units as available from Supplier at

shall return the units to Supplier. In the event Supplier does not receive the
units within the applicable loan period, Supplier may invoice HP for the [*] as
set forth in this Exhibit (C), [*] pursuant to the purchase order issued with
the order for the Non-Commercial OEM Product. Supplier will use commercially
reasonable efforts to supply OEM Product prototype units required under this
section, upon reasonable advance notice by HP of its requirement for such units.

                                   EXHIBIT (D)

                             MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT

1.       GENERAL TERMS.

         1.1.     SCOPE: Supplier will provide maintenance and support services
                  to HP as specified in these Support Terms to allow HP to
                  provide effective service to end-user customers ("Customers")
                  of the Product. Unless otherwise agreed, HP will serve as the
                  primary support contact with Customers, and Supplier shall
                  have no direct end-user customer support obligations except as
                  otherwise provided herein. The obligations of each party are
                  specified below. In case of any conflict with the agreement
                  which contains this Maintenance and Support Exhibit
                  ("Agreement"), the terms of this Maintenance and Support
                  Exhibit will take precedence for clarification of support
                  obligations, but will not otherwise modify the Agreement.

         1.2.     DEFINITIONS: The following capitalized terms will have these
                  meanings when used in these Support Terms:

                  1.2.1.   "ACTION PLAN" means the initial plan to be created
                           and implemented by Supplier in response to an HP
                           Problem Resolution or Escalation request. At a
                           minimum, the Action Plan must contain the following:

                           1.  Problem Statement;

                           2.  List of all key HP and Supplier contacts and
                               their managers;

                           3.  Actions to be taken;

                           4.  Purpose and desired result for each action;

                           5.  Expected completion time; and

                           6.  Contingencies or alternatives if desired results
                               are not achieved.

                  1.2.2.   "ESCALATION" is the process described in ARTICLE 4
                           below through which HP declares that a Customer
                           situation requires immediate action. Under this
                           process, the nature and severity of the problem is
                           raised in each party's organization and additional
                           resources are allocated as specified in these Support
                           Terms toward solving the problem.

                  1.2.3.   "FIX" means a change in a Product that removes a
                           problem in that product. A Fix must be designed and
                           tested so that it can be distributed to all
                           Customers. A Fix may be temporary or permanent. A
                           temporary Fix may be a patch or bug fix that
                           temporarily modifies a Product or any software in the
                           product without rebuilding that product. A permanent
                           Fix provides a permanent solution to the problem,
                           agreed upon by both HP and the Supplier.

                  1.2.4.   "PROBLEM RESOLUTION" is the process described in
                           Article 3 below through which HP submits a Request
                           for Technical Assistance to notify Supplier when a
                           problem (such as a fault or defect) is suspected in a
                           Product. Under this process, HP confirms the problem
                           diagnosis with Supplier, and the parties cooperate to
                           resolve the problem.

                           problems related to Supplier's support of Products.

                  1.2.6.   "STATUS UPDATE" means Supplier's summary of the
                           problem, describing the possible cause and the
                           incremental work to be performed to reach resolution,
                           including the Action Plan and the availability date
                           of a Fix.

                  1.2.7.   "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE" is the process described in
                           Article 2 below through which HP obtains assistance
                           from Supplier in the support of Customers. Technical
                           Assistance includes the exchange of information, such
                           as product configuration, product operation, or other
                           necessary answers or assistance to support questions.

                  1.2.8.   "TRACKING SYSTEM" means an electronic database to be
                           maintained by the parties for updating and
                           communicating information pertaining to Service
                           Requests, Technical Assistance, Problem Resolution
                           and Escalation. The particular type of Tracking
                           System will be mutually determined, as more
                           particularly described in Section 1.7 below.

                  1.2.9.   "WORKAROUND" means a temporary solution or temporary
                           Fix that restores operational capability for the
                           Product, without severely compromising the
                           performance of that product, until a permanent Fix is
                           available. A Workaround can be a change in the
                           configuration or a change in Customer documentation.

                  1.2.10.  "PRODUCTS" means the products listed in Exhibit (A)
                           of the Agreement to which this Exhibit is attached,

                           provided pursuant to the Agreement.

         1.3.     GENERAL OBLIGATIONS. Each party agrees to the following
                  general terms:

                  1.3.1.   For each Product, Supplier will provide a product
                           support plan incorporating HP's support planning
                           processes and support recommendations.

                  1.3.2.   Unless expressly authorized under these Support
                           Terms, neither party will commit resources of the
                           other to Customers.

                  1.3.3.   Both parties will provide such information to each

                           provisions of this Agreement. Unless otherwise
                           specified, all such information will be used by the
                           other party solely for its internal use to fulfill
                           its obligations under these Support Terms.

                           policies and procedures that may affect its ability
                           to support Customers or the other party under these
                           terms, the party making the changes will inform the
                           other party's Strategic Support Contact listed in
                           Section 1.5 below of such changes in accordance with
                           the procedures described in these Support Terms.

                  1.3.5.   HP may [*]. Nothing in these Support Terms prohibits
                           either party from independently supporting the other

                           acknowledges that, except as expressly granted
                           hereunder or in the Software License Agreement, no

                  these Support Terms, in accordance with the problem
                  classification listings in that Appendix.

2.       TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

         2.1.     HP REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

                  2.1.1.   When making a request for Technical Assistance, HP

CLASSIFICATION OF PROBLEM SITUATION.

ESCALATION/BCS:   Product situation requiring immediate additional action by HP
                  and SUPPLIER because the problem has not been satisfactorily
                  resolved through normal response channels This situation is
                  defined by HP and can only be declared to Supplier by HP after
                  HP standard support escalation procedure.

CRITICAL:         Emergency situation in which the Product is not usable,
                  produces incorrect results, loses information or data, or
                  fails catastrophically in response to internal errors, user
                  errors or incorrect input files.

SERIOUS:          Detrimental or serious situation in which there is a severe
                  impact on use or performance of the Product. A Serious
                  situation may occur when, for example, a Product experiences
                  one or more inoperable commands or functions that degrades its
                  usability.

MEDIUM:           Inconvenient situation in which the Product is usable but does
                  not provide a function in the most convenient or expeditious
                  manner, but use of the Product suffers little or no
                  significant impact.

         The purpose of this Quality/Reliability Requirements Document is to
         establish an understanding and agreement between Hewlett-Packard (HP)
         and Seller with regard to quality and reliability expectations and
         responsibilities. The terms Supplier and Seller are used
         interchangeably in this Quality/Reliability Requirements Document.

         It is HP's objective to receive Product of the highest possible quality
         and reliability with the lowest cost of ownership. The Product must
         consistently meet or exceed the requirements of this document and the
         individual specifications applicable to each Product. It is HP's
         expectation that Supplier shall strive to ship defect-free, fully
         tested Product as measured at the first operational test at HP.
         Repaired units are subject to the same Product Specifications as when
         originally shipped.

         HP's objective is to work in close cooperation with Supplier to resolve
         any quality issue, and expects the Supplier to work diligently to
         resolve any quality issue.

2.0 GENERAL

         This exhibit specifies quality and reliability requirements for Switch
         products and components and modules attached or included there in.

3.0 DEFECTIVE PRODUCT

         HP shall inform Supplier of any units or lots that fail, and provide
         Supplier with yield percentages. Defective units or lots will be
         shipped to Supplier's facility as instructed by Supplier. Supplier
         shall test and verify all failed units, and provide the data of failure
         symptoms observed or NTF (No Trouble Found), on all units returned from
         HP worldwide manufacturing sites.

MATERIAL OWNERSHIP

Seller agrees to deliver Products to the [*] as agreed to by Buyer and Seller.
Seller and Buyer agree to negotiate in good faith adding other [*] locations to
meet Buyer's distribution requirements. These Products shall remain as [*]
designated site by the Buyer. Payment terms are per the Agreement.

BUFFER REPLENISHMENT

Buyer's manufacturing sites operate [*]. Seller is expected to maintain the
Buffer Stock quantities as identified in Table 1 at each of the [*] as specified
in Table 2. Product which is pulled [*] by Buyer should be replenished by Seller
as required, based on the Compaq Site specific established Minimum/Maximum
requirements.

CALCULATING BUFFER STOCK

Once a week, each CompaqHP Site ([*] and such sites as may be agreed to by the
parties) will provide Seller with updated information regarding Buyer's forecast
manufacturing volumes for the ODM part numbers identified in Table 1 via the
Trader Web Site. Seller will respond via the Trader Web Site with their supply
response covering the forecast period and to confirm that Buffer Stock
quantities are in place at the respective [*].

The Trader Web Site forecast is a planning tool. Therefore, it is important that
the Seller and the Compaq Site buyer and/or Site Commodity Manager review the
Buffer Stock and minimum/maximum Product requirements on a weekly basis or as
frequently as required.

Should Seller be unable to support maximum volumes, as listed on the Trader Web
Site, a Seller representative will notify the appropriate CompaqHP site
Commodity Site Buyer to review and adjust as required. Buffer stock quantities
are determined by the CompaqHP Site Buyer but are typically equal to two weeks
average inventory based on an eight week forecast.

FORECAST CONFIRMATION

By [*] central time on [*], Seller is required to provide a supply response to
the Trader Web Site forecast.

BUFFER STOCK CONFIRMATION

In addition to the confirmation, by [*], Seller is required to provide current
Buffer Stock confirmation to each of the Buyer's sites.

PROCEDURE FOR RELEASING MATERIAL

Scheduling Agreements, transmitted electronically via email and/or Blanket
Orders, shall be used by Buyer for ease of order administration by both parties.
The use of scheduling agreements and/or blanket orders across multiple pricing
periods does not preclude Buyer from paying the price in effect on the date of
each receipt. Confirmation of the Scheduling Agreements shall be returned in the
form of an email, within [*] after receipt.

Buyer may make adjustments to scheduling agreements and/or blanket order
duration, volume per line item and price(s) [*] pending notice to Seller of such
changes. Buyer reserves the right to amend scheduling agreements and/or blanket
order(s) [*] to correspond to Buyer's latest production requirements over any
specified period of time.

DELAYS IN USAGE

In the event any Product unit(s) shall remain [*] for greater than [*], then,
upon written notification from Seller to Buyer of Seller's request [*], Buyer
shall elect to either purchase such inactive units through [*]. In the event
Buyer does not confirm [*].

MATERIAL LIABILITY FOR TERMINATION

Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, material liability for Product
supplied in support of Buyer's published production plans and/or forecasts is
limited to two weeks Buffer Stock and any unique material. Seller agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the liability to Buyer.

                          HP REGIONAL TRADE GUIDELINES

SECTION 1         HP TRADE BASICS

1.1      TRADE COMPLIANCE
         Each Supplier shipping location bears [*] for ensuring its own
         import/export compliance; however, HP is responsible for setting
         baseline policies and guidelines for Supplier operations. The following
         is distributed in order to clearly convey HP's minimum trade compliance
         expectations and to provide an operations reference tool for Supplier
         locations; responsibility for developing and implementing procedures to
         comply with the following belongs solely to the Supplier .

1.2      TERMS OF SALE
         Supplier is responsible for implementing the sales term (eg. FOB, FCA,
         DDP, etc.) negotiated with HP. Supplier's responsibilities may include,
         but are not limited to, the following:

            -   Warehouse storage at point of origin

            -   Warehouse labor at point of origin

            -   Export packing

            -   Loading at point of origin

            -   Inland freight to origin port

            -   Port receiving

            -   Loading on vessel

            -   International freight/transport

            -   Customs clearance at destination port

            -   Delivery to final destination

1.3      COUNTRY OF ORIGIN
         Each Supplier site is responsible for determining the appropriate
         country of origin ("COO") for the product(s) it manufactures/assembles
         and for marking the products accordingly. Further, each site must
         ensure that shipping documentation and EDI confirmation signals
         accurately convey shipment-level COO data; Country of Origin is a
         mandatory line-item data element for all HP EDI shipping confirmation
         (eg. 856/4010) signals. Finally, each site must cooperate fully with HP
         in supplying data to facilitate HP's origin reporting requirements and
         qualification for preferential origin programs such as NAFTA, IFTA,
         FMF, EXIM and the like including, but not limited to, all requested
         origin analysis, certificates of origin, manufacturer's affidavits,
         data transmissions, and special reporting.

         Additional HP COO marking/labeling guidelines are set out in SECTION 2
         of this Exhibit.

1.4      VALUATION
         For each and every transaction where HP is to be importer of record
         into the US, the Supplier site is responsible for ensuring that
         commercial documentation accurately reflects the actual price paid or
         payable

         between HP and the site. It is Supplier's responsibility to reconcile
         its financial records against commercial documentation in order to
         validate HP's use of Transaction Value for declarations to US Customs
         under Section 402(b)(1) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (TAA; 19
         U.S.C. 1401a); no alternate valuation methodologies are used or
         approved for HP transactions.

         Zero dollar values are unacceptable for US Customs purposes. Where
         items are provided "free of charge," the commercial invoice must
         reflect fair market value for the products; the nomenclature "Value for
         Customs Purposes Only," may be used in these instances.

1.5      SHIPPING DOCUMENTATION
         All Supplier sites must be capable of producing accurate and complete
         shipping documentation for each shipment. Supplier is responsible for
         knowing and understanding shipping standards applied in the normal
         course of international business and for knowing and understanding
         additional HP requirements outlined in this Exhibit.

1.6      RECORDKEEPING/REPORTING
         Each Supplier site must comply with record-keeping, data-transmission,
         incident-reporting, and audit requirements set out in Section 4 of this
         Exhibit.

         SECTION 2      LABELING/ MARKING

2.1      COUNTRY OF ORIGIN
         A Product's country of origin is where the Product is wholly
         manufactured or the final location where a substantial transformation
         occurs. A Product is substantially transformed if the end product
         functions in a significantly different manner than the individual
         components. As a practical matter, Customs looks to whether the final
         assembly has a new "name, character, and use" from the component level
         parts. Further clarification regarding HP country of origin standards
         is provided in Trade Policy CP020-27.

2.2      MARKING
         Every article of foreign origin entering the United States must be
         marked with the English name of the country of origin preceded by the
         HP standard nomenclature: "PRODUCT OF." This marking must appear in a
         conspicuous, legible, indelible and permanent form on the outermost
         packaging (e.g. pallet), on the consumer packaging (box in which the
         item will arrive to the ultimate consumer), and on the Product itself.

         For the human readable portion of HP's standard label, COO must be
         indicated by the complete country name; abbreviations are unacceptable.
         For the barcode scan area, COO should be represented by the 2-digit ISO
         COUNTRY CODE; one digit codes (eg. A = US) are NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE nor
         supported by HP. Material with multiple COOs must be segregated,
         separately palletized (if applicable) and separately scanned so as to
         be represented on the commercial invoice as individual invoice line
         items with individual COOs.

         COO Product markings/labels must ALWAYS match COO indicated on the
         commercial invoice and reported to HP via the shipping confirmation
         signal. Supplier is responsible for implementing procedures

         to ensure that labels are checked for accuracy and audited against
         shipping documentation/data transmissions.

         Further clarification regarding HP marking standards is provided in
         HP's COO Marking Policy, as well as HP's Country of Origin Encoding
         spec (EDB Drawing # 137169).

2.3.1    COO CHECKLIST

         Supplier must adhere to the following COO requirements:

         -   MUST implement processes to determine correct COO for Products.

         -   MUST ensure that COO is labeled on outermost packaging
             conspicuously, legibly, indelibly, and permanently.

         -   MUST ensure that COO is labeled on consumer packaging (box in which
             the item will arrive to the last person in the US who will receive
             it in its imported form) conspicuously, legibly, indelibly, and
             permanently.

         -   MUST ensure that COO is labeled directly on the Product
             conspicuously, legibly, indelibly, and permanently.

         -   MUST ensure that the accurate COO prints in the designated field on
             the commercial invoice.

         -   MUST ensure that COO designated for a particular Product to be
             shipped is consistent across all labels and documentation.

SECTION 3         SHIPPING DOCUMENTATION

3.1      DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

             Supplier must adhere to the following trade requirements:

         -   MUST produce accurate and complete shipping documentation for each
             and every shipment. All text must be in English; all monetary
             amounts must be represented in US dollars.

         -   MUST be able to reproduce shipping document on demand (with or
             without requested modifications and/or corrections) for a minimum
             of 60 days after shipment.

         -   MUST have internal audit procedures in place for
             verification/correction of all outbound documentation issues
             including, but not limited to, proper print alignment. Where data
             is printed more than 1/16" off assigned documentation fields, the
             documentation MUST be discarded and reprinted before shipment
             release.

         *   All data transmitted from HP must be verified for accuracy.
         Supplier is responsible for implementing procedures demonstrating
         reasonable care in the verification of all data received from HP.

SECTION 4         Reporting/ Recordkeeping

4.1      REPORTING/DATA TRANSMISSIONS
         The following trade data elements must be printed on each commercial

         -   ECCN (line item level)

         -   License (line item level)

         -   Destination Control Statement

         These are HP-required data elements for the Shipping Confirmation
         signal. Failure to transmit these items will result in signal
         rejection.

4.2      RECORDS
         Each Supplier site must maintain a system for retention, retrieval and
         reproduction (for a period of not less than six calendar years from the
         date of each shipment) of original shipping, export, customs, import
         and other trade-related documentation ("Trade Control Records"),

         Parts 762 and 772, U.S. Department of Commerce, Export Administration
         Regulations and the U.S. Customs Record-Keeping Regulations, 19 C.F.R.
         163.

         Supplier, upon receipt of written notice from HP, will collect,
         reproduce if required, and provide to HP (at Supplier's expense)
         originals and/or satisfactory copies of 100% of the Trade Control
         Records as HP may request from time to time. All HP requests for Trade
         Control Records must be fulfilled within 15 business days of HP's
         written request, or the response date required by an official
         government record production request or subpoena, whichever is the
         lesser time for response. Supplier will not destroy or render
         inaccessible any of the Trade Control Records relating to HP
         transactions, without having first obtained the express written
         permission from HP.
