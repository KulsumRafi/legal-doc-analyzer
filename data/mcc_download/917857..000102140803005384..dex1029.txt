                           1.00 Terms of Participation

     .    Your Triggering Events (see Plan Sections 2.26 and 4.04) will be:

          .    The date you complete 72 months of Plan participation and the
               Company's net worth (calculated by applying standard accounting
               principles) first exceeds $100,000,000 (both conditions must be
               met before this Triggering Event will occur); or

I acknowledge and agree, on my own behalf and on behalf of my Beneficiary and my

(including any unpaid installments) if my employer becomes bankrupt, [3] I may

                               4.00 Distributions

Normally, your Plan benefit will be distributed in a lump sum shortly after you
Terminate. However, you may elect to have your Plan benefit distributed in as
many as 10 annual installments and may elect to have your payment begin at some
date after you Terminate (but benefits always must begin shortly after you reach
age 65 or when you terminate employment, whichever is latest). However, these
payment options are available only if this election is made at least 12 months
before you Terminate.

Also, if you make this election but change your mind (e.g., you decide you do
not want to receive annual installments), this election may be revoked but only
if you deliver another completed Enrollment Form to the Committee before you
Terminate. Any revocation delivered after that date will be ignored. Check as
appropriate
