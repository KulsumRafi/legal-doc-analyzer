<P ALIGN="CENTER">&#9;<U>ARTICLE V</P>
</U><P ALIGN="CENTER">&#9;<U>BUSINESS SECRETS</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;1.&#9;Employee shall not at any time or in any manner, either directly or indirectly, divulge, disclose or communicate to any person, firm or corporation, in any manner whatsoever, any proprietary or confidential information concerning any matter affecting or relating to the business of Employer or its subsidiaries, including without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any of their customers, the prices they obtain from providers or have obtained from the sale of, or at which they sell or have sold, its services, or any other information concerning the business of Employer or its subsidiaries, their manner of operation, or their plans, if such a disclosure would be detrimental to the business interests of Employer or its subsidiaries.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;2.&#9;If Employee's employment hereunder is terminated by either party at any time hereafter, then Employee agrees to turn over to Employer all papers, documents, working papers, correspondence, memos and any and all other documents in Employee's possession relating to or concerning any matter affecting or relating to the business of Employer or its subsidiaries.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&#9;<U>ARTICLE VI</P>
</U><P ALIGN="CENTER">&#9;<U>NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;1.&#9;Employee acknowledges that in Employee's employment hereunder, Employee will have continual contacts with the groups, members, and providers who are covered by or associated with the managed health care programs offered by Employer or its subsidiaries in Nevada and other states.  In all of Employee's activities, Employee, through the nature of Employee's work, will have access to and will acquire confidential information related to the business and operations of Employer and its subsidiaries, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, member and group lists, and confidential information relating to processes, plans, methods of doing business and special needs of doctors, hospitals, members, groups, pharmacies, or other health care providers who contract with Employer or its subsidiaries.  Employee acknowledges that all such information is the property of Employer or its subsidiaries solely and constitutes confidential information of such parties; that the disclosure thereof would cause substantial loss to the goodwill of Employer and its subsidiaries; that disclosure thereof to Employee is being made only because of the position of trust and confidence which Employee will occupy and because of Employee's agreement to the restrictions herein contained; that his knowledge of these matters would enable him, on termination of this Agreement, to compete with Employer or its subsidiaries in a manner likely to cause Employer and its subsidiaries irreparable harm, and disclosure of such matters would, likewise, cause such harm; and that the restrictions imposed upon Employee herein would not prohibit Employee in earning a living.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;2. &#9;It is understood and agreed by Employee and Employer that the essence of this Employment Agreement is the mutual covenants of the parties herein made, that the present and future members and groups of Employer or its subsidiaries will remain Employer's or its subsidiaries' members and groups during the term of this Agreement and following its termination for any reason.  In consideration for the employment and continued employment of Employee by Employer, and also for the amount received by Employee as compensation, Employee hereby irrevocably warrants, covenants, and agrees as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(a)&#9;during the term of Employee's employment and after leaving the employment of Employer for any reason, whether involuntary or voluntary, Employee will not take any action whatsoever which may or might disturb any existing business relationship of Employer or its subsidiaries with any doctors, groups, members, hospitals, pharmacies or other health care providers in Nevada who contract with Employer or its subsidiaries;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &#9;&#9;(b)&#9;for a period of one (1) year after leaving the employment of Employer, Employee will not solicit business from the members or groups of Employer or its subsidiaries in Nevada, or in any manner disrupt any business relationship Employer or its subsidiaries has with any contracted health care provider in Nevada with whom Employee came in contact as an employee of Employer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(c)&#9;for a period of one (1) year after leaving the employment of Employer, Employee will not, either directly or indirectly, work for any present or future competitors of Employer operating in the state of Nevada who in any manner offer any managed health care programs, insurance coverage, or administer health care claims for employers.  Such competitors shall include, but are not limited to, HMOs, PPOs, insurance companies, utilization management companies, or third party administrators.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;3.&#9;The one (1) year period specified in this Article will be tolled during any period of breach of any of the terms of Article VI by Employee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;4.&#9;Employee agrees that in the event of a breach of any term of this Agreement, and more particularly, in the event of a breach of any of the terms and provisions of Article VI, Employer shall be entitled to secure an order in any suit brought for that purpose to enjoin Employee from violating any of the provisions of the Agreement and that, pending the hearing and the decision on the application for such order, Employer shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order without prejudice to any other remedy available to Employer, all at the expense of Employee should Employer prevail in such action.  Employee understands that the covenants of this Article are the essence of this Employment Agreement, and without which no Employment Agreement with Employee would be entered into by Employer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;5.&#9;The provisions of Article VI shall in no event be construed to be an exclusive remedy and such remedy shall be held and construed to be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies, whether in law or equity, otherwise available under the terms of this Agreement or under the laws of the United States or the State of Nevada.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;6.&#9;The covenants and agreements made by Employee in this Article VI shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other provision in the Agreement and the existence of any claim or cause of action by Employee against Employer, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Employer, by injunctive relief or otherwise, of the provisions of Article VI.  The invalidity of all or any part of any section or paragraph of this Article VI shall not render invalid the remainder of this Article or any section hereof.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;7.&#9;No failure or failures on the part of Employer to enforce any violation by Employee of this Noncompetition agreement, shall constitute a waiver of Employer's rights thereafter to enforce all of the terms, covenants, provisions and agreements herein contained.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&#9;<U>ARTICLE VII</P>
</U><P ALIGN="CENTER">&#9;<U>TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT</P>

In addition, if Employee's employment hereunder is terminated for reasons other than those set forth in Paragraph 6 of this Article within <B><U>two (2) years</B></U> after the effective date of a change in control which was approved by a majority of Employer's Board of Directors, Employee shall be entitled to a cash amount equal to <B><U>(2.0)</B></U> times Employee's current salary and the target annual bonus for which Employee is eligible in the year of termination, together with all other separation compensation and benefits as are routinely made available to other employees of Employer at the same organizational level.
