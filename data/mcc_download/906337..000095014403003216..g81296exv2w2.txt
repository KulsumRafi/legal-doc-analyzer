MEDUNITE INC.
REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2001




<PAGE>




                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
MedUnite Inc.


In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and the related statements of
operations, of stockholders' equity (deficit) and of cash flows present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of MedUnite Inc. at December
31, 2001 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2001 and for the period from June 9, 2000 (inception) through
December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. The Company incurred a net loss of
$40,399,000 and generated negative cash flows from operations of $33,482,000
during 2001, and at December 31, 2001 had an accumulated deficit of $53,607,000.
These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are
described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.       ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

         THE COMPANY
         MedUnite Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in Delaware in June
         2000. The Company was formed to develop and maintain an exchange that
         provides connectivity applications in the healthcare market that
         facilitates various business transactions, including claims submission,
         real-time claim status inquiry, eligibility and referral and
         authorization.

         The Company is subject to risks common to rapidly growing
         technology-based companies, including rapid technological change,
         dependence on principal products, new product development, new product
         introductions, other activities of competitors, and a limited operating
         history in Internet related e-commerce activities.

         The Company incurred a net loss of $40,399,000 and generated negative
         cash flows from operations of $33,482,000 during 2001. The Company has
         an accumulated deficit of $53,607,000 as of December 31, 2001. In
         February 2002 and August 2002, the Company issued notes payable to its
         founders in the aggregate amount of $23,975,000 (Note 12).

         Due to liquidity constraints in the second half of 2002, management
         implemented certain measures to conserve capital resources that
         included reducing its workforce and certain product development and
         marketing efforts. In addition, management has been engaged in efforts
         to raise additional resources through the issuance of additional
         capital or the sale of the Company. However, there can be no assurance
         that management will be successful in raising additional capital or in
         its efforts to sell the Company. These circumstances raise substantial
         doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These
         financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result
         if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.


2.       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         BASIS OF PRESENTATION
         The financial statements include the accounts of MedUnite Inc. and its
         wholly-owned subsidiary. All intercompany balances and transactions
         have been eliminated in consolidation.

         USE OF ESTIMATES
         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
         principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
         management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
         amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
         assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
         reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
         Actual results could differ from those estimates.

         CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
         The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
         maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash
         equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and
         certificates of deposit with a financial institution.

         INVESTMENT IN DERIVATIVE SECURITIES
         Changes in the fair value of the Company's investment in derivative
         securities are recorded in investment income. The Company elected to
         adopt Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, ACCOUNTING
         FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, upon the Company's
         inception.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


         PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
         Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
         depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method
         over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to
         three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
         straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives
         or the term of the lease. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets
         disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from
         the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to
         income. Expenditures for repairs, maintenance and minor renewals and
         betterments are expensed as incurred.

         INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE
         Internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use computer
         software during the application development stage are capitalized.
         Application development stage costs generally include software
         configuration, coding, installation to hardware and testing. Costs of
         upgrades and major enhancements that result in additional functionality
         are also capitalized. Costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades
         and enhancements are expensed as incurred. During the year ended
         December 31, 2001, the Company capitalized $9,876,000 of internal-use
         software development costs. Amortization expense, which is computed on
         a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from two to
         three years, was $293,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The
         Company did not capitalize any internal-use software development costs
         during the period ended December 31, 2000 (Note 5).

         LONG-LIVED ASSETS
         The Company assesses potential impairments of its long-lived assets
         when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances have
         made recovery of an asset's carrying value unlikely. An impairment loss
         is recognized when the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash
         flows expected to be generated by an asset (or group of assets) is less
         than its carrying value. Any required impairment loss would be measured
         as the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair
         value and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the
         related asset and a charge to operations. The Company has not recorded
         any such impairment losses.

         INTANGIBLE ASSETS
         Intangible assets consist primarily of a software platform, non-compete
         agreement, customer related agreements and software and goodwill
         arising from the Company's acquisition of NDCHealth's physician network
         services business in 2001 (Note 3). Identifiable intangible assets with
         determinable lives are stated at their fair value and are being
         amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful
         lives as follows:



                Software platform                              3 years
                Non-compete agreement                          5 years
                Customer related agreements                  3 to 5 years
                Other identifiable intangible assets       0.5 to 5 years


         Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed annually (or more frequently
         if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. Intangible assets that
         are not deemed to have indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment in
         accordance with the Company's policy for long-lived assets. As of
         December 31, 2001, no such impairment losses have been recognized.

         REVENUE RECOGNITION
         The Company derives revenue from processing electronically submitted
         medical claims for insurance companies and health care providers.
         Revenue is recognized as services are provided according to the terms
         of the underlying contracts.

         RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
         Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

         ADVERTISING COSTS
         Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was
         $481,000 and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2001 and the period
         ended December 31, 2000, respectively.

         INCOME TAXES
         Current income tax expense or benefit represents the amount of income
         taxes expected to be payable or refundable for the current year. A
         deferred income tax asset or liability is computed for the expected
         future impact of differences between the financial reporting and income
         tax bases of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax
         benefit to be derived from tax credits and loss carryforwards. Deferred
         income tax expense or benefit represents the net change during the year
         in the deferred income tax asset or liability. Deferred tax assets are
         reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it
         is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
         assets will not be realized.

         CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
         The Company's financial instruments subject to concentrations of credit
         risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts
         receivable. The Company's policy is to place its cash and cash
         equivalents with high quality financial institutions in order to limit
         its credit exposure. To date, the Company has not experienced any
         credit losses associated with these financial institutions. Accounts
         receivable are generally unsecured. The Company performs on-going
         credit evaluations of its customers and maintains an allowance for
         potential credit losses as considered necessary.

         COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)
         Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in the equity of a
         business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events
         and circumstances from non-owner sources. The Company presents other
         comprehensive income (loss) in its statements of stockholders' equity.
         For the year ended December 31, 2001 and the period ended December 31,
         2000, the only component of comprehensive loss is net loss.


3.       ACQUISITION

         In August 2001, the Company acquired NDCHealth's physician network
         services business (the "Acquisition"). The physician network services
         business connects physicians to payors to provide electronic processing
         for claims, eligibility, referrals and other health transactions. The
         Company acquired the physician network services business in exchange
         for 15,263,402 shares of Series A preferred stock, having an estimated
         fair value, as determined by management, of $15,263,000, and a
         promissory note with a principal amount of $2,300,000, having an
         estimated fair value of $1,966,000 (Note 6). In addition, the Company
         incurred acquisition costs of $1,043,000 related to the acquisition.

         The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
         accounting, and accordingly, the results of the acquired business have
         been included in the Company's financial statements from the date of
         acquisition. The aggregate purchase price was allocated as follows:

            Accounts receivable            $  2,214,000

4.       INVESTMENT IN WARRANT OF QUOVADX, INC.

         In October 2000, the Company entered into a Software License and
         Services Agreement (the "Agreement") with Quovadx, Inc., formerly
         XCare.net, Inc. ("Quovadx") under which Quovadx provides software
         development and hosting services related to the Company's internet
         portal. The development services are invoiced to the Company on a time
         and materials basis and the hosting service fees are invoiced based on
         the number of servers hosted. In June 2001, the Company accepted and
         paid approximately $6,700,000 for a perpetual software license, which
         is included in property and equipment.

         In addition, the Company is committed to purchase software maintenance
         services from Quovadx from June 2002 through December 31, 2005, as
         follows:

             YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31,

                  2002                                 $      700,000
                  2003                                        700,000
                  2004                                        700,000
                  2005                                        408,000
                                                       ----------------
                                                       $    2,508,000
                                                       ================

          In connection with the Agreement, Quovadx issued warrants to the
         Company to purchase 1,350,000 shares of Quovadx's common stock at an
         exercise price of $4.06. The warrants were immediately vested,
         exercisable and non-forfeitable and had a contractual life of 18 months
         from the date of grant. The fair value of the warrants at the date of
         issuance was estimated to be $3,054,000, using the Black-Scholes option
         pricing model assuming a volatility factor of 120%, risk-free interest
         rate of 5.9%, dividend yield of 0%, a contractual life of 18 months and
         Quovadx's stock price of $4.06. The warrants are classified as an
         investment and are stated at fair value at December 31, 2000. Payments
         made to Quovadx up to the initial fair value of the warrant are
         considered payment for the purchase of the warrant. For the period
         ended December 31, 2000, the Company made payments of $2,113,000 to
         Quovadx. The remaining $941,000, which was included in accrued expenses
         at December 31, 2000, was offset against payments made during the year
         ended December 31, 2001. The difference between (i) the value of the
         development services provided on a time and materials basis and the
         software payment of $6,700,000 and (ii) the fair value of the warrant
         of $3,054,000 is being accounted for as internally developed software.
         In September 2001, the Company exercised these warrants and sold the
         underlying Quovadx common stock for a total of $8,915,000, recognizing
         a gain of $4,956,000, which is included in investment income for 2001.

         In addition, under the terms of the Agreement, the Company has a put
         right with Quovadx that would require Quovadx to invest between $10
         million and $20 million in a future financing, subject to certain
         conditions, if requested by Company's Board of Directors. The
         investment shall be on terms similar to other investors in the
         financing. However, there can be no assurance that the Board of
         Directors will exercise this right or that the conditions of the put

6.       NOTES PAYABLE

         During 2001 and 2000, the Company received proceeds of $24,340,000 and
         $20,000,000, respectively, from its founders in connection with the
         issuance of convertible notes payable (the "Notes"), as amended. The
         Notes have annual interest rates ranging from 6.10% to 6.53%. The
         principal balance of the Notes automatically converted into 44,340,331
         shares of Series A preferred stock at $1.00 per share upon the closing
         the Acquisition in August 2001. The outstanding accrued interest of
         $1,565,000 was converted into notes payable. The Company imputed an
         interest rate of 12% on these notes, which more accurately reflects the
         rate that the Company would pay to a third party lender. The resulting
         debt discount of $129,000 was recorded as additional paid-in capital
         because the notes were issued to the founders. The notes are repayable
         in four quarterly installments during 2003. Accrued interest related to
         this note at December 31, 2001 of $70,000 is included in other
         long-term liabilities.

         During 2001, the Company issued a promissory note in connection with
         the Acquisition. The note has a principal amount of $2,300,000 payable
         in full in August 2004, and was initially recorded at its estimated
         fair value of $1,996,000, representing an effective annual interest
         rate of 12%. Accrued interest related to this note at December 31, 2001
         of $99,000 is included in other long-term liabilities.

7.       COMMON STOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK

         COMMON STOCK
         The rights and privileges of the common stock under the Company's
         Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation are as follows:

         Each holder of Class A common stock and Class B common stock is
         entitled to one vote per share. Holders of Class B common stock, voting
         as a separate class, are entitled to elect or remove from office the
         founders' members of the Company's Board of Directors. The holders of
         all outstanding shares of Company stock, voting together on an
         if-converted basis as a single class, are entitled to elect all
         remaining members of the Board of Directors.

         Each share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time into an
         equal number of shares of Class A common stock transferred to a
         non-founder. Class B common stock transferred to a non-founder will
         automatically convert into Class A common stock. In addition, Class B
         common stock owned by the founders will automatically convert into
         Class A common stock upon the earlier of a) the fifth anniversary of an
         initial public offering of the Company, or b) when the founders own, in
         aggregate, less than 50% of Class B common stock that would be issued
         upon conversion of the Series A preferred stock.

         PREFERRED STOCK
         The rights, preferences and privileges of the Series A preferred stock
         under the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
         are as follows:

         DIVIDENDS - The holders of shares of the Series A preferred stock are
         entitled to receive dividends at the rate of 8% of the original issue
         price, which is $1.00 per share, per annum (subject to appropriate
         adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination
         or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares), payable when
         and as declared by the Board of Directors of the Company. The right to
         receive dividends shall be noncumulative; however the Company shall not
         declare or pay any distributions on shares of common stock until the
         preferred stockholders have received a cumulative distribution at the
         rate specified above.

         LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE - In certain events, including liquidation,
         dissolution or winding up of the Company, including a consolidation or
         merger and conveyance of substantially all of the assets of the
         Company, the holders of Series A preferred stock have a preference in
         liquidation over the common stockholders equal to the original issue
         price of $1.00 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment in the
         event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar

         recapitalization affecting such shares), plus any dividends declared
         but unpaid thereon. If the assets of the Company are not sufficient to
         fulfill the liquidation amount, the stockholders will share in the
         liquidation amount on a pro rata basis.

         SALE OF THE COMPANY - In the event the Board of Directors decides to
         pursue the sale of the Company, the founders shall be given the first
         right of refusal to acquire the Company. If none of the founders
         exercise this right, NDCHealth has the option to purchase the Company.

         VOTING RIGHTS - Each holder of preferred stock shall be entitled to the
         number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of common stock
         into which they are then convertible. Holders of Series A preferred
         stock, voting as a separate class, are entitled to elect or remove from
         office the founders' members of the Company's Board of Directors.

         CONVERSION - Each share of preferred stock is automatically convertible
         into one share of Class B common stock (subject to customary
         adjustments to protect against dilution) upon the closing of a public
         offering of the Company's common stock that results in gross proceeds
         of at least $50,000,000.

         Due to the uncertainty of the Company generating future taxable income,
         the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax
         assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


         At December 31, 2001, the Company had $44,739,000 and $44,739,000 of
         federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively. The
         federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in
         2020 and 2010, respectively.

         Management is currently exploring various strategic alternatives
         including the possible sale of the Company. Future changes in control
         may result in a limitation on the future utilization of the company's
         net operating loss carryforwards.



9.       STOCK OPTIONS

         The Company has adopted the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan")
         providing for the granting of up to 10,280,374 shares of the Company's
         common stock. The Plan provides for the granting of stock options and
         restricted stock awards. Incentive stock options granted under the Plan
         must be granted with strike prices not less than the fair market value.
         Non-qualified stock options granted under the Plan must be granted with
         strike prices not less than 85% of fair market value. Options generally
         expire ten years from the date of grant. Option vesting is determined
         by the Board of Directors upon each grant and is generally a five-year
         period.

         In June 2000, the Company entered into a five-year employment agreement
         with an executive under which the Company issued stock options to
         purchase 2,803,738 shares of common stock and is obligated to issue
         847,458 shares of restricted common stock to the executive. If the
         executive's employment terminates, other than for cause, prior to the
         fifth anniversary of the executive's hire date, the Company is
         obligated to repurchase all of the restricted common stock for an
         aggregate price equal to the greater of the then fair market value or
         $1,000,000. Commencing on the fifth anniversary of the executive's hire
         date, the executive has a right to sell all or some of his shares of
         restricted common stock and stock option shares to the Company for a
         guaranteed fixed pre-tax gain of $7,000,000 in the aggregate assuming
         all shares were repurchased. This amount is being recognized as
         compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the five-year
         service period. Through December 31, 2001, $2,158,000 has been recorded
         as deferred compensation.

         In 2002, this executive has asserted that if his employment is
         terminated following a change in control of the Company, the
         "guaranteed value" provision set forth in Section 7 of this employment
         agreement will be accelerated and become fully due and payable. He
         asserts that he would be entitled to receive $7,000,000 for his
         restricted stock and options. The Company believes the executive's
         "guaranteed value" provision does not accelerate upon a change of
         control of the Company and that the executive must be an employee of
         the Company on the fifth anniversary of his hire date in order to
         receive the $7,000,000 guaranteed value. The Company does not dispute
         that if the executive's employment terminates without cause as defined
         in the agreement prior to the fifth anniversary of his hire date, he
         would be entitled to put the shares to the Company for repurchase at an
         aggregate purchase price equal to the greater of the then fair market
         value or $1,000,000.

         The executive has requested that the Company agree to a binding
         arbitration to resolve this dispute. The Company has rejected this
         request for arbitration and intends to defend any claim vigorously. The
         accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that
         may result from this uncertainty.

         During 2001, the Company granted options to purchase 8,452,458 shares
         of common stock (including the options to purchase 2,803,738 shares of
         common stock granted to the executive referred to above) with a
         weighted average exercise price of $1.54.

         At December 31, 2001, 980,458 shares (exclusive of the 897,458 shares
         of restricted stock to be issued to the executive referred to above)
         were available for future grants under the Plans.

         The weighted-average fair value of options granted during the year
         ended December 31, 2001 was $0.08.

         PRO FORMA EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION EXPENSE
         Had compensation cost for the Company's stock-based compensation been
         determined based on the fair value of the options at the date of grant,
         the Company's net loss would not have been materially different from
         the net loss reported for 2001.

         The fair value of these options was estimated at the date of grant
         using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
         weighted-average assumptions for grants during 2001: dividend yield of
         0%, expected life of five years, expected volatility of 0%, and
         risk-free interest rate of 6%.



10.      RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         The Company was founded by seven leading insurance companies who are
         expected to be among the Company's primary customers. In August 2001,
         the Company entered into service agreements with each of the founders
         under which the Company will facilitate specified business transactions
         for fees. These agreements have a term of two years and automatically
         renew for successive annual periods, if not cancelled by either party.

         At December 31, 2001, the Company has accounts receivable from its
         founders in the aggregate amount of $361,000. During 2001, the Company
         recognized revenue of $1,348,000 from its founders.

         At December 31, 2001, the Company has accounts receivable from
         NDCHealth of $506,000 and accounts payable and accrued liabilities due
         to NDCHealth of $1,642,000. During 2001, the Company recognized revenue
         of $2,157,000 from NDCHealth.

</TABLE>

         Assets under capital leases included in property and equipment at
         December 31, 2001 had a net book value of $542,000, which includes
         accumulated amortization of $95,000.

         Rent expense was $1,555,000 and $441,000 for the year ended December
         31, 2001 and the period ended December 31, 2000, respectively. Certain
         facility operating leases contain escalation clauses. The Company
         recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the related lease
         term.

         EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
         The Company entered into employment agreements with certain executives
         that provide for cash severance payments if the executives are
         terminated without cause. The Company's aggregate commitment under
         these agreements is $2,335,000 at December 31, 2001.



12.      SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

         In February 2002, the Company issued convertible promissory notes
         bearing interest at 2.74% per annum, pursuant to a note purchase
         agreement with its founders, under which the Company borrowed an
         aggregate amount of $18,160,000. In the event that the Company issues
         and sells shares of Series B Preferred Stock to new investors with
         total proceeds of not less than $30,000,000, including the $18,160,000
         advanced, prior to February 2003, then the outstanding principal of the
         convertible promissory notes will automatically convert into shares of
         Series B Preferred Stock at the same price per share that the shares of
         Series B Preferred Stock are sold to the new investors. If a financing

         does not occur before February 2003, then the outstanding principal
         balance will automatically convert into shares of Series B Preferred
         Stock at the price per share equal to the then fair market value. The
         Series B Preferred Stock will have such rights, preferences and
         privileges as are approved by the required vote of the founders (as
         defined in the Company's amended and restated certificate of
         incorporation); provided that the rights of the Series B Preferred
         stockholders shall be pari passu to the rights of the Series A
         Preferred stockholders upon a liquidation of the Company.

         In April 2002, the Company entered into a non-cancellable operating
         lease for office space, which expires on April 30, 2005. The Company's
         future minimum payments under the lease for the years ending December
         31, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 are $327,652, $501,880, $517,483, and
         $174,228, respectively.

         In July 2002, the Company entered into a three-year information
         technology services agreement to outsource certain hosting, system
         maintenance and operation services. Actual service fees are based on
         the number of transactions processed by the software being supported;
         however, the Company is committed to pay a minimum annual service fee
         of $1,212,000. The Company has the option to cancel the agreement by
         providing 90 days notice and paying an early termination fee which will
         be equal to between one and three months' average transaction fees,
         depending upon when the agreement is terminated.

         In August 2002, the Company issued promissory notes bearing interest at
         6% per annum, pursuant to a note purchase agreement with its founders,
         under which the Company subsequently borrowed the maximum amount
         available of $5,815,000. The outstanding principal amount of the loan
         is due and payable on the earliest of the following events: (a)
         December 31, 2002, (b) the date that the Company completes an equity
         financing for the minimum amount of $20,000,000 or (c) the effective
         date of a change of control of the Company.
