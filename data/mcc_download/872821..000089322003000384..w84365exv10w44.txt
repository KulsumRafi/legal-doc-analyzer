preamble hereof.

                  "Permitted Transferee" shall mean, with respect to any natural
person, the parents, siblings, spouse, children (by birth or adoption) or
spouses of children of such person (in any such case who are the age of 21 or

                  "Put Notice" has the meaning set forth in Section 7.2(d)
hereof.

                  "Put Price" means an amount equal to the LLC Value multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Membership Points
included in the LLC Interest to be purchased by Wilmington from CRM, Inc. or a
Principal and his Permitted Transferees, as the case may be, and the denominator
of which is the number of Membership Points outstanding on the Purchase Closing
Date on a fully-diluted basis (i.e., including any "in the money" options as
determined in accordance with Exhibit B). With respect to a Put under Section
7.2(b) and a purchase under Section 7.3(a) hereof, the Put Price shall be
determined as of the Determination Date immediately preceding the Purchase
Closing Date. For example, if a Principal were to die on August 1,1999, the
Purchase Closing Date would occur on April 1, 2001, and the Determination Date
as of which the Put Price is determined would be December 31, 2000.

                  With respect to a purchase under Sections 7.3(b) and (c)
hereof, the Put Price shall be determined as follows: a portion of the Put
Price, which portion shall be determined by dividing the number of days the
Principal has been employed by the Company during the Fiscal Year in which the
event giving rise to the purchase obligation or Wilmington Call arises (or, with
respect to delivery of a Put Notice in excess of one-half of a Principal's High
Water Mark, the number of days during a Fiscal Year prior to the date of
delivery of the Put Notice) and the denominator of which is 365, shall be
determined as of the Determination Date immediately preceding the Purchase
Closing Date, and the balance of the Put Price shall be determined as of the
penultimate Determination Date preceding the Purchase Closing Date. For example,
if (i) the LLC Value as of December 31,1998 is $(*) million; (ii) the LLC Value
as of December 31, 1999 is $(*) million; (iii) a Principal and his Permitted
Transferees own a 2% LLC Interest; and (iv) such Principal resigns his
employment with the Company on August 1,1999, 212/365 of the Put Price would be
based on the LLC Value determined as of December 31, 1999 and 153/365 of the Put
Price would be based on the LLC Value determined as of December 31,1998. The Put
Price would thus equal $(*) million x .02 x 212/365, or $(*), plus $(*) million
x .02 x 153/365, or $(*) for a total Put Price of $(*).

                  "Realization Event" shall mean (i) any sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company, (ii) any merger or consolidation
of the Company with or into another entity, or, unless otherwise provided by the
Board, of another entity with or into the Company or (iii) any dissolution or
winding up of the Company.

                  "Related Entities" shall mean, with respect to any Member or
Members, any partnership, limited liability company or corporation in which such
Member or Members or a Permitted Transferee of such Member or Members own all of
the partnership, membership or other equity interests, or all of the capital
stock, as the case may be, and with respect to WTI, shall mean any entity that
is or will be consolidated with WTI or WTC for federal income tax purposes.

Ronald H. McGlynn, when that Principal reaches age 55 and, with respect to
Ronald H. McGlynn, when he reaches age 58; provided, however, Retirement shall
not occur with respect to a Principal who continues to work for the Company
after reaching the age set forth herein, unless the Board notifies him that it

to a Principal who continues to participate in the Company after reaching such

meetings without call or notice at such places and at such times as the Board
may from time to time determine, provided reasonable notice of the first regular
meeting following any such determination is given to Managers absent at the
meeting fixing regular meetings. When called by the Chairman or by Managers
holding a majority of votes on the Board, the Board may hold special meetings at
such places and times as are designated in the call of the meeting, upon at
least seven days' notice given by the Chairman, the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary, or by the Managers calling the meeting.

                  Section 5.8. Quorum. At any meeting of the Board, the presence
of three Managers shall constitute a quorum. Any meeting may be adjourned from
time to time by Managers holding a majority of votes present at the meeting,
whether or not a quorum is present, and the meeting may be held as adjourned

taken without a meeting if all the Managers consent to the action in writing.
The written consents shall be filed with the records of the meetings of the

Designated Managers necessary for Board action under Section 5.12 hereof may
bind the Company.

them.

                  (c) Subject to the limitation set forth in paragraph (b), the
Board hereby delegates to the Officers of the Company the respective powers
delegated to officers of a corporation under the Delaware General Corporation
Law, subject to the powers of a board of directors of a corporation under such

                  Section 5.17. Reimbursement. The Company shall reimburse each
Manager for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such
Manager on behalf of the Company according to such terms as shall be approved by
the Board. The Board' s sole determination of which expenses may be reimbursed
to a Manager and the amount of such expenses shall be conclusive. Such
reimbursement shall be treated as an expense of the Company that shall be
deducted in computing Profits and Losses and shall not be deemed to constitute a
distributive share of Profits or a distribution or return of capital to the

                  (a) Each member shall have a capital account on the books of
the Company.

                  (b) A Member's capital account shall be credited with:

                  (i) such Member's capital contributions;

                  (ii) such Member's share of Profits as provided in Section

                  (iii) any gain allocated to such Member under Section 6.3(a);
and

                  (iv) such other amounts as may be required in order for the
capital account to be considered to be determined and maintained in accordance
with the rules of Treas. Reg. Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) (or any successor
section of similar import).

                  (c) A Member's capital account shall be debited with:

                  (i) such Member's share of Losses as provided in Section
6.3(h);

                  (ii) distributions made to such Member; and

                  (iii) such other amounts as may be required in order for the
capital account to be considered to be determined and maintained in accordance
with the rules of Treas. Reg. Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) (or any successor
section of similar import).

                  (c) Capital accounts shall not bear interest.

                  (d) Except as provided in Section 13.4(a)(ii) hereof, no
Member has the right to demand a return of such Member's capital contributions
(or the balance of such Member's capital account). Further, no Member has the
right (i) to demand and receive any distribution from the Company in any form
other than cash or (ii) to bring an action of partition against the Company or
its property.

                  Section 6.3. Distributions and Allocations.

                  (a) Subject to Section 6.3(c), within 90 days after the end of
each Fiscal Year, the Board shall cause to be distributed to the Members all
Available Cash in accordance with (and in proportion to) their respective number
of Membership Points for such Fiscal Year. In the event the Board, in its sole
discretion, elects to make any distributions of Available Cash with respect to
any Fiscal Year prior to the end of that Fiscal Year, such distributions shall
be made to the Members pro rata, in accordance with reasonable estimates of the
amount of distributions to be made to each Member for such Fiscal Year under
this Section 6.3(a), and all such distributions shall be deemed advances against
distributions of Available Cash to the Members pursuant to this Section 6.3(a).
In the event (i) the Membership Points of any Member shall be adjusted, by
Transfer or otherwise, during any Fiscal Year or (ii) any Member shall be
admitted to the Company during any Fiscal Year, any distributions and any
allocations to such Member pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall be made based on
the average of the Member's LLC Interest for such Fiscal Year, determined on a
monthly basis. For example, if in the months of January through July of a Fiscal
Year (i.e., seven months) a Member owned nine Membership Points and in the
months of August through December of such Fiscal Year (i.e., five months) a
Member owned three Membership Points, the distributions and allocations to such
Member pursuant to this Section 6.3(a) shall be based on an LLC Interest
calculated as follows:

                       (7 x 9) + (5 x 3) = 6.5 Membership
                              12                Points
                                       16
<PAGE>
                  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.3(a) hereof,
the Board shall make distributions to the Members pro rata, in accordance with
their Membership Points, at least quarterly, in amounts intended to enable the
Members (or any Person whose tax liability is determined by reference to the
income of a Member) to discharge their United States federal, state and local
income tax liabilities arising from the allocations made pursuant to this
Section 6.3, including, without limitation, estimated tax payments (a "Tax
Liability Distribution"). The amount of any such Tax Liability Distribution
shall be determined by the Board taking into account among other things (i) the
maximum combined United States federal, and any applicable state and local tax
rate, in each case applicable to individuals or corporations on ordinary income
and net short-term capital gain or on net long-term capital gain, as applicable,
and taking into account the deductibility of state and local income taxes for
United States federal income tax purposes and the deductibility of local income
taxes for state income tax purposes, and (ii) the amounts of such income and
gain so allocated to such Member, and otherwise based on such reasonable
assumptions as the Board determines in good faith to be appropriate. All
distributions made to the Members pursuant to this Section 6.3(b) shall be
deemed advances against distributions of Available Cash to the Members pursuant
to Section 6.3(a).

                  (c) Subject to the terms and conditions in Article XIII
hereof, upon liquidation of the Company, any distributions shall be in
proportion to the balances of the Members' capital accounts at the end of the
Fiscal Year in which the liquidation occurs, or, if later, within ninety (90)
days after the liquidation.

                  (d) All amounts withheld pursuant to the Code or any provision
of any state or local tax law with respect to any payment, distribution or
allocation to the Company or the Members shall be treated as amounts distributed
to the Members pursuant to this Section 6.3 for all purposes of this Agreement.
The Board is authorized to withhold from distributions or with respect to
allocations to the Members and to pay over to any federal, state or local
government any amounts required to be so withheld pursuant to the Code or any
provision of any other federal, state or local law and shall allocate such
amounts to those Members with respect to which such amounts were withheld.

                  (e) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company shall not make a distribution to any Member on
account of its interest in the Company if such distribution would violate
Section 18-607 of the Delaware Act or other applicable law.

                  (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any
Member unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions
described in Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) of the Treasury
Regulations such Member shall be specially allocated items of income and gain
(consisting of a pro rata portion of each item of Company income, including
gross income, and gain for such Fiscal Year) in an amount and manner sufficient
to eliminate as quickly as possible the deficit capital account balance (if any)
of such Member (determined after decreasing such balance for the items described
in Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) of the Treasury Regulations and
increasing such balance by any amount which a Member is deemed to be obligated
to restore under Section 1.704-2(g)(1) or (i)(5) of the Treasury Regulations).
This provision is intended to comply with the "qualified income offset"
requirement of Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) of the Treasury Regulations and
shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

<PAGE>
                  (g) Profits or Losses, as the case may be, for a Fiscal Year
shall be allocated among the Members in accordance with their respective
Membership Points based on the weighted average of each Member's LLC Interest
for such Fiscal Year, determined on a monthly basis (See example in Section
6.3(a)).

                  (h) Income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any
property contributed to the capital of the Company by a, Member shall, solely
for income tax purposes, be allocated to the contributing Member in accordance
with Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations.

                                   ARTICLE VII

           TRANSFER OF LLC INTERESTS, PUT AND CALL OPTIONS, MANDATORY
                  PURCHASES AND ADMISSION OF ADDITIONAL MEMBERS

                  Section 7.1. Assignability of Interests.

                  (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Article VII, no LLC
Interest of a Member may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated,
gifted, exchanged, optioned or encumbered (each, a "Transfer") and no Transfer
in violation of this Agreement shall be binding upon the Company.

                  (b) A Member may transfer all or any portion of its or his LLC
Interest to any one or more Permitted Transferees or Related Entities who agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however,
that notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
transferring Member shall retain the vote with respect to the LLC Interests so
Transferred to Permitted Transferees or Related Entities unless the Transferee
is consolidated with WTI or Wilmington for federal income tax purposes or unless
the Transferee is a trust of which a Principal is the voting trustee or
otherwise possesses the power to vote the LLC Interest so Transferred.

                  (c) In addition to Transfers permitted under Section 7.1(b),
the Members may exercise Puts in accordance with Section 7.2, make sales in
accordance with Section 7.3 and pledge their LLC Interests to secure loans, the
proceeds of which are used to finance the purchase of LLC Interests.

                  Section 7.2 Put Options.

                  (a) On or before February 28 of each year, the Company shall
notify all Members of the LLC Value as of December 31 of the immediately
preceding year.

<PAGE>
                  (b) Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this
Section 7.2, each Principal or his Permitted Transferee may exercise an option
to sell to Wilmington all or any portion of their LLC Interest. In addition,
subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this Section 7.2, if a
shareholder of CRM, Inc. notifies CRM, Inc. of his exercise of a put of all or
any portion of his CRM, Inc. shares pursuant to Section 6.2 of the CRM, Inc.
Shareholders Agreement, then CRM, Inc. shall put to Wilmington that portion of
the outstanding LLC Interests represented by the Derivative Share attributable
to the shares of CRM, Inc. with respect to which puts have been so exercised
(each such Put to Wilmington by a Principal, his Permitted Transferees or CRM,
Inc., a "Put"). Upon exercise of a Put under this Section 7.2(b), Wilmington
shall thereupon become obligated to purchase the LLC Interest as to which the
Put has been exercised.

                  (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 7.2(b) to
the contrary, unless otherwise agreed to by Wilmington (i) a Principal and his
Permitted Transferees may not exercise, or in their capacity as shareholders of
CRM, Inc. cause CRM, Inc. to exercise, a Put during any Fiscal Year with respect
to LLC Interests in excess of 50% of the High Water Mark of such Principal
unless the sum of such Principal' s and his Permitted Transferees then current
LLC Interest and their Derivative Share of CRM, Inc.'s LLC Interest is one
percent (1%) or less; (ii) Puts may not be exercised in any Fiscal Year with
respect to more than 20% of the LLC Interests of the Company then outstanding;
(iii) a Principal and his Permitted Transferees may not exercise, or in their
capacity as shareholders of CRM, Inc. cause CRM, Inc. to exercise, a Put until
at least three years after such Principal ceases to be employed by the Company
by reason of (A) termination for Cause or (B) resignation other than by
Retirement or other than for Good Reason; (iv) a Put may not be exercised, and
any Put which has been exercised shall be rescinded, with respect to any LLC
Interest which, prior to the Purchase Closing Date of a proposed Put exercise,
is to be purchased or has been Called under Section 7.3 hereof; (v) a Put may
not be exercised with respect to the respective LLC Interests of Gerald B.
Cramer or Ronald H. McGlynn and their Permitted Transferees, or their respective
Derivative Shares, prior to March 15, 2000; and (vi) Puts may not be exercised
with respect to an LLC Interest purchased pursuant to the exercise of options
granted (A) prior to April 1, 2000 by the Company under Section 7.9 hereof until
at least six months after the purchase of such LLC Interest, and (B) after March
31, 2000 by the Company under Section 7.9 hereof or by WTI until the earlier of
(x) three years after the purchase of such LLC Interest and (y) five years after
such options were granted by the Company or WTI, but in no event until at least
six months after the Purchase of such LLC Interest; provided, however, if there
is a Change of Control which accelerates the vesting of options pursuant to the
terms thereof, a Put may be exercised with respect to an LLC Interest acquired
pursuant to the exercise of such options beginning six months after the purchase
of such LLC Interest; and further provided, however, the limitations set forth
in this Section 7.2(c), other than the limitations set forth in item (vi) above,
shall not apply with respect to the exercise of a Put by a Principal and his
Permitted Transferees if such Principal's employment by the Company is
terminated by the Company without Cause or such Principal's resignation of
employment for Good Reason or to the exercise of a Put by CRM, Inc. following
the termination of employment by the Company without Cause or resignation of
employment for Good Reason of a Principal who or whose Permitted Transferees are
shareholders of CRM, Inc., to the extent of such Principal's and Permitted
Transferee's Derivative Share of CRM, Inc.'s LLC Interest, if such shareholder's
CRM, Inc. shares are purchased pursuant to Section 6.2 of the CRM, Inc.
Shareholders Agreement. If, in any Fiscal Year, Puts are exercised with respect
to more than 20% of the outstanding LLC Interests of the Company (subject to the
proviso set forth in the immediately preceding sentence) then each such Member
shall be entitled to exercise Puts equal to the product of (x)

                                       19
<PAGE>
20%, (y) the LLC Interests of the Company then outstanding and (z) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the LLC Interest for which a Put is sought to be
exercised by the Member and the denominator of which is the total LLC Interests
for which Puts are sought to be exercised by all Members.

                  (d) A Member may exercise a Put by giving an irrevocable
notice of exercise of the Put to Wilmington in substantially the form of Exhibit
C hereto (the "Put Notice") on or before March 15 of any year stating that it or
he is electing to exercise the Put and specifying the LLC Interest to be sold
pursuant to the Put. On or before the first day of April after receipt of a Put
Notice, and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.2(c), Wilmington
shall purchase from the Principal and his Permitted Transferees and, if
applicable, CRM, Inc., the LLC Interest set forth in the Put Notice. At the
closing of the exercise of a Put, Wilmington shall deliver the Put Price to the
Principal and his Permitted Transferees or CRM, Inc., as the case may be, by
certified check or wire transfer of immediately available funds against delivery
of such documents or instruments of transfer as may be reasonably requested by
Wilmington.

                  (e) On the last day of the month in which a Put is exercised
by a Member, such Member shall cease to have any rights as a Member with respect
to the LLC Interest so Put other than (i) the right to receive the Put Price on
the Purchase Closing Date; and (ii) the right to receive distributions and
allocations with respect to such LLC Interest through the last day of the month
in which the Put is exercised in accordance with Section 6.3(g) and the last two
sentences of Section 6.3(a).

                  Section 7.3. Purchase on Death, Disability, Retirement;
Wilmington Call Options. The following provisions with respect to the purchase
and sale of an LLC Interest of a Principal and his Permitted Transferees,
including their Derivative Share of CRM, Inc.'s LLC Interest, shall apply
following the termination of such Principal's employment by the Company, a
transfer required by operation of law or other involuntary transfer of an LLC
Interest or a Derivative Share of CRM, Inc.'s LLC Interest or delivery of one or
more Put Notices which together represent more than one-half (1/2) of the High
Water Mark of a Principal;

                  (a) In the event of the death, Disability or Retirement of a
Principal (i) Wilmington shall be obligated to purchase from such Principal or
such Principal's estate and such Principal's Permitted Transferees, and such
Principal or such Principal's estate and such Principal's Permitted Transferees,
as the case may be, shall be obligated to sell to Wilmington, all of such
Principal's and his Permitted Transferees' LLC Interest at a purchase price
equal to the Put Price thereof; and (ii) Wilmington shall be obligated to
purchase from CRM, Inc. and CRM, Inc. shall be obligated to sell to Wilmington,
the Derivative Share of CRM, Inc.'s LLC Interest attributable to such Principal
and his Permitted Transferees, at a purchase price equal to the Put Price
thereof. In the event of the death, Retirement or Disability of a Principal
between January 1 and June 30 of any year, the Purchase Closing Date under this
Section 7.3(a) shall be on April 1 (or if April 1 is not a business day, the
next succeeding business day) of the year following the date of death,
Disability or Retirement. At the closing of the purchase from the Principal, the
estate of the deceased Principal, the Principal's Permitted Transferees, or CRM,
Inc., in the event of such Principal's death, Disability or Retirement between
January 1 and June 30 of any year, Wilmington shall deliver to the Principal,
his Permitted Transferees, CRM, Inc. or the personal representative of the
deceased Principal' s estate, as the case may be, the purchase price by
certified check or wire transfer of immediately available funds. In the event of
the death, Disability or Retirement of a Principal between July 1 and December
31 of any year, the Purchase Closing Date under this Section

                                       20
<PAGE>
7.3(a) shall be on April 1 (or if April 1 is not a business day, the next
succeeding business day) of the second year following the date of death,
Disability or Retirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on or before April 1 of
the year following the date of death, Disability or Retirement of a Principal
whose death, Disability or Retirement occurs between July 1 and December 31 of
any year, Wilmington shall deliver to the Principal, the Principal's Permitted
Transferees, the personal representative of the estate of the deceased
Principal, or CRM, Inc., as the case may be, by certified check or wire transfer
of immediately available funds, an amount equal to 75% of the Put Price
determined as of the most recent Determination Date as an advance against the
Put Price to be paid to the Principal, the Principal's Permitted Transferees,
the personal representative of the deceased Principal's estate or CRM, Inc., as
the case may be, at the Purchase Closing Date. At the closing of the purchase
under this Section 7.3(a) with respect to a Principal whose death, Disability or
Retirement occurs between July 1 and December 31 of any year, Wilmington shall
deliver to the Principal, the Principal's Permitted Transferees, the personal
representative of the deceased Principal's estate or CRM, Inc., as the case may
be, by certified check or wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
amount, if any, by which the purchase price for the LLC Interest purchased on
such Purchase Closing Date exceeds the amount previously advanced to such Person
pursuant to this Section 7.3(a). If Wilmington advises the Principal, the
Principal's Permitted Transferees, the personal representative of the deceased
Principal's estate or CRM, Inc., as the case may be, that the amount previously
advanced to such Person exceeds the purchase price for the LLC Interest
purchased on such Purchase Closing Date, then the Principal, the Principal's
Permitted Transferees, the personal representative of the deceased Principal's
estate or CRM, Inc., as the case may be, shall remit the shortfall promptly to
Wilmington. Wilmington may purchase life insurance or Disability insurance on
any Principal in order to fund the obligations of Wilmington under this Section
7.3(a) or for any other purpose. Each Principal shall cooperate with Wilmington,
in obtaining such insurance, including taking any required physical
examinations.

                  (b) Within 90 days following (i) the termination of employment
by the Company of a Principal, other than by reason of death, Disability or
Retirement; (ii) a transfer required by operation of law or other involuntary
transfer of a Principal's or his Permitted Transferee's LLC Interest or their
Derivative Share of CRM, Inc.'s LLC Interest; or (iii) the first time there is a
delivery of one or more Put Notices which together represent more than one-half
(1/2) of the High Water Mark of a Principal, Wilmington may exercise the right
to purchase from such Principal, such Principal's Permitted Transferees or from
CRM, Inc., as the case may be, all or any portion of such Principal's and such
Principal's Permitted Transferees' LLC Interest, including their Derivative
Share of CRM, Inc.'s LLC Interest ( a "Wilmington Call"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, unless otherwise approved by the Board, Wilmington may not exercise a
Wilmington Call pursuant to item (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence if,
as a result of the purchase of the LLC Interest subject to the Wilmington Call,
WTI would own 80% or more of the outstanding LLC Interests. In the event a
Wilmington Call is exercised as a result of (i) a termination of a Principal's
employment by the Company without Cause or by reason of voluntary resignation of
his employment by the Company; (ii) a transfer required by operation of law or
other involuntary transfer of a Principal's or such Principal's Permitted
Transferees LLC Interest or their Derivative Share of CRM, Inc.'s LLC Interest;
or (iii) delivery of one or more Put Notices which together represent more than
one-half (1/2) of the High Water Mark of a Principal, the purchase price payable
by Wilmington to a Principal and his Permitted Transferees for their LLC
Interest, and to CRM, Inc. for the Derivative Share of the LLC Interest of CRM,
Inc. attributable to such Principal and his Permitted Transferees, shall be the
Put Price. In the event of the termination of a Principal's employment by the
Company for Cause the purchase price payable by Wilmington to a Principal and
his Permitted

                                       21
<PAGE>
Transferees for their LLC Interest and to CRM, Inc. for the Derivative Share of
the LLC Interest of CRM, Inc. attributable to the terminated Principal and his
Permitted Transferees shall be 60% of the Put Price.

                  (c) If Wilmington does not exercise a Wilmington Call with
respect to all of a Principal's and such Principal's Permitted Transferees' LLC
Interest in accordance with Section 7.3(b) hereof, then the remaining Members
shall have an additional 90 days to exercise such Wilmington Call with respect
to that portion of the Principal's and such Principal's Permitted Transferees'
LLC Interest as to which Wilmington does not exercise the Wilmington Call on a
pro rata basis in accordance with their respective Membership Points or on such
other basis as they shall agree upon.

                  (d) A Wilmington Call may be exercised by delivering to the
Member a written notice signed by Wilmington or the other Members if Section
7.3(c) is applicable in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto (the
"Wilmington Call Notice") stating that it or he is exercising the Wilmington
Call and any LLC Interest with respect to which the Wilmington Call is being
exercised. On the April 1 after receipt of a Wilmington Call Notice (or if April
1 is not a business day, the next succeeding business day, or if a Wilmington
Call Notice is received before April 1 of any year, on April 1 of the subsequent
year), the Member whose LLC Interest is subject to the Wilmington Call shall
sell to Wilmington (or other Members pursuant to Section 7.3(c)), the LLC
Interest set forth in the Wilmington Call Notice. Except as hereinafter
provided, at the closing of the exercise by Wilmington or another Member of a
Wilmington Call, Wilmington or the other Members, as the case may be, shall
deliver the purchase price to the selling Principal, the selling Permitted
Transferees of the Principal or CRM, Inc., as the case may be, by certified
check or wire transfer of immediately available funds against delivery of such
documents or instruments of transfer as may be reasonably requested by
Wilmington or such other Member. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Wilmington
Call is exercised with respect to the LLC Interest of a Principal or his
Permitted Transferees or the Derivative Share of CRM, Inc.'s LLC Interest
attributable to a Principal or his Permitted Transferees in connection with such
Principal (i) who has voluntarily resigned his employment with the Company other
than by Retirement and other than with Good Reason, then the portion of the
purchase price payable to such Principal and his Permitted Transferees or
payable to CRM, Inc. and attributable to their Derivative Share of CRM, Inc.'s
LLC Interest shall be paid by delivery of a three year promissory note to the
selling Member, which shall bear interest at the "applicable federal rate" as
defined under Section 1274(d) of the Code (a "Note"), payable quarterly, and the
principal of which shall be payable three years after the Purchase Closing Date;
(ii) who has delivered one or more Put Notices which together represent more
than one-half (1/2) of the High Water Mark of such Principal, then the purchase
price payable to such Principal and his Permitted Transferees or payable to CRM,
Inc. and attributable to their Derivative Share of CRM, Inc.'s LLC Interest
shall (A) with respect to purchases of up to the first one-half (1/2) of a
Principal's High Water Mark, be payable by certified check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds and (B) with respect to purchases in excess of the
first one-half (1/2) of a Principal's High Water Mark, be payable by delivery of
a Note, the principal of which is payable in three consecutive equal annual
installments with the first installment become due one year after the Purchase
Closing Date, and interest on which is payable quarterly; or (iii) whose
employment by the Company was terminated for Cause, then the portion of the

Company (the "Confidential Information"), and (iii) the use by any Member for

potential competitors of the Company of the Confidential Information would place
the Company at a serious competitive disadvantage and would cause irreparable
harm to the business of the Company.

                  (b) The Members acknowledge that (i) Confidential Information
includes, without limitation, any lists of clients of the Company and any lists

funds or securities under management with any Person other than the Company
would cause irreparable harm to the Company. The Principals and CRM, Inc.
further acknowledge and agree that if they were to compete, directly or
indirectly, with the Company's business, the Company would suffer irreparable
harm.

                  (f) By reason of the foregoing, and in consideration of the

Person; (x) encourage any such Person to terminate his employment with the
Company; (y) encourage any Client to terminate its advisory relationship with
the Company; or (z) take any actions that may interfere with the Company's

apply to each of the Principals and CRM, Inc. during the period commencing on
the date hereof and ending three years after it or he ceases to be a Member of
the Company (the "Three-Year Restricted Period"); provided, however, if a
Principal and CRM, Inc. deliver one or more Put Notices which together represent
one-half (1/2) or more of the High Water Mark of that Principal, then the
restrictions set forth in this Section 11.1(g) shall apply to such Principal
during the period ending four years after delivery of the Put Notice which
results in such Principal and CRM, Inc. having exercised Puts with respect to
one-half or more of the Principal's High Water Mark (the "Four-Year Restricted
Period"). Nothing in this paragraph (g) shall be construed to permit the
Principals or CRM, Inc. to use Confidential Information made available by WTI,
WTC or Wilmington to the Company, including, without limitation, client lists,
for any purpose whatsoever other than the pursuit of the Company's business
objectives.

                  (h) The restrictions set forth in Sections 11.1(f) and (g)
shall not apply to (i) the management of a Member's own money; (ii) the
management of the money of any member of such Member's Family; (iii) the
management of the money of any trust of which such Member or any member of his
Family is a grantor or beneficiary; or (iv) the management of the money of any
of the accounts set forth on Schedule 11.1; provided, however, this exception to
the Section 11.1(f) and (g) restrictions shall not apply to advisory accounts
that are opened after the date hereof and on which advisory fees are payable
(other than accounts which are opened after the date hereof and which are
controlled by Persons described in items (i) through (iv) of this paragraph (h),
provided that such Persons presently have accounts with the Company). The

other than the Company. The restrictions set forth in clause (iii) of Section
11.1(g) shall not apply to accepting business or funds or securities for
management in other than small, mid or large cap equity products or Hedge Funds

securities of such institutional Client results exclusively from the contact or
solicitation of such institutional Client through a consultant to such Client.

engaged in the business of consulting for institutional clients of asset
management firms in the selection of asset management firms or in asset
allocation.

issuance of LLC Interests to the Principals and CRM, Inc., each of the
Principals and CRM, Inc. covenants and agrees that it or he will not, at any
time after the date hereof, for whatever reason, whether for his or its account
or for the account of any other Person (other than the Company), use any
investment results or performance information of the Company, CRM, Inc., CRM
Management or Advisors, including, without limitation, the investment
performance of any accounts or groups of accounts for which a Person was a
portfolio manager, in connection with any business similar to, related to or in
competition with the business conducted by the Company, CRM, Inc., CRM
Management or Advisors, unless such Person refrains from taking any credit,
explicitly or implicitly, for the achievement of such results or performance.

have done so with the benefit of the advice of counsel. Furthermore, the Members
agree that any breach or attempted breach by any of them of the provisions of
Article XI of this Agreement will cause irreparable harm to the Company for
which monetary damages will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the Company
shall be entitled to apply for and obtain injunctive relief (temporary,
preliminary and permanent) in order to restrain the breach or threatened breach

further or continuing waiver of any other breach of such term, condition,
