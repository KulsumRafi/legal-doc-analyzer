         5.19   [Intentionally Omitted].

         5.20   Solvency.

         Each of the Company and the Original Subsidiary Guarantors is, and upon
giving effect to the exchange of the Notes and the  execution of this  Agreement
and the Subsidiary  Guarantee  Agreements will be, a "solvent  institution",  as
said term is used in section  1405(c) of the New York State Insurance Law, whose
"obligations are not in default as to principal or interest",  as said terms are
used in said section  1405(c).  Each of the Company and the Original  Subsidiary
Guarantors  has capital  not  unreasonably  small in relation to its  respective
business or any  contemplated or undertaken  transaction and has assets having a
value both at fair  valuation and at present fair salable value greater than the
amount  required to pay its debts as they become due and greater than the amount
that will be required to pay its respective  probable  liability on its existing
debts as they become absolute and matured.  Neither the Company nor any Original
Subsidiary  Guarantor intends to incur, or believes or should have believed that
it will  incur,  debts  beyond its ability to pay such debts as they become due.
Neither the  Company  nor any  Original  Subsidiary  Guarantor  will be rendered
insolvent by the execution and delivery of, and  performance  of its  respective
obligations  under,  this  Agreement,  the  Notes and the  Subsidiary  Guarantee
Agreements.

Restricted Subsidiaries.

         The  Company  and  its  Restricted   Subsidiaries   share   centralized
administration of the winery functions of each entity including  finance,  sales
and marketing.  Such  centralized  administration  is performed at the Company's
Napa office. This facility also includes a central

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

distribution  center  in  which  substantially  all of  the  Company's  and  its
Restricted Subsidiaries' wines are stored prior to shipping.

         Sales  and   marketing  of  all  of  the   Company's   and   Restricted
Subsidiaries'  wines  within  the  State  of  California  are made  through  the
Company's  own sales  forces and one or more  wholesalers.  The  Company  uses a
single  broker  for  all  wholesale  California  sales  of the  Company  and its
Restricted  Subsidiaries.  Furthermore,  all of  the  Company's  and  Restricted
Subsidiaries'  wineries  are  operated  under  the  overall  supervision  of the
Company's Chief Executive Officer.

         The  Company  and  its  Restricted  Subsidiaries  prepare  consolidated
financial  statements  and present their  financial  reporting on a consolidated
basis.

         5.22   No Burdensome Restrictions.

         Neither the Company nor any Original Subsidiary Guarantor is a party to
any agreement or instrument or subject to any other obligation or any charter or
corporate restriction or any provision of any applicable law, rule or regulation
which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.23   Matters Relating to the Collateral.

         The Liens  granted in favor of the  Collateral  Agent  pursuant  to the
Collateral  Documents in respect of the collateral  described therein constitute
and will constitute first and second,  as the case may be, priority  (subject to
Permitted Liens) perfected  security interests under the Uniform Commercial Code
as in effect in each applicable  jurisdiction,  entitled to all rights, benefits
and priorities as provided by such Uniform  Commercial Code or other  applicable
law. Upon the filing of financing statements relating to such security interests
in each office and in each  jurisdiction  where required in order to perfect the
security interests  described above and recordations of the Security  Agreements
and/or the Patent and Trademark Security  Agreements in the United States Patent
and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office,  all such action as
is necessary or advisable to establish such rights of the Collateral  Agent will
have been taken.  There will be upon  execution  and  delivery  of the  Security
Agreements  and Patent and  Trademark  Security  Agreements  and such filings no
necessity for any further action in order to preserve, protect and continue such
rights,  except  the  filing of  continuation  statements  with  respect to such
financing  statements  within six months prior to each five year  anniversary of
the filing of such financing statements.

         5.24   Credit Agreement Representations.

         The  representations  and  warranties  set forth in  Article  IX of the

commencing  September 15, 2004 and ending on September 15, 2009, both inclusive,
it will prepay and apply and there shall become due and payable on the principal
debt  evidenced  by the  Series C Notes an  amount  equal to the  lesser  of (x)
$2,142,857.14   or  (y)  the  principal  amount  of  the  Series  C  Notes  then
outstanding.  The entire remaining  principal amount of the Series C Notes shall
become due and payable on  September  15, 2010.  No premium  shall be payable in
connection  with any required  prepayment  made pursuant to this Section 8.1(c).
Upon any partial  prepayment of the Series C Notes  pursuant to Section 8.2, the
principal amount of each required  prepayment of the Series C Notes becoming due
under  this  Section  8.1(c) on and after the date of such  prepayment  shall be
reduced in the same proportion as the aggregate  unpaid  principal amount of the
Series C Notes is reduced as a result of such prepayment.

         8.2    Optional Prepayments with Make-Whole Amount.

         The Company may, at its option,  upon notice as provided below,  prepay
at any time  all,  or from  time to time any part of (but if in part,  then such
prepayment shall be applied against the Series A Note, the Series B Note and the
Series C Note,  respectively,  in proportion to the aggregate amount outstanding
of each  Series),  the  Notes,  in an amount  not less than 5% of the  aggregate
principal  amount of all series of the Notes then  outstanding  in the case of a
partial  prepayment,  at 100% of the principal amount so prepaid,  together with
interest accrued thereon to the date of such prepayment, plus the greater of (i)
zero and (ii) the Make-Whole  Amount  determined  for the  prepayment  date with
respect to such  principal  amount.  The Company  will give each Holder of Notes
written notice of each optional  prepayment under this Section 8.2 not less than
30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date  fixed for such  prepayment.
Each such notice shall specify such date, the aggregate  principal amount of the
Notes to be prepaid on such date, the principal amount of each Note held by such
Holder to be prepaid  (determined  in  accordance  with  Section  8.3),  and the
interest to be paid on the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount
being prepaid,  and shall be accompanied by a certificate of a Senior  Financial
Officer  as to the  estimated  Make-Whole  Amount  due in  connection  with such
prepayment  (calculated  as if the  date of such  notice  were  the  date of the
prepayment),  setting forth the details of such  computation.  Two Business Days
prior to such  prepayment,  the Company  shall deliver to each Holder of Notes a
certificate of a Senior  Financial  Officer  specifying the  calculation of such
Make-Whole Amount as of the specified prepayment date.

         8.3    Allocation of Partial Prepayments.

         In the case of each partial prepayment of the Notes pursuant to Section
8.2, the principal  amount of the Notes to be prepaid  shall be allocated  among
all  of  the  Notes  at  the  time  outstanding  in  proportion,  as  nearly  as
practicable,  to the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof not theretofore
prepaid.

         8.4    Maturity; Surrender, etc.

         In the case of each  prepayment  or purchase of Notes  pursuant to this
Section 8, the  principal  amount of each Note to be prepaid or purchased  shall
mature  and become due and  payable  on the date  fixed for such  prepayment  or
purchase,  together with interest on such principal  amount accrued to such date
and the applicable  Make-Whole  Amount, if any. From and after such date, unless
the Company  shall fail to pay such  principal  amount when so due and  payable,
together with the interest and Make-Whole Amount, if any, as aforesaid, interest
on such  principal  amount  shall cease to accrue.  Any Note paid,  purchased or
prepaid in full shall be  surrendered to the Company and cancelled and shall not

in accordance  with the terms of this Agreement and the Notes.  The Company will
promptly  cancel  all Notes  acquired  by it or any  Affiliate  pursuant  to any
payment,  prepayment  or purchase of Notes  pursuant  to any  provision  of this
Agreement  and no Notes may be issued in  substitution  or exchange for any such
Notes.

         8.6    Make-Whole Amount.

         "MAKE-WHOLE  AMOUNT" means,  with respect to any Note of any series, an
amount equal to the excess,  if any, of the  Discounted  Value of the  Remaining
Scheduled  Payments  with  respect to the Called  Principal of such Note of such
series over the amount of such Called  Principal,  provided that the  Make-Whole
Amount may in no event be less than zero.  For the purposes of  determining  the
Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following meanings:

         "CALLED  PRINCIPAL" means, with respect to any Note of any series,  the
principal of the Note of such series that is to be prepaid or purchased pursuant
to Sections  8.2 or 8.7 or has become or is declared to be  immediately  due and

         "DISCOUNTED  VALUE" means,  with respect to the Called Principal of any
Note of any series,  the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining  Scheduled
Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their  respective  scheduled
due dates to the  Settlement  Date with  respect to such  Called  Principal,  in
accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on
the same  periodic  basis as that on which  interest  on such Notes is  payable)
equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal.

         "REINVESTMENT  YIELD" means,  with respect to the Called Principal of a
Note of any series,  0.50% over the yield to maturity  implied by (i) the yields
reported,  as of 10:00  A.M.  (New York City time) on the  second  Business  Day
preceding  the  Settlement  Date with respect to such Called  Principal,  on the
display  designated as Screen PX1 on the Bloomberg  Financial  Markets  Services
System (or such other display as may replace  Screen PX1 on Bloomberg  Financial
Markets

Services System) for actively traded U.S. Treasury  securities having a maturity
equal  to the  remaining  average  live  of  such  Called  Principal  as of such
Settlement  Date, or (ii) if such yields are not reported as of such time or the
yields  reported as of such time are not  ascertainable,  the Treasury  Constant
Maturity Series Yields  reported,  for the latest day for which such yields have
been so reported as of the second  Business Day  preceding the  Settlement  Date
with respect to such Called Principal,  in Federal Reserve  Statistical  Release
H.15 (519) (or any comparable  successor  publication)  for actively traded U.S.
Treasury  securities  having a constant  maturity equal to the remaining average
life of such Called  Principal as of such  Settlement  Date.  Such implied yield
will  be  determined,  if  necessary,  by  (a)  converting  U.S.  Treasury  bill
quotations  to  bond-equivalent  yields in accordance  with  accepted  financial
practice and (b)  interpolating  linearly  between (1) the actively  traded U.S.
Treasury  security  with the maturity  closest to and greater than the remaining
average life of such Called Principal and (2) the actively traded U.S.  Treasury
security with the maturity  closest to and less than the remaining  average life
of such Called Principal.

         "REMAINING  SCHEDULED  PAYMENTS"  means,  with  respect  to the  Called
Principal of any Note of any series,  all payments of such Called  Principal and
interest  thereon  that would be due after the  Settlement  Date with respect to
such Called  Principal if no payment or purchase of such Called  Principal  were
made prior to its scheduled due date  (assuming  that the Notes will continue to
bear interest at the rates in effect on the Settlement  Date),  PROVIDED that if
such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made
under  the  terms of the  Notes of such  series,  then  the  amount  of the next
succeeding  scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest
accrued to such  Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date
pursuant to Sections 8.2, 8.7 or 12.1.

         "SETTLEMENT  DATE" means,  with respect to the Called  Principal of any
Note of any series,  the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid or
purchased pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately

         8.7    Mandatory Prepayments with Make-Whole Amount.

                (a)     Upon the  sale,  transfer or  other  disposition of  any
Collateral by the Company or any Subsidiary under Section 10.9(c) (to the extent
the Net Proceeds  from the sale,  transfer or other  disposition  of worn out or
obsolete assets are not promptly applied to replace such assets) or 10.9(f), the
Company  shall,  if either (i) an Event of Default  shall have  occurred  and be

the Net Proceeds  therefrom by depositing such amount with the Collateral  Agent
for  application by the  Collateral  Agent under and pursuant to Section 6.10 of
the Intercreditor Agreement to the Secured Obligations, and (2) in the case of a
prepayment be reason of the  circumstances  set forth in clause (ii) above, that
amount of the Net Proceeds therefrom that would be required to be prepaid on the
Notes so that after giving effect to the application thereof,


                                      -23-

such  Specified  Loan to Value Event would no longer  exist by  depositing  such

Business  Day of the  Company's  or such  Subsidiary's  receipt of the  proceeds
therefrom,  prepay the outstanding  principal amount of the Notes, together with
the Make-Whole Amount payable with respect thereto, in an amount equal to (1) in
the case of a prepayment by reason of the  circumstances set forth in clause (i)
above,  100% of the Net Proceeds  therefrom by  depositing  such amount with the
Collateral  Agent for application by the Collateral  Agent under and pursuant to
Section 6.10 of the Intercreditor Agreement to the Secured Obligations,  and (2)
in the case of a prepayment be reason of the  circumstances  set forth in clause
(ii) above, that amount of the Net Proceeds  therefrom that would be required to
be prepaid on the Notes so that after giving effect to the application  thereof,

amount with the Collateral  Agent for application by the Collateral  Agent under
and  pursuant  to Section  6.10 of the  Intercreditor  Agreement  to the Secured
Obligations.

obtain and maintain in effect all licenses,  certificates,  permits,  franchises
and  other  governmental  authorizations  necessary  to the  ownership  of their
respective properties or to the conduct of their respective businesses,  in each
case to the  extent  necessary  to ensure  that  non-compliance  with such laws,
ordinances  or  governmental  rules or  regulations  or  failures  to  obtain or

governmental  authorizations  could  not,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         9.2    Insurance.

         The Company shall,  and shall cause each of its  Subsidiaries to, carry
and maintain in full force and effect,  at its own expense and with  financially

Holders  from time to time upon the request of any Holder a  certificate  of the
Company's  insurance  broker  or other  insurance  specialist  stating  that all
premiums then due on the policies  relating to insurance on the Collateral  have
been  paid,  that  such  policies  are in full  force and  effect  and that such
insurance  coverage and such policies  comply with all the  requirements of this
subsection.  All insurance  policies  required  under this section shall provide
that they shall not be  terminated  or  cancelled  nor shall any such  policy be
materially changed without at least 30 days' prior written notice to the Company
and the Holders.  Receipt of notice of termination or  cancellation  of any such
insurance policies or reduction of coverages or amounts thereunder shall entitle
the Holders to renew any such policies,  cause the coverages and amounts thereof

Section 9.2 or otherwise to obtain similar  insurance in place of such policies,
in each case at the expense of the Company.

properly  conducted at all times,  PROVIDED  that this Section shall not prevent
the  Company  or  any  Subsidiary  from  discontinuing  the  operation  and  the
maintenance of any of its properties if such  discontinuance is desirable in the
conduct of its business and the Company has concluded  that such  discontinuance
could not,  individually  or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                (b)     The  Company  shall,  and   shall  cause  each  of   its
Subsidiaries  to, upon becoming aware of the presence of any Hazardous  Material
or the existence of any environmental  liability under applicable  Environmental
Laws with respect to the Premises,  take all actions, at their cost and expense,
as shall be necessary or advisable to investigate  and clean up the condition of
the  Premises,  including all removal,  containment  and remedial  actions,  and
restore the Premises to a condition in compliance with applicable  Environmental
Laws.

imposed on them or any of their properties, assets, income or franchises, to the
extent  such taxes and  assessments  have become due and payable and before they
have become delinquent and all claims for which sums have become due and payable
that have or might become a Lien on  properties  or assets of the Company or any
Subsidiary,  PROVIDED that neither the Company nor any  Subsidiary  need pay any
such tax or  assessment or claims if (a) the amount,  applicability  or validity
thereof is contested by the Company or such Subsidiary on a timely basis in good
faith and in appropriate  proceedings,  and the Company has established adequate
reserves therefor in accordance with GAAP on the books of the Company or (b) the
nonpayment  of all  such  taxes  and  assessments  in the  aggregate  could  not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         9.5    Corporate Existence, etc.

         The Company and each  Subsidiary will at all times preserve and keep in
full force and effect its  corporate  existence.  Subject to  Sections  10.2 and
10.9,  the Company will at all times  preserve and keep in full force and effect
the  corporate  existence  of  each  of its  Subsidiaries  and  all  rights  and
franchises  of the  Company  and its  Subsidiaries  unless,  in the  good  faith
judgment of the Company,  the  termination of or failure to preserve and keep in

respect of which the  Collateral  Agent holds a perfected  first  priority  Lien
(subject  only to  Permitted  Liens),  for the  ratable  benefit of the  Secured
Parties as their interests may appear,  pending the application of such proceeds
to  repay  the  Notes  as  provided  in  Section  __ or to  repair,  replace  or
reconstruct the property affected by the Event of Loss.

         9.9    Post-Closing Matters. In addition to the terms and provisions of

12.      REMEDIES ON DEFAULT, ETC.

         12.1   Acceleration.

                (a)     If  an  Event of Default  with  respect  to  the Company
described in paragraph  (g) or (h) of Section 11 (other than an Event of Default
described  in  clause  (i) of  paragraph  (g) or  described  in  clause  (vi) of
paragraph (g) by virtue of the fact that such clause  encompasses  clause (i) of
paragraph (g)) has occurred,  all the Notes then outstanding shall automatically
become immediately due and payable.

                (b)     If any  other  Event of  Default  has  occurred  and  is
continuing,  any Holder or Holders of more than 25% in  principal  amount of the
Notes at the time outstanding may at any time at its or their option,  by notice
or  notices  to the  Company,  declare  all the  Notes  then  outstanding  to be
immediately due and payable.

                (c)     If any Event of Default described in paragraph (a) or(b)
of Section 11 has occurred and is continuing,  any Holder or Holders of Notes at
the time  outstanding  affected by such Event of Default may at any time, at its
or their option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare all the Notes held
by it or them to be immediately due and payable. Upon any Notes becoming due and
payable under this Section 12.1, whether  automatically or by declaration,  such
Notes  will  forthwith  mature and the entire  unpaid  principal  amount of such
Notes,  plus (x) all accrued and unpaid interest  thereon and (y) the Make-Whole
Amount  determined  in respect  of such  principal  amount  (to the full  extent
permitted by applicable law), shall all be immediately due and payable,  in each
and every case without  presentment,  demand,  protest or further notice, all of
which are hereby waived. The Company acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree,
that each holder of a Note has the right to maintain its investment in the Notes
free from repayment by the Company (except as herein specifically  provided for)
and that the provision for payment of a Make-Whole  Amount by the Company in the
event that the Notes are prepaid or are  accelerated  as a result of an Event of
Default,  is intended to provide  compensation for the deprivation of such right
under such circumstances.

         12.2   Other Remedies.

         If any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,  and
irrespective of whether any Notes have become or have been declared  immediately
due and  payable  under  Section  12.1,  the  Holder  of any  Note  at the  time
outstanding  may  proceed to protect and enforce the rights of such Holder by an
action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate  proceeding,  whether for the
specific performance of any agreement contained herein or in any Note, or for an
injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof,  or in aid
of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise.

         12.3   Rescission.

         At any time after any Notes have been declared due and payable pursuant
to clause (b) or (c) of Section  12.1,  the Holders of not less than  66-2/3% in
principal amount of the Notes then


                                      -40-

<PAGE>

outstanding,  by written  notice to the Company,  may rescind and annul any such
declaration  and its  consequences  if (a) the  Company  has  paid  all  overdue
interest on the Notes,  all principal of and Make-Whole  Amount,  if any, on any
Notes  that are due and  payable  and are  unpaid  other  than by reason of such
declaration,  and all interest on such overdue principal and Make-Whole  Amount,
if any, and (to the extent  permitted by applicable law) any overdue interest in
respect of the  Notes,  at the  Default  Rate,  (b) all  Events of  Default  and
Defaults,  other  than  non-payment  of amounts  that have  become due solely by
reason of such  declaration,  have been cured or have been  waived  pursuant  to
Section 17, and (c) no  judgment  or decree has been  entered for the payment of
any monies due pursuant  hereto or to the Notes.  No  rescission  and  annulment
under this Section 12.3 will extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default
or Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

         12.4   No Waivers or Election of Remedies, Expenses, etc.

         No course of dealing and no delay on the part of any Holder of any Note
in exercising  any right,  power or remedy shall operate as a waiver  thereof or
otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or
remedy  conferred by this Agreement or by any Note upon any Holder thereof shall
be exclusive of any other right,  power or remedy  referred to herein or therein
or now or  hereafter  available  at law,  in equity,  by  statute or  otherwise.
Without  limiting the  obligations  of the Company under Section 15, the Company
will pay to the holder of each Note on demand  such  further  amount as shall be
sufficient  to cover all costs  and  expenses  of such  holder  incurred  in any
enforcement or collection under this Section 12, including,  without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements.

13.      REGISTRATION; EXCHANGE; SUBSTITUTION OF NOTES.

         13.1   Registration of Notes.

The Company  shall keep at its  principal  executive  office a register  for the
registration  and  registration  of transfers of Notes.  The name and address of
each  Holder and the name and  address of each  transferee  of one or more Notes
shall be registered in such register.  Prior to due presentment for registration
of  transfer,  the Person in whose name any Note  shall be  registered  shall be
deemed and treated as the owner and Holder thereof for all purposes hereof,  and
the Company  shall not be affected by any notice or knowledge  to the  contrary.
The Company shall give to any Holder promptly upon request therefor,  a complete
and correct copy of the names and addresses of all registered Holders.

         13.2   Transfer and Exchange of Notes.

         Upon  surrender of any Note at the  principal  executive  office of the
Company for registration of transfer or exchange (and in the case of a surrender
for  registration  of  transfer,  duly  endorsed  or  accompanied  by a  written
instrument of transfer duly  executed by the  registered  Holder or his attorney
duly  authorized in writing and  accompanied  by the address for notices of each
transferee of such Note or part thereof), the Company shall execute and deliver,
at the Company's  expense (except as provided below),  one or more new Notes (as
requested  by the Holder  thereof) in such Series in  exchange  therefor,  in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the


                                      -41-

<PAGE>

unpaid  principal  amount of the  surrendered  Note. Each such new Note shall be
payable to such Person as such Holder may request and shall be  substantially in
the form of  Exhibit  1-A,  1-B or 1-C,  as the case may be.  Each such new Note
shall be dated and bear interest from the date to which interest shall have been
paid on the  surrendered  Note or dated the date of the  surrendered  Note if no
interest shall have been paid thereon.  The Company may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any stamp tax or  governmental  charge imposed in respect of
any such transfer of Notes.  Notes shall not be transferred in  denominations of
less than  $100,000,  PROVIDED THAT if necessary to enable the  registration  of
transfer  by a Holder  of its  entire  holding  of  Notes,  one Note may be in a
denomination of less than $100,000. Any transferee,  by its acceptance of a Note
registered  in its name (or the name of its  nominee),  shall be  deemed to have
made the representation set forth in Section 6.2.

         13.3   Replacement of Notes.

         Upon receipt by the Company of evidence  reasonably  satisfactory to it
of the ownership of and the loss,  theft,  destruction or mutilation of any Note
(which evidence shall be, in the case of an Institutional Investor,  notice from
such Institutional Investor of such ownership and such loss, theft,  destruction
or mutilation), and

                (a)     in the case of loss,  theft or destruction, of indemnity
reasonably  satisfactory  to it (PROVIDED THAT if the Holder is, or is a nominee
for,  an  original  Purchaser  or another  Holder with a minimum net worth of at
least $25,000,000,  such Person's own unsecured  agreement of indemnity shall be
deemed to be  satisfactory),  or

                (b)     in   the   case   of   mutilation,  upon  surrender  and
cancellation thereof,

         the Company at the Holder's sole expense shall execute and deliver,  in
lieu  thereof,  a new Note of such Series,  dated and bearing  interest from the
date to which interest shall have been paid on such lost,  stolen,  destroyed or
mutilated  Note or dated the date of such lost,  stolen,  destroyed or mutilated
Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon.

14.      PAYMENT OF NOTES.

         14.1   Place of Payment.

         Subject to Section 14.2,  payments of principal,  Make-Whole Amount, if
any,  and  interest  becoming  due and payable on the Notes shall be made in New
York, New York, at the principal office of Chase Manhattan Bank. The Company may
at any time, by notice to each Holder,  change the place of payment of the Notes
so long as such place of payment  shall be either  the  principal  office of the
Company in such  jurisdiction or the principal office of a bank or trust company
in such jurisdiction.

         14.2 Home Office Payment.

         So  long  as any  Purchaser  or its  nominee  shall  be a  Holder,  and
notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  Section  14.1 or in  such  Note to the
contrary, the Company will pay all sums becoming due on such Note for principal,
Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest by the


                                      -42-

<PAGE>

method and at the address specified for such purpose below such Purchaser's name
in  Schedule  A, or by  such  other  method  or at such  other  address  as such
Purchaser  or nominee  shall have from time to time  specified to the Company in
writing for such purpose,  without the presentation or surrender of such Note or
the making of any  notation  thereon,  except that upon  written  request of the
Company  made  concurrently  with  or  reasonably   promptly  after  payment  or
prepayment in full of any Note,  such Purchaser or nominee shall  surrender such
Note for  cancellation,  reasonably  promptly  after  any such  request,  to the
Company  at its  principal  executive  office  or at the place of  payment  most
recently  designated by the Company  pursuant to Section 14.1. Prior to any sale
or other  disposition  of any Note,  any  Purchaser or its nominee  will, at its
election,  either  endorse  thereon the amount of principal paid thereon and the
last date to which  interest has been paid thereon or surrender such Note to the
Company  in  exchange  for a new Note or Notes  pursuant  to Section  13.2.  The
Company  will afford the  benefits  of this  Section  14.2 to any  Institutional
Investor that is the direct or indirect transferee of any Note purchased by each
Purchaser under this Agreement and that has made the same agreement  relating to
such Note as each Purchaser has made in this Section 14.2.

15.      EXPENSES, ETC.

effected  pursuant  to the  provisions  of this  Section  17 to each  Holder  of

                (b)     Payment -- the Company  will not directly or  indirectly
pay or cause to be paid any  remuneration,  whether  by way of  supplemental  or
additional interest,  fee or otherwise,  or grant any security, to any Holder of
Notes as  consideration  for or as an  inducement  to the  entering  into by any
Holder of Notes of any waiver or  amendment  of any of the terms and  provisions
hereof or of the Notes or of the Collateral  Documents unless such  remuneration
is concurrently  paid, or security is concurrently  granted,  on the same terms,
ratably to each  Holder of Notes  then  outstanding  whether or not such  Holder
consented to such waiver or amendment.

         17.3   Binding Effect, etc.

         Any  amendment  or waiver  consented  to as provided in this Section 17
applies  equally to all Holders of Notes and is binding  upon them and upon each
future Holder of Notes and upon the Company  without regard to whether such Note
has been marked to indicate  such  amendment  or waiver.  No such  amendment  or
waiver will extend to or affect any obligation,  covenant, agreement, Default or
Event of Default not expressly  amended or waived or impair any right consequent
thereon.  No course of dealing  between the Company and any Holder nor any delay
in exercising  any rights  hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver
of any rights of any  Holder.  As used  herein,  the term "this  Agreement"  and
references  thereto  shall  mean this  Agreement  as it may from time to time be
amended or supplemented.

         17.4   Notes Held by Company, etc.

         Solely  for the  purpose  of  determining  whether  the  Holders of the
requisite percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding
approved or consented to any amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this
Agreement  or the Notes,  or have  directed  the  taking of any action  provided
herein  or in the  Notes to be taken  upon the  direction  of the  Holders  of a
specified   percentage  of  the  aggregate   principal   amount  of  Notes  then
outstanding,  Notes  directly or  indirectly  owned by the Company or any of its
Affiliates shall be deemed not to be outstanding.

18.      NOTICES.

         All notices  and  communications  provided  for  hereunder  shall be in
writing  and  sent  (a) by  telecopy  if the  sender  on the  same  day  sends a

writing.

         This Agreement and all documents relating thereto,  including,  without
limitation,  (a)  consents,  waivers and  modifications  that may  hereafter  be
executed, (b) documents received by each Holder at the Closing (except the Notes
themselves),  and (c) financial  statements,  certificates and other information
previously  or hereafter  furnished  to any Holder,  may be  reproduced  by such
Holder  by  any  photographic,   photostatic,  microfilm,  microcard,  miniature
photographic  or other similar  process and such Holder may destroy any original
document so reproduced.  The Company  agrees and stipulates  that, to the extent
permitted  by  applicable  law, any such  reproduction  shall be  admissible  in
evidence as the  original  itself in any judicial or  administrative  proceeding
(whether  or  not  the  original  is  in  existence  and  whether  or  not  such
reproduction  was made by such Holder in the regular course of business) and any
enlargement,  facsimile  or  further  reproduction  of such  reproduction  shall
likewise be  admissible  in  evidence.  This  Section 19 shall not  prohibit the
Company or any Holder from  contesting any such  reproduction to the same extent
that it could contest the original,  or from introducing evidence to demonstrate
the inaccuracy of any such reproduction.

20.      CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

         For the purposes of this Section 20,  "CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION" means
information  delivered  to each  Holder by or on behalf  of the  Company  or any
Subsidiary  in connection  with the  transactions  contemplated  by or otherwise
pursuant to this  Agreement  that is  proprietary in nature and that was clearly
marked or labeled or  otherwise  adequately  identified  when  received  by such
Holder as being  confidential  information  of the  Company or such  Subsidiary,
provided that such term does not include information that (a) was publicly known
or  otherwise  known to such Holder  prior to the time of such  disclosure,  (b)
subsequently becomes publicly known through no act or omission by such Holder or
any Person acting on such Holder's behalf,  (c) otherwise  becomes known to such
Holder  other than through  disclosure  by the Company,  any  Subsidiary  or any
Guarantor  through  disclosure by a Person who was  otherwise  permitted to make
such  disclosure,  or (d)  constitutes  financial  statements  delivered to such
Holder under Section 7.1 that are otherwise publicly available.

         Each Holder will use its best efforts to maintain  the  confidentiality
of such Confidential  Information in accordance with procedures  adopted by such
Holder  in good  faith to  protect  confidential  information  of third  parties
delivered  to such  Holder,  PROVIDED  THAT such  Holder may deliver or disclose
Confidential  Information to (i) each Holder's  directors,  trustees,  officers,
employees,  Purchasers,  attorneys and affiliates (to the extent such disclosure
reasonably relates to the  administration of the investment  represented by each
Holder's Notes),  (ii) each Holder's  financial  advisors and other professional
advisors who agree to hold confidential the Confidential


                                      -46-

<PAGE>

Information substantially in accordance with the terms of this Section 20, (iii)
any other Holder,  (iv) any Institutional  Investor to which any Holder sells or
offers to sell such Note or any part  thereof or any  participation  therein (if
such  Person  has agreed in writing  prior to its  receipt of such  Confidential
Information  to be bound by the  provisions  of this Section 20), (v) any Person
from whom any Holder  offers to  purchase  any  security of the Company (if such
Person  has  agreed  in  writing  prior  to its  receipt  of  such  Confidential
Information  to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (vi) any federal
or state regulatory  authority having  jurisdiction  over any Holder,  (vii) the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization,  or
any  nationally  recognized  rating agency that requires  access to  information
about such  Holder's  investment  portfolio  or (viii) any other Person to which
such  delivery or  disclosure  may be  necessary  or  appropriate  (w) to effect
compliance with any law, rule, regulation or order applicable to any Holder, (x)
in response to any subpoena or other legal process,  (y) in connection  with any
litigation  to which  any  Holder is a party or (z) if an Event of  Default  has
occurred and is continuing,  to the extent any Holder may  reasonably  determine
such delivery and disclosure to be necessary or  appropriate in the  enforcement
or for the  protection  of the  rights  and  remedies  under your Notes and this
Agreement.  Each Holder,  by its  acceptance  of a Note,  will be deemed to have
agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the  benefits of this  Section 20 as
though it were a party to this Agreement.

21. SUBSTITUTION OF PURCHASER; PARTICIPATION.

                (a)     Each Purchaser  shall have  the right to  substitute any
one of its  Affiliates  as the  purchaser of the Notes that such  Purchaser  has
agreed to purchase  hereunder,  by written  notice to the Company,  which notice
shall be signed by both such  Purchaser and such  Affiliate,  shall contain such
Affiliate's  agreement  to be  bound  by this  Agreement  and  shall  contain  a
confirmation  by  such  Affiliate  of the  accuracy  with  respect  to it of the
representations  set forth in Section 6. Upon receipt of such  notice,  wherever
the word  "Purchaser" is used in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21),
such word  shall be deemed to refer to such  Affiliate  in lieu of the  previous
Purchaser.  In the event that such  Affiliate is so  substituted  as a purchaser
hereunder and such  Affiliate  thereafter  transfers to any Purchaser all of the
Notes then held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the Company of notice of such
transfer, wherever the word "Purchaser" is used in this Agreement (other than in
this  Section  21),  such  word  shall  no  longer  be  deemed  to refer to such
Affiliate,  but shall refer to the Purchaser,  and the Purchaser  shall have all
the rights of an original Holder under this Agreement.

                (b)     Any Holder  may at any  time sell to one or more Persons
not Affiliates of the Company (a "Participant")  participating  interests in any
loan evidenced by a Note issued hereunder held by such Holder (the  "Originating
Holder"); provided, however, that (i) the Originating Holder's obligations under
this Agreement shall remain unchanged,  (ii) the Originating Holder shall remain
solely  responsible for the performance of such  obligations,  (iii) the Company
and  the  Subsidiary   Guarantors  shall  deal  solely  and  directly  with  the
Originating  Holder in  connection  with the  Originating  Holder's  rights  and
obligations  under this  Agreement  and the Notes held by it, and (iv) no Holder
shall transfer or grant any  participating  interest under which the Participant
has rights to approve any  amendment  to, or any consent or waiver with  respect
to, this Agreement or any of the Notes.  In the case of any such  participation,
the


                                      -47-

<PAGE>

Participant  shall be entitled to the benefit of Section14.2,  as though it were
also a Holder hereunder.

22.      MISCELLANEOUS.

         22.1   Successors and Assigns.

         All covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement by or on
behalf  of any of the  parties  hereto  bind and inure to the  benefit  of their
respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any subsequent
Holder) whether so expressed or not.

         22.2   Payments Due on Non-Business Days.

         Anything   in   this   Agreement   or  the   Notes   to  the   contrary
notwithstanding, any payment of principal of or Make-Whole Amount or interest on
any Note that is due on a date other  than a  Business  Day shall be made on the
next  succeeding  Business Day without  including the additional days elapsed in
the computation of the interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day.

         22.3   Severability.

         Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or  unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such  prohibition  or  unenforceability   without   invalidating  the  remaining
provisions  hereof,  and  any  such  prohibition  or   unenforceability  in  any
jurisdiction  shall (to the full  extent  permitted  by law) not  invalidate  or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         22.4   Construction.

         Each  covenant  contained  herein  shall be construed  (absent  express
provision to the contrary) as being independent of each other covenant contained
herein,  so that  compliance  with any one  covenant  shall not (absent  such an
express  contrary  provision)  be  deemed to  excuse  compliance  with any other
covenant. Where any provision herein refers to action to be taken by any Person,
or which  such  Person  is  prohibited  from  taking,  such  provision  shall be
applicable whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person.

         22.5   Counterparts.

         This Agreement may be executed in any number of  counterparts,  each of
which  shall be an  original  but all of which  together  shall  constitute  one
instrument.  Each  counterpart  may consist of a number of copies  hereof,  each
signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties hereto.

         22.6   Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Service of Process.

         This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance  with, and
the  rights of the  parties  shall be  governed  by, the law of the State of New
York, excluding choice-of-law


                                      -48-

<PAGE>

principles  of the law of such State that would require the  application  of the
laws of a jurisdiction other than such State. The Company hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally  agree that any suit,  action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement,  or any  proceeding  to execute or otherwise  enforce any judgment in
respect  of any  breach  thereof,  brought  by any  registered  Holder of a Note
against the Company or any of its  property,  may be brought by such Holder of a
Note in the United States  District Court for the Southern  District of New York
or any New York State Court  sitting in the Borough of  Manhattan as such Holder
of a Note may in its sole discretion elect, and by the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Company irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of each such
court;  and agrees that process served either  personally or by registered  mail
shall constitute, to the extent permitted by law, adequate service of process in
any such suit.  In  addition,  the Company  hereby  irrevocably  waives,  to the
fullest  extent  permitted by law, any  objection  which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue in any suit, action or proceeding  arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any Note,  brought in the said courts,  and hereby
irrevocably waives any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient  forum.  Nothing herein shall
in any way be deemed to limit the ability of any registered  Holder of a Note to
serve  any  such  writs,  process  or  summonses,  in any  manner  permitted  by
applicable  law or to  obtain  jurisdiction  over  the  Company  in  such  other
jurisdiction, and in such manner, as may be permitted by applicable law.

22.7 Agents for Service of Process.

         WITHOUT  LIMITING THE FOREGOING,  THE COMPANY HEREBY  APPOINTS,  IN THE
CASE OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR  PROCEEDING  BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF OR IN THE STATE
OF NEW YORK, CT  CORPORATION  TO RECEIVE,  FOR IT AND ON ITS BEHALF,  SERVICE OF
PROCESS IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITH RESPECT THERETO, PROVIDED THE COMPANY MAY,
AND IN THE EVENT THAT CT CORPORATION  IS AT ANY TIME NO LONGER  DOMICILED IN THE
STATE OF NEW YORK,  THE  COMPANY  SHALL,  APPOINT  CT  CORPORATION  OR ANY OTHER
PERSON, REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE REQUIRED HOLDERS, WITH OFFICES IN THE STATE
OF NEW YORK TO REPLACE SUCH  PURCHASERS  FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS UPON DELIVERY TO
THE HOLDERS OF A REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENT OF SUCH NEW PURCHASERS AGREEING
SO TO ACT.  IF  SERVICE  OF  PROCESS  IS MADE BY ANY  HOLDER OF A NOTE UPON SUCH
APPOINTEE,  A COPY THEREOF SHALL ALSO BE PROVIDED TO THE COMPANY,  BY REGISTERED
OR CERTIFIED MAIL, OR BY INTERNATIONALLY-RECOGNIZED  EXPEDITED DELIVERY SERVICE;
PROVIDED  THAT THE  FAILURE OF SUCH  HOLDER TO PROVIDE  SUCH COPY TO THE COMPANY
SHALL NOT IMPAIR OR AFFECT IN ANY WAY THE VALIDITY OF SUCH SERVICE OF PROCESS OR
ANY JUDGMENT RENDERED IN ANY SUCH SUIT,  ACTION,  OR PROCEEDING.  NOTHING HEREIN
SHALL IN ANY WAY BE DEEMED TO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF ANY HOLDER OF A NOTE TO SERVE
ANY SUCH WRITS,  PROCESS OR SUMMONSES IN ANY MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
OR TO OBTAIN JURISDICTION OVER THE COMPANY,  IN SUCH OTHER JURISDICTION,  AND IN
SUCH MANNER, AS MAY BE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

OTHER  PROCEEDING WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR
ENFORCEABILITY  OF THIS  AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN  DOCUMENTS OR ANY PROVISION
HEREOF  OR  THEREOF.  THIS  WAIVER  SHALL  APPLY TO ANY  SUBSEQUENT  AMENDMENTS,
RENEWALS,  SUPPLEMENTS  OR  MODIFICATIONS  TO THIS  AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS.  A COPY OF THIS  SECTION  22.8 MAY BE FILED WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE  OF THE  WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND  CONSENT  TO TRIAL BY
COURT.  THIS SECTION  22.8 MAY NOT BE AMENDED,  MODIFIED,  TERMINATED  OR WAIVED

                                   LITIGATION



As  disclosed in the  Company's  Form 10-K filed for the  nine-month  transition
period ended  December 31, 2001,  the Company  received  notice dated August 28,
1998 from the California  Department of Alcoholic  Beverage Control ("ABC") that
it was  accused,  along  with 36  other  companies  (most of them  wineries)  of
violations of Section  25502(a)(2)  of the California  Business and  Professions
Code which prohibits wine growers and others from giving "something of value" to
retailers.  The accusation arises from the appearance of paid  advertisements of
the Company and other wineries in catalogues  distributed by a certain retailer.
The notice of violation  requested  each of the noticed  companies who agreed to
the  accusation  to  stipulate to a ten (10) day  suspension  of its license or,
consent  to the  payment  of a fine  not  greater  than  $10,000  in lieu of the
suspension. The matter was tried to an administrative law judge appointed by the
ABC on July 14,  1999.  The  judge  found  for the ABC and the ABC  adopted  the
judge's decision. The Company,  together with 16 other wine companies,  filed an
appeal with the Alcoholic  Beverage  Control Appeals Board, an independent  body
that hears  appeals  from ABC  decisions.  The matter was  submitted  to the ABC
appeals  board for a decision to be rendered  within 90 days pursuant to the May
24, 2001 hearing date. The appeals board ruled against the ABC. The ABC does not
agree with the ruling of the ABC appeals board and has submitted the case to the
First District Court of Appeals in San Francisco for review.

         7.     The  issuance,  sale  and  delivery  of  the  Notes  under   the

comply with the provisions of the Note Purchase Agreement.

         10.    The  Company  is  not  an  "investment  company"  or  a  company

the Notes is valid and will be recognized  and applied by the courts of New York
and of the United States.

         13.    The Company is not, nor  will it become,  solely  by  reason  of
entering into or performing  its respective  obligations  under the Agreement or
the  carrying out of any of the  transactions  contemplated  thereby,  a "public
utility company" or a "holding company" under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended.

         14.    Each  Subsidiary  Guarantor  is  a  corporation  or  other legal

<PAGE>

the  character  of the  properties  owned or leased  by it or the  nature of the
business transacted by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary.

         15.    To ensure the  legality,  validity,  enforceability  or
admissibility  into evidence of the Agreement and the Notes, it is not necessary
that said documents or any other  documents be registered,  notarized,  filed or
recorded  with any court or other  authority or that any stamp or similar tax be
paid with respect thereto.

         16.    The  obligations  of  the  Company  under  the Agreement and the
Notes,  and the  obligations  of the Original  Subsidiary  Guarantors  under the
Original Subsidiary  Guarantee  Agreements,  rank PARI PASSU in right of payment
with all other Debt (actual or  contingent)  of the Company which is not secured
or the subject of any  statutory  trust or  preference or which is not expressly
subordinated in right of payment to any other Debt thereof.  Collateral Document
opinions to come.

         17.    The  opinion  of  such  counsel shall cover  such  other matters
relating to the sale of the Notes as the Purchasers may reasonably request. With

entitled to rely on appropriate certificates of public officials and officers of

other guaranties of, any indebtedness, liability or obligation of the Company or
any other Person to the Purchasers or by any failure, delay, neglect or omission
by the Purchasers to realize upon or protect any such indebtedness, liability or

waive any default with respect thereto,  or waive,  modify,  amend or change any
provision of any other instruments; or

the  Company or of any other  Person  secondarily  or  otherwise  liable for any
indebtedness, liability or obligation of the Company on the Obligations; or

                        (3)  settle,  adjust  or  compromise  any  claim  of the
Company  against  any other  Person  secondarily  or  otherwise  liable  for any
indebtedness, liability or obligation of the Company on the Obligations.

modification,  amendment, impairment,  substitution,  settlement,  adjustment or
compromise  and agrees that the same shall be binding upon it, and hereby waives

acceptance of this Amended and Restated  Subsidiary  Guarantee  Agreement by the
Purchasers  or of the  creation,  renewal  or accrual  of any  liability  of the
Company,  present or future,  or of the  reliance  of the  Purchasers  upon this

termination whatsoever.

                (c)     The obligations of  the Subsidiary  Guarantor  hereunder
shall be binding upon the  Subsidiary  Guarantor and its successors and assigns,
and shall remain in full force and effect irrespective of:

                        (1)   the   genuineness,    validity,    regularity   or
enforceability  of the Obligations,  the Note Agreement or any other instruments

thereunder or the existence or continuance of the Company or any other Person as

perform any obligation, covenant or agreement under the terms of the Obligations
or the Note  Agreement or failure to resort for payment to the Company or to any
other Person or to any other guaranty or to any property,  security or liens, if
any, or other rights or remedies; or

                        (10)  the  acceptance of any security or other guaranty,
the advance of additional money to the Company or any other Person,  the renewal
or  extension  of the  Obligations  or  amendments,  modifications,  consents or
waivers  with respect to the  Obligations  or the Note  Agreement,  or the sale,
release,  substitution or exchange of any security,  if any, for the Obligations
or for this  Amended and  Restated  Subsidiary  Guarantee  Agreement  including,
without limitation, the release of collateral, if any, or


                                       -5-

                        (11)  any  defense  whatsoever  that  the Company or any
other Person might have to the payment of the Obligations, or to the performance
or observance of any of the provisions of the Note  Agreement,  whether  through
the satisfaction or purported satisfaction by the Company or any other Person of
its debts due to any cause such as bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, merger,
consolidation,   reorganization,   dissolution,   liquidation,   winding-up   or
otherwise; or

                        (12)  any  act or failure  to act  with  regard  to  the
Obligations  or the Note  Agreement or anything which might vary the risk of the
Subsidiary Guarantor; or

                        (13)  any   other  circumstance  which  might  otherwise
constitute a defense  available to, or a discharge of, the Subsidiary  Guarantor
in respect of the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor under this Amended and
Restated Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement;

PROVIDED that the specific enumeration of the above-mentioned  acts, failures or
omissions shall not be deemed to exclude any other acts,  failures or omissions,
though not specifically mentioned above, it being the purpose and intent of this
Amended and Restated Subsidiary  Guarantee Agreement that the obligations of the
Subsidiary  Guarantor  shall be  absolute  and  unconditional  and  shall not be
discharged,  impaired or varied except by the payment in full of the Obligations
in accordance with their respective terms whenever the same shall become due and
payable,  at the place  specified  in and all in the  manner and with the effect
provided in the Notes and the Note Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is understood  that repeated and  successive  demands may be made and recoveries
may be had hereunder as and when,  from time to time,  the Company shall default
under  the  terms of the Notes or the Note  Agreement  and that  notwithstanding
recovery  hereunder  for or in respect of any given  default or  defaults by the
Company  under  the  Notes or the Note  Agreement,  this  Amended  and  Restated
Subsidiary  Guarantee  Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
apply to each and every subsequent default.

                (d)     To the extent of any payments made  under  this  Amended
and Restated Subsidiary  Guarantee  Agreement,  the Subsidiary  Guarantor making
such payment shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of the Obligations
in  respect of whose  Obligations  such  payment  was made,  but the  Subsidiary
Guarantor  covenants  and  agrees  that  such  right  of  subrogation  shall  be
subordinate  in right of payment to the rights of any holder of the  Obligations
for which full  payment has not been made or provided  for and, to that end, the
Subsidiary  Guarantor  agrees  not  to  claim  or  enforce  any  such  right  of
subrogation  or any  right of  set-off  or any  other  right  which may arise on
account of any payment made by the Subsidiary  Guarantor in accordance  with the
provisions of this Amended and Restated  Subsidiary  Guarantee  Agreement unless
and until all of the Notes and all other  Obligations  have been  fully paid and
discharged.

                (e)     The Subsidiary  Guarantor  agrees that to the extent the
Company or any other Person makes any payment on any  Obligation,  which payment
or  any  part  thereof  is  subsequently  invalidated,  voided,  declared  to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered, rescinded or is required to be
retained  by or repaid to a trustee,  receiver,  or any other  Person  under any
bankruptcy code,  common law, or equitable cause, then and to the extent of such
payment,  the obligation or the part thereof  intended to be satisfied  shall be
revived and continued


                                       -6-

<PAGE>

in full force and effect with respect to the Subsidiary Guarantor's  obligations
hereunder, as if said payment had not been made. The liability of the Subsidiary
Guarantor hereunder shall not be reduced or discharged,  in whole or in part, by
any payment to the Purchasers from any source that is thereafter paid,  returned
or  refunded  in whole or in part by reason of the  assertion  of a claim of any
kind relating  thereto,  including,  but not limited to, any claim for breach of
contract,  breach of  warranty,  preference,  illegality,  invalidity,  or fraud
asserted by any account debtor or by any other Person.

                (f)     The Purchasers  shall not be under any obligation (1) to
marshall any assets in favor of the Subsidiary Guarantor or in payment of any or
all of the  liabilities of the Company under or in respect of the Obligations or
the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder or (2) to pursue any other
remedy that the Subsidiary Guarantor may or may not be able to pursue itself and
that may lighten  such  Subsidiary  Guarantor's  burden,  any right to which the
Subsidiary Guarantor hereby expressly waives.

         4.     GUARANTOR COVENANTS.

                (a)     REPORTING  COVENANTS.  So  long as any Obligations shall
remain unsatisfied, the Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that it shall furnish to the
Purchasers:  (i)  prompt  written  notice of any  condition  or event  which has
resulted,  or that could reasonably be expected to result, in a Material Adverse
Effect; and (ii) such other information  respecting the operations,  properties,
business or condition  (financial or otherwise) of the  Subsidiary  Guarantor or
its  Subsidiaries,  if any, as the Purchasers  may from time to time  reasonably
request.

                (b)     ADDITIONAL  AFFIRMATIVE  COVENANTS.   So  long  as   any
Obligations shall remain unsatisfied, the Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that:

                        (i)      PRESERVATION OF EXISTENCE, ETC.  The Subsidiary
                Guarantor  shall, and shall cause each of its  Subsidiaries,  if
                any, to, maintain and preserve its legal  existence,  its rights
                to  transact  business  and all  other  rights,  franchises  and
                privileges  necessary or  desirable in the normal  course of its
                business and operations and the ownership of its properties.

                        (ii)     FURTHER  ASSURANCES  AND ADDITIONAL  ACTS.  The
                Subsidiary Guarantor shall execute, acknowledge,  deliver, file,
                notarize  and  register  at its own  expense  all  such  further
                agreements, instruments,  certificates, documents and assurances
                and perform such acts as the Purchasers  shall  reasonably  deem
                necessary  or  appropriate  to  effectuate  the purposes of this
                Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement and promptly
                provide  the   Purchasers   with   evidence  of  the   foregoing
                satisfactory in form and substance to it.

                (c)     NEGATIVE COVENANTS.  So  long  as  any Obligations shall
remain unsatisfied, the Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that:

                        (i)      RESTRICTIONS  ON   FUNDAMENTAL  CHANGES.    The
                Subsidiary  Guarantor shall not merge with or consolidate  into,
                or acquire all or


                                      -7-

                substantially  all  of the  assets  of,  any  Person,  or  sell,
                transfer,   lease  or  otherwise  dispose  of  (whether  in  one
                transaction or in a series of transactions) all or substantially
                all of its assets,  except that any wholly owned  Subsidiary  of
                the  Subsidiary  Guarantor may merge with,  consolidate  into or
                transfer all or substantially  all of its assets to another such
                wholly-owned  Subsidiary or to the  Subsidiary  Guarantor and in
                connection  therewith  such  Subsidiary  may  be  liquidated  or
                dissolved.

                        (ii)     DISTRIBUTIONS.  The  Subsidiary Guarantor shall
                not  grant  or  otherwise  agree  to  or  suffer  to  exist  any
                consensual restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and make
                other  distributions to the Company,  or to pay any Indebtedness
                owed to the  Company or  transfer  properties  and assets to the
                Company,  except that any consensual restrictions existing as of
                the date hereof and disclosed in writing to the Purchasers shall
                be permitted hereunder.

         5.     NOTICES.

         All communications provided for herein  shall be in writing,  delivered

                                                Agreement

                                                Agreement

         6.     AMENDMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS; SOLICITATION OF NOTEHOLDERS.

                (a)     This Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement
may only be amended  and/or  modified by an instrument in writing  signed by the
Subsidiary  Guarantor  and by the holder or holders of at least 51% in aggregate
principal  amount of the Notes then  outstanding;  provided,  that  without  the
written  consent of the  holders of all of the Notes then  outstanding,  no such
waiver,  modification,  alteration  or amendment  shall be effective  which will
reduce  the  scope of the  guaranty  set  forth  in this  Amended  and  Restated
Subsidiary  Guarantee  Agreement or amend the requirements of Sections 1, 2 or 3
hereof or amend this Section 6. No such amendment or  modification  shall extend
to or affect any  obligation  not  expressly  amended or  modified or impair any
right consequent thereon.

                (b)     The  Subsidiary Guarantor  will not solicit,  request or
negotiate for or with


                                      -8-

<PAGE>

respect to any proposed waiver or amendment of any of the provisions of this
Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guarantee  Agreement,  the Note Agreement unless
each Holder of the Notes  (irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it)
shall be informed thereof by the Subsidiary  Guarantor and shall be afforded the
opportunity  of  considering  the same and shall be supplied  by the  Subsidiary
Guarantor  with a copy of the  proposed  waiver  or  amendment  and  such  other
information  regarding such amendment or waiver as any Holder of the Notes shall
reasonably  request  to  enable it to make an  informed  decision  with  respect
thereto. Executed or true and correct copies of any waiver or amendment effected
pursuant  to the  provisions  of  this  Section  6  shall  be  delivered  by the
Subsidiary  Guarantor  to  each  Holder  of  outstanding  Notes  within  30 days
following  the date on which the same shall have been  executed and delivered by
the Holder or Holders of the requisite  percentage of the outstanding Notes. The
Subsidiary  Guarantor will not, directly or indirectly,  pay or cause to be paid
any remuneration,  whether by way of supplemental or additional interest, fee of
otherwise,  to any Holder of the Notes as consideration  for or as an inducement
to the  entering  into by any Holder of the Notes of any waiver or  amendment of
any of the  terms  and  provisions  of  this  Amended  and  Restated  Subsidiary
Guarantee   Agreement  or  the  Note  Agreement  unless  such   remuneration  is
concurrently paid, on the same terms, ratably to the Holders of all of the Notes
then outstanding.

         7.     MISCELLANEOUS.

                (a)     No  remedy  herein  conferred  upon  or  reserved to the
Purchasers  is  intended  to be  exclusive  of any  other  available  remedy  or
remedies,  but each and every such remedy  shall be  cumulative  and shall be in
addition to every other remedy given under this Amended and Restated  Subsidiary
Guarantee  Agreement now or hereafter  existing at law or in equity. No delay or
omission to exercise any right or power  accruing upon any default,  omission or
failure of performance  hereunder  shall impair any such right or power or shall
be construed to be a waiver thereof but any such right or power may be exercised
from time to time and as often as may be deemed  expedient.  In order to entitle
the  Purchasers  to exercise any remedy  reserved to them under this Amended and
Restated  Subsidiary  Guarantee  Agreement,  it shall not be  necessary  for the
Purchasers to physically  produce their Notes in any  proceedings  instituted by
them or to give any notice,  other than such  notice as may be herein  expressly
required.

                (b)     This Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement
shall be binding upon the Subsidiary  Guarantor,  its successors and assigns and
shall inure,  together with the rights and remedies of the Purchasers hereunder,
to the benefit of the  Purchasers and their  successors  and assigns;  provided,
however, that the Subsidiary Guarantor may not assign its rights or delegate its
duties hereunder without the Purchasers' prior written consent. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing,  but subject to the terms and conditions of the
Note Agreement, the Purchasers may assign or otherwise transfer any indebtedness
held by them secured by this Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement
to any other Person or entity,  and such other Person or entity shall  thereupon
become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Purchasers
herein or otherwise,  subject, however, to the provisions of the Note Agreement.
The Company  hereby  releases the  Purchasers  from any liability for any act or
omission relating to this Amended and Restated Subsidiary  Guarantee  Agreement,
except the Purchasers' gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                (c)     In the event that any provision  hereof shall be  deemed
to be invalid by reason


                                      -9-

<PAGE>

of the operation of any law or by reason of the interpretation placed thereon by
any court,  this Amended and Restated  Subsidiary  Guarantee  Agreement shall be
construed as not containing  such provision,  but only as to such  jurisdictions
where  such law or  interpretation  is  operative,  and the  invalidity  of such
provision shall not affect the validity of any remaining  provision hereof,  and
any and all other  provisions  hereof which are otherwise lawful and valid shall
remain in full force and effect.

                (d)     This Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement
shall be deemed to have been made in the State of New York and shall be governed
by and construed in accordance  with the laws of the State of New York,  without
regard to  principles of conflicts of law. The headings in this  instrument  are
for  convenience of reference  only and shall not limit or otherwise  affect the
meaning of any provision hereof.

                (e)     THE  GUARANTORS HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE, AND THE AGENT AND
THE LENDERS BY THEIR ACCEPTANCE  HEREOF HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE,  THEIR RESPECTIVE
RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION  BASED UPON OR ARISING
OUT OF OR  RELATED  TO THIS  GUARANTY,  THE  OTHER  GUARANTOR  DOCUMENTS  OR THE
TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY IN ANY ACTION,  PROCEEDING OR OTHER
LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES  AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR
PARTIES, WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, OR OTHERWISE. THE
GUARANTORS  HEREBY  AGREE,  AND THE AGENT AND THE  LENDERS  BY THEIR  ACCEPTANCE
HEREOF HEREBY AGREE,  THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BY A
COURT TRIAL  WITHOUT A JURY.  WITHOUT IN ANY WAY  LIMITING  THE  FOREGOING,  THE
GUARANTORS  FURTHER  AGREE,  AND THE AGENT AND THE  LENDERS BY THEIR  ACCEPTANCE
HEREOF FURTHER AGREE,  THAT THEIR  RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED
BY OPERATION OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM, OR OTHER PROCEEDING
WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF
THIS  GUARANTY OR THE OTHER  GUARANTORS  DOCUMENTS  OR ANY  PROVISION  HEREOF OR
THEREOF.  THIS  WAIVER  SHALL  APPLY  TO ANY  SUBSEQUENT  AMENDMENTS,  RENEWALS,
SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THE GUARANTY AND THE OTHER GUARANTOR  DOCUMENTS.
A COPY OF THIS SECTION  7(E) MAY BE FILED WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN  EVIDENCE OF
THE WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND CONSENT TO TRIAL BY COURT.

                (f)     THE  GUARANTORS  ACKNOWLEDGE  THAT  THEY  AS  INDIVIDUAL
ENTITIES  HAVE  EITHER  OBTAINED  THE  ADVICE OF LEGAL  COUNSEL  OR HAVE HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN SUCH ADVICE IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF
THIS GUARANTY. THE GUARANTORS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT EACH OF THE WAIVERS AND
CONSENTS SET FORTH HEREIN ARE MADE WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AND
CONSEQUENCES.  ADDITIONALLY,  THE  GUARANTORS  ACKNOWLEDGE  AND  AGREE  THAT  BY
EXECUTING THIS


                                      -10-

<PAGE>

GUARANTY, THEY ARE WAIVING CERTAIN RIGHTS, BENEFITS, PROTECTIONS AND DEFENSES TO
WHICH THEY MAY OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED UNDER  APPLICABLE LAW,  INCLUDING UNDER THE
PROVISIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA  CIVIL CODE AND CALIFORNIA  CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
REFERRED TO IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE EXTENT SUCH LAWS ARE  APPLICABLE,  AND THAT
ALL SUCH WAIVERS HEREIN ARE EXPLICIT,  KNOWING WAIVERS.  THE GUARANTORS  FURTHER
ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS ARE RELYING ON SUCH WAIVERS
IN CREATING  THE  GUARANTEED  OBLIGATIONS,  AND THAT SUCH WAIVERS ARE A MATERIAL
PART OF THE  CONSIDERATION  WHICH THE AGENT AND THE  LENDERS ARE  RECEIVING  FOR
CREATING THE  GUARANTEED  OBLIGATIONS.

                (g)     The  obligations  of the Subsidiary Guarantor  hereunder
shall remain in full force and effect until all the  Obligations  have been paid
and satisfied in full.

                                 By: The Chalone Wine Group, Ltd.,
                                     a California corporation

                                         Thomas B. Selfridge,
                                         President and CEO



<PAGE>

        REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTIES OF ORIGINAL SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS

         Such  Subsidiary Guarantor represents and warrants to each Purchaser as
follows:

         1.     SUBSIDIARIES.  Such  Subsidiary  Guarantor  has,  directly   and
indirectly, good and marketable title to all of the shares it purports to own of
the stock of each of its subsidiaries,  free and clear in each case of any Lien.
All such shares have been duly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

         2.     ORGANIZATION AND AUTHORITY.  Such Subsidiary Guarantor, and each
of its subsidiaries,

                (a)     is   a   corporation   or   general   partnership,  duly
incorporated,  or duly organized,  as the case may be, amalgamated or continued,
validly  existing and in good standing and has duly made all  registrations  and
filings  required  given  the  nature  of its  business  under  the  laws of its
jurisdiction  of  incorporation  or  organization  and has paid all taxes as are
necessary to maintain its corporate or  partnership  existence,  as the case may
be;

                (b)     has all requisite power  and authority and all necessary
licenses  and  permits to own and  operate  its  properties  and to carry on its
business  as now  conducted,  where  failure  to do so would  materially  affect
adversely  the  business,  properties,  profits or  financial  condition of such
Subsidiary Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries; and

                (c)     is duly licensed or qualified and is in good standing as
a foreign  corporation in each  jurisdiction  wherein the nature of the business
transacted by it or the nature of the property  owned or leased by it makes such
licensing or  qualification  necessary,  where failure to do so would materially
affect  adversely the business,  properties,  profits or financial  condition of
such Subsidiary Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries.

         3.     FULL DISCLOSURE. Neither the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement, the
Collateral  Documents to which such Subsidiary  Guarantor is a signatory nor any
other written statement furnished by such Subsidiary Guarantor to such Purchaser
in connection with the negotiation of the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement and the
Collateral Documents to which such Subsidiary Guarantor is a signatory, contains
any untrue  statement of a material fact or omits a material  fact  necessary to
make the statements contained therein or herein not misleading. There is no fact
peculiar to such Subsidiary  Guarantor or its subsidiaries which such Subsidiary
Guarantor  has not  disclosed  to such  Purchaser  in writing  which  materially
affects adversely nor, so far as such Subsidiary Guarantor can now foresee, will
materially  affect  adversely  the  properties,  business,  profits or financial
condition of such Subsidiary Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         4.     PENDING LITIGATION.  There are no proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of such  Subsidiary  Guarantor,  threatened  against or affecting such
Subsidiary  Guarantor  or any of its  subsidiaries  in any court or  before  any
governmental authority or arbitration board or tribunal are reasonably likely to
materially  affect  adversely  the  properties,  business,  profits or financial
condition of such Subsidiary Guarantor and its subsidiaries.


                                EXHIBIT 10.11(a)
                        (to the Note Purchase Agreement)


<PAGE>

         5.     TITLE TO PROPERTIES.  Such Subsidiary  Guarantor and each of its
subsidiaries  has good and  marketable  title in fee simple  (or its  equivalent
under  applicable  law) to all  material  parcels of real  property and has good
title to all the other material items of property it purports to own,  except as
sold or otherwise  disposed of in the ordinary course of business and except for
Liens permitted by this Agreement.

         6.     PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS.  Such Subsidiary  Guarantor and  each of
its  subsidiaries  owns,  possesses  or has the  right  to use all the  patents,
trademarks,  trade names,  service  marks,  copyright,  licenses and rights with
respect to the foregoing necessary for the present and planned future conduct of
its business, without any known conflict with the rights of others.

         7.     COMPLIANCE IS LEGAL AND AUTHORIZED.Compliance by such Subsidiary
Guarantor with all of the provisions of the Subsidiary  Guarantee  Agreement and
the Collateral Documents to which such Subsidiary Guarantor is a signatory--

                (a)     is  within  the corporate or partnership powers, as  the
case may be, of such Subsidiary Guarantor;

                (b)     will not violate any  provisions of any law or any order
of any court or  governmental  authority or agency and will not conflict with or
result in any  breach  of any of the  terms,  conditions  or  provisions  of, or
constitute a default under the charter or other organizational documents of such
Subsidiary  Guarantor or any indenture or other agreement or instrument to which

or  franchises,  to the extent  such taxes and  assessments  have become due and

assessments  (i) the  amount of which is not  individually  or in the  aggregate

under,  and are in  compliance  with,  applicable  federal  legislation  and all
reports, returns and filings required to be made thereunder have been made. Such

provisions of applicable law.  Neither such Subsidiary  Guarantor nor any of its

pension  plan or the  withdrawal  from a  multiemployer  plan which would have a
Material  adverse  effect on the  properties,  business,  profits  or  condition
(financial  or  otherwise)  of  such  Subsidiary   Guarantor  and  each  of  its
subsidiaries taken as a whole or impair the ability of such Subsidiary Guarantor

         (b)    The  consummation  of  the  transactions  provided  for  in  the
Subsidiary  Guarantee  Agreement  and the  Collateral  Documents  to which  such

prohibited  transaction  within  the  meaning  of ERISA or  Section  4975 of the

any  ERISA  Affiliate  has  withdrawn  from  any Plan or  Multiemployer  Plan or
instituted  steps to do so and no steps have been  instituted  to terminate  any
Plan.  No condition  exists or event or  transaction  has occurred in connection
with any Plan which could result in the incurrence by such Subsidiary  Guarantor
or any ERISA  Affiliate  of any  material  liability,  fine or penalty.  No Plan
maintained by such Subsidiary  Guarantor or any ERISA  Affiliate,  nor any trust
created thereunder, has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" as defined
in Section 302 of ERISA nor does the present value of all benefits  vested under
all Plans exceed,  as of the last annual valuation date, the value of the assets
of the  Plans  allocable  to  such  vested  benefits.  Neither  such  Subsidiary
Guarantor nor any ERISA  Affiliate has any contingent  liability with respect to
any  post-retirement  "welfare  benefit plan" (as such term is defined in ERISA)
except as has been disclosed to the Purchasers.

         12.    COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Neither such Subsidiary  Guarantor nor any

governmental  rule or  regulation  to which it is subject;  or (b) has failed to
obtain  any  license,  permit,  franchise  or other  governmental  authorization
necessary to the  ownership  of its property or to the conduct of its  business,
which  violation  or failure to obtain  would  materially  adversely  affect the
business,  prospects,  profits, properties or condition (financial or otherwise)
of such Subsidiary  Guarantor and its subsidiaries,  taken as a whole, or impair
the ability of such Subsidiary Guarantor to perform its obligations contained in
the Subsidiary  Guarantee  Agreement and the Collateral  Documents to which such
Subsidiary  Guarantor is a signatory.  Neither such Subsidiary Guarantor nor any
of its  subsidiaries  is in  default  with  respect to any order of any court or
governmental authority or arbitration board or tribunal.

         13.    COMPLIANCE WITH  ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.   Neither  such  Subsidiary

toxic,  hazardous or other controlled,  prohibited or regulated substances which
violation could materially affect adversely the business, profits, properties or
financial condition of such Subsidiary Guarantor and its subsidiaries,  taken as
a whole.  Such  Subsidiary  Guarantor does not know of any liability or class of

Restricted Subsidiaries share centralized administration of the winery functions
of  each  entity  including  finance,  sales  and  marketing.  Such  centralized
administration  is performed at the  Company's  Napa office.  This facility also
includes  a  central  distribution  center  in  which  substantially  all of the

become absolute and matured. Such Subsidiary Guarantor does not intend to incur,
or believes or should have believed that it will incur, debts beyond its ability
to pay such debts as they  become due.  Such  Subsidiary  Guarantor  will not be

obligations  under,  the  Subsidiary  Guarantee  Agreement  and  the  Collateral
Documents to which such  Subsidiary  Guarantor is a signatory.  such  Subsidiary
Guarantor  does not  intend to  hinder,  delay or defraud  its  creditors  by or

enabling it to increase its  capitalization on a consolidated  basis and (ii) in

(actual or contingent) of such Subsidiary  Guarantor which is not secured or the
subject of any  statutory  trust or  preference  or which is not expressed to be
subordinate or junior in rank to any other Debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor.

not directly or indirectly controlled by or acting on behalf of any Person which
is, required to register as an "investment company" under the Investment Company

                  It is agreed and understood by the parties hereto that:

                  1. The  Secured  Obligations  are also  secured  by the  other
         Security  Documents.  The other Security  Documents are intended to and
         shall constitute  security for the entire  indebtedness  represented by
         the Amended and Restated  Senior  Secured Notes,  the Credit  Agreement

         release (which,  if permitted by law, may be executed by the Collateral
         Agent in its own name or as  attorney-in-fact  for the  Company and the
         Collateral Agent is hereby irrevocably  appointed  attorney-in-fact for
         the Company to, in the event that an Event of Default  hereunder  shall
         have  occurred  and be  continuing,  so  execute  such  deed  or  other
         instruments of conveyance,  transfer or release) shall be effective (if

redemption  (to  the  extent  permitted  by law) by the  Company  or any  Person
claiming  under it, and to bar  forever all claims by the Company or the Trustee
or the Collateral  Agent to the property covered thereby and no grantee from the
Trustee,  the Collateral Agent, or Sheriff shall be under any duty to inquire as
to the authority of the Trustee, the Collateral Agent, or Sheriff to execute the
same, or to see to the application of the purchase money.

         5. This Deed of Trust  constitutes  a  financing  statement  filed as a
fixture filing under UCC ss. 9502(4)(c) in the official records of the county in
which the  Collateral  is located with respect to any and all fixtures  included
within the term  "Collateral"  and with  respect to any goods or other  personal
property  that  may now be or  hereafter  become  such a  fixture.  PARTS OF THE
PERSONAL PROPERTY ARE, OR ARE TO BECOME, FIXTURES ON THE PROPERTY.

                  (a)  Company and  Collateral  Agent agree that the filing of a
         financing  statement in the records normally having to do with personal
         property  shall never be  construed  as in any way  derogating  from or
         impairing  this Deed of Trust and the  intention  of the  parties  that
         everything  used in connection  with the  production of income from the
         Collateral  or  adapted  for use  therein  or  which  is  described  or
         reflected  in this  Deed of  Trust  is,  and at all  times  and for all
         purposes  and in all  proceedings  both  legal  or  equitable  shall be
         regarded  as,  part of the real  estate  subject  to the  lien  hereof,
         irrespective  of whether  (i) any such item is  physically  attached to
         improvements  located  on such real  property  or (ii) any such item is
         referred to or  reflected  in any  financing  statement so filed at any
         time. Similarly, the mention in any such financing statement of (A) the
         rights in or the proceeds of any fire or hazard insurance policy or (B)
         any award in eminent domain proceedings for taking or for loss of value
         or for any cause of action or proceeds  thereof in connection  with any
         damage or injury to the  Collateral  or any part thereof shall never be
         construed as in any way altering any of the rights of Collateral  Agent
         as  determined  by  this   instrument  or  impugning  the  priority  of
         Collateral  Agent's  lien  granted  hereby  or by  any  other  recorded
         document,  but such mention in such financing  statement is declared to
         be for the protection of Collateral  Agent in the event any court shall
         at any time hold with  respect  to the  matters  set forth  above  that
         notice of  Collateral  Agent's  priority of  interest,  to be effective
         against a particular class of persons,  including,  without limitation,
         the federal  government  and any  subdivision  or entity of the federal
         government,  must be filed in the  personal  property  records or other
         commercial code records.

                  (b) It is  understood  and agreed that,  in the event that (A)
         Company  intends to purchase any goods which may become fixtures to the
         Collateral,  or any part  thereof  (except as permitted  under  Section
         10.04(e) of the Credit  Agreement  and Section 10.09 of the Amended and
         Restated  Note  Agreement),  and (B) such  goods  will be  subject to a
         security  interest  held by a seller or any  other  party  (other  than
         Permitted  Liens),   Company  shall,   before  executing  any  security
         agreement or other document  evidencing such security interest,  obtain
         the prior written  approval of Collateral  Agent,  and all requests for
         such  written  approval  shall be in writing and contain the  following
         information:

                       breach of Company's  covenants  under this Deed of Trust,
                       and shall,  at the option of  Collateral  Agent,  entitle
                       Collateral Agent to all rights and remedies  provided for
                       herein  upon  default.  No  consent by  Collateral  Agent
                       pursuant to this paragraph  shall be deemed to constitute
                       an agreement to subordinate any right of Collateral Agent
                       in  fixtures  or other  property  covered by this Deed of

is  required to be provided  pursuant  to SECTION  2.5(D)(7)  above or which may
reasonably be believed by the  Collateral  Agent to form the basis of a material
Environmental  Claim in  connection  with the  Collateral.  If such a  requested
environmental  report is not  delivered  within  seventy-five  (75)  days  after
receipt of the Collateral Agent's request, then the Collateral Agent may arrange

against Company and all of Company's assets and property for the recovery of any
deficiency,  including,  without  limitation,  seeking an attachment order under
California  Code of Civil  Procedure  Section  483.010.  No such waiver shall be
final or binding on Collateral  Agent unless and until a final money judgment is
obtained against Company. As between Collateral Agent and Company,  for purposes
of California  Code of Civil  Procedure  Section  726.5,  Company shall have the
burden of proving that the release or  threatened  release was not  knowingly or
negligently caused or contributed to, or knowingly or willfully permitted or



                                      -15-

acquiesced  to by Company or any  related  party (or any  affiliate  or agent of
Company or any related party) and that Company made written  disclosure  thereof
to Collateral Agent or that Collateral Agent otherwise obtained actual knowledge
thereof prior to the making of the Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary  contained  in the Deed of Trust or any of the Security  Documents,
Company  shall be fully and  personally  liable  for all  judgments  and  awards
entered against Company pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure 726.5 and
such  liability  shall not be limited by the  original  principal  amount of the
obligations secured by this Deed of Trust. Company's obligations hereunder shall
survive the foreclosure,  deed in lieu of foreclosure,  release, reconveyance or
any other transfer of the Collateral or this Deed of Trust.  For the purposes of
any action  brought under this Deed of Trust,  Company hereby waives the defense
of laches and any applicable statute of limitations.  For purposes of California
Code of Civil  Procedure  726.5,  the acts,  knowledge and notice of each "726.5
Party" shall be attributed to and be deemed to have been  performed by the party
or parties then obligated on or liable for payment of the Indebtedness.  As used
herein,  "726.5 Party" shall mean Company,  any partner  thereof,  any successor
owner to Company of all or any portion of the  Collateral,  any related party of
Company or any such  successor and any  affiliate or agent of Company,  any such
successor or any such related party.

 Subsidiary to maintain, insurance coverage with financially sound and reputable
 domestic  insurers  in such forms and  amounts  and  against  such risks as are

         respect to the Collateral  shall not at any time be less than a blanket
         limit of $70,000,000 in the aggregate;  and PROVIDED  FURTHER that such
         insurance  POLICY SHALL  provide that NOT more than  $1,000,000  may be
         deductible FROM the LOSS payable with respect to any casualty;

                  (ii)  fiduciary  liability  insurance  with such  terms as are

         than  $1,000,000;  and PROVIDED,  FURTHER,  that such  insurance  shall
         provide with respect to the Company that not more than  $100,000 may be
         deductible  from any loss payable and that with respect to  individuals

 Agent by each  insurer with  respect  thereto.  Provided no Default or Event of
 Default  has  occurred or is  continuing,  the loss,  if any,  under any policy
 pertaining to loss by reason of damage to or  destruction of any portion of any
 of the  Collateral  shall be  adjusted  with  the  insurance  companies  by the
 Company,  subject to the approval of the  Collateral  Agent if the loss exceeds
 $1,500,000;  PROVIDED that such approval shall not  unreasonably be withheld or
 delayed. The loss so adjusted shall be paid to the Collateral Agent pursuant to
 said loss payable  clause  unless said loss is $1,500,000 or less in which case
 said loss shall be paid  directly to the  Company  unless a Default or Event of
 Default has occurred and is  continuing,  in which event any such loss shall be

 relating to insurance on the Collateral have been .paid, that such policies are
 in full force and effect and that such  insurance  coverage  and such  policies
 comply  with all the  requirements  of this  subsection.  Receipt  of notice of
 termination  or  cancellation  of any such  insurance  policies or reduction of
 coverages or amounts thereunder shall entitle the Collateral Agent to renew any
 such  policies,  cause the  coverages  and amounts  thereof to be maintained at
 levels  required  pursuant to this Section 2.6 or  otherwise to obtain  similar
 insurance  in  place  of such  policies,  in each  case at the  expense  of the

 Agreement,  the Company  will pay and  discharge,  before the same shall become
 delinquent,  together  with  interest and  penalties  thereon,  if any, (1) all
 taxes,  assessments  (INCLUDING  ASSESSMENTS  for benefits from public works or
 improvements whenever begun or completed),  levies, fees, water and sewer rents

 Collateral  or any part  thereof  or upon  this  Deed of  Trust or the  Secured
 Obligations  secured hereby, or upon the revenues,  rents,  issues,  income and
 profits in respect of the  Collateral,  or arising in respect of the occupancy,
 use or possession  thereof,  but excluding the Excluded Taxes, which failure to
 pay would  result in the  creation  of a Lien upon the  Collateral  or any part
 thereof,  or upon the  revenues,  rents,  issues,  income  and  profits  of the
 Collateral  or in the  diminution  thereof  or  would  result  in any  material
 interference with the use or operation of the

 fees and  charges  assessed,  levied or imposed  in  respect  of its  corporate
 existence  or its right to do  business in any state,  (3) all  income,  excess
 profits,  excise, sales,  franchise,  gross receipts and other taxes, duties or
 imposts, whether of alike or different nature,  assessed,  levied or imposed by
 any Governmental Authority on it or the Collateral,  or any portion thereof, or
 upon the revenues,  rents, issues, income and profits of the Collateral whether
 or not the  failure  to pay any such tax,  duty or impost  might  result in the
 creation of a Lien upon any asset of the Company or the  Collateral or any part
 thereof  or upon  the  revenues,  rents,  issues,  income  and  profits  of the
 Collateral or in the diminution thereof,  and whether or not any such tax, duty
 or impost is payable  directly by the Company or is subject to  withholding  at
 the source  and (4) all lawful  claims  and  demands  of  mechanics,  laborers,
 materialmen and others which, if unpaid, might result in the creation of a Lien
 on the Collateral or upon the revenues,  rents,  issues,  income and profits of
 the  Collateral  and,  in  general,  will do or  cause  to be  done  everything
 necessary so that the Lien hereof shall be fully preserved,  at the cost of the
 Company,  without expense to the Trustee or the Collateral  Agent (all of which
 taxes,  assessments,  levies,  fees and other governmental or  non-governmental
 charges,  claims and  demands of like  nature are  hereinafter  referred  to as
 "IMPOSITIONS").  The  Company  shall  discharge  any claim or Lien  relating to
 Impositions upon the Collateral.

         (b) The  Company  will pay  when  due all  utility  charges  which  are
incurred by the Company for the benefit of the  Collateral or which may become a
charge or Lien  against  the  Collateral  for gas,  electricity,  water or sewer
services  furnished to the Collateral and all other  assessments or charges of a
similar  nature,  whether  public or private,  affecting  the  Collateral or any
portion  thereof,  whether or not such taxes,  assessments or charges are or may

terms and conditions thereof, the Company may, in good faith and with reasonable
diligence and by appropriate proceedings diligently prosecuted, contest or cause
to be contested the validity or amount of any such Impositions, PROVIDED that:

                  (1) such contest shall have the effect of  preventing  (i) any
          sale,  forfeiture  OR loss of the  Collateral  or any part  thereof or
          interest   therein  to  satisfy   the  same  and  (ii)  any   material
          interference with the value, use or occupancy of the Collateral or any
          part thereof; and

                  (2) the Company  shall have  established  with respect to such
          Impositions (and any attendant penalties or late fees) reserves deemed
          by it to be adequate with respect thereto.
                  SECTION 2.8.  LIMITATION ON LIENS. The Company will not create
 or incur or suffer to be incurred or to exist, any mortgage,  pledge,  security
 interest,  encumbrance,  charge or other Lien of any kind upon the  Collateral,

                  SECTION  2.9.  ADVANCES.  If the Company  shall fail to comply
 with the  covenants  contained  herein or contained in the Amended and Restated
 Note Agreements,  the Credit Agreement,  the Intercreditor and Agency Agreement
 or the other Note Documents and incorporated  herein by reference,  the Trustee
 or the  Collateral  Agent,  without  waiving any Default or Event of Default or
 releasing any obligation, may (but shall be under no obligation to) at any time
 thereafter  after five Business  Days' prior written notice to the Company make
 such  payment or perform  such act for the  account  and at the  expense of the
 Company, and may enter upon the Collateral or any part thereof for such purpose
 and take all such  action  thereon as, in the  opinion of the  Trustee,  may be
 necessary or reasonably appropriate therefore.  All sums so paid by the Trustee
 or the  Collateral  Agent,  and all  costs  and  expenses  (including,  without
 limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) so incurred, together with
 interest  thereon  at the  Advance  Overdue  Rate from the date of  payment  or
 incurrence,  shall be secured  hereby  and shall be paid by the  Company to the
 Collateral  Agent on  demand.  The  Collateral  Agent  in  making  any  payment
 authorized  under this SECTION 2.9 relating to taxes or  assessments  may do so
 according to any bill,  statement  or estimate  procured  from the  appropriate
 public  office  without  inquiry into the  accuracy of such bill,  statement or
 estimate or into the validity of any tax assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax Lien
 or title  or  claim  thereof.  The  Collateral  Agent,  in  performing  any act
 hereunder,  shall be the sole  judge of whether  the  Company  is  required  to
 perform  the same  under the  terms of this  Deed of Trust and no such  advance
 shall be deemed to relieve the Company from any default hereunder.

                  SECTION  2.10.  RECORDATION.  The  Company  will,  at its  own
 expense,  cause this Deed of Trust and all supplements hereto and any financing
 statements and continuation  statements required by the Uniform Commercial Code
 or other law in respect  thereof at all times to be kept  recorded and filed at
 its own  expense in such manner and in such places as may be required by law in
 order  to  fully  preserve  and  protect  the  rights  of the  Trustee  and the
 Collateral Agent hereunder.

                  SECTION 2.11.  AFTER-ACQUIRED  PROPERTY.  Any and all property
 hereafter  acquired  which is of the kind or nature  described  in the Granting
 Clauses  hereof  and is or is  intended  to become a part  thereof,  shall IPSO
 FACTO, and without any further conveyance, assignment or act on the part of the
 Company or the Trustee or the  Collateral  Agent become and be,  subject to the
 Lien and first perfected  security  interest OF this Deed of Trust as fully and
 completely  as though  specifically  described  herein;  but  nevertheless  the
 Company shall from time to time, if requested by the Trustee or the  Collateral
 Agent, execute and deliver any and all such further assurances, conveyances and
 assignments  thereof as the  Trustee  or the  Collateral  Agent may  reasonably
 require for the purpose of expressly  and  specifically  subjecting to the Lien
 and first  perfected  security  interest of this Deed of Trust any and all such
 property, subject to Permitted Encumbrances.  In the event the Company acquires
 a  material  leasehold  estate in any  property  which is of the kind or nature
 described in the Granting  Clauses hereof,  such leasehold estate shall be made
 subject to a lien and first perfected security interest in favor of the Trustee
 by means of the Company's  execution  and delivery of a leasehold  mortgage and
 security agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
 and the  Collateral  Agent.  The  Company  agrees that in the event the Company
 acquires a leasehold estate as described in this SECTION 2.11, the Company will
 use commercially  reasonable efforts to promptly obtain from the subject lessor
 an agreement  for the benefit of the Trustee and the  Collateral  Agent,  INTER
 ALIA,  providing that the lessor will give the Trustee and the Collateral Agent
 written notice of any


                                      -20-

defaults  under the subject lease together with the option to cure such defaults
and providing for such other requirements as the Collateral Agent may reasonably
request.

                  SECTION 2.12. INDEMNIFCATION; WAIVER OF OFFSET
                                       SET

         (a) If the Trustee or the Collateral Agent is made a party defendant to
any  litigation  concerning  this  Deed of Trust or the  Collateral  or any part
thereof or interest therein,  then the Company shall indemnify,  defend and hold
the Trustee or the  Collateral  Agent  harmless  from all liability by reason of
said litigation,  including reasonable  attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by
the Trustee or the Collateral Agent in any such  litigation,  whether or not any
such  litigation  is prosecuted  to judgment.  If the Trustee or the  Collateral
Agent commences an action against the Company to enforce any of the terms hereof
or because of the breach by the Company of any of the terms  hereof,  or for the
recovery of any of the Secured Obligations,  the Trustee or the Collateral Agent
shall have its reasonable  attorneys' fees and expenses paid by the Company.  If
the Trustee or the Collateral Agent is a party to any discussion or negotiations
relating to any  amendment,  waivers or  consents  to the  Amended and  Restated
Senior Secured Notes,  the Credit Agreement Term Notes, the Amended and Restated
Note Agreements,  the Credit Agreement,  the Intercreditor and Agency Agreement,
this  Deed of  Trust  or the  other  Note  Documents,  or  relating  to any loan
modification,  recasting,  settlement or other agreement relating to the Secured
Obligations,  then the Company shall  indemnify,  defend and hold the Trustee or
the Collateral Agent harmless from all liability, costs and expenses incurred in
connection therewith, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.

         (b) All sums  payable by the Company  hereunder  shall be paid  without
notice,  demand,   counterclaim,   setoff,  deduction  or  defense  and  without
abatement,  suspension,  deferment, diminution or reduction, and the obligations
and liabilities of the Company hereunder shall in no way be released, discharged
or otherwise affected (except as expressly provided herein) by reason of (i) any
damage  to or  destruction  of or any  condemnation  or  similar  taking  of the
Collateral  or any  part  thereof;  (ii) any  restriction  or  prevention  of or
interference with any use of the Collateral or any part thereof; (iii) any title
defect or encumbrance  on the Collateral or any part thereof by title  paramount
or otherwise;  (iv) any  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  composition,
adjustment,  dissolution,  liquidation or other like proceeding  relating to the
Trustee or the Collateral  Agent,  or any action taken with RESPECT to this Deed
OF Trust by any trustee OR receiver of the Trustee or the Collateral  Agent,  or
by any court,  in any such  proceeding;  (v) any claim  which the Company has or
might have  against the  Trustee or the  Collateral  Agent;  (vi) any default or
failure on the part of the Trustee or the Collateral  Agent to perform or comply
with any of the terms  hereof or of any other  agreement  with the  Company;  or
(vii) any other  occurrence  whatsoever,  whether  similar or  dissimilar to the
foregoing;  whether or not the Company  shall have notice or knowledge of any of
the foregoing.  Except as expressly  provided herein,  the Company waives to the
extent  permitted  by law all rights now or  hereafter  conferred  by statute or
otherwise to any abatement,  suspension,  deferment,  diminution or reduction of
any of the Secured Obligations payable by the Company.

         (c) The Company  shall,  at its sole expense,  indemnify,  defend (with
attorneys,  consultants  and experts  reasonably  acceptable  to the  Collateral
Agent),  and hold the Trustee and the Collateral Agent harmless from and against
any  and  all  liens,  damages,  losses,  liabilities,  obligations,  settlement
payments, penalties, assessments, citations, directives, claims, litigation,

demands,  defenses,  judgments,  suits,  proceedings,  costs,  disbursements  or
expenses  of any  kind or of any  nature  whatsoever  which  may at any  time be
imposed  upon,  incurred  by or  asserted  or awarded  against  the  Trustee and
Collateral  Agent  or the  Collateral,  (including,  without  limitation,  those
arising out of or attributed,  directly or indirectly,  to or resulting from any
and all  negligent  acts or omissions of Trustee or  Collateral  Agent,  whether
caused  by  the  sole  negligence  of  Trustee  or  Collateral  Agent  or by the
concurrent  negligence of Trustee or Collateral Agent), and arising prior to the
Collateral  Agent's  obtaining  title to the Collateral  through  foreclosure or
other like proceedings,  directly or indirectly from or out of (i) the presence,
release  or threat of  release  of any  Hazardous  Substance  on,  in,  under or
affecting  all or  any  portion  of the  Collateral  or any  surrounding  areas,
regardless  of whether or not caused by or within  control of the Company;  (ii)

actions taken in response to the  presence,  release or threat of release of any
Hazardous  Substance on, in, under or affecting any portion of the Collateral or
any  surrounding  areas to prevent or minimize such release or threat of release
so that it does not migrate or otherwise  cause or threaten danger to present or
future public health, safety, welfare or the environment,  and costs incurred to
comply with the Environmental  Laws in connection with all or any portion of the
Collateral or any surrounding areas; except, in each case, to the extent arising
out of the gross  negligence or willful  misconduct of the Trustee or Collateral
Agent.  The indemnity  set forth in this SECTION  2.12(C) shall also include any
diminution in the value of the security afforded by the Collateral or any future
reduction in the sales price of the Collateral by reason of any matter set forth
in this SECTION 2.12(C).  The Company's  obligations  under this SECTION 2.12(C)
shall survive payment in full of the indebtedness secured hereby and shall be in
addition to all other rights of Trustee and the Collateral Agent under this Deed
of Trust, the Amended and Restated Note Agreements,  the Credit  Agreement,  the
Amended and Restated  Senior Secured Notes,  the Credit  Agreement Notes and the

          Replacement Items of Trade Property, are either subject to the lien of
          this Deed of Trust, or that such Deed of Trust and Security  Agreement
          Supplement and any necessary financing  statements have been recorded,
          registered and filed in such manner and in such

         places as may be required  by law to  preserve  and protect the Trustee
         and the Collateral  Agent as to all property  comprising the Collateral
         (including,   without  limitation,   the  Replacement  Items  of  Trade
         Property).

          (b) No purchaser in good faith of an item of Trade  Property  shall be
 bound to inquire  into the  authority of the Company to sell such item of Trade
 Property,  or the authority of the Trustee or the Collateral Agent to execute a
 release of its security interest, under the terms hereof.

                  SECTION  3.4.  RELEASE  OF  COLLATERAL  -- LOSS,  DAMAGE TO OR
 DESTRUCTION OF THE COLLATERAL AND PREPAYMENT OF THE NOTES.  Upon the occurrence
 of any material loss,  damage to or destruction of the Collateral,  the Company
 shall  give the  Trustee  and the  Collateral  Agent,  within 30 days after the
 occurrence  thereof,  written notice of such loss, damage or destruction.  Such
 notice shall generally describe the nature and extent of the loss, damage to or
 destruction of the Collateral and shall include a detailed estimate of the cost
 of repair or replacement of such damaged or destroyed  Collateral.  In the case
 of any loss,  damage to or  destruction  of the  Collateral  which results in a
 prepayment  of the Notes in  accordance  with the  provisions  of  SECTION  4.1
 hereof,  the Trustee or the Collateral Agent shall execute a release in respect
 of the damaged or destroyed Collateral upon receipt of such prepayment in full.

          All  determinations  of the  cost  of  repair  or  replacement  of the
 Collateral  hereof  shall be made by the  Company  in good  faith  and shall be
 evidenced by the delivery of an Officer's  Certificate  or a resolution  of the
 Board of Directors of the Company certifying the accuracy and reasonableness of
 such determination. In making such determinations,  the Company shall base such
 calculations on engineer's,  architect's or other objective criteria, including
 insurance estimates of cost of repair, as shall be reasonably consulted in good
 faith by the Company.

                  SECTION 3.5.  EMINENT DOMAIN.  The Company,  immediately  upon
 obtaining  knowledge of the institution of any proceeding for the  condemnation
 of the Collateral or any portion thereof,  shall notify the Collateral Agent of
 the pendency of such  proceeding.  The Collateral  Agent may participate in any
 such proceeding,  and the Company from time to time will deliver or cause to be
 delivered to the  Collateral  Agent all  instruments  requested by it to permit
 such participation. Any award or compensation payable to the Company on account
 of such condemnation proceeding, if any, shall be paid to the Collateral Agent,
 and such award of  compensation  shall be retained by the  Collateral  Agent as
 part of the Collateral and applied in accordance with SECTION 4.1(A) OR SECTION
 4.1(B) hereof.  The  Collateral  Agent shall be under no obligation to question
 the amount of the award of  compensation  and,  without  limiting the Company's
 right to adjust such award,  the Collateral  Agent may accept any such award of
 compensation.  In any such condemnation proceedings the Collateral Agent may be
 represented by counsel.  The  reasonable  costs of counsel shall be paid by the
 Company.

 SECTION 4. APPLICATION OF INSURANCE AND CERTAIN OTHER MONEYS RECEIVED BY THE
COLLATERAL AGENT.

                  SECTION 4.1. INSURANCE  PROCEEDS AND CONDEMNATION  AWARDS. The
 amounts received by or payable to the Collateral Agent from time to time which
constitute insurance proceeds in respect of any damage to or destruction of the
Collateral or any part thereof or


                                      -24-


<PAGE>





Condemnation  Awards or  compensation  covering the Collateral  (less the actual
costs,  fees and expenses  incurred in the collection  thereof) shall be held by
the  Collateral  Agent as part of the  Collateral  and shall be  applied  by the
Collateral  Agent,  subject  to  the  terms  of  the  Intercreditor  and  Agency
Agreement,  as set forth below (Company hereby  unconditionally  and irrevocably
waives all rights of a property owner under the provisions of California Code of
Civil Procedure ss.  1265.225(a),  or any successor  statute,  providing for the
allocation of condemnation proceeds between a property owner and a lienholder):

         (a) In case of any loss, damage to,  destruction or condemnation of the
Collateral or any part thereof for which the total cost of repair or replacement
is less than $1,500,000, such proceeds shall be paid over to the Company and the
Company  shall  have the right and the  option,  so long as no Event of  Default
hereunder has occurred and is  continuing,  to use the net  insurance  proceeds,
Condemnation Awards or other compensation from such loss, damage to, destruction
or  condemnation  of the  Collateral for either (i) the repair or replacement of
such Collateral so lost, damaged, destroyed or condemned, so long as such repair
or  replacement  is  commenced  within 180 days of the receipt by the Company of
such  insurance  proceeds or  condemnation  award and the  Collateral  Agent has
received  written evidence  satisfactory to the Collateral  Agent  demonstrating
that the collateral  lost,  damaged or destroyed will be replaced or restored to
substantially the same market value and condition immediately prior to the loss,
damage to,  destruction  or  condemnation  of or other event  giving rise to the
payment of such  proceeds;  or (ii) the  reduction  of the  Secured  Obligations
(whether  or not then  due) in  accordance  with and  pursuant  to the terms and
provisions  of  the  Intercreditor  and  Agency  Agreement  including,   without
limitation, the payment of the Make Whole Premium, as applicable; and

         (b) In case of any loss,  damage to or destruction of the Collateral or
any part  thereof for which the total cost of repair or  replacement  is greater
than or equal to $1,500,000, the net insurance proceeds,  Condemnation Awards or
other compensation from such loss, damage to, destruction or condemnation of the
Collateral  shall be placed in a separate escrow account and 180 days thereafter
shall be  applied  by the  Collateral  Agent  to the  reduction  of the  Secured
Obligations  (whether or not then due) in  accordance  with and  pursuant to the
terns and  provisions  of the  Intercreditor  and  Agency  Agreement  including,
without  limitation,  the  payment of the Make  Whole  Premium,  if  applicable;
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that the Collateral Agent agrees, subject to the immediately
following  sentence,  to release  such  insurance  proceeds  to the  Company for
replacement or restoration of the portion of the Collateral so lost,  damaged or
destroyed if, but only if, (i) no Event of Default hereunder has occurred and is
continuing  at the time of release,  (ii) written  application  for such release
signed by the President or any Vice  President of the Company is received by the
Collateral Agent within 180 days of the placement of such proceeds in escrow and
(iii) the Collateral Agent has received evidence reasonably  satisfactory to the
Collateral Agent  demonstrating  that the Collateral lost,  damaged or destroyed
has been or will be replaced or restored to substantially  the same market value
and  condition  immediately  prior  to  the  loss,  damage  to,  destruction  or
condemnation  of or other event  giving  rise to the  payment of such  insurance
proceeds. All insurance proceeds and Condemnation Awards shall be subject to the
lien and security interest of the Collateral Agent hereunder. In the case of any
repair or replacement  of the Collateral for which the cost exceeds  $8,000,000,
the Collateral Agent shall receive a supplement hereto  sufficient,  as shown by
an opinion of counsel  (which may be counsel  for the  Company) to grant a valid
first  Lien  and  first  perfected   security  interest  (subject  to  Permitted
Encumbrances) in any additions to or substitutions for the

                                      -25-


<PAGE>





 Collateral to or for the benefit of the Collateral  Agent,  which opinion shall
 also cover the filing  and/or  recording  of such  supplement  (and a financing
 statement or similar notice thereof if and to the extent  permitted or required
 by  applicable  law) so as to perfect  the Lien and  security  interest in such
 additions  or  substitutions,  or in the  alternative  an opinion  that no such
 supplement is required for such purpose.

                  SECTION  4.2.  TITLE  INSURANCE.  Any moneys  received  by the
 Trustee or the  Collateral  Agent as  payment  for any loss under any policy of
 title  insurance  which was  delivered by the Company  shall become part of the
 Collateral.

                  SECTION 4.3. OTHER PROCEEDS.  Any other moneys received by the
 Collateral Agent in connection with the release of the Collateral shall be held
 by the  Collateral  Agent as part of the Collateral and shall be applied by the
 Collateral  Agent upon the terms and in the  manner  provided  in  SECTION  5.3
 hereof.

                  SECTION 4.4.  APPLICATION  IF EVENT of DEFAULT  EXISTS.  If an
 Event of Default hereunder has occurred and is continuing, all amounts received
 by the Collateral Agent under this Deed of Trust, including without limitation,
 all amounts held pursuant to SECTION 4.5 hereof, shall be applied in the manner
 PROVIDED  FOR IN SECTION  5.3 hereof in respect of  proceeds  and avails of the
 Collateral.

                  SECTION 4.5. INVESTMENT OF COLLATERAL.  All monies held by the
 Collateral  Agent  hereunder as Collateral  shall be invested and reinvested by
 the  Collateral  Agent at the  direction of the Company in one or more Eligible
 Investments. The Collateral Agent shall not in any way be held liable by reason
 of any insufficiency of such invested Collateral resulting from any loss on any
 Eligible  Investment  included  therein.  All interest  earned on such Eligible
 Investments  shall be held by the Collateral Agent as Collateral  hereunder and
 shall be invested and reinvested pursuant to this SECTION 4.5.

 SECTION 5. DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES THEREFOR.

                  SECTION 5.1. EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  The Company  acknowledges and
 agrees,  without  limitation,  that each and all of the terms and provisions of
 Section 11 of the Amended and Restated  Note  Agreements  and Article XI of the
 Credit  Agreement,  have been and are  incorporated  into this Deed of Trust by
 reference  to the same extent as though  fully set out herein and that the term
 Event of Default wherever used in this Deed of Trust shall mean either:  (a) an
 Event of Default as defined in the Amended and Restated Note  Agreements or the
 Credit  Agreement,  as the case may be, or (b) the  failure  of the  Company to
 comply with any covenant, agreement or warranty contained in this Deed of Trust
 within 30 days  after the  earlier  of the date that (1) the  Collateral  Agent
 shall have given  written  notice  thereof to the Company,  or (2) such failure
 shall first  become  actually  known to a  Responsible  Officer of the Company;
 PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that if the  Company  shall be  diligently  proceeding  to
 correct  such  failure but shall be unable to correct  such  failure  within 30
 days,  then such period shall  continue for an additional 60 days if at the end
 of the initial  30-day period it can be  reasonably  expected that such failure
 can be corrected  within such 60 additional days and the Company shall continue
 to proceed  diligently  to correct such failure  during such  additional 60 day
 period.

                  SECTION 5.2. REMEDIES. When any Event of Default hereunder has
 occurred  and is  continuing  and pursuant to the terms and  conditions  of the
 Amended and Restated Note  Agreements or the Credit  Agreement,  the Collateral
 Agent or Trustee may exercise any one or more or all, and in any order,  of the
 remedies  hereinafter set forth,  it being expressly  understood that no remedy
 herein or in the Amended and Restated Note  Agreements or the Credit  Agreement
 conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies; but each
 and every  remedy shall be  cumulative  and shall be in addition to every other
 remedy  given  herein or now or  hereafter  existing  at law or in equity or by
 statute:

          (a)  Subject  to  compliance  with the  terms  and  provisions  of the
 Intercreditor  and Agency  Agreement,  the  Noteholders and the Lenders may, by
 notice in writing to the  Company,  declare  the entire  unpaid  balance of the
 Amended and  Restated  Senior  Secured  Notes and the Credit  Agreement  Notes,
 respectively,  to be immediately due and payable; and thereupon all outstanding
 principal,  together with all accrued interest thereon and premium, if any, and
 all other fees or other  amounts  payable  with  respect  thereto  shall be and
 become immediately due and payable.

          (b)  Subject  to the terms and  conditions  of the  Intercreditor  and
 Agency Agreement,  the Collateral  Agent,  personally or by agents or attorneys
 may, to the extent  permitted by law, enter into and take  possession of all or
 any part of the  Collateral,  and may  forthwith  use,  operate  and manage the
 Collateral,  collect  the  earnings  and  income  therefrom,  pay  all  charges
 including  taxes and  assessments  levied thereon and operating and maintenance
 expenses and all  disbursements  and  liabilities of the Company  hereunder and
 apply the net proceeds  arising from any such  operation of the  Collateral  as
 provided  in SECTION  5.3 hereof in  respect of the  proceeds  of a sale of the
 Collateral.  The right to enter and take  possession of the  Collateral and use
 any personal property therein, to manage, operate and conserve the same, and to
 collect  the rents,  issues and  profits  thereof,  shall be in addition to all
 other rights or remedies of the Collateral  Agent  hereunder or afforded by law
 (including,  without  limitation  the rights of  Collateral  Agent set forth in
 California  Civil  Code  Section  2938),  and  may  be  exercised  concurrently
 therewith or  independently  thereof.  The expenses  (including  any reasonable
 receiver's  fees,  reasonable  counsel  fees,  costs and agent's  compensation)
 incurred  pursuant to the powers herein  contained  shall be secured hereby and
 the  Company  promises  to pay all such  expenses  upon  demand  together  with
 interest thereon at the Advance Overdue Rate. The Collateral Agent shall not be
 liable to account to the Company for any action  taken  pursuant  hereto  other
 than to  account  for any rents  actually  received  by the  Collateral  Agent.
 Without taking  possession of the Collateral,  the Collateral Agent may, in the
 event the Collateral becomes vacant or is abandoned, take such reasonable steps
 as it deems appropriate to protect and secure the Collateral  (including hiring
 watchmen  therefor)  and  all  costs  incurred  in so  doing  shall  constitute
 additional Secured Obligations payable upon demand with interest thereon at the
 Advance Overdue Rate.

         (c) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor and Agency
 Agreement, the Trustee may, if at the time such action may be lawful and always
 subject to compliance  with any mandatory  legal  requirements,  either with or
 without  taking  possession and either before or after taking  possession,  and
 without  instituting any legal proceedings  whatsoever,  and having first given
 notice of such sale to the  Company  at least 30 days prior to the date of such
 sale and having given any other  notice which may be required by law,  sell and
 dispose of said  Collateral  or any part  thereof at public  auction or private
 sale to the highest bidder, which may be a


                                      -27-


<PAGE>





 Noteholder,  in one lot as an  entirety or in  separate  lots (the  Company for
 itself  and for all who may claim  by,  through  or under it  hereby  expressly
 waiving and releasing all rights to have the Collateral marshaled to the extent
 permitted  by law),  and  either for cash or on credit and on such terms as the
 Trustee may determine and at the place  required by law. Any such sale or sales
 may be  adjourned  from  time to time by  announcement  at the time  and  place
 appointed  for such  sale or sales or for any  such  adjourned  sale or  sales,
 without further published notice. Company waives all rights to direct the order
 in which any of the Collateral will be sold in the event of any sale under this
 Deed of  Trust.  In the  case of a sale  under  this  Deed of  Trust,  the said
 property,  real, personal and mixed, may be sold in one parcel or more than one
 parcel.  Should  Collateral  Agent desire that more than one such sale or other
 disposition be conducted,  Collateral Agent may, at its option,  cause the same
 to be conducted  simultaneously,  or  successively  on the same day, or at such
 different days or times and in such order as Collateral Agent may deem to be in
 its best interest. Any person,  including Company, Trustee or Collateral Agent,
 may purchase at the sale.  Upon any sale,  Trustee shall execute and deliver to
 the purchaser or purchasers a deed or deeds conveying the property so sold, but
 without any covenant or warranty whatsoever, express or implied, whereupon such
 purchaser or  purchasers  shall be let into  immediate  possession.  Collateral
 Agent,  from time to time before the trustee's sale pursuant to this paragraph,
 may rescind any notice of breach or default and of election to cause to be sold
 the  Collateral by executing and delivering to Trustee a written notice of such
 rescission,  which notice,  shall also  constitute a cancellation  of any prior
 declaration of default and demand for sale. The exercise by Collateral Agent of
 such right of rescission shall not constitute a waiver of any breach or default
 then existing or subsequently occurring or impair the right of Collateral Agent
 to execute and deliver to Trustee,  as above  provided,  other  declarations of
 default and demand for sale, and notices of breach or default,  the obligations
 hereof,  nor  otherwise  affect any  provision,  covenant or  condition  of the
 Operative  Agreements  and/or  this  Deed  of  Trust  or  any  of  the  rights,
 obligations or remedies of the parties thereunder or hereunder.

          (d)  Subject  to the terms and  conditions  of the  Intercreditor  and
 Agency  Agreement,  the Collateral Agent may proceed to protect and enforce its
 rights by a suit or suits in equity or at law, or for the specific  performance
 of any  covenant or agreement  contained  herein or in the Amended and Restated
 Note  Agreements  or the Credit  Agreement,  or in aid of the  execution of any
 power herein or therein granted,  or for the foreclosure of this Deed of Trust,
 or for the enforcement of any other appropriate legal or equitable remedy. Upon
 the  bringing  of any suit to  foreclose  this Deed of Trust or to enforce  any
 other remedy available  hereunder,  the plaintiff shall be entitled as a matter
 of right,  without  notice and  without  giving  bond to the  Company or anyone
 claiming  under,  by or  through  it, and  without  regard to the  solvency  or
 insolvency  of the  Company or the then value of the  premises,  to apply to an
 appropriate court to have a receiver appointed of all the Collateral and of the
 earnings,  income, rents, issues, profits and proceeds thereof, with such power
 as the court making such appointment shall confer,  and the Company does hereby
 irrevocably  consent to such  appointment.  It is understood and agreed upon by
 the Company and the Collateral  Agent that this Deed of Trust may be foreclosed
 upon simultaneously in one or more jurisdictions.

          (e)  Subject  to the terms and  conditions  of the  Intercreditor  and
 Agency  Agreement,  in  case  of any  sale of the  Collateral,  or of any  part
 thereof,  pursuant  to any  judgment  or decree of any  court or  otherwise  in
 connection with the enforcement of any of the terms of this Deed of Trust,  the
 Collateral  Agent,  the  Lenders  or the  Noteholders  may bid and  become  the
 purchaser,


                                      -28-


<PAGE>





 and the purchaser or  purchasers,  for the purpose of making  settlement for or
 payment of the purchase  price,  shall be entitled to TURN IN AND use the Notes
 and ANY claims for interest and premium  matured and unpaid  thereon,  in order
 that there may be credited as paid on the purchase price the sum  apportionable
 and  applicable  to the Notes,  including  principal  and  interest and premium
 thereof, out of the net proceeds of such sale after allowing for the proportion
 of the total  purchase  price  required  to be paid in actual  cash.  If at any
 foreclosure  proceeding  the  Collateral  shall be sold for a sum less than the
 total  amount  of  indebtedness  for  which  judgment  is  therein  given,  the
 Collateral Agent shall be entitled to the entry of a deficiency  decree against
 the  Company  and  against  the  property of the Company for the amount of such
 deficiency.

          (f)  Subject  to the terms and  conditions  of the  Intercreditor  and
 Agency  Agreement,  the  Collateral  Agent  shall  have any and all  rights and
 remedies (including, without limitation, extra judicial power of sale) provided
 to a secured party by the Uniform  Commercial  Code with respect to any and all
 parts of the  Collateral  which are and which are deemed to be  governed by the
 Uniform Commercial Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,  the
 Collateral Agent shall, with respect to any part of the Collateral constituting
 property  of the type in respect  of which  realization  on a Lien or  security
 interest  granted therein is governed by the Uniform  Commercial Code, have all
 the  rights,  options  and  remedies  of a  secured  party  under  the  Uniform
 Commercial Code, including,  without limitation, the right to the possession of
 any such  property,  or any part  thereof,  and the  right  peaceably  to enter
 without  legal process any premises  where any such property may be found.  Any
 requirement of said Uniform  Commercial Code for reasonable  notification shall
 be met by mailing  written  notice to the  Company at its  address set forth in
 SECTION  6.3 hereof at least 30 days prior to the sale or other event for which
 such notice is required.

          (g)  Declare  all  sums  secured  by this  Deed of Trust to be due and
 payable  without  further notice and commence a trustee's sale of the Property,
 and if the  Collateral  Agent shall so elect,  the sale shall be  conducted  as
 follows:

                  (1) The  Collateral  Agent shall  deliver to Trustee a written
         declaration  of default  and  demand  for sale and a written  notice of
         default and election to cause the Mortgaged  Property to be sold, which
         notice  Trustee  shall cause to be filed for record.  Collateral  Agent
         shall  also  deposit  with  Trustee  this  Deed of  Trust,  the  Credit
         Agreement Documents,  the Note Documents,  and all documents evidencing
         expenditures secured hereby.

                  (2) After a lapse of such time as may then be  required by law
         following the recordation of said notice of default, and notice of sale
         having been given as then required by law,  Trustee,  without demand on
         the Company,  shall sell the  Mortgaged  Property at the time and place
         fixed by it in the  notice of sale,  either  as a whole or in  separate
         parcels,  and in such order as it may  determine,  at public auction to
         the  highest  bidder  for cash in lawful  money of the  United  States,
         payable at time of sale.  Trustee may  postpone  the sale of all or any
         portion of the Mortgaged  Property by public  announcement at such time
         and place of sale,  and from time to time  thereafter may postpone such
         sale  by  public  announcement  at the  time  fixed  by  the  preceding
         postponement.   Trustee  shall  deliver  to  such  purchaser  its  deed
         conveying the Mortgaged  Property so sold,  but without any covenant or
         warranty, express or implied. The recitals

                                      -29-


<PAGE>





         in such deed of any matters or facts shall be conclusive proof of the
         truthfulness thereof.

                  (3) Any  person,  including  the  Company,  the  Trustee,  the
         Collateral  Agent,  or any  of the  Noteholders  or  the  Lenders,  may
         purchase at any sale of the Property  under this Deed of Trust,  and if
         the Collateral  Agent is the highest bidder,  may credit the portion of
         the purchase price that would be  distributed  to the Collateral  Agent
         against the  indebtedness  in lieu of paying cash. The proceeds of such
         sale shall be applied as provided in this Deed of Trust.

          (h) The  Collateral  Agent shall have any and all rights and  remedies
 provided  for in the  Intercreditor  and Agency  Agreement  and the Amended and
 Restated Note Agreements and the Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION  5.3.  APPLICATION  OF PROCEEDS.  The  purchase  money
 proceeds and/or avails of any sale of the  Collateral,  or any part thereof and
 the  proceeds  and the  avails  of any  remedy  hereunder  shall be paid to and
 applied as follows:

          (a)  FIRST,  to  the  payment  PRO  RATA  of  costs  and  expenses  of
 foreclosure or suit, if any, and of such sale,  and to the extent  permitted by
 applicable law, the reasonable  compensation of the Collateral  Agent's agents,
 attorneys  and  counsel,  and of all proper  expenses,  liability  and advances
 incurred or made  hereunder by the Collateral  Agent or such agents,  attorneys
 and counsel,  and of all taxes,  assessments  or liens  superior to the Lien of
 these presents, except any taxes, assessments or other superior Lien subject to
 which said sale may have been made; and

          (b)  SECOND, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Intercreditor and Agency Agreement.

                  SECTION 5.4. WAIVER OF EXTENSION,  APPRAISEMENT AND STAY LAWS.
 The Company covenants that, upon the occurrence and the continuance of an Event
 of Default  hereunder  and the  acceleration  of the Notes  pursuant to SECTION
 5.2(A)  hereof and to the extent that such rights may then be lawfully  waived,
 it will not at any time  thereafter  insist  upon or  plead,  or in any  manner
 whatever  claim or take any benefit or advantage  of, any stay or extension law
 now or at any time  hereafter  in  force,  or claim,  take or  insist  upon any
 benefit or advantage of or from any law now or hereafter in force providing for
 the valuation or  appraisement  of the  Collateral or any part thereof prior to
 any  sale  or  sales  thereof  to be  made  pursuant  to any  provision  herein
 contained,  or to the  decree,  judgment  or  order of any  court of  competent
 jurisdiction or, after confirmation of any such sale or sales claim or exercise
 any right under any statute  now or  hereafter  made or enacted by any state or
 otherwise  to redeem  the  property  so sold or any part  thereof,  and  hereby
 expressly  waives  for  itself  and on behalf of each and every  Person who may
 claim under it, all benefit and  advantage  of any such law or laws which would
 otherwise be available to any such Person in connection with the enforcement of
 any of the Collateral  Agent's remedies  hereunder;  and covenants that it will
 not in connection with any such enforcement  proceedings  invoke or utilize any
 such law or laws or  otherwise  hinder,  delay or impede the  execution  of any
 power herein granted and delegated to the Collateral  Agent but will suffer and
 permit the execution of every such power as though no such law or laws had been
 made or enacted.

          The Company  hereby waives any and all rights of redemption  from sale
 under any order or decree of foreclosure  pursuant to rights herein granted, on
 behalf of the Company,  and each and every Person acquiring any interest in, or
 title to the Collateral described herein subsequent to the date of this Deed of
 Trust, and on behalf of all other Persons to the extent permitted by applicable
 law.

          Any sale, whether under any power of sale hereby given or by virtue of
 judicial proceedings, shall operate to divest all right, title, interest, claim
 and demand whatsoever, either at law or in equity, of the Company in and to the
 property sold and shall be a perpetual bar, both at law and in equity,  against
 the  Company,  its  successors  and  assigns,  and  against any and all Persons
 claiming  the  property  sold or any part  thereof  under,  by or  through  the
 Company, its successors or assigns.

                  SECTION 5.5. EFFECT OF DISCONTINUANCE OF PROCEEDINGS.  IN case
 the Collateral  Agent shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Deed
 of Trust by foreclosure,  sale, entry or otherwise,  and such proceedings shall
 have been discontinued  through written notice to the Company by the Collateral
 Agent or shall have been determined adversely,  then and in every such case the
 Company and the  Collateral  Agent shall each be restored to its  position  and
 rights hereunder,  except with respect to any rights  specifically  denied in a
 proceeding which was adversely determined, as they existed immediately prior to
 the  commencement of such  proceedings  with respect to the property subject to
 the Lien and first perfected security interest of this Deed of Trust.

                  SECTION 5.6. DELAY OR OMISSION NOT A WAIVER. No delay, failure
 or omission of the Collateral Agent to exercise any right or power arising from
 any Event of Default  on the part of the  Company  shall  exhaust or impair any
 such right or power or prevent  its  exercise  during the  continuance  of such
 Event of  Default.  No  waiver  by the  Collateral  Agent of any such  Event of
 Default, whether such waiver be full or partial, shall extend to or be taken to
 affect any  subsequent  Event of  Default,  or to impair  the rights  resulting
 therefrom,  except as may be  otherwise  provided  herein.  No right,  power or
 remedy  hereunder  is intended to be  exclusive  of any other  right,  power or
 remedy but each and every  right,  power or remedy shall be  cumulative  and in
 addition to any and every  other  right,  power or remedy  given  hereunder  or
 otherwise existing. Nor shall the giving, taking or enforcement OF any other or
 additional security, collateral or guaranty for the payment of the indebtedness
 secured  under  this Deed of Trust  operate to  prejudice,  waive or affect the
 security of this Deed of Trust or any rights, powers or remedies hereunder; nor
 shall the  Collateral  Agent be required  to first look to,  enforce or exhaust
 such other or additional security, collateral or guaranties.

                  SECTION 5.7. COSTS AND EXPENSES OF FORECLOSURE. In any suit to
 foreclose the Lien or first perfected  security  interest hereon there shall be
 allowed and included as additional  Secured  Obligations in the decree for sale
 all  expenditures and expenses which may be paid or incurred by or on behalf of
 the Collateral  Agent and Trustee for reasonable  attorney's  fees,  reasonable
 appraiser's  fees,  outlays for documentary and expert  evidence,  stenographic
 charges, publication costs and costs (which may be estimated as the items to be
 expended  after the entry of the decree) of  procuring  all such  abstracts  of
 title, title searches and examination, guarantee policies, and similar data and
 assurances  with respect to title as the Collateral  Agent and Trustee may deem
 to be reasonably  necessary  either to prosecute any  foreclosure  action or to
 evidence to


                                      -31-


<PAGE>





 the bidder at any sale pursuant  thereto the true  condition of the title to or
 the value of the Collateral,  all of which expenditures shall become additional
 Secured  Obligations  which the Company  agrees to pay and all of such shall be
 immediately due and payable with interest  thereon from the date of expenditure
 until paid at the Advance Overdue Rate.

                  SECTION  5.8.  NOTES TO  BECOME  DUE UPON  SALE BY  COLLATERAL
 AGENT. Upon any sale under or by virtue of this Deed of Trust, whether pursuant
 to foreclosure,  power of sale or otherwise, the entire unpaid principal amount
 of the Notes  shall,  unless  the  Collateral  Agent  shall  expressly  declare
 otherwise or if not previously declared due and payable, immediately become due
 and payable,  together  with  interest  accrued  thereon and Make Whole Premium
 and/or fees, if any, and all other indebtedness which this Deed of Trust by its
 terms secures,  anything contrary in this Deed of Trust, the Notes or any other
 instrument securing the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding.

                  SECTION 5.9.  REMEDIES  SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW. ALL rights,
 remedies, and powers provided by this SECTION 5 entitled "Defaults and Remedies
 Therefor"  may be exercised  only to the extent that the exercise  thereof does
 not violate any applicable provisions of law, and all of the provisions of this
 Section are intended to be subject to all  applicable  mandatory  provisions of
 law which may be controlling and to be limited to the extent  necessary so that
 they will not render this Deed of Trust invalid, unenforceable, or not entitled
 to be recorded,  registered,  or filed under the  provisions of any  applicable
 law.

the occurrence of the preceding sentence, or otherwise pursuant to the terms and
provisions of the  Intercreditor  and Agency  Agreement,  the  Collateral  Agent
shall, upon the request and at the expense of the Company, forthwith release all
its liens and security interests hereunder by, including but not limited to, the

release of the Deed of Trust of record.

                 SECTION 6.6.  COUNTERPARTS. This Deed of Trust may be executed,

                 SECTION  6.7.  AGENCY.  Each  holder  of  the  Notes,  by its
execution and delivery of the Intercreditor  and Agency Agreement,  appoints and
authorizes  the  Trustee and  Collateral  Agent to hold the lien of this Deed of
Trust on the  Collateral  for the equal and ratable  benefit and security of all
holders of the Notes, without preference, priority or distinction of any thereof
or any other by reason of  difference  in time of issuance,  sale or delivery of
the Notes to such  holders.  The  Collateral  Agent  shall take such  actions in
respect of the Collateral (including actions after the occurrence of an Event of
Default)  as  are  delegated  to  the  Collateral  Agent  by  the  terms  of the
Intercreditor and Agency Agreement.

                  SECTION 6.8.  SUBSTITUTE  TRUSTEE.  Trustee  shall be under no
 duty to take any action hereunder except as expressly required or by law, or to
 perform any act which would  involve  Trustee in any expense or liability or to

 Trustee's  reasonable  satisfaction.  Trustee,  by  acceptance  of this Deed of
 Trust,  covenants  to perform  and  fulfill the trusts  herein  created,  being
 liable,  however,  only for gross negligence or willful misconduct,  and hereby
 waives any statutory fee and agrees to accept reasonable compensation,  in lieu
 thereof,  for any  services  rendered by Trustee in  accordance  with the terms
 hereof.  Trustee may resign at any time upon giving thirty (30) days' notice to
 Company and to Collateral Agent.  Collateral Agent may in its sole and absolute
 discretion and with or without cause remove Trustee at any time or from time to
 time and select a

                                      -33-


<PAGE>





 successor trustee. In the event of the death, removal, resignation,  refusal to
 act, or inability to act of Trustee, or in its sole and absolute discretion for
 any  reason  whatsoever  Collateral  Agent  may,  without  notice  and  without
 specifying any reason  therefor and without  applying to any court,  select and
 appoint a successor  trustee,  by an instrument  recorded wherever this Deed of
 Trust is recorded and all powers  rights,  duties and authority of Trustee,  as
 aforesaid,  shall  thereupon  become  vested  in  such  successor  and  without
 conveyance of the  Collateral,  the successor  trustee shall succeed to all the
 title,  powers, and duties conferred upon Trustee herein and by applicable laws
 as if the  successor  had been named Trustee at the time this Deed of Trust was
 recorded.  Such  substitute  trustee shall not be required to give bond for the
 faithful  performance of the duties of Trustee  hereunder unless required to do
 so by Collateral Agent. Company shall pay all costs, fees and expenses incurred
 by Trustee and Trustee's  agents and counsel in connection with the performance
 by Trustee of Trustee's duties hereunder and all such costs,  fees and expenses
 shall be secured by this Deed of Trust.

                  SECTION  6.9.  GOVERNING  LAW.  This Deed of Trust shall be
construed  in  accordance  with and  governed by the laws and decisions of the

of Trust.

                  SECTION  6.11.  FUTURE  ADVANCES.  At all times,  this Deed of
 Trust  secures as part of the  Secured  Obligations  the payment of any and all
 loan  commissions,   service  charges,  liquidated  damages,  attorney's  fees,
 expenses  and  advances  due to or  incurred  by the  Collateral  Agent and the
 Trustee in connection with the Secured Obligations,  all in accordance with the
 Notes, this Deed of Trust, the Amended and Restated Note Agreements, the Credit
 Agreement  the  Intercreditor  and  Agency  Agreement  and any of the  Security
 Documents,  together with such future or additional  advances as may be made by
 the  Collateral  Agent or the holder  hereof,  at its  exclusive  option to the
 Company  or its  successors  or  assigns  in title,  for any  purpose  provided
 hereunder,  PROVIDED that all such advances are made within twenty years of the
 date of this Deed of Trust.

                 SECTION  6.12.  WAIVER  OF  JURY  TRIAL.  The  Company  and the
Collateral Agent hereby knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally waive the right
to trial by jury in respect of any  litigation  based  hereon,  arising  out of,
under or in connection  with this Deed of Trust or any other  Security  Document
contemplated  to be executed in connection  herewith,  or any course of conduct,
course of  dealings,  statements  (whether  verbal or written) or acts of either
party, or any exercise of any party of their  respective  rights under this Deed
of Trust or any such Security  Document.  The Company hereby  acknowledges  that
this  waiver  of jury  trial is a  material  inducement  to the  Noteholders  in
extending  credit to the Company,  that the Noteholders  would not have extended
credit  without  this  waiver  of jury  trial  and that the  Company  has had an
opportunity  to consult with an attorney in connection  with this waiver of jury
trial and understands the legal effect of this waiver.

                 SECTION  6.13.  SPECIAL  CALIFORNIA   PROVISIONS.   The  terms,
conditions  and  provisions of this Section 6.13, if any,  shall apply solely to
the portion of the security herein  described which is located in California and
shall govern,  control and take  precedence  with respect to such portion of the
security:


                                      -34-


<PAGE>





                  (a) The  provisions of this Deed of Trust shall remain in full
 force and effect  notwithstanding (i) any release of Company from any liability
 with respect to the Secured  Obligations;  or (ii) any release or subordination
 of any real or personal  property now or hereafter held by Collateral  Agent as
 security for the performance of the Secured Obligations;

                  (b) Company hereby waives all rights and defenses that Company
 may have because any of Company's debt is secured by real property. This means,
 among other things: (i) Collateral Agent may collect from Company without first
 foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by Company; and
 (ii) if Collateral Agent forecloses on any real property  collateral pledged by
 Company  (A) the amount of debt may be reduced  only by the price for which the
 collateral is sold at the  foreclosure  sale,  even if the  collateral is worth
 more than the sale price,  and (B)  Collateral  Agent may COLLECT  FROM COMPANY
 even if Collateral Agent, by foreclosing on the real property  collateral,  has
 destroyed any right  Company may have to collect from any other party.  This is
 an unconditional and irrevocable  waiver of any rights and defenses Company may
 have  because  Company's  debt is secured by real  property.  These  rights and
 defenses  include,  but are not limited  to, any rights or defenses  based upon
 Section 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.

                  (c) In the case of a power of sale foreclosure under this Deed
 of Trust or any other deed of trust entered into by the parties as security for
 the Secured Obligations,  the fair market value of the real property collateral
 shall be  conclusively  deemed to be the  amount of the  successful  bid at the
 foreclosure sale. Company waives any rights or benefits it may now or hereafter
 have to a fair value hearing under Section 580a of the California Code of Civil
 Procedure.  Collateral  Agent shall have absolutely no obligation to make a bid
 at any  foreclosure  sale,  but rather may make no bid or bid any amount  which
 Collateral Agent, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.

                 (d) Company  warrants and  represents to Collateral  Agent that
(i) it now has or will continue to have full and complete  access to any and all
information concerning the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements
referred  to  therein,  the value of the assets  owned or to be  acquired by any
Subsidiary Guarantor under the Operative Agreements,  their financial status and
their respective  ability to pay and perform their respective  obligations under
the Operative  Agreements;  and (ii) Company has reviewed and approved copies of
the Operative  Agreements and is fully informed of the remedies Collateral Agent
may pursue, with or without notice to Company, in the event of default under the
Operative Agreements. Company shall keep fully informed as to all aspects of the
financial condition of any Subsidiary  Guarantor under the Operative  Agreements
and  the  performance  of  their  respective  obligations  under  the  Operative
Agreements.

                  (e) Company  agrees that  Collateral  Agent may  exercise  any
 right or remedy hereunder or under any of the Operative  Agreements without the
 necessity of resorting to or exhausting any security or collateral  conveyed or
 assigned by Company or any of the  Subsidiary  Guarantors  under the  Operative
 Agreements or any guarantor of any of the Secured  Obligations.  Company hereby
 waives any right it may now or hereafter  have to require  Collateral  Agent to
 proceed  against any Subsidiary  Guarantor under the Operative  Agreements,  to
 proceed against any guarantor of any of the Secured  Obligations,  to foreclose
 any lien on any real or personal  property  collateral  conveyed or assigned to
 Collateral Agent by Company or any Subsidiary



                                      -35-


<PAGE>





 Guarantor under the Operative Agreements, to exercise any right or remedy under
 the  Operative  Agreements,  to draw  upon  any  letter  of  credit  issued  in
 connection with any of the Secured  Obligations,  or to pursue any other remedy
 or to enforce any other right under the Operative Agreements.

                  (f) Company and Collateral  Agent intend that the relationship
 created hereunder be solely that of "debtor" and "creditor".  Nothing herein is
 intended to create a joint venture,  partnership,  tenancy- in-common, or joint
 tenancy  relationship  between  Company  and  Collateral  Agent  nor  to  grant
 Collateral Agent any interest in the Collateral other than that of beneficiary,
 secured party or lender. '

                  (g)  This  Deed  of  Trust  may  not  be  modified,   amended,
 discharged  or waived in whole or in part  except by an  agreement  in  writing
 signed by Company and  Collateral  Agent.  The  covenants of this Deed of Trust
 shall RUN WITH THE LAND AND SHALL BIND  COMPANY  and the  heirs,  distributees,
 personal representatives, successors and assigns of Company and all present and
 subsequent  encumbrancers,  lessees and sublessees of any of the Collateral and
 shall inure to the benefit of Collateral  Agent and its respective  successors,
 assigns and endorsees.

                  (h) Whenever  possible,  each  provision of this Deed of Trust
 shall  be  interpreted  in such  manner  as to be  effective  and  valid  under
 applicable  law, but if any provision of this Deed of Trust shall be prohibited
 by or invalid under  applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the
 extent of such  prohibition or invalidity,  without  invalidating the remaining
 provisions of this Deed of Trust. Nothing in this Deed of Trust or in any other
 Operative  Agreements  shall  require  Company to pay, or  Collateral  Agent to
 accept,  interest in an amount which would subject  Collateral Agent to penalty
 under  applicable  law.  In the event  that the  payment  of any  interest  due
 hereunder or under any of the other Operative  Agreements or a payment which is
 deemed  interest,  exceeds the  maximum  amount  payable as interest  under the
 applicable  usury laws, such excess amount shall be applied to the reduction of
 the  Indebtedness,  and  upon  payment  in full of the  Indebtedness,  shall be
 applied to the performance of the Obligations,  and upon performance in full of
 the  Obligations,  shall be deemed to be a payment made by mistake and shall be
 refunded to Company.

                  (i) Any consent or approval by Collateral  Agent in any single
instance  shall not be deemed or construed to be Collateral  Agent's  consent or
approval in any like matter  arising at a  subsequent  date,  and the failure of
Collateral  Agent to promptly  exercise  any right,  power,  remedy,  consent or
approval  provided  herein or at law or in equity  shall  not  constitute  or be
construed as a waiver of the same nor shall  Collateral  Agent be stopped  from
exercising such right, power,  remedy,  consent or approval at a later date. Any
consent or approval requested of and granted by Collateral Agent pursuant hereto
shall be  narrowly  construed  to be  applicable  only to Company and the matter
identified  in such  consent or  approval  and no third  party  shall  claim any
benefit by reason thereof, other than the party to whom such consent or approval
was given or  reasonably  intended to benefit,  and any such consent or approval
shall not be deemed to  constitute  Collateral  Agent a venturer or partner with
Company nor shall privity of contract be presumed to have been  established with
any such third party.

                  It is the desire and intention of the parties hereto that this
Deed of Trust  and the lien  hereof  do not  merge  in fee  simple  title to the
Collateral. It is hereby understood and agreed



                                      -36-


<PAGE>





 that should Collateral Agent acquire any additional or other interests in or to
 the  Collateral or the ownership  thereof,  then,  unless a contrary  intent is
 manifested by  Collateral  Agent as evidenced by an  appropriate  document duly
 recorded,  this Deed of Trust and the lien hereof shall not merge in such other
 or additional interests in or to the Collateral,  toward the end that this Deed
 of  Trust  may be  foreclosed  as if  owned  by a  stranger  to said  other  or
 additional interests.

                  (j) By accepting delivery of any item required to be observed,
 performed or fulfilled or to be given to Collateral Agent pursuant to this Deed
 of Trust and the other Operative Agreements, including, but not limited to, any
 officer's  certificate,  balance  sheet,  statement of profit and loss or other
 financial statement,  survey,  appraisal or insurance policy,  Collateral Agent
 shall  not  be  deemed  to  have  warranted,  consented  to,  or  affirmed  the
 sufficiency,  legality,  effectiveness  or legal effect of the same,  or of any
 term,  provision or condition thereof,  and such acceptance of delivery thereof
 shall not be or constitute any warranty,  consent or  affirmation  with respect
 thereto by Collateral Agent.

                  (k) The  parties  hereto  agree  that  each of them,  upon the
 request of the other party,  shall execute and deliver such further  documents,
 instruments  or  agreements  and shall  take such  further  action  that may be
 necessary or  appropriate  to effectuate  the purposes of this Deed of Trust or
 that may be necessary or  appropriate  to comply with the  requirements  of the
 Uniform Commercial Code.

                  COMPANY  PLEASE  NOTE:  UPON  THE  OCCURRENCE  OF  A  DEFAULT,
 CALIFORNIA  PROCEDURE PERMITS THE TRUSTEE TO SELL THE COLLATERAL AT A SALE HELD
 WITHOUT  SUPERVISION  BY ANY COURT AFTER  EXPIRATION OF A PERIOD  PRESCRIBED BY
 LAW.  UNLESS YOU  PROVIDE AN ADDRESS  FOR THE GIVING OF NOTICE,  YOU MAY NOT BE
 ENTITLED TO NOTICE OF THE  COMMENCEMENT  OF SALE  PROCEEDINGS.  BY EXECUTION OF
 THIS DEED OF TRUST,  YOU CONSENT TO SUCH PROCEDURE.  COLLATERAL AGENT URGES YOU
 TO GIVE  PROMPT  NOTICE OF ANY CHANGE IN YOUR  ADDRESS SO THAT YOU MAY  RECEIVE
 PROMPTLY ANY NOTICE GIVEN PURSUANT TO THIS DEED OF TRUST.

                        FORM OF ENVIRONMENTAL INDEMNITY

         This ENVIRONMENTAL  INDEMNITY (this "INDEMNITY") is entered into as of
April 19, 2002,  by THE CHALONE WINE GROUP,  LTD. (the  "COMPANY"),  EDNA VALLEY
VINEYARD ("EDNA"),  CANOE RIDGE VINEYARD,  L.L.C.  ("CANOE LLC"), SHW EQUITY CO.
("SHW"),  STATON HILLS WINERY COMPANY LIMITED ("STATON") and CANOE RIDGE WINERY,
INC.   ("CANOE   WINERY")  (each  an   "INDEMNITOR"   and,   collectively,   the
"INDEMNITORS")  to and  for the  benefit  of each  of the  Purchasers  named  in
Schedule A to the Note Purchase Agreement.

The Purchasers and the Company are parties to that certain  Amended and Restated
Note  Purchase  Agreement  dated as of April  19,  2002 (as  amended,  restated,
modified,  supplemented,  renewed  or  extended  from  time to time,  the  "NOTE
PURCHASE  AGREEMENT").  Edna,  Canoe LLC and SHW,  are each  parties to separate
Amended and Restated  Guaranty  Agreements  dated as of April 19, 2002 ("AMENDED
AND  RESTATED  GUARANTEES")  and Canoe  Winery and  Staton  are each  parties to
separate Guaranty  Agreements dated as of April 19, 2002 ("ORIGINAL  GUARANTEES"
and together with the Amended and Restated  Guarantees,  the  "GUARANTEES"),  in
favor of the Purchasers  pursuant to which they have  guaranteed the payment and
performance of the Company's  obligations  under and in connection with the Note
Purchase Agreement as provided in such Guarantees.

The  obligations  of the  Company  and the  Guarantors  under the Note  Purchase
Agreement,  the  Guarantees  and the other Loan  Documents are secured by, among
other  things,  certain  deeds of trust  and  mortgages  covering  the  premises
described on EXHIBIT A hereto and the  improvements  now or  hereafter  existing
thereon (such  premises and  improvements,  the  "PROPERTY").

It is a condition  precedent to the  borrowings and issuances of Notes under the
Note Purchase  Agreement  that the  Indemnitors  indemnify the Purchasers as set
forth  herein.  This  Indemnity is secured by the personal  property  Collateral
covered by the Collateral Documents, but not by the Property.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration of the foregoing and other valuable
consideration,  the receipt and  sufficiency  of which are hereby  acknowledged,
each  Indemnitor  agrees as follows:

DEFINITIONS.

"ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS" means all federal, state and local environmental, health or
safety  laws,  regulations,   ordinances,   standards,  policies,  requirements,
rulings, judgments, and rules of common law (including,  without limitation, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as
amended, 42 U.S.C. ss.9601 ET SEQ., the Hazardous Materials  Transportation Act,
49 U.S.C.ss.1802, ET SEQ., The


                                   EXHIBIT B
                        (to the Note Purchase Agreement)

<PAGE>

Resource  Conservation  and Recovery Act, 42  U.S.C.ss.6901  ET SEQ.,  the Toxic
Substance  Control Act of 1976, as amended,  15 U.S.C.ss.2601 ET SEQ., the Clean
Water Act,  33  U.S.C.ss.466  et seq.,  as  amended,  and the Clean Air Act,  42
U.S.C.ss.7401 ET SEQ.).

"HAZARDOUS  SUBSTANCES"  means  any toxic or  hazardous  wastes,  pollutants  or
substances,  including,  without limitation,  asbestos, PCBs, petroleum products
and  by-products,  substances  defined or listed as  "hazardous  substances"  or
"toxic  substances" or similarly  identified in or pursuant to any Environmental
Laws and any hazardous or toxic substance or pollutant regulated under any other
applicable federal, state or local laws.

Capitalized  terms used herein  (including  in the preamble and recitals of this
Indemnity) and not otherwise  defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to
such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement.

INDEMNIFICATION.  The  Indemnitors,  jointly  and  severally,  hereby  agree  to
indemnify and hold the Purchasers harmless from and against, and shall reimburse
the  Purchasers  for, any and all loss,  claim,  liability,  damage,  injunctive
relief,  injuries to person,  property,  collateral or natural resources,  cost,
expense (including,  without limitation,  reasonable fees and allocated costs of
internal and external  counsel,  expert  witnesses  and other  professionals  or
experts  advising  the  Purchasers),  action  or cause  of  action,  arising  in
connection with the release or presence of any Hazardous  Substance at or on any
or all of the Property, whether foreseeable or unforeseeable,  regardless of the
source of such  release  or when  such  release  occurred  or such  presence  is
discovered.  The foregoing indemnity includes, without limitation, (a) all costs
in law or in equity of removal,  remediation  of any kind,  and disposal of such
Hazardous  Substances,  (b) all cost of  determining  whether  any or all of the
Property  is in  compliance,  and  causing  any or all of the  Property to be in
compliance,  with all applicable  Environmental  Laws, (c) all costs  associated
with claims for damages to persons, property, or natural resources, and (d) each
Purchaser's  reasonable  attorneys'  fees  (including  the  allocated  costs  of
internal legal counsel) and consultants' fees and court costs.

SECURITY.  This Indemnity is secured by the personal property Collateral covered
by the Collateral  Documents,  but not by the Property.  The  obligations of the
Indemnitors  under this Indemnity  shall survive the  foreclosure of any Deed of
Trust and satisfaction of the other Obligations, and shall be independent of any
other Obligations. The rights of the Purchasers under this Indemnity shall be in
addition to any other rights and remedies of the Purchasers  under any Guaranty,
the Note  Purchase  Agreement  or any other Loan  Document  or at law or equity.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indemnity or any other instrument or
agreement to the contrary,  the  Purchasers  shall at all times have the maximum
rights and remedies  available at any time under any applicable law or equitable
principal of any state (including,  without limitation, under Chapter 70.105D of
the  Revised  Code  of  Washington,  or any  other  similar  laws  or  equitable
principals of any state).

SURVIVAL.  If any  Purchaser  takes title to any or all of the Property  through
foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure of any or all of the Deeds of Trust,
this Indemnity shall not apply to any loss or costs incurred by any Purchaser as
a direct result of affirmative actions of any Purchaser as

                                       B-2

<PAGE>

owner and  operator of any or all such  Property  after  Purchaser  has acquired
title to any or all such  Property,  which actions are the sole and direct cause
of damage  resulting from the  introduction  and initial  release of a Hazardous
Substance at any or all such Property;  provided,  however, this Indemnity shall
otherwise remain in full force and effect,  including,  without limitation,  (a)
with respect to Hazardous  Substances  which are discovered at any or all of the
Property  by any  Purchaser  or any other  Person  after the date any  Purchaser
acquires  title  to any or all  such  Property,  but  which  were  not  actually
introduced at any or all such Property by any Purchaser, and (b) with respect to
the  continuing  migration  or release  of any  Hazardous  Substance  previously
introduced  at any or all of the  Property.  This  Indemnity  is  intended to be
operable under 42 U.S.C. ss.9607(e)(1) and any successor section thereof.

INTEREST.  Any amount  claimed  hereunder by the  Purchasers and not paid by the
Indemnitors within thirty (30) days after written demand from any Purchaser with
an explanation of the amounts  claimed,  shall bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to the highest interest rate set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement.

SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Indemnity shall inure to the benefit of each of the
Purchasers and each  Purchaser's  successors  and assigns,  and shall be binding
upon each Indemnitor's  successors and assigns,  provided that no Indemnitor may
assign its obligations under this Indemnity without the prior written consent of
the Purchasers.

NO WAIVER;  CONSENTS. Each waiver hereunder by the Purchasers must be in writing
and signed by the  Purchasers,  and no waiver shall be construed as a continuing
waiver.  No waiver shall be implied from any delay or failure by the  Purchasers
to take  action on account  of any  default  of any  Indemnitor.  Consent by the
Purchasers to any act or omission by any Indemnitor  shall not be construed as a
consent  to any  other or  subsequent  act or  omission  or as a  waiver  of the
requirement  for the  Purchasers'  consent to be obtained in any future or other
instance.

GOVERNING LAW. This Indemnity shall be governed and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York.

JOINT AND SEVERAL  OBLIGATIONS.  If this  Indemnity is executed by more than one
person or entity, the liability of the undersigned  hereunder shall be joint and
several.

COSTS,  EXPENSES AND  ATTORNEYS'  FEES. The  Indemnitors  agree to reimburse the
Purchasers for all reasonable costs,  out-of-pocket expenses and attorneys' fees
(including the allocated  costs of internal legal counsel)  expended or incurred
by each Purchaser in preparation of or enforcing (or attempted  enforcement  of)
this  Indemnity,  in actions for  declaratory  relief in any way related to this
Indemnity,  or in collecting any sum which becomes due from an Indemnitor to the
Purchasers under this Indemnity.

NOTICES.  Any notices,  requests or responses to be made or to be given pursuant
to the  terms  of this  Indemnity  shall  be made in  accordance  with  the Note
Purchase Agreement.

                                      B-3

<PAGE>

SEVERABILITY.  Whenever  possible,  each  provision of this  Indemnity  shall be
interpreted  in such manner as to be  effective  and valid under all  applicable
laws and  regulations.  If,  however,  any provision of this Indemnity  shall be
prohibited by or invalid  under any such law or regulation in any  jurisdiction,
it shall, as to such jurisdiction,  be deemed modified to conform to the minimum
requirements  of such law or regulation,  or, if for any reason it is not deemed
so  modified,  it shall be  ineffective  and invalid  only to the extent of such
prohibition  or invalidity  without  affecting the remaining  provisions of this
Indemnity  or the  validity  or  effectiveness  of such  provision  in any other
jurisdiction.

COUNTERPARTS. This Indemnity may be executed in two or more counterparts, and by
different  parties on separate  counterparts,  each of which shall constitute an
original,  but all of which,  when  taken  together,  shall  constitute  but one
agreement.

                                   EXHIBIT C
                          (to Note Purchase Agreement)

<PAGE>

                    PATENT AND TRADEMARK SECURITY AGREEMENT

         THIS PATENT AND TRADEMARK SECURITY AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"),  dated

corporation (the "Borrower"), Canoe Ridge Vineyard, L.L.C., a Washington limited
liability company,  SHW Equity Co., a Washington  corporation,  and Staton Hills
Winery Company Limited, a Washington  corporation,  Canoe Ridge Winery,  Inc., a
Washington  corporation  (each a "Grantor" and together  with the Borrower,  the
"Grantors"), and Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A., "Rabobank
International", New York Branch ("Rabobank"), as collateral agent for the Agent,
the  Lenders  and the  Noteholders  referred  to below  (in such  capacity,  the
"Collateral Agent").

         The Borrower,  certain  lenders and  Rabobank,  as issuer of letters of
credit (in such capacity,  the "Issuing  Lender"),  as swingline lender (in such
capacity, the "Swingline Lender") and as administrative agent (in such capacity,
the "Agent"),  are parties to a Credit  Agreement dated as of April 19, 2002 (as
amended,  restated,  modified,  supplemented,  renewed or extended  from time to
time, the "Credit Agreement")  pursuant to which the Lenders have made available
to the Borrower a revolving credit facility and term loan facility,  as provided
therein.

         The  Borrower  and  certain  noteholders  are parties to an Amended and
Restated  Note  Purchase  Agreement  dated as of  April  19,  2002 (as  amended,
restated,  modified,  supplemented,  renewed or extended from time to time,  the
"Note  Agreement")  pursuant to which the  Borrower  and such  noteholders  have
amended  and  restated  the  $30,000,000   aggregate  principal  amount  of  the
Borrower's Senior  Guaranteed  Notes,  Series A, B and C, Due September 15, 2010
originally   issued  and  sold  to  such   noteholders  on  September  15,  2000
(collectively, the "Private Placement Notes"), as provided therein.

         The Grantors  have also entered into a Security  Agreement  dated as of
April  19,  2002 (as  amended,  restated,  modified,  supplemented,  renewed  or
extended  from time to time,  the "Security  Agreement")  pursuant to which each
Grantor has granted a security  interest in  substantially  all of its  personal
property in favor of the Collateral Agent, for itself and for the benefit of the
Agent, the Lenders and the Noteholders.

         It is a  condition  precedent  to the  borrowings  and the  issuance of
letters of credit under the Credit  Agreement and the amendment and  restatement
of the  Private  Placement  Notes as provided  in the Note  Agreement  that each
Grantor enter into this Agreement and grant to the Collateral  Agent, for itself
and for the ratable benefit of the Agent, the Lenders and the  Noteholders,  the
security  interests  hereinafter  provided  to  secure  the  obligations  of the
Grantors as described below.

         The Collateral  Agent,  the Agent, the Lenders,  the  Noteholders,  the
Grantors and certain of their affiliates have entered into an Intercreditor  and
Collateral  Agency  Agreement dated as of April 19, 2002 (as amended,  restated,
supplemented  or  otherwise  modified  from  time to  time,  the  "Intercreditor
Agreement")  pursuant to which,  among other things, the Lenders and Noteholders
have agreed (i) to the  appointment of Rabobank as Collateral  Agent and (ii) to
the relative  priority of their  security  interests in the  Collateral  and the
manner and order in which

<PAGE>

certain rights and remedies of the Lenders and Noteholders may be exercised, all

proceeding  with respect to the  Collateral,  (B) to assert or retain any rights

Agent to use the  Collateral,  to grant or issue any exclusive or  non-exclusive
license  with  respect to any  Collateral,  and to assign,  convey or  otherwise

event  shall  the  Collateral  Agent  have the  unilateral  power,  prior to the
occurrence  of an Event of  Default,  to  assign  any of the  Collateral  to any
Person,  including itself,  without the Grantor's written consent. The foregoing
power of attorney is coupled  with an interest  and  irrevocable  so long as the
Lenders have any Commitments or the Secured  Obligations  have not been paid and
performed in full. Each Grantor hereby ratifies, to the extent permitted by law,
all that the Collateral Agent shall lawfully and in good faith do or cause to be
done by virtue of and in compliance with this Section 7.

have no duty or  liability  to exercise or preserve  any rights,  privileges  or
powers  pertaining to the Collateral.

         SECTION 10 REMEDIES.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
any Event of Default,  the Collateral Agent shall have, in addition to all other
rights and remedies granted to it in this Agreement, the Credit Agreement or any

royalty free licenses,  to the extent  permitted by law, for any Collateral that
is  reasonably  necessary  to permit the  exercise  of any of the Agent's or the
Collateral  Agent's  rights or remedies upon or after the occurrence of an Event
of Default.  In addition to and without limiting any of the foregoing,  upon the
occurrence  and during the  continuance  of an Event of Default,  the Collateral

the Collateral Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy,
power or privilege  hereunder shall operate as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall any
single  or  partial  exercise  of any such  right,  remedy,  power or  privilege
preclude  any other or further  exercise  thereof or the  exercise  of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege.  The rights and remedies under this Agreement
are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies,  powers and privileges
that may otherwise be available to the Agent.

         SECTION 13 BINDING  EFFECT.  This Agreement  shall be binding upon, and
shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the Collateral  Agent,  the
Agent,  the Lenders,  the  Noteholders  and the  Grantors  and their  respective

CONSTRUED  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH,  THE LAW OF THE  STATE OF NEW  YORK,  EXCEPT AS
REQUIRED  BY  MANDATORY  PROVISIONS  OF LAW AND TO THE  EXTENT THE  VALIDITY  OR
PERFECTION OF THE SECURITY INTERESTS  HEREUNDER,  OR THE REMEDIES HEREUNDER,  IN
RESPECT OF ANY COLLATERAL  ARE GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF A JURISDICTION  OTHER THAN
NEW YORK.

         SECTION 15 ENTIRE  AGREEMENT;  AMENDMENT.  This Agreement  contains the
entire  agreement of the parties with respect to the subject  matter  hereof and
shall not be amended except by the written  agreement of the parties as provided

Agreement  shall be prohibited by or invalid under any such law or regulation in
any  jurisdiction,  it shall,  as to such  jurisdiction,  be deemed  modified to
conform to the minimum  requirements  of such law or regulation,  or, if for any
reason it is not deemed so modified, it shall be ineffective and invalid only to
the extent of such  prohibition  or invalidity  without  affecting the remaining
provisions of this Agreement, or the validity or effectiveness of such provision
in any other jurisdiction.

         SECTION 17  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate  counterparts,  each

                                   EXHIBIT D
                          (to Note Purchase Agreement)

<PAGE>

         THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of April 19, 2002,
is made among The Chalone  Wine  Group,  Ltd.,  a  California  corporation  (the
"Borrower"),  Canoe Ridge  Vineyard,  L.L.C.,  a  Washington  limited  liability
company  ("Canoe  Ridge"),  SHW Equity Co., a  Washington  corporation  ("SHW"),
Staton Hills Winery Company Limited, a Washington  corporation ("Staton Hills"),
Canoe Ridge Winery, Inc. a Washington  corporation ("CRW") (the Borrower,  Canoe
Ridge, CRW, SHW and Staton Hills, individually a "Debtor" and collectively,  the
"Debtors") and Cooperatieve Centrale  Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank  B.A., "Rabobank
International", New York Branch ("Rabobank"), as Collateral Agent.

         The Borrower,  certain  lenders and  Rabobank,  as issuer of letters of

capacity, the "Swingline Lender") and as administrative agent (in such capacity,
the "Agent"),  are parties to a Credit  Agreement dated as of April 19, 2002 (as
amended,  restated,  modified,  supplemented,  renewed or extended  from time to
time, the "Credit Agreement")  pursuant to which the Lenders have made available
to the Borrower a revolving credit facility and term loan facility,  as provided
therein.

         The Borrower is also party to those  separate and several Note Purchase
Agreements,  each dated as of September  15, 2000  (collectively,  the "Original
Note  Agreements"),  entered  into by the Borrower  with each of the  Purchasers
listed on  Schedule  A  thereto,  under and  pursuant  to which the  Noteholders
purchased  $5,000,000 8.75% Senior Guaranteed Notes, Series A, due September 15,
2010,  $10,000,000 Senior Guaranteed Notes, Series B, due September 15, 2010 and
$15,000,000   Senior  Guaranteed  Notes,   Series  C,  due  September  15,  2010
(collectively,  the "Original  Senior Notes") of the Borrower.  The Borrower has
requested that the Noteholders  amend and restate the Original Note  Agreements,
amend and restate the Original Senior Notes,  and the Noteholders are willing to
enter  into and  execute  those  certain  Amended  and  Restated  Note  Purchase
Agreements  each dated  April 19,  2002 (as the same may  hereafter  be amended,
modified  and/or  restated  from time to time,  collectively,  the  "Amended and
Restated  Note  Agreement")  and are willing to amend and  restate the  Original
Senior  Notes  pursuant to the terms  thereof (as so amended,  the  "Amended and
Restated Senior Secured Notes").

         It is a  condition  precedent  to the  borrowings  and the  issuance of
letters of credit under the Credit  Agreement and the amendment and  restatement
of the  Original  Senior  Notes as provided in the  Amended  and  Restated  Note
Agreement and the Amended and Restated  Senior Notes that each Debtor enter into
this Agreement and grant to the Collateral Agent, for itself and for the ratable
benefit of the Agent,  the Lenders and the Noteholders,  the security  interests
hereinafter  provided  to secure the  obligations  of the  Debtors as  described
below.

         The Collateral  Agent, the Agent, the Lenders,  the Noteholders and the
Debtors have entered into an Intercreditor and Collateral Agency Agreement dated
as of April 19, 2002 (as amended,  restated,  supplemented or otherwise modified
from time to time, the "Intercreditor Agreement") pursuant to which, among other
things,  the  Lenders and  Noteholders  have  agreed (i) to the  appointment  of
Rabobank as Collateral Agent and (ii) to the relative priority of their security
interests in the Collateral and the manner and order in which certain rights and

exercises its rights  hereunder to collect Rights to Payment,  each Debtor shall
endeavor  in the first  instance  diligently  to collect  all  amounts due or to

drafts,  money  orders or other  forms of payment or  security  and  collect any
Proceeds of any Collateral;

         (iii) sign and endorse any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of
the Collateral, warehouse or storage receipts, drafts against customers or other
obligors,  assignments,  notices of  assignment,  verifications  and  notices to
customers or other obligors;

         (iv)  send  requests  for  verification  of Rights  to  Payment  to the
customers or other obligors of any Debtor;

         (v) contact, or direct the Debtors to contact,  all account debtors and
other  obligors on the Rights to Payment and instruct  such account  debtors and
other obligors to make all payments directly to the Collateral Agent;

         (vi) assert,  adjust,  sue for,  compromise or release any claims under

and the Collateral Agent's security interest therein; and

         (xiii) execute any and all such other documents and instruments, and do
any and all  acts  and  things  for and on  behalf  of the  Debtors,  which  the
Collateral  Agent may  reasonably  deem  necessary  or  advisable  to  maintain,
protect,  realize upon and preserve the Collateral  and the  Collateral  Agent's
security interest therein and to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement.

The Collateral  Agent agrees that,  except upon and during the continuance of an
Event of Default,  it shall not exercise  the power of  attorney,  or any rights
granted to the Collateral  Agent,  pursuant to clauses (ii) through (xiii).  The
foregoing  power of attorney is coupled with an interest and irrevocable so long
as the Lenders have any  Commitments  or the Secured  Obligations  have not been
paid and performed in full. Each Debtor hereby ratifies, to the extent permitted
by law,  all that the  Collateral  Agent shall  lawfully and in good faith do or
cause to be done by virtue of and in compliance with this Section 7.

         SECTION 8  COLLATERAL  AGENT  PERFORMANCE  OF DEBTOR  OBLIGATIONS.  The
Collateral Agent, the Agent or the Noteholders may perform or pay any obligation
which the Debtors have agreed to perform or pay under this Agreement upon notice
to the  Debtors,  if the Debtors  have failed to timely  perform or pay any such
obligation,  and each Debtor shall reimburse the Collateral  Agent, the Agent or
the  Noteholders,  as the case may be, on  demand  for any  amounts  paid by the
Collateral Agent, the Agent or the Noteholders,  as the case may be, pursuant to
this Section 8.

         SECTION 9 [Reserved.]

         SECTION 10 REMEDIES.

         (a)  Remedies.  Upon the  occurrence  of any Event of Default and while
such Event of  Default is  continuing,  the  Collateral  Agent  shall  have,  in
addition to all other rights and remedies  granted to it in this Agreement,  all
rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC and other  applicable laws.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Debtor agrees that:

         (i) The  Collateral  Agent may peaceably  and without  notice enter any
premises of any Debtor, take possession of any Collateral,  remove or dispose of
all or part of the


                                       17

<PAGE>

Collateral  on any  premises  of any  Debtor  or  elsewhere,  or, in the case of
Equipment, render it nonfunctional,  and otherwise collect, receive, appropriate
and realize  upon all or any part of the  Collateral,  and demand,  give receipt
for, settle, renew, extend, exchange,  compromise, adjust, or sue for all or any
part of the Collateral, as the Collateral Agent may determine.

         (ii) The Collateral Agent may require any Debtor to assemble all or any
part of the  Collateral and make it available to the  Collateral  Agent,  at any
place and time designated by the Collateral Agent.

         (iii) The  Collateral  Agent may use or  transfer  any of any  Debtor's
rights and interests in any Intellectual  Property  Collateral,  by license,  by
sublicense (to the extent permitted by an applicable  license) or otherwise,  on
such conditions and in such manner as the Collateral Agent may determine.

         (iv) The Collateral  Agent may secure the  appointment of a receiver of
the Collateral or any part thereof (to the extent and in the manner  provided by
applicable law).

         (v) The  Collateral  Agent may withdraw (or cause to be withdrawn)  any
and all funds from any Deposit Accounts or securities accounts.

         (vi) The  Collateral  Agent  may  sell,  resell,  lease,  use,  assign,
transfer  or  otherwise  dispose  of any or all of the  Collateral  in its  then
condition or following any  commercially  reasonable  preparation  or processing
(utilizing in connection therewith any of any Debtor's assets, without charge or
liability to the Collateral Agent therefor) at public or private sale, by one or
more contracts, in one or more parcels, at the same or different times, for cash
or credit or for future delivery  without  assumption of any credit risk, all as
the Collateral Agent deems advisable;  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such Debtor shall
be credited  with the net  proceeds of sale only when such  proceeds are finally
collected by the Collateral  Agent. The Collateral Agent and each of the Lenders
shall have the right upon any such public sale, and, to the extent  permitted by
law,  upon any such  private  sale,  to  purchase  the  whole or any part of the
Collateral so sold,  free of any right or equity of  redemption,  which right or
equity of redemption  each Debtor hereby  releases,  to the extent  permitted by
law.  The  Collateral  Agent shall give the Debtors such notice of any public or
private sale as may be required by the UCC or other  applicable law. Each Debtor
recognizes that the Collateral  Agent may be unable to make a public sale of any
or all of the  Investment  Property,  by reason  of  prohibitions  contained  in
applicable  securities  laws or otherwise,  and expressly  agrees that a private
sale to a restricted  group of purchasers  for investment and not with a view to
any distribution thereof shall be considered a commercially reasonable sale.

         (vii) Neither the Collateral  Agent,  the Agent, any Noteholder nor any
Lender shall have any obligation to clean up or otherwise prepare the Collateral
for sale.  The  Collateral  Agent has no  obligation  to attempt to satisfy  the
Secured Obligations by collecting them from any other Person liable for them and
the Collateral Agent may release, modify or waive any Collateral provided by any
other Person to secure any of the Secured Obligations, all without affecting the
Collateral Agent's, the Agent's, any Noteholder's or any Lender's rights against
any Debtor.  Each Debtor waives any right it may have to require the  Collateral
Agent,  the Agent,  any  Noteholder or any Lender to pursue any third Person for
any of the Secured Obligations.

The  Collateral  Agent may  comply  with any  applicable  state or  federal  law
requirements  in connection  with a disposition of the Collateral and compliance
will not be considered adversely to affect the commercial  reasonableness of any
sale of the  Collateral.  The Collateral  Agent may sell the Collateral  without
giving  any  warranties  as  to  the  Collateral.   The  Collateral   Agent  may
specifically  disclaim any warranties of title or the like.  This procedure will
not be considered adversely to affect the commercial  reasonableness of any sale
of the  Collateral.  If the Collateral  Agent sells any of the  Collateral  upon
credit,  the Debtors will be credited  only with  payments  actually made by the
purchaser,  received by the Collateral  Agent and applied to the indebtedness of
the purchaser.  In the event the purchaser fails to pay for the Collateral,  the
Collateral  Agent may resell the  Collateral  and the Debtors  shall be credited
with the  proceeds of the sale.

         (b)  LICENSE.  For the  purpose of  enabling  the  Collateral  Agent to
exercise  its  rights  and  remedies  under  this  Section  10 or  otherwise  in
connection  with this  Agreement,  each Debtor hereby  grants to the  Collateral
Agent an irrevocable,  non-exclusive and assignable license (exercisable without
payment or royalty or other  compensation  to the  Debtors)  to use,  license or
sublicense any Intellectual Property Collateral.

         (c) PROCEEDS ACCOUNT. To the extent that any of the Secured Obligations
may be contingent,  unmatured or unliquidated (including with respect to undrawn
amounts under the Letters of Credit) at such time as there may exist an Event of
Default,  the Collateral Agent may, at its election,  (i) retain the proceeds of
any sale,  collection,  disposition or other realization upon the Collateral (or
any  portion  thereof)  in a  special  purpose  non-interest-bearing  restricted
deposit  account  (the  "Proceeds   Account")  created  and  maintained  by  the
Collateral  Agent for such  purpose  (which shall  constitute a Deposit  Account
included  within the  Collateral  hereunder)  until such time as the  Collateral
Agent may elect to apply such  proceeds  to the  Secured  Obligations,  and each
Debtor agrees that such retention of such proceeds by the Collateral Agent shall
not be deemed  strict  foreclosure  with  respect  thereto;  (ii) in any  manner
elected by the  Collateral  Agent,  estimate the  liquidated  amount of any such
contingent,  unmatured  or  unliquidated  claims and apply the  proceeds  of the
Collateral  against  such  amount;  or (iii)  otherwise  proceed  in any  manner
permitted by applicable law. Each Debtor agrees that the Proceeds  Account shall
be a blocked  account  and that upon the  irrevocable  deposit of funds into the
Proceeds  Account,  the  Debtors  shall  not have any right of  withdrawal  with
respect to such funds.  Accordingly,  each Debtor  irrevocably  waives until the
termination  of this  Agreement in accordance  with Section 22 the right to make
any  withdrawal  from  the  Proceeds  Account  and the  right  to  instruct  the
Collateral Agent to honor drafts against the Proceeds Account.

         (d)  APPLICATION  OF  PROCEEDS.  Subject to  subsection  (c),  the cash
proceeds  actually  received from the sale or other disposition or collection of
Collateral,  and any other amounts received in respect of the Collateral,  shall
be applied as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. Any surplus thereof which
exists after payment and performance in full of the Secured Obligations shall be
promptly paid over to the Debtors or otherwise  disposed of in  accordance  with
the Intercreditor  Agreement, the UCC or other applicable law. The Debtors shall
remain  liable to the  Collateral  Agent,  the Agent,  the  Noteholders  and the
Lenders for any deficiency  which exists after any sale or other  disposition or
collection of Collateral.

         SECTION 11 CERTAIN WAIVERS.  Each Debtor waives,  to the fullest extent
permitted by law, (i) any right of  redemption  with respect to the  Collateral,
whether before or


                                       19

<PAGE>

after sale hereunder,  and all rights,  if any, of marshalling of the Collateral
or other collateral or security for the Secured  Obligations;  (ii) any right to
require the Collateral  Agent,  the Agent, the Noteholders or the Lenders (a) to
proceed against any Person,  (b) to exhaust any other collateral or security for
any of the  Secured  Obligations,  (c) to pursue  any  remedy in the  Collateral
Agent's,  the Agent's,  any Noteholder's or any of the Lenders' power, or (d) to
make  or  give  any   presentments,   demands   for   performance,   notices  of
nonperformance,  protests,  notices  of  protests  or  notices  of  dishonor  in
connection  with any of the  Collateral;  and (iii)  all  claims,  damages,  and
demands against the Collateral  Agent, the Agent, the Noteholders or the Lenders
arising out of the repossession,  retention, sale or application of the proceeds
of any sale of the Collateral.

         SECTION 12 NOTICES. All notices or other communications hereunder shall
be given in the  manner  and to the  addresses  specified  in the  Intercreditor
Agreement.  All such  notices  and  other  communications  shall be deemed to be
delivered  when a record  (within the meaning of the UCC) has been (i) delivered
by hand;  (ii) sent by mail,  upon the  earlier  of the date of  receipt or five
Business Days after deposit in the mail,  first class (or air mail, with respect
to  communications  sent to or from the United States);  (iii) sent by facsimile
transmission, or (iv) sent by email.

         SECTION 13 NO WAIVER;  Cumulative  Remedies.  No failure on the part of
the Collateral  Agent, the Agent, any Noteholder or any Lender to exercise,  and
no delay in exercising,  any right,  remedy,  power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall any single or partial  exercise  of any
such right,  remedy,  power or privilege  preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the  exercise of any other right,  remedy,  power or  privilege.  The
rights and remedies under this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights,  remedies,  powers and privileges that may otherwise be available to the
Collateral Agent, the Agent, any Noteholder or any Lender.

         SECTION 14 COSTS AND EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION; OTHER CHARGES.

         (a) COSTS AND EXPENSES. Each Debtor agrees to pay on demand:

         (i) the reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs and expenses of the Collateral
Agent and any of its Affiliates,  and the reasonable fees and  disbursements  of
counsel to the Collateral Agent (including allocated costs of internal counsel),
in  connection  with  the  negotiation,  preparation,  execution,  delivery  and
administration of this Agreement,  and any amendments,  modifications or waivers
of the terms thereof, and the custody of the Collateral;

         (ii) all title,  appraisal  (including the allocated  costs of internal
appraisal services),  survey, audit, consulting,  search, recording,  filing and
similar fees,  costs and expenses  incurred or sustained by the Collateral Agent
or any of its Affiliates in connection  with this  Agreement or the  Collateral;
and

         (iii) all costs and expenses of the Collateral Agent and its Affiliates
and the fees and  disbursements  of counsel  (including  the allocated  costs of
internal counsel),  in connection with the enforcement or attempted  enforcement
of, and  preservation  of any rights or interests  under,  this  Agreement,  any
out-of-court  workout or other refinancing or restructuring or in any bankruptcy
case, and the protection,  sale or collection of, or other realization upon, any
of


                                       20

<PAGE>

the Collateral,  including all expenses of taking, collecting, holding, sorting,
handling,  preparing for sale,  selling, or the like, and other such expenses of
sales and collections of Collateral,  and any and all losses, costs and expenses
sustained  by the  Collateral  Agent as a result of any failure by any Debtor to

         (b)  INDEMNIFICATION.  Each  Debtor  hereby  agrees  to  indemnify  the
Collateral  Agent,  any  Affiliate  thereof,  and  their  respective  directors,
officers,  employees,  agents,  counsel and other advisors (each an "Indemnified
Person") against,  and hold each of them harmless from, any and all liabilities,
obligations,  losses, claims, damages,  penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever, including the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to an Indemnified Person (including
allocated costs of internal  counsel),  which may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against any Indemnified  Person,  in any way relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it hereunder (the  "Indemnified  Liabilities");  provided
that the Debtors shall not be liable to any  Indemnified  Person for any portion
of such Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are found by a final decision
of a court of competent  jurisdiction  to have  resulted  from such  Indemnified
Person's gross negligence or willful  misconduct.  If and to the extent that the
foregoing  indemnification  is for any reason  held  unenforceable,  each Debtor
agrees to make the maximum  contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each
of the Indemnified Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law.

         (c) OTHER  CHARGES.  Each Debtor  agrees to  indemnify  the  Collateral
Agent, the Agent,  each Noteholder and each Lender against and hold each of them
harmless from any and all present and future stamp,  transfer,  documentary  and
other such  taxes,  levies,  fees,  assessments  and other  charges  made by any
jurisdiction by reason of the execution,  delivery,  performance and enforcement
of this Agreement.

         (d) INTEREST.  Any amounts payable to the Collateral  Agent, the Agent,
any  Noteholder  or any Lender  under this  Section 14 or  otherwise  under this

of the Credit Agreement.

         SECTION 15 BINDING EFFECT.  This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Debtors,  the Collateral  Agent, the
Agent,  each  Noteholder  and each Lender and their  respective  successors  and
assigns  and  shall  bind any  Person  who  becomes  bound  as a debtor  to this
Agreement.

         SECTION 16  GOVERNING  LAW.  THIS  AGREEMENT  SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH,  THE LAW OF THE  STATE OF NEW  YORK,  EXCEPT AS
REQUIRED  BY  MANDATORY  PROVISIONS  OF LAW AND TO THE  EXTENT THE  VALIDITY  OR
PERFECTION OF THE SECURITY INTERESTS  HEREUNDER,  OR THE REMEDIES HEREUNDER,  IN
RESPECT OF ANY COLLATERAL  ARE GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF A JURISDICTION  OTHER THAN
NEW YORK.

         SECTION  17  ENTIRE  AGREEMENT;   AMENDMENT.  This  Agreement  and  the
Intercreditor  Agreement  contains  the entire  agreement  of the  parties  with
respect to the subject


                                       21

matter  hereof and shall not be amended  except by the written  agreement of the
parties hereto or as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement.

         SECTION 18  SEVERABILITY.  Whenever  possible,  each  provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
all  applicable  laws  and  regulations.  If,  however,  any  provision  of this
Agreement  shall be prohibited by or invalid under any such law or regulation in
any  jurisdiction,  it shall,  as to such  jurisdiction,  be deemed  modified to
conform to the minimum  requirements  of such law or regulation,  or, if for any
reason it is not deemed so modified, it shall be ineffective and invalid only to
the extent of such  prohibition  or invalidity  without  affecting the remaining
provisions of this Agreement, or the validity or effectiveness of such provision
in any other jurisdiction.

         SECTION 19  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate  counterparts,  each
of which when so  executed  shall be deemed to be an  original  and all of which
taken together shall constitute but one and the same agreement.

         SECTION 20 INCORPORATION OF PROVISIONS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  To the
extent the Credit Agreement contains provisions of general  applicability to the
Loan Documents, including any such provisions contained in Article XIII thereof,
such provisions are incorporated herein by this reference.

         SECTION 21 NO INCONSISTENT REQUIREMENTS.  Each Debtor acknowledges that
this Agreement,  the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Amended and
Restated Note  Agreement and the other Loan Documents (as defined in the Amended
and  Restated  Note  Agreement)  may  contain  covenants  and  other  terms  and
provisions  variously stated  regarding the same or similar matters,  and agrees
that all such  covenants,  terms and  provisions are cumulative and all shall be
performed and satisfied in accordance with their respective terms.

         SECTION 22 FUTURE  DEBTORS.  At such time  following the date hereof as
any Person (an "Acceding  Subsidiary")  is required to accede hereto pursuant to
the terms of Section 10.03(k) of the Credit Agreement,  such Acceding Subsidiary
shall  execute  and  deliver  to the  Collateral  Agent an  accession  agreement
substantially in the form of Annex 1 (the "Accession Agreement'), signifying its
agreement  to be bound by the  provisions  of this  Agreement as a Debtor to the
same  extent  as if  such  Acceding  Subsidiary  had  originally  executed  this
Agreement as of the date hereof.

         SECTION 23 TERMINATION.  Upon the termination of the Commitments of the
Lenders,  the surrender of the Letters of Credit and payment and  performance in
full  of all  Secured  Obligations,  the  security  interests  created  by  this
Agreement  shall terminate and the Collateral  Agent shall promptly  execute and
deliver to the Debtors such documents and  instruments  reasonably  requested by
the  Debtors as shall be  necessary  to  evidence  termination  of all  security
interests given by the Debtors to the Collateral Agent hereunder.

all  Liens now or  hereafter  existing  in favor of the  Collateral  Agent,  any
Secured Party or any other Person on any Revolving  Debt Priority  Collateral to
secure the Revolving Debt shall be senior at all times to the Liens or interests
now or hereafter existing in favor of the Collateral Agent, any Secured Party or
any other Person  thereon to secure the Term Debt,  in each case,  regardless of
the  fact  that all  Secured  Obligations  are  secured  by the same  Collateral
Documents, the time or order of attachment or perfection,  any provisions to the
contrary  in  any  of  the  Collateral  Documents  or  any  other  circumstances
whatsoever.

         Section  2.3.  Liens of  Secured  Parties  in  respect  of  Patent  and
Trademark  Collateral  are Pari Passu.  All Liens now or  hereafter  existing in
favor of the  Collateral  Agent,  any Secured  Party or any other  Person on any
Patent and Trademark  Collateral  to secure the Term Debt or the Revolving  Debt
shall be PARI PASSU in all  respects  and at all times,  regardless  of the fact
that all Secured Obligations are secured by the same Collateral  Documents,  the
time or order of attachment or perfection, any provisions to the contrary in any
of the Collateral Documents or any other circumstances whatsoever.

         Section  2.4.   Nonavoidability   of  Liens.  The   subordinations  and
priorities   specified   hereinabove   are   expressly   conditioned   upon  the
nonavoidability and perfection of the Lien to which another Lien is subordinated
or made PARI PASSU and, if the Lien to which  another  Lien is  subordinated  or
made PARI PASSU is not  perfected  or is  avoidable,  for any  reason,  then the
subordinations and relative priority agreements provided for herein shall not be
effective  as  to  the  particular  Collateral  which  is  the  subject  of  the
unperfected or avoidable lien.

         SECTION 3. RELATIONSHIPS AMONG SECURED PARTIES.

         Section 3.1.  Restrictions on Actions.  Each Secured Party agrees that,
so long as any Secured  Obligations are outstanding or any Secured Party has any
commitment  to extend  credit in respect  thereof  pursuant  to the terms of the
Credit  Agreement,  the provisions of this Agreement shall provide the exclusive
method by which any Secured Party may exercise  rights and remedies with respect
to the Collateral under the Collateral Documents and under applicable


                                       7

<PAGE>

law relating to the rights and remedies of secured  creditors.  Therefore,  each
Secured Party shall,  for the mutual benefit of all Secured  Parties,  except as
permitted under this Agreement:

                (a)  refrain  from  taking or filing  any  action,  judicial  or
otherwise,  to enforce  any rights or pursue  any  remedy  under the  Collateral
Documents, except for delivering notices hereunder;

                (b) refrain  from (1) selling  any  Secured  Obligations  to the
Company or any  Affiliate of the Company and (2)  accepting  any guaranty of, or
any  other  security  for,  the  Secured  Obligations  from the  Company  or any
Affiliate  of the Company or any other  Person,  except any guaranty or security
granted to the  Collateral  Agent for the benefit of all Secured  Parties in the
relative priorities set forth herein; and

                (c) refrain from  exercising any rights or remedies with respect
to the  Collateral  under the  Collateral  Documents,  or under  applicable  law
relating to the rights and remedies of secured creditors, which have or may have
arisen  or which  may arise as a result  of a  Default  or Event of  Default  or
otherwise;

PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that nothing contained in subsections (a) through (c) above
shall  prevent the Agent or any Secured  Party from  exercising or enforcing any
other right or remedy available to the Agent or any Secured Party under the Note
Agreement,  the Notes, the Credit  Agreement,  the Subsidiary  Guaranties or the
other Loan Documents (as defined in the Credit  Agreement),  as the case may be,
including,  without limitation,  accelerating the maturity of the Term Debt, the
Revolving Debt or the Notes, as the case may be,  terminating any commitments to
lend  additional  money to the Company under the Credit  Agreement in accordance
with the terms thereof,  imposing a default rate of interest in accordance  with
the Credit Agreement or the Note Agreement, as applicable,  raising any defenses
in any action in which it has been made a party  defendant or has been joined as
a third party,  except that the Collateral Agent may, but shall not be obligated
to, direct and control any defense  directly  relating to the  Collateral or any
one or  more  of the  Collateral  Documents,  which  shall  be  governed  by the
provisions of this Agreement.  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE FOREGOING,  NO SECURED PARTY
SHALL EXERCISE, OR ATTEMPT TO EXERCISE, ANY RIGHT OF SET-OFF,  BANKER'S LIEN, OR
THE LIKE,  AGAINST ANY DEPOSIT  ACCOUNT OR PROPERTY OF THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS
SUBSIDIARIES  HELD OR  MAINTAINED BY THE SECURED PARTY WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN
CONSENT OF THE COLLATERAL AGENT, THE REQUIRED REVOLVING DEBT SECURED PARTIES AND
THE REQUIRED TERM DEBT SECURED PARTIES.

         Section 3.2.  Representations  and Warranties.  (a) Each of the Secured
Parties represents and warrants to the other parties hereto that:

                        (1)   It (i) is either (x) a corporation duly organized,

                        (3) The  execution, delivery  and  performance by such
Secured  Party of this  Agreement  will  result in a valid and  legally  binding
obligation of such Secured Party enforceable in accordance with its terms.

                (b)    The Collateral Agent hereby represents and warrants that:

                        (3) execution,delivery and performance by the Collateral
Agent of this  Agreement  will not contravene any law, rule or regulation of the
United States or any United States  governmental  authority or agency regulating

breach of, or constitute a default under,  the Collateral  Agent's  constitutive
documents  or the  provision  of any  indenture,  mortgage,  contract  or  other
agreement  to which it is a party  or by  which it or any of its  properties  is
bound.

                        (4) execution,delivery and performance by the Collateral

of, the giving of notice to, the filing or  registration  with, or the taking of
any other  action in respect of, any United  States  governmental  authority  or
agency regulating the banking activities of the Collateral Agent.

                        (5)  Agreement  has been  duly  executed  and  delivered
by the Collateral Agent and constitutes the legal,  valid, and binding agreement
of the Collateral  Agent,  enforceable in accordance with its terms,  subject to

such further  acts as may be  necessary or proper to carry out more  effectively

Secured Obligations.

         Section  3.4.  Termination  of  Credit  Agreement,  Note  Agreement  or
Additional  Facilities.  Upon final  payment in full of all Secured  Obligations
owing to any Secured Party,  and, in the case of any Facility Lender,  after the
termination of such Facility  Lender's  Revolving  Commitment (as defined in the

Agreement; provided, however, if all or any part of any payments to such Secured
Party  are  invalidated  or set  aside or  required  to be paid or repaid to any
Person in any Bankruptcy Proceeding or otherwise (including, without limitation,
any  payment  required  to be made by such  Secured  Party to one or more of the
other Secured Parties pursuant to ss.6.15 hereof),  then this Agreement shall be
renewed as of such date and shall  thereafter  continue in full force and effect
to the extent of the Secured  Obligations  so  invalidated,  set aside,  paid or
repaid.

on its behalf and exercise such powers and use such  discretion as are expressly
permitted  hereunder  and under the  Collateral  Documents  and all  instruments
relating  hereto and thereto and (ii) to exercise  such powers and perform  such
duties as are, in each case,  expressly delegated to the Collateral Agent by the
terms hereof and thereof  together with such other powers and  discretion as are

                (b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in
this Agreement or the Collateral Documents,  the Collateral Agent shall not have
any  duties or  responsibilities  except  those  expressly  set forth  herein or
therein or any fiduciary  relationship  with any Secured  Party,  and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall

against the Collateral Agent.

         SECTION 5. AGENCY PROVISIONS.

         Section 5.1.  Delegation of Duties.  The Collateral  Agent may exercise
its powers and execute any of its duties under this Agreement and the Collateral
Documents  by or through  employees,  agents or  attorneys-in-fact  and shall be

pertaining  to such  powers  and  duties.  The  Collateral  Agent  shall  not be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or  attorneys-in-fact
selected  by it with  reasonable  care.  The  Collateral  Agent may  utilize the
services of such Persons as the


                                       10

<PAGE>

Collateral  Agent in its sole discretion may determine,  and all reasonable fees
and expenses of such Persons shall be borne by the Company.

         Section 5.2. Exculpatory  Provisions.  Neither the Collateral Agent nor
any  of  the  Collateral  Agent's  officers,   directors,   employees,   agents,
attorneys-in-fact  or  Affiliates  shall be (a) liable  for any action  taken or
omitted  to be  taken by it or such  Person  under or in  connection  with  this
Agreement or any Collateral  Document or any Collateral  (except for its or such
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct),  or (b) responsible in any
manner  to  any  of  the   Secured   Parties  for  any   recitals,   statements,
representations  or warranties made by the Grantors,  any officer thereof or any
other Person contained in, or made or deemed made in connection with, the Credit
Agreement,  the Note Agreement or any Collateral Document or in any certificate,
report,  statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received
by the Collateral Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement,  the Credit
Agreement,  the  Note  Agreement  or any  Collateral  Document,  or for  the due
execution, legality, value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability
or  sufficiency  of the Credit  Agreement,  the Note Agreement or any Collateral
Document or any other document or instrument  furnished  pursuant  thereto or of
any  of the  Collateral  or for  any  failure  of any  Grantor  to  perform  its
obligations  under  such  documents.  The  Collateral  Agent  shall  be under no
obligation  to  the  Secured  Parties  to  ascertain  or to  inquire  as to  the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, statements made
in, or conditions of the Credit Agreement,  the Note Agreement or any Collateral
Document or to inspect the  property  (including  the books and  records) of the
Grantors.

Section  5.3.  Reliance  by  Collateral  Agent.  The  Collateral  Agent shall be
entitled to rely,  and shall be fully  protected and shall incur no liability in
acting and relying, upon any writing, resolution,  notice, consent, certificate,
affidavit,  letter,  cablegram,  telegram,  telecopy, telex or teletype message,
statement,  order or other document or conversation reasonably believed by it to
be  genuine  and  correct  and to have been  signed,  sent or made by the proper
Person or Persons and upon advice and  statements of legal  counsel  (including,
without limitation, counsel to the Grantors),  independent accountants and other
experts selected by the Collateral Agent. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing,  the  Collateral  Agent  may  treat  the  payee of any  Term  Debt or
Revolving  Debt as the  registered  holder  thereof until it receives  notice or
otherwise  has actual  knowledge  that such  payee is no longer  the  registered
holder of such Term Debt or  Revolving  Debt.  Notwithstanding  anything  to the
contrary  contained herein or in any Collateral  Document,  the Collateral Agent
shall be fully  justified  in  failing or  refusing  to take  action  under this
Agreement  or the  Collateral  Documents  (including,  without  limitation,  the
exercise of any rights or remedies  under, or the entering into of any agreement
amending, modifying,  supplementing,  waiving any provision of, or the giving of
consent  pursuant  to, any of the  Collateral  Documents)  unless it shall first
receive instructions of the relevant Required Secured Parties as is contemplated
by ss.6 hereof and it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable  satisfaction
by the relevant  Secured Parties against any and all liability and expense which
may be incurred by it by reason of taking, continuing to take or refraining from
taking  any such  action.  The  Collateral  Agent  shall  in all  cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,  under this Agreement and the
Collateral  Documents in accordance  with the provisions of ss.6.5 hereof and in
accordance with written  instructions of the relevant  Required  Secured Parties
pursuant to ss.6.3 hereof, and such instructions and any action taken or failure
to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the relevant Secured Parties.

Section 5.4.  Knowledge or Notice of Default,  Event of Default.  The Collateral
Agent  shall not be  deemed to have  actual,  constructive,  direct or  indirect
knowledge or notice of the  occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless
and until the Collateral  Agent has received written notice from a Secured Party
or the Company  referring  to the Credit  Agreement,  the Note  Agreement or the
Collateral Documents, describing such Default or Event of Default, setting forth
in reasonable  detail the facts and  circumstances  thereof and stating that the
Collateral Agent may rely on such notice without further inquiry;  provided that
if the Agent is the Collateral  Agent  hereunder,  the Collateral Agent shall be
deemed to have actual  knowledge and notice of the  occurrence of any Default or
Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) under the Credit Agreement
if the Agent has  actual  knowledge  of such  Default or Event of Default or has
declared an Event of Default under the Credit  Agreement.  The Collateral  Agent
shall have no obligation or duty prior to or after  receiving any such notice to
inquire  whether a Default or Event of Default has in fact occurred and shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in so relying, on any such notice
furnished to it.

Section 5.5.  Non-Reliance on Collateral Agent and Other Secured  Parties.  Each
Secured Party expressly acknowledges that, except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement,  neither  the  Collateral  Agent  nor any of the  Collateral  Agent's
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made
any  representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Collateral Agent
hereafter taken,  including any review of the affairs of the Grantors,  shall be
deemed to constitute any  representation  or warranty by the Collateral Agent to
any Secured Party. Each Secured Party represents that it has,  independently and
without reliance upon the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party, and based
on such  documents and  information as it has deemed  appropriate,  made its own
appraisal  of  and  investigation  into  the  business,  operations,   property,
financial and other condition and credit-worthiness of the Grantors and made its
own  decision  to enter  into this  Agreement,  the Credit  Agreement,  the Note
Agreement or any Collateral Document. Each Secured Party also represents that it
will,  independently and without reliance upon the Collateral Agent or any other
Secured  Party,  and based on such  documents and  information  as it shall deem
appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own credit  analysis,  appraisals
and  decisions in taking or not taking  action under the Credit  Agreement,  the
Note Agreement or any Collateral  Document and this Agreement,  and to make such
investigation  as it  deems  necessary  to  inform  itself  as to the  business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and credit-worthiness of the
Grantors.  Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to
be furnished  to the Secured  Parties by the  Collateral  Agent  hereunder,  the
Collateral  Agent  shall  not have any duty or  responsibility  to  provide  the
Secured  Parties with any credit or other  information  concerning the business,
operations,  property, financial and other condition or credit-worthiness of the
Grantors which may come into the  possession of the  Collateral  Agent or any of
its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

Section  5.6.  Indemnification.  The  Secured  Parties  agree to  indemnify  the
Collateral  Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not  reimbursed  by the
Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors, but without limiting any obligation of the
Company and the Subsidiary  Guarantors to do so) ratably in accordance  with the
Secured  Parties'  Pro Rata  Shares,  against,  and hold  the  Collateral  Agent
harmless from, any and all liabilities,  obligations,  losses, claims,  damages,
penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature


                                       12

<PAGE>

whatsoever,  which may be imposed  on,  incurred  by, or  asserted  against  the
Collateral Agent, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
Collateral  Document or the transactions  contemplated  hereby or thereby or any
action taken or omitted by the  Collateral  Agent in connection  with any of the
foregoing;  PROVIDED  that no Secured  Party  shall be liable to the  Collateral
Agent  for  any  portion  of such  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages,
penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to the
extent they are found by a final  decision of a court of competent  jurisdiction
to have  resulted  from the  Collateral  Agent's  gross  negligence  or  willful
misconduct.. The agreements in
this ss.5.6 shall survive the payment of the Secured Obligations.

         Section 5.7. Collateral Agent in Its Individual Capacity.  Cooperatieve
Centrale  Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank  B.A.,  "Rabobank  International",  New York
Branch and its Affiliates may make loans to and generally  engage in any kind of
business with the Company or any other Grantor as though such Person was not the
Collateral  Agent  hereunder  and  without  any duty to account  therefor to the
Secured  Parties.  With respect to any Term Debt or Revolving  Debt issued to it
and  advances  made by it  under  the  Credit  Agreement,  if any,  Cooperatieve
Centrale  Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank  B.A.,  "Rabobank  International",  New York
Branch shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any Secured
Party and may exercise the same as though it were not the Collateral  Agent, and
the terms  "Secured  Party" and "Secured  Parties"  shall  include  Cooperatieve
Centrale  Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank  B.A.,  "Rabobank  International",  New York
Branch in its individual capacity.

         Section 5.8. Successor Collateral Agent.

                (a)     The  Collateral  Agent may resign at any time upon sixty
days'  notice to the  Secured  Parties and the Company and may be removed at any
time, with or without cause,  by the Required  Secured Parties by written notice
delivered to the Company,  the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties.  If the
Collateral Agent is also a Facility Lender,  then the Noteholders may remove the
Collateral Agent for a continuing breach of its obligations under this Agreement
at any time  upon a vote of the  holders  of  66-2/3%  or more of the  aggregate
principal amount of outstanding Notes,  PROVIDED that the Collateral Agent shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to cure such breach prior to any such removal.
After  any  resignation  or  removal  hereunder  of the  Collateral  Agent,  the
provisions of this ss.5 shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted  to be taken by it in  connection  with its role as  Collateral
Agent  hereunder  while it was the Collateral  Agent under this Agreement and it
shall be entitled to be paid  promptly when due any amounts owing to it pursuant
to ss.5.6.

                (b)    Upon receiving notice of any such resignation or removal,
a successor Collateral Agent shall be appointed by the Required Secured Parties;
provided,  however,  that such successor Collateral Agent shall be (i) a bank or
trust company  having a combined  capital and surplus of at least  $500,000,000,
subject to supervision  or examination by a federal or state banking  authority;
and (ii) authorized under the laws of the  jurisdiction of its  incorporation or
organization to assume the functions of the Collateral Agent. If the appointment
of such successor  shall not have become  effective (as hereafter  provided) (x)
within such sixty day period after the Collateral  Agent's notice of resignation
or (y) upon  removal of the  Collateral  Agent,  then the  Collateral  Agent may
assign the Liens and its duties hereunder and under the Collateral


                                       13

<PAGE>

Documents to the Secured  Parties,  as their  interests may appear,  and in such
case all references herein to "Collateral Agent" shall be deemed to refer to the
"Required  Secured Parties." Any Secured Party may petition a court of competent
jurisdiction  for the appointment of a successor  Collateral  Agent.  Such court
shall, after such notice as it may deem proper,  appoint a successor  Collateral
Agent  meeting  the  qualifications  specified  in this  ss.5.8(b).  The Secured
Parties hereby consent to such petition and appointment so long as such criteria
are met.

                (c)     The  resignation or removal of a Collateral  Agent shall
become   effective  upon  the  execution  and  delivery  of  such  documents  or
instruments  as are  necessary  to transfer  the rights and  obligations  of the
Collateral Agent under the Collateral Documents,  including, without limitation,
the delivery and  recordation of all  amendments,  instruments,  Deed of Trusts,
financing statements,  continuation  statements and other documents necessary to
maintain the perfection of the security  interests held by the Collateral  Agent
hereunder.  Copies of each such document or instrument shall be delivered to all
Secured  Parties.  Subject to the foregoing  provisions of this  ss.5.8(c),  the
appointment of a successor Collateral Agent pursuant to this ss.5.8 shall become
effective upon the acceptance of the  appointment as Collateral  Agent hereunder
by a successor Collateral Agent. Upon such effective appointment,  the successor
Collateral Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges  and  duties  of the  retiring  Collateral  Agent  and  the  retiring
Collateral  Agent shall be discharged  from its rights,  powers,  privileges and
duties  under  this  Agreement  and the other  Collateral  Documents;  provided,
however,  that  the  provisions  of this  ss.5  shall  continue  to inure to the
retiring  Collateral  Agent's  benefit as to any actions  taken or omitted to be
taken by it in connection  with its role as Collateral  Agent hereunder while it
was the Collateral Agent under this Agreement.

         SECTION 6. ACTIONS BY THE COLLATERAL AGENT.

         Section 6.1. Duties and Obligations.  The duties and obligations of the
Collateral  Agent  are  only  those  set  forth  in  this  Agreement  and in the
Collateral Documents.

         Section 6.2.  Notification of Default. If the Collateral Agent has been
notified in a writing  conforming to the  requirements  of ss.5.4 by any Secured
Party that a Default,  an Event of  Default  or a Special  Event of Default  has
occurred,  the Collateral  Agent shall furnish to the Secured  Parties a copy of
such  written  notice and may,  but is under no  obligation  to,  furnish to the
Company a copy of the notice received by the Collateral  Agent and a copy of the
Collateral  Agent's  notice to the Secured  Parties.  The failure of any Secured
Party having knowledge of the occurrence of a Default,  an Event of Default or a
Special Event of Default to notify the Collateral  Agent or any Secured Party of
such occurrence, however, does not constitute a waiver of such Default, Event of
Default or Special  Event of Default by the Secured  Parties.  Upon receipt of a
notice  conforming  to the  requirements  of ss.5.4 from a Secured  Party of the
occurrence of an Event of Default or a Special Event of Default,  the Collateral
Agent shall (in  addition to the action  required by the first  sentence of this
ss.6.2)  promptly  (and in any event no later  than  three  Business  Days after
receipt of such notice) issue its Notice of Default to all Secured Parties. Such
Notice of Default shall  indicate the nature of such Event of Default or Special
Event of Default.  The Notice of Default may contain a recommendation of actions
to be taken by the Secured Parties and/or request  instructions from the Secured
Parties  and shall  specify the date on which  responses  are due in order to be
timely within ss.6.4 hereof.


                                       14

<PAGE>

Section 6.3. Exercise of Remedies.  Except as otherwise  provided in ss.6.5, the
Collateral  Agent shall take only such actions and exercise  only such  remedies
under the Collateral Documents as are approved in written instructions delivered
to the  Collateral  Agent and signed by the relevant  Required  Secured  Parties
required under ss.6.4. In the event that the Collateral Agent shall determine in
good faith that taking the actions specified in such instructions is contrary to
law, it may refrain (and shall be fully protected in so refraining)  from taking
such  action  and  shall  immediately  give  notice  of such fact to each of the
Secured Parties. In the event that instructions received by the Collateral Agent
are in its good faith  judgment  ambiguous or conflict  with other  instructions
received by the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent (a) shall promptly notify
the  Secured  Parties of such  ambiguity  or  conflict  and  request  clarifying
instructions,  and (b) may either (1) delay taking any such action or exercising
any such remedy pending the receipt of such clarifying  instructions  (and shall
be fully  protected  in so  delaying) or (2) take such actions as it is entitled
under ss.6.5.

         Section 6.4. Instructions from Secured Parties.

         Notwithstanding  anything  express or implied  to the  contrary  in any
Collateral Document:

                (a)     remedies  and  other  actions  to  be  taken  under  the
Collateral  Documents  or  applicable  law with  respect to the  Revolving  Debt
Priority  Collateral  shall be directed by the Required  Revolving  Debt Secured
Parties,  or by the Required Term Debt Secured  Parties with the written consent
of  the  Required  Revolving  Debt  Secured  Parties  (such  consent  not  to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed);

                (b)     remedies  and other  actions  to  be  taken  under  the
Collateral  Documents or  applicable  law with respect to the Term Debt Priority
Collateral  shall be directed by the Required Term Debt Secured  Parties,  or by
the  Required  Revolving  Debt Secured  Parties with the written  consent of the
Required Term Debt Secured Parties (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed);

                (c)  remedies and other actions to be taken under the Collateral
Documents or applicable law with respect to the Patent and Trademark  Collateral
shall be  directed by both the  Required  Term Debt  Secured  Parties and by the
Required  Revolving Debt Secured Parties;  and

                (d) if any Secured Party does not respond in a timely  manner to
any  notice  (including,  without  limitation,  a Notice  of  Default)  from the
Collateral Agent or request for instructions within the time period specified by
the Collateral Agent in such notice or request for instructions  (which shall be
a minimum of five Business Days),  the Secured  Obligations held by such Secured
Party which would otherwise be included in a determination  of Required  Secured
Parties shall not be included in the  determination  of Required Secured Parties
for purposes of such notice or request for instructions. Any action taken or not
taken  without  the vote of such  Secured  Party or Secured  Parties  under this
ss.6.4 shall nevertheless be binding on such Secured Party or Secured Parties.

Section 6.5. Emergency Actions. If the Collateral Agent has asked the relevant
Secured  Parties for instruction  and if the relevant  Required  Secured Parties
have not yet


                                       15

<PAGE>

responded to such request, the Collateral Agent shall be authorized to take, but
shall not be required to take and shall in no event have any  liability  for the
taking or the failure to take, such actions (other than any action  described or
permitted  under  ss.6.7  hereof)  with  regard to a Default or Event of Default
which the Collateral Agent, in good faith, believes to be reasonably required to
promote and protect the  interests  of the Secured  Parties and to preserve  the
value of the Collateral and shall give the Secured Parties appropriate notice of
such action;  PROVIDED that once  instructions with respect to such request have
been  received  by the  Collateral  Agent  from the  relevant  Required  Secured
Parties,  the actions of the Collateral  Agent shall be governed thereby and the
Collateral  Agent  shall not take any  further  action  which  would be contrary
thereto.

         Section  6.6.  Changes  to  Collateral  Documents.   Any  term  of  the
Collateral  Documents may be amended,  and the  performance or observance by the
parties to a Collateral  Document of any term of such Collateral Document may be
waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively)  with the written  consent of both the Required Term Debt Secured
Parties and the Required Revolving Debt Secured Parties.

         Section 6.7.  Release of  Collateral.  The release of any Collateral by
the Collateral Agent from the Lien of any Collateral Document shall be permitted
with the written consent of all of the Secured Parties; provided,  however, that
if  the  Company  or its  Subsidiaries  disposes  of  Collateral  pursuant  to a
disposition  that is  permitted  under  both the Credit  Agreement  and the Note
Agreement, then the written consent of the Secured Parties to the release by the
Collateral Agent of such Collateral shall not be required.

         Section 6.8. Other Actions.  The Collateral  Agent shall have the right
to take such  actions,  or omit to take such  actions,  hereunder  and under the
Collateral  Documents  not  inconsistent  with the written  instructions  of the
relevant  Required  Secured Parties  delivered  pursuant to ss.6.3 hereof or the
terms of this Agreement,  including actions the Collateral Agent deems necessary
or  appropriate  to  perfect  or  continue  the  perfection  of the Liens on the
Collateral for the benefit of the Secured Parties.  Except as otherwise provided
by applicable law, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral,
the  collection  or  protection  of  the  Collateral  or  any  income  therefrom
(including  any  duty to  ascertain  or  take  action  with  respect  to  calls,
conversions,  exchanges,  maturities,  tenders or other matters  relative to any
Collateral,  whether  or not  the  Collateral  Agent  has or is  deemed  to have
knowledge of such matters),  nor as to the  preservation of rights against prior
parties,  nor as to the  preservation  of rights  pertaining  to the  Collateral
beyond the safe  custody of any  Collateral  in the  Collateral  Agent's  actual
possession.

         Section  6.9.  Cooperation.  To the  extent  that the  exercise  of the
rights,  powers and remedies of the  Collateral  Agent in  accordance  with this
Agreement  requires that any action be taken by any Secured Party,  such Secured
Party shall take such action and cooperate with the  Collateral  Agent to ensure
that the rights,  powers and  remedies of all Secured  Parties are  exercised in
full.

                (c)   Upon  any  realization  upon  the  Patent   and  Trademark
Collateral, the Secured Parties agree that the proceeds thereof shall be applied
(i) first, to the amounts owing to the Collateral Agent,  solely in its capacity
as  Collateral  Agent (or owing to the Secured  Parties in such  capacity if the

Guaranties, the Secured Parties agree that the proceeds thereof shall be applied
(i) first, to the amounts owing to the Collateral Agent,  solely in its capacity
as  Collateral  Agent (or owing to the Secured  Parties in such  capacity if the

Secured  Parties  pursuant to this Agreement or the Collateral  Documents;  (ii)
second,  ratably to the payment of the Agent's  administrative agency fee (which
fee  shall  not  exceed  $30,000  per  year)  and  all  professional  and  other

                (e)   Upon  the request  of  the  Collateral  Agent prior to any
distribution  under  this  ss.6.10,  each  Secured  Party  shall  provide to the
Collateral Agent certificates,  in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the  Collateral  Agent,  setting  forth the  respective  amounts  referred to in
ss.6.10(a), ss.6.10(b), ss.6.10(c) and ss.6.10(d) hereof which each such Secured
Party believes it is entitled to receive.

                (f)    Notwithstanding the preceding subsections 6.10(a) through
6.10(c),  in the event that the Company is required  to  mandatorily  prepay the
Facility  Debt  under  Section  5.03(b)(ii),  (b)(iii)  or (b)(iv) of the Credit
Agreement,  such prepayments shall be made in accordance with the terms thereof;
provided,  however,  that if either (1) an Event of Default has  occurred and is
continuing at the time of such prepayment or (2) after giving effect on a pro


                                       18

<PAGE>

forma basis to the  application of such  prepayment  proceeds as provided in the
Credit  Agreement  a  Specified  Loan to Value  Event  (as  defined  in the Note
Agreement)  would  occur  as a  result  thereof,  then  the  provisions  of this
Agreement  shall  govern the  application  of the  prepayment  proceeds and such
proceeds  shall be applied to the Secured  Obligations  pursuant to the terms of
this Section 6.10; PROVIDED FURTHER that if the terms of this Section 6.10 shall
govern the application of such prepayment  proceeds as a result of the facts set
forth only in clause (2)  hereof,  then the amount of such  prepayment  proceeds
that shall be applied  pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall be that amount of the
proceeds  which will be  required to prepay the  Secured  Obligations  so that a
Specified  Loan to Value  Event will not occur and be  continuing  after  giving
effect to the application of such proceeds under this Section 6.10.

         Notwithstanding  the  preceding  Sections  6.10(a)  through  (d) to the
contrary,  any  payment  hereunder  of the  Agent's  administrative  agency  fee
pursuant to the Sections  6.10(a)(ii),  (b)(ii),  (c)(ii) and (d)(ii)  shall not
exceed $30,000 in the aggregate per year.

         Section 6.11. Senior Preferential Payments and Special Trust Account.

                (a)   After  the  receipt  by each Secured  Party of a Notice of
Default pursuant to ss.6.2 stating that a Special Event of Default has occurred,
all Senior Preferential  Payments other than those payments received pursuant to
subsection  (b) of this ss.6.11 shall be delivered to the  Collateral  Agent for
deposit into the Special Trust Account.

                (b)     If  (i) such  Special  Event of Default is waived by the
Facility  Lenders  and the  Noteholders  and if no other  Event of  Default  has
occurred and is  continuing,  (ii) such Special Event of Default is cured by the
Company or by any amendment of the Credit  Agreement or the Note  Agreement,  as
the case may be, and if no other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
or (iii) any or all of the Secured Obligations have not been accelerated and the
Required  Secured Parties have not instructed the Collateral  Agent to foreclose
on a substantial portion of the Collateral,  seek the appointment of a receiver,
commence  litigation against the Company,  liquidate the Collateral,  commence a
Bankruptcy Proceeding against the Company,  seize Collateral,  or exercise other
remedies of similar  character  prior to the 180th day  following  such  Special
Event of Default,  the  Collateral  Agent  thereupon  shall  return all amounts,
together with their pro rata share of any interest earned  thereon,  held in the
Special Trust Account  representing  payment of any Secured  Obligations  to the
Secured Party initially entitled thereto, and no payments thereafter received by
a Secured Party shall constitute a Senior Preferential Payment by reason of such
cured or waived Special Event of Default. No payment returned to a Secured Party
for which  such  Secured  Party has been  obligated  to make a deposit  into the
Special  Trust  Account  shall  thereafter  ever be  characterized  as a  Senior
Preferential Payment.

                (c)   Each Secured  Party agrees that upon the  occurrence  of a
Special Event of Default it shall (i) promptly  notify the  Collateral  Agent of
the receipt of any Senior Preferential Payments, (ii) hold such amounts in trust
for the Secured  Parties and act as agent of the Secured Parties during the time
any such amounts are held by it, and (iii)  deliver  promptly to the  Collateral
Agent  such  amounts  for  deposit  into the  Special  Trust  Account as soon as
practicable.

<PAGE>

                (d)   If  the Secured  Obligations  have been accelerated or the
Required  Secured Parties have instructed the Collateral Agent to foreclose on a
substantial  portion of the  Collateral,  seek the  appointment  of a  receiver,
commence  litigation against the Company,  liquidate the Collateral,  commence a
Bankruptcy Proceeding against the Company,  seize Collateral,  or exercise other
remedies of similar  character,  then all funds,  together with interest  earned
thereon,   held  in  the  Special  Trust  Account  and  all  subsequent   Senior
Preferential  Payments  shall be applied in  accordance  with the  provisions of
ss.6.10 above.

         Section  6.12.  Authorized  Investments.  Any and all funds held by the
Collateral  Agent in its capacity as Collateral  Agent,  whether pursuant to any
provision of this  Agreement or any of the  Collateral  Documents,  shall to the
extent feasible within a reasonable time be invested by the Collateral  Agent in
Cash Equivalent Investments. Prior to making such investment or to the extent it
is not  feasible  to  invest  such  funds in Cash  Equivalent  Investments,  the
Collateral Agent shall hold any such funds in an interest  bearing account.  Any
interest  earned on such funds  shall be  disbursed  to the  Secured  Parties in
accordance with ss.6.10 or ss.6.11,  as applicable.  The Collateral  Agent shall
have no duty to place  funds  held and  invested  pursuant  to this  ss.6.12  in
investments  which provide a maximum return.  The Collateral  Agent shall not be
responsible for any loss of any funds invested in accordance with this ss.6.12.

         Section  6.13.   Restoration  of  Obligations.   For  the  purposes  of
determining the amount of outstanding Secured Obligations,  if any Secured Party
is  required  to deposit any Senior  Preferential  Payment in the Special  Trust
Account,   then  the  obligations  intended  to  be  satisfied  by  such  Senior
Preferential  Payment  shall be  revived,  as of the date of the deposit of such
amount with the  Collateral  Agent,  in the amount of such  Senior  Preferential
Payment and such  obligation  shall  continue in full force and effect (and,  if
applicable,  bear  interest  from such deposit date at the  non-default  rate as
provided in the Notes or in the Credit Agreement, as the case may be) as if such
Secured Party had not received such payment.  All such revived obligations shall
be included as Secured Obligations for purposes of allocating any payments under
ss.6.10 and for applying the definition of Required Secured Parties. If any such
revived obligation shall not be allowed as a claim under the Bankruptcy Code due
to the fact that the Senior  Preferential  Payment  has in fact been made by the
Company,  the Secured Parties shall make such other equitable  arrangements  for
the purchase and sale of participations in the Secured Obligations to effectuate
the intent of this ss.6.13.

         Section 6.14. Bankruptcy, Preferences, etc. If any payment to a Secured
Party is subsequently invalidated,  declared to be fraudulent or preferential or
set aside and is required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party
under any bankruptcy law, state or Federal law,  common law or equitable  cause,
and such Secured Party has previously  made a deposit in respect of such payment
into the Special Trust Account  pursuant to ss.6.11,  then the Collateral  Agent
shall  distribute to such Secured Party  proceeds from the Special Trust Account
in an amount  equal to such  deposit or so much  thereof as is  affected by such
events and if, due to previous  disbursements to the Secured Parties pursuant to
ss.6.11(d),  the proceeds in the Special Trust Account are insufficient for such
purpose,  then each other  Secured  Party shall pay to such  Secured  Party upon
demand an amount equal to a ratable portion of such disbursements of the deposit
which was  distributed  to each such Secured  Party  according to the  aggregate
amounts so distributed to each such Secured Party.

         Section 6.15.  Sharing of Proceeds.  If, despite the provisions of this
Agreement,  any  Secured  Party shall  receive any payment or other  recovery in
excess of its portion of payments on account of the Secured Obligations to which
it is then entitled in accordance with this Agreement,  such Secured Party shall
hold such  payment or other  recovery  in trust for the  benefit of the  parties
entitled thereto and promptly pay over or deliver such payment or other recovery
to the Collateral  Agent for  application by the Collateral  Agent in accordance
with this Agreement.

         SECTION 7. BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.

         The following  provisions shall apply during any Bankruptcy  Proceeding
of any Grantor:

                (a)  The Collateral Agent shall represent all Secured Parties in
connection  with all  matters  directly  relating to the  Collateral,  including
without  limitation,  use, sale or lease of Collateral,  use of cash collateral,
relief from the automatic stay and adequate  protection.  The  Collateral  Agent
shall act on the  instructions of the Required  Secured  Parties;  provided that
such  instructions  by the Required  Secured Parties shall not treat any Secured
Party  differently  with  respect  to  rights in the  Collateral  from any other
Secured Party; and provided further that if action is required prior to the time
such  instructions  are received or if the Required Secured Parties fail to give
instructions  with  respect  to  any  matter,  the  Collateral  Agent  shall  be
authorized to act, or refrain from acting, in accordance with ss.6.5 hereof.

                (b) Each Secured Party shall be free to act independently on any
issue not directly  relating to the Collateral,  including  without  limitation,
matters  relating to appointment of a trustee,  conversion of a case,  filing of
claims, and plans of reorganization.  Each Secured Party shall give prior notice
to the  Collateral  Agent of any such  action to the extent  that such notice is
possible.  If such prior  notice is not given,  such  Secured  Party  shall give
prompt notice following any such action.

         SECTION 8. ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS OF SECURED PARTIES.

                (a)  The Term Debt Secured Parties agree that the Revolving Debt
Secured Parties, through their authorized representatives or agents, may (to the
extent the Term Debt Secured  Parties  have the right to restrict  access to the
Term Debt Priority  Collateral)  enter upon any real property  constituting Term
Debt Priority  Collateral from time to time during normal business hours for the
sole  purpose  of  inspecting,  repairing,  removing,  caring  for,  harvesting,
protecting  or  conducting a sale or sales of any or all of the  Revolving  Debt
Priority  Collateral if the Agent provides the Term Debt Secured  Parties notice
prior to each entry (which  shall not be less than two (2) business  days except
in the case of  emergency).  The Term Debt Secured  Parties  further  agree that
neither the Agent nor any Revolving Debt Secured Party shall have any obligation
or liability to any Term Debt Secured Party, except, however, that the Revolving
Debt Secured  Parties shall promptly repair any damage to the Term Debt Priority
Collateral caused by the removal,  repair,  sale or inspection and the Revolving
Debt Secured Parties shall be liable for, and shall  indemnify,  defend and hold
the Collateral  Agent and the Term Debt Secured Parties  harmless from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of their employees or agents in connection with
such removal, repairs, sale or inspection.  The Agent and Revolving Debt Secured
Parties  agree  that  neither  the  Collateral  Agent nor the Term Debt  Secured
Parties shall


                                       21
<PAGE>

have any  obligation  or  liability  to  preserve,  protect,  manage,  maintain,
safekeep or otherwise  have any  responsibility  for the Revolving Debt Priority
Collateral beyond the safe custody of any Collateral in any such Person's actual
possession;  provided,  however,  that the Term Debt Secured  Parties agree that
they will not take or direct the Collateral  Agent to take any action to destroy
or damage any crops grown on,  attached  to,  affixed to, or located on any Term
Debt Priority Collateral.

                (b)   The  Collateral  Agent  agrees to use its best efforts to
give to the Agent,  via certified mail,  written notice prior to the exercise by
the  Collateral  Agent of any of its rights or  remedies  against  the Term Debt
Priority  Collateral  at the address  provided for in ss.10.2  below;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that any failure to so provide such notice shall have no effect on the
ability  of the  Collateral  Agent to  exercise  any of its  rights or  remedies
against the Term Debt Priority Collateral.

                (c)  The Collateral Agent agrees to use its best efforts to give
to the Term Debt Secured  Parties,  via certified mail,  written notice prior to
the exercise by  Collateral  Agent of any of its rights or remedies  against the
Revolving Debt Priority Collateral at the address provided for in ss.10.2 below;
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that any failure to so provide  such  notice  shall have no
effect on the ability of the  Collateral  Agent to exercise any of its rights or
remedies against the Revolving Debt Priority Collateral.

                (d)   If the Collateral  Agent takes possession of the Grantors'
books and records  included  in the  Revolving  Debt  Priority  Collateral,  the
Collateral Agent shall provide the Term Debt Secured Parties  reasonable  access
to inspect  and copy such books and  records  if the Term Debt  Secured  Parties
provide  prior notice (which shall be not less than two (2) business days except
in the case of emergency) and if such access is necessary to exercise its rights
and remedies in the Term Debt Priority Collateral.

                (e)   If the  Collateral  Agent or the  Revolving  Debt  Secured
Parties  receives any Term Debt  Priority  Collateral  or any  proceeds  thereof
(other than crops and  proceeds of crops which are not included in the Term Debt
Priority  Collateral)  in  which  the Term  Debt  Secured  Parties  have a prior
perfected  security  interest or if the  Collateral  Agent or Term Debt  Secured
Parties receives any Revolving Debt Priority  Collateral or any proceeds thereof
in which the  Revolving  Debt Secured  Parties have a prior  perfected  security
interest,  such party  shall (a) notify the other party in writing of the nature
of such receipt, the date of the receipt and the amount thereof; (b) deduct from
the  proceeds  received  any costs or expenses  (including  attorneys'  fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with the acquisition of such proceeds; (c) hold
the  remaining  amount of such  proceeds  in trust for the  benefit of the other
party until paid over to the other party;  and (d) pay the  remaining  amount of
such  proceeds or deliver the  applicable  Collateral  to the other party hereto
promptly upon receipt thereof.  If at any time payment,  in whole or in part, of
any Collateral or proceeds of Collateral  distributed  hereunder is rescinded or
must otherwise be restored or returned as a preference, fraudulent conveyance or
otherwise  under any  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or similar  law,  then each party

         Section 10.3.  Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Collateral Agent, the Agent and each of the
Secured  Parties  and  their  respective  successors  and  assigns,  whether  so

holder of Secured Obligations, wherever the context permits.

         Section 10.4. Consents, Amendment, Waivers. All amendments,  waivers or

Agreement,  the prevailing party shall be entitled to its reasonable  attorney's
fees (including the allocated costs of in-house counsel).

under the terms of the Credit Agreement, or when the Collateral Agent, the Agent

         Section  10.11.  Obligations  Several.  The  obligations of the Secured
Parties,  the Agent and the Collateral Agent hereunder are several.  The failure
of any  Secured  Party,  the  Agent or the  Collateral  Agent  to carry  out its
obligations  hereunder  shall not relieve any other Secured Party,  the Agent or

the Agent or the Collateral  Agent be responsible for the obligations of, or any
action taken or omitted by, any other  Person  hereunder.  Nothing  contained in
this  Agreement  shall be deemed to cause any  Secured  Party,  the Agent or the
Collateral  Agent to be considered a partner of or joint venturer with any other
Secured Party, the Collateral Agent, the Agent, the Subsidiary Guarantors or the
Company.

         IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  each  of the  parties  hereto  has  caused  this
