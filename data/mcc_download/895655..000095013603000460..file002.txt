     Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the
Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated.

         (1) INTEREST. Jarden Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
     "Company"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note
     at 9 3/4% per annum from November 1, 2002 until maturity and shall pay the
     Liquidated Damages, if any, payable pursuant to Section 5 of the
     Registration Rights Agreement referred to below. The Company will pay
     interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, semi-annually in arrears on May 1
     and November 1 of each year, or if any such day is not a Business Day, on
     the next succeeding Business Day (each, an "Interest Payment Date").
     Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which
     interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of
     issuance; provided that if there is no existing Default in the payment of
     interest, and if this Note is authenticated between a record date referred
     to on the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date,
     interest shall accrue from such next succeeding Interest Payment Date;
     provided, further, that the first Interest Payment Date shall be the first
     of May 1 or November 1 to occur after the date of issuance, unless such May
     1 or November 1 occurs within one calendar month of such date of issuance,
     in which case the first Interest Payment Date shall be the second of May 1
     or November 1 to occur after the date of issuance. The Company will pay
     interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any
     Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal and premium, if any, from time to time
     on demand at a rate that is 1% per annum in excess of the rate then in
     effect; it will pay interest (including post-petition interest in any
     proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest
     and Liquidated Damages, if any, (without regard to any applicable grace
     periods) from time to time on demand at the same rate to the extent lawful.
     Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
     months.

         (2) METHOD OF PAYMENT. The Company will pay interest on the Notes
     (except defaulted interest) and Liquidated Damages, if any, to the Persons
     who are registered Holders of Notes at the close of business on the April
     15 or October 15 next preceding the Interest Payment Date, even if such
     Notes are canceled after such record date and on or before such Interest
     Payment Date, except as provided in Section 2.12 of the Indenture with
     respect to defaulted interest. The Notes will be payable as to principal,
     premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest at the office or
     agency of the Company maintained for such purpose within or without the
     City and State of New York, or, at the option of the Company, payment of
     interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, may be made by check mailed to the
     Holders at their addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided
     that payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds will be
     required with respect to principal of and interest, premium and Liquidated
     Damages, if any, on, all Global Notes and any other Notes if any Holder of
     $1.0 million or more in aggregate principal amount of such Notes has
     provided wire transfer instructions to the Company or the Paying Agent for
     that purpose. Such payment will be in such coin or currency of the United
     States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of
     public and private debts.

         (3) PAYING AGENT AND REGISTRAR. Initially, The Bank of New York, the
     Trustee under the Indenture, will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The
     Company may change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice to any
     Holder. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act in any such
     capacity.

<PAGE>

         (4) INDENTURE. The Company issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as
     of April 24, 2002 (the "Indenture") among the Company, the Guarantors and
     the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture,
     except Section 3.08 thereof, and those made part of the Indenture by
     reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (15 U.S. Code
     ss.ss. 77aaa-77bbbb). The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders
     are referred to the Indenture and such Act for a statement of such terms.
     To the extent any provision of this Note conflicts with the express
     provisions of the Indenture, the provisions of the Indenture shall govern
     and be controlling. The Notes are obligations of the Company unlimited in
     aggregate principal amount.

         (5) OPTIONAL REDEMPTION.

     Except as set forth in subparagraph (b) of this Paragraph 5, the Company
will not have the option to redeem the Notes prior to May 1, 2007. Thereafter,
the Company will have the option to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, upon
not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices
(expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, thereon to the applicable
redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on May 1
of the years indicated below:

        Year                                                          Percentage
        ----                                                          ----------
        2007...................................................        104.875%
        2008...................................................        103.250%
        2009...................................................        101.625%
        2010 and thereafter....................................        100.000%

     (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph 5,
at any time prior to May 1, 2005, the Company may redeem Notes with the net
proceeds of a public equity offering at a redemption price equal to 109.750% of
the aggregate principal amount thereof; provided that at least 65% in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture remains outstanding
immediately after the occurrence of such redemption and that such redemption
occurs within 45 days of the date of the closing of such public equity offering.

         (6) [Intentionally omitted.]

         (7) MANDATORY REDEMPTION.

     The Company will not be required to make mandatory redemption or sinking
fund payments with respect to the Notes.

         (8) REPURCHASE AT OPTION OF HOLDER.

            (a) If there is a Change of Control, the Company will be required to
     make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to repurchase all or any part
     (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) of each Holder's Notes at
     a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof
     plus accrued and unpaid interest and Liquidated Damages thereon, if any, to
     the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 10 days
     following any Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each
     Holder setting forth the procedures governing the Change of Control Offer
     as required by the Indenture.

<PAGE>

            (b) If the Company or a Subsidiary consummates any Asset Sales,
     within 30 days of each date on which the aggregate amount of Excess
     Proceeds exceeds $5 million, the Company will commence an offer to all
     Holders of Notes and all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu
     with the Notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in the
     Indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of
     sales of assets (an "Asset Sale Offer") pursuant to Section 3.10 of the
     Indenture to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes (including any
     Additional Notes) and other pari passu Indebtedness that may be purchased
     out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to
     100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and
     Liquidated Damages thereon, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of
     such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.
     To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes (including any Additional
     Notes) and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale
     Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company (or such Subsidiary)
     may use such deficiency for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the
     Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other pari passu
     Indebtedness surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess
     Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and other pari passu
     Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Holders of Notes that are
     the subject of an offer to purchase will receive an Asset Sale Offer from
     the Company prior to any related purchase date and may elect to have such
     Notes purchased by completing the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect
     Purchase" on the reverse of the Notes.

         (9) NOTICE OF REDEMPTION. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least
     30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder
     whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address. Notes in
     denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole
     multiples of $1,000, unless all of the Notes held by a Holder are to be
     redeemed. On and after the redemption date interest ceases to accrue on
     Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.

         (10) DENOMINATIONS, TRANSFER, EXCHANGE. The Notes are in registered
     form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of
     $1,000. The transfer of Notes may be registered and Notes may be exchanged
     as provided in the Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee may require a
     Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and
     transfer documents and the Company may require a Holder to pay any taxes
     and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Company need
     not exchange or register the transfer of any Note or portion of a Note
     selected for redemption, except for the unredeemed portion of any Note
     being redeemed in part. Also, the Company need not exchange or register the
     transfer of any Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes
     to be redeemed or during the period between a record date and the
     corresponding Interest Payment Date.

         (11) PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. The registered Holder of a Note may be
     treated as its owner for all purposes.

         (12) AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER. Subject to certain exceptions,
     the Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes may be amended or
     supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in
     principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and Additional Notes, if
     any, voting as a single class, and any existing default or compliance with
     any provision of the Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes may
     be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount
     of the then outstanding Notes and Additional Notes, if any, voting as a
     single class. Without the consent of any Holder of a Note, the Indenture,
     the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes may be amended or supplemented to
     cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated
     Notes in addition to or in


<PAGE>

     place of certificated Notes or to alter the provisions of Article 2 of the
     Indenture (including the related definitions) in a manner that does not
     materially adversely affect any Holder, to provide for the assumption of
     the Company's or any Guarantor's obligations to Holders of the Notes in
     case of a merger or consolidation, to make any change that would provide
     any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of the Notes or that does
     not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such
     Holder, to comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or
     maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act,
     to provide for the Issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the
     limitations set forth in the Indenture, or to allow any Guarantor to
     execute a supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or a Subsidiary
     Guarantee with respect to the Notes.

         (13) DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES. Events of Default include: (i) the Company
     defaults for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on, or Liquidated
     Damages with respect to, the Notes whether or not prohibited by the
     subordination provisions of the Indenture; (ii) the Company defaults in the
     payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the
     principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes (including, but not limited
     to, amounts due in connection with Mandatory Redemption), whether or not
     prohibited by the subordination provisions of the Indenture, (iii) the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries fails to comply with the provisions of
     Section 4.10 (other than the requirement that the resolution of the Board
     of Directors pursuant to clause (2) of the first paragraph of Section 4.10
     be set forth in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee, with
     respect to which the Event of Default described in clause (5) of the
     paragraph will apply), 4.15 or 5.01 of the Indenture; (iv) the Company or
     any of its Subsidiaries fails to comply with the provisions of Section 4.07
     or 4.09 of the Indenture such failure continues for 30 days; (v) the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries fails to observe or perform any other
     covenant, representation, warranty or other agreement in the Indenture or
     the Notes for 60 days after notice to the Company by the Trustee or the
     Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
     outstanding voting as a single class; (vi) default under certain other
     agreements relating to Indebtedness of the Company which default results in
     the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity; (vii)
     certain final judgments against the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
     for the payment of money that remain undischarged for a period of 60 days;
     (viii) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the
     Company, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any
     group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a
     Significant Subsidiary and (ix) except as permitted by the Indenture, any
     Subsidiary Guarantee shall be held in any judicial proceeding to be
     unenforceable or invalid or shall cease for any reason to be in full force
     and effect or any Guarantor or any Person acting on its behalf shall deny
     or disaffirm its obligations under such Guarantor's Subsidiary Guarantee.
     If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the
     Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
     may declare all the Notes to be due and payable. Notwithstanding the
     foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events
     of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding Notes will become due and
     payable without further action or notice. Holders may not enforce the
     Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to
     certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then
     outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or
     power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any
     continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of
     Default relating to the payment of principal or interest or Liquidated
     Damages) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The
     Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
     outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of
     the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its
     consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of
     Default in the payment of interest or Liquidated Damages on, or the
     principal of, the Notes; provided, however, that at any time after a
     declaration of acceleration under the


<PAGE>

     Indenture, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has
     been obtained by the Trustee, the Holders of a majority in aggregate
     principal amount of the outstanding Notes, by written notice to the Company
     and the Trustee, may rescind such declaration and its consequences given
     certain circumstances as provided in the Indenture. The Company is required
     to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with
     the Indenture, and the Company is required upon becoming aware of any
     Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement
     specifying such Default or Event of Default.

         (14) SUBORDINATION. Payment of principal, interest and premium and
     Liquidated Damages, if any, on the Notes is subordinated to the prior
     payment of Senior Debt on the terms provided in the Indenture.

         (15) TRUSTEE DEALINGS WITH COMPANY. The Trustee, in its individual or
     any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform
     services for the Company or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the
     Company or its Affiliates, as if it were not the Trustee.

         (16) NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. A director, officer, employee,
     incorporator or stockholder, of the Company or any of the Guarantors, as
     such, will not have any liability for any obligations of the Company or
     such Guarantor under the Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Indenture
     or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations
     or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all
     such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for
     the issuance of the Notes.

         (17) AUTHENTICATION. This Note will not be valid until authenticated by
     the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent.

         (18) ABBREVIATIONS. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of
     a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (=
     tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of
     survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A
     (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).

         (19) ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF RESTRICTED GLOBAL NOTES AND
     RESTRICTED DEFINITIVE NOTES. In addition to the rights provided to Holders
     of Notes under the Indenture, Holders of Restricted Global Notes and
     Restricted Definitive Notes will have all the rights set forth in the
     Registration Rights Agreement dated as of April 24, 2002, between the
     Company, the Guarantors and the other parties named on the signature pages
     thereof or, in the case of Additional Notes, Holders of Restricted Global
     Notes and Restricted Definitive Notes will have the rights set forth in one
     or more registration rights agreements, if any, among the Company, the
     Guarantors and the other parties thereto, relating to rights given by the
     Company and the Guarantors to the purchasers of any Additional Notes
     (collectively, the "Registration Rights Agreement").

         (20) CUSIP NUMBERS. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the
     Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has
     caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and the Trustee may use
     CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No
     representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed
     on the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may
     be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.
