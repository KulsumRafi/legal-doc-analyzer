</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Executive desires and is willing to accept employment with
the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants
contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Term</u>. The Company hereby agrees to continue the employment of the
Executive and the Executive hereby agrees to continue to serve the Company
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as Executive Vice
President of the Company, or in such other position with the Company of at
least commensurate responsibility and authority in all material respects, for a
term commencing on the Effective Date hereof and expiring on December&nbsp;15, 2004,
unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section&nbsp;5 hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Executive shall serve in said office(s) at the pleasure of the
Company&#146;s Board of Directors (the &#147;Board of Directors&#148;) and the Executive may
be removed from said office(s) at any time with or without Cause, as
hereinafter defined, pursuant to Sections&nbsp;5(b) or 5(d) hereof; provided that
any such removal shall be without prejudice to any contract rights the
Executive may have hereunder. Subject to Section&nbsp;8(a)(6) and Section&nbsp;8(b)
hereof, this Agreement shall expire by its terms on December&nbsp;15, 2004.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Duties and Responsibilities</u>. The Executive&#146;s duties hereunder shall be
those which shall be prescribed by the Company&#146;s Bylaws, as amended from time
to time, and by the Board of Directors or any committee thereof from time to
time and shall include such executive authority, duties, powers and
responsibilities as customarily attend the office as Executive Vice President
of a company comparable to the Company. The Executive shall discharge such
duties consistent with sound business practices and in accordance with law and
the Company&#146;s general employment policies, in each case, as in effect from time
to time, in all material respects and the Executive shall use best efforts to
promote the best interests of the Company. During the term of this Agreement,
the Executive&#146;s position (including the Executive&#146;s status and reporting
requirements), authority, duties, powers and responsibilities shall at all
times be at least commensurate in all material respects with the most
significant of those held, exercised or assigned to the Executive as of the

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">to the business of
the Company in order to perform such assigned duties faithfully, competently
and diligently. It is understood and agreed between the parties that the
Executive may (i)&nbsp;engage in charitable and community activities, including
serving on boards of directors or trustees of and holding other leadership
positions in non-profit organizations unless the objectives and requirements of
such positions are determined by the Board of Directors to be inconsistent with
the performance of the Executive&#146;s duties hereunder, and, (ii)&nbsp;manage personal
investments, so long as such activities do not interfere or conflict with the
Executive&#146;s performance of responsibilities and obligations hereunder. It is
expressly agreed that any such activities engaged in by the Executive as of the
Effective Date shall not thereafter be deemed to interfere with the Executive&#146;s
obligations and responsibilities hereunder. The Executive agrees that the
approval of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof shall be required
before the Executive first accepts a position as director of any for-profit
corporation after the date hereof.
