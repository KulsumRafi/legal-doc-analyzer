that is the purchaser, assignee or transferee of any such assets and properties,

including 2.2(h) of the Loan Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and

                  (b)      Perfection of Security Interests.

                           (i)      Each Borrower irrevocably and
unconditionally authorizes Lender (or its agent) to file at any time and from
time to time such financing statements with respect to the Collateral naming
Lender or its designee as the secured party and such Borrower as debtor, as
Lender may require, and including any other information with respect to such
Borrower or otherwise required by part 5 of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial
Code of such jurisdiction as Lender may determine, together with any amendment
and continuations with respect thereto, which authorization shall apply to all
financing statements filed on, prior to or after the date hereof. Each Borrower
hereby ratifies and approves all financing statements naming Lender or its
designee as secured party and such Borrower as debtor with respect to the
Collateral (and any amendments with respect to such financing statements) filed
by or on behalf of Lender prior to the date hereof and ratifies and confirms the
authorization of Lender to file such financing statements (and amendments, if
any). Each Borrower hereby authorizes Lender to adopt on behalf of such Borrower
any symbol required for authenticating any electronic filing. In the event that
the description of the collateral in any financing statement naming Lender or
its designee as the

                                     - 20 -

<PAGE>

secured party and any Borrower as debtor includes assets and properties of such
Borrower that do not at any time constitute Collateral, whether hereunder, under
any of the other Financing Agreements or otherwise, the filing of such financing
statement shall nonetheless be deemed authorized by such Borrower to the extent
of the Collateral included in such description and it shall not render the
financing statement ineffective as to any of the Collateral or otherwise affect
the financing statement as it applies to any of the Collateral. In no event
shall any Borrower at any time file, or permit or cause to be filed, any
correction statement or termination statement with respect to any financing
statement (or amendment or continuation with respect thereto) naming Lender or
its designee as secured party and such Borrower as debtor.

                           (ii)     Subject to Section 7(c) hereof, each
Borrower does not have any chattel paper (whether tangible or electronic) or
instruments as of the date hereof, except as set forth in Schedule 7(b) attached
hereto. In the event that any Borrower shall be entitled to or shall receive any
chattel paper or instrument after the date hereof, Borrowers shall promptly
notify Lender thereof in writing. Promptly upon the receipt thereof by or on
behalf of any Borrower (including by any agent or representative), such Borrower
shall deliver, or cause to be delivered to Lender, all tangible chattel paper
and instruments that such Borrower has or may at any time acquire, accompanied
by such instruments of transfer or assignment duly executed in blank as Lender
may from time to time specify, in each case except as Lender may otherwise
agree. At Lender's option, each Borrower shall, or Lender may at any time on
behalf of any Borrower, cause the original of any such instrument or chattel
paper to be conspicuously marked in a form and manner acceptable to Lender with
the following legend referring to chattel paper or instruments as applicable:
"This [chattel paper][instrument] is subject to the security interest of
Congress Financial Corporation and any sale, transfer, assignment or encumbrance
of this [chattel paper][instrument] violates the rights of such secured party."

                           (iii)    In the event that any Borrower shall at any
time hold or acquire an interest in any electronic chattel paper or any
"transferable record" (as such term is defined in Section 201 of the Federal
Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act or in Section 16 of
the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act as in effect in any relevant
jurisdiction), such Borrower shall promptly notify Lender thereof in writing.
Promptly upon Lender's written request, such Borrower shall take, or cause to be
taken, such actions as Lender may request to give Lender control of such
electronic chattel paper under Section 9-105 of the UCC and control of such
transferable record under Section 201 of the Federal Electronic Signatures in
Global and National Commerce Act or, as the case may be, Section 16 of the
Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, as in effect in such jurisdiction.

                           (iv)     Subject to Section 7(c) hereof, each
Borrower does not have any deposit accounts as of the date hereof, except as set
forth in Schedule 7(b) attached hereto or as set forth in the Deposit Account
Control Agreement to be entered into among Borrowers, certain Guarantors, Lender
and Allfirst Bank. Borrowers shall not, directly or indirectly, after the date
hereof open, establish or maintain any deposit account unless each of the
following conditions is satisfied: (A) Lender shall have received not less than
five (5) Banking Days' prior written notice of the intention of any Borrower to
open or establish such account which notice shall specify in reasonable detail
and specificity acceptable to Lender the name of the account, the owner of the
account, the name and address of the bank at which such account is to be opened
or established, the individual at such bank with whom such

                                     - 21 -

<PAGE>

Borrower is dealing and the purpose of the account, (B) the bank where such
account is opened or maintained shall be reasonably acceptable to Lender, and
(C) on or before the opening of such deposit account, such Borrower shall as
Lender may specify either (1) deliver to Lender a Deposit Account Control
Agreement with respect to such deposit account duly authorized, executed and
delivered by such Borrower and the bank at which such deposit account is opened
and maintained or (2) arrange for Lender to become the customer of the bank with
respect to the deposit account on terms and conditions acceptable to Lender. The
terms of this subsection (iv) shall not apply to deposit accounts specifically
and exclusively used for payroll, payroll taxes and other employee wage and
benefit payments to or for the benefit of any Borrower's or Guarantor's salaried
employees.

                           (v)      As of the date hereof, no Borrower owns or
holds, directly or indirectly, beneficially or as record owner or both, any
investment property, as of the date hereof, or has any investment account,
securities account, commodity account or other similar account with any bank or
other financial institution or other securities intermediary or commodity
intermediary as of the date hereof, in each case except as set forth in Schedule
7(b) attached hereto subject to Section 7(c) hereof.

                                    (A)     In the event that any Borrower shall
be entitled to or shall at any time after the date hereof hold or acquire any
certificated securities, such Borrower shall promptly endorse, assign and
deliver the same to Lender, accompanied by such instruments of transfer or
assignment duly executed in blank as Lender may from time to time specify. If
any securities, now or hereafter acquired by any Borrower are uncertificated and
are issued to such Borrower or its nominee directly by the issuer thereof, such
Borrower shall immediately notify Lender thereof and shall as Lender may specify
in writing, either, in Lender's good faith judgment (1) cause the issuer to
agree to comply with instructions from Lender as to such securities, without
further consent of any Borrower or such nominee, or (2) arrange for Lender to
become the registered owner of the securities.

                                    (B)     Borrowers shall not, directly or
indirectly, after the date hereof open, establish or maintain any investment
account, securities account, commodity account or any other similar account
(other than a deposit account) with any securities intermediary or commodity
intermediary unless each of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) Lender
shall have received not less than five (5) Banking Days' prior written notice of
the intention of Borrower to open or establish such account which notice shall
specify in reasonable detail and specificity acceptable to Lender the name of
the account, the owner of the account, the name and address of the securities
intermediary or commodity intermediary at which such account is to be opened or
established, the individual at such intermediary with whom such Borrower is
dealing and the purpose of the account, (2) the securities intermediary or
commodity intermediary (as the case may be) where such account is opened or
maintained shall be acceptable to Lender, and (3) on or before the opening of
such investment account, securities account or other similar account a
securities Intermediary or commodity intermediary, such Borrower shall as Lender
may specify either (i) execute and deliver, and cause to be executed and

                           (vi)     Borrowers are not the beneficiary or
otherwise entitled to any right to payment under any letter of credit, banker's
acceptance or similar instrument as of the date hereof, except as set forth in
Schedule 7(b) attached hereto subject to Section 7(c) hereof. In the event that
any Borrower shall be entitled to or shall receive any right to payment under
any letter of credit, banker's acceptance or any similar instrument, whether as
beneficiary thereof or otherwise after the date hereof, such Borrower shall
promptly notify Lender thereof in writing. Such Borrower shall immediately, as
Lender may specify, either (A) deliver, or cause to be delivered to Lender, with
respect to any such letter of credit, banker's acceptance or similar instrument,
the written agreement of the issuer and any other nominated person obligated to
make any payment in respect thereof (including any confirming or negotiating
bank), in form and substance satisfactory to Lender in its good faith judgment,
consenting to the assignment of the proceeds of the letter of credit to Lender
by such Borrower and agreeing to make all payments thereon directly to Lender or
as Lender may otherwise direct or (B) cause Lender to become, at Borrowers'
expense, the transferee beneficiary of the letter of credit, banker's acceptance

promptly notify Lender thereof in writing, which notice shall (A) set forth in
reasonable detail the basis for and nature of such commercial tort claim and (B)
include the express grant by such Borrower to Lender of a security interest in
such commercial tort claim (and the proceeds thereof). In the event that such
notice does not include such grant of a security interest, the sending thereof
by such Borrower to Lender shall be deemed to constitute such grant to Lender.
Upon the sending of such notice, any commercial tort claim described therein
shall constitute part of the Collateral and shall be deemed included therein.
Without limiting the authorization of Lender provided in Section 7(b)(i) hereof
or otherwise arising by the execution by such Borrower of this Agreement or any
of the other Financing Agreements, Lender is hereby irrevocably authorized from
time to time and at any time to file such financing statements naming Lender or
its designee as secured party and such Borrower as debtor, or any amendments to
any financing statements, covering any such commercial tort claim as Collateral.
In addition, each Borrower shall promptly upon Lender's request, execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to Lender such other agreements,
documents and instruments as Lender may require in connection with such
commercial tort claim.

                           (viii)   Borrowers do not have any goods, documents
of title or other Collateral in the custody, control or possession of a third
party as of the date hereof, except as set forth in Schedule 7(b) attached
hereto subject to Section 7(c) hereof and except for goods in transit to a
location of a Borrower or a Guarantor permitted in the Loan Agreement or the
other Financing Agreements in the ordinary course of business of such Borrower
or a Guarantor in the possession of the carrier transporting such goods. In the
event that any goods, documents of title or other Collateral are at any time
after the date hereof in the custody, control or possession of any other person
not referred to in Schedule 7(b) attached hereto or such carriers, Borrowers
shall promptly notify Lender thereof in writing. Promptly upon Lender's request,
Borrowers shall deliver to Lender a Collateral Access Agreement duly authorized,
executed and delivered by such person and the Borrower that is the owner of such
Collateral.

                           (ix)     Borrowers shall take any other actions
reasonably requested by Lender from time to time to cause the attachment,
perfection and first priority of, and the ability of Lender to enforce, the
security interest of Lender in any and all of the Collateral, including, without
limitation, (A) executing, delivering and, where appropriate, filing financing
statements and amendments relating thereto under the UCC or other applicable
law, to the extent, if any, that any Borrower's signature thereon is required
therefor, (B) at Lender's written request, causing Lender's name to be noted as
secured party on any certificate of title for a titled good if such notation is
a condition to attachment, perfection or priority of, or ability of Lender to
enforce, the security interest of Lender in such Collateral, (C) complying with
any provision of any statute, regulation or treaty of the United States as to
any Collateral if compliance with such provision is a condition to attachment,
perfection or priority of, or ability of Lender to enforce, the security
interest of Lender in such Collateral, (D) obtaining the consents and approvals
of any Governmental Authority or third party, including, without limitation, any
consent of any licensor, lessor or other person obligated on Collateral, and (E)
taking all actions required by any earlier versions of the UCC or by other law,
as applicable in any relevant jurisdiction.

                  (c)      Delivery of Schedule 7(b. Borrowers and Guarantors
hereby agree to deliver, in form and substance satisfactory to Lender, on or

accordance with Section 7(b) hereof. The representations and warranties
contained in Section 7(b) hereof as to matters, events and information set forth

Borrowers and Guarantors only when Schedule 7(b) is delivered to Lender.

set forth above may be pleaded as a full and complete defense and may be used as
a basis for an injunction against any action, suit or other proceeding which may
be instituted, prosecuted or attempted in breach of the provisions of such
release.

                           (iii)    Each Borrower and Guarantor agrees that no
fact, event, circumstance, evidence or transaction which could now be asserted

unconditionally and irrevocably, jointly and severally, covenants and agrees
with each Releasee that it will not sue (at law, in equity, in any regulatory

                  (a)      Subject to the satisfaction of each of the conditions
precedent set forth herein, Lender hereby waives any Event of Default under
Section 7(b) of the Loan Agreement arising as a result of the failure of
Borrowers and Guarantors to comply with the terms of Sections 6.2, 6.5 and 6.6
of the Loan Agreement by failing to obtain the consent of Lender in connection
with the formation of Hanover Gifts in December 2000.

                  (b)      Lender has not waived, is not by this Amendment
waiving, and has no intention of waiving any Event of Default which may have
occurred on or prior to the date hereof, whether or not continuing on the date
hereof, or which may occur after the date hereof (whether the same or similar to
the Events of Default referred to in Section 16(a) hereof or otherwise), other
than the Existing Default. The foregoing waiver shall not be construed as a bar
to or a waiver of any other or further Event of Default on any future occasion,
whether similar in kind or otherwise and shall not constitute a waiver, express
or implied, of any of the rights and remedies of Lender arising under the terms
of the Loan Agreement or any other Financing Agreements on any future occasion
or otherwise.

         17.      Fees. In addition to all other fees, charges, interest and
expenses payable by Borrowers to Lender under the Loan Agreement and the other

         18.      Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Each Borrower and
Guarantor represents, warrants and covenants with, to and in favor of Lender as
follows, which representations, warranties and covenants are continuing and
shall survive the execution and delivery hereof, the truth and accuracy of, or
compliance with each, together with the representations, warranties and

2002 Reorganization Agreements, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Hanover 2002 Reorganization Agreements, nor compliance with
the provisions of the Hanover 2002 Reorganization Agreements, shall result in

other than in any such jurisdiction which is designated as "pending", which are

at their present fair salable value are, and will be, greater than the
indebtedness of each such Borrower and Guarantor, respectively, and including
subordinated and contingent liabilities computed at the amount which, to the
best of each such Borrower's and Guarantor's, represents an amount which can
reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.

any State corporation law, or any other law or regulation or any order or decree
of any court or governmental instrumentality in any respect, or (ii) does or
will conflict with or result in the breach of, or constitute a default in any

estate leases, intellectual property licenses and equipment leases, or (iii)
does or will violate any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or
Certificate of Formation, as applicable, or By-Laws or Operating Agreement, as
applicable, of any Borrower or Guarantor.

governmental or public body or authority, other than the filing of UCC financing
statements and filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and
