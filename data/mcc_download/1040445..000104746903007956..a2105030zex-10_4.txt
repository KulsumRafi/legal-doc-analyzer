     Letter of Credit Amount and the Series 2002-1 Available Reserve Account
     Amount will be less than the Principal Deficit Amount on any Distribution

          Section 2.6 ADMINISTRATOR'S FAILURE TO INSTRUCT THE TRUSTEE TO MAKE A
DEPOSIT OR PAYMENT. If the Administrator fails to give notice or instructions to
make any payment from or deposit into the Collection Account required to be
given by the Administrator, at the time specified in the Administration
Agreement or any other Related Document (including applicable grace periods),
the Trustee shall make such payment or deposit into or from the Collection
Account

                                      -31-
<Page>

without such notice or instruction from the Administrator, PROVIDED that the
Administrator, upon request of the Trustee, promptly provides the Trustee with
all information necessary to allow the Trustee to make such a payment or
deposit. When any payment or deposit hereunder or under any other Related
Document is required to be made by the Trustee or the Paying Agent at or prior

          Section 2.7 SERIES-2002-1 RESERVE ACCOUNT. (a) ESTABLISHMENT OF SERIES
2002-1 RESERVE Account. AFC-II shall establish and maintain in the name of the
Series 2002-1 Agent for the benefit of the Series 2002-1 Noteholders and the
Surety Provider, or cause to be established and maintained, an account (the
"Series 2002-1 Reserve Account"), bearing a designation clearly indicating that
the funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of the Series 2002-1
Noteholders and the Surety Provider. The Series 2002-1 Reserve Account shall be
maintained (i) with a Qualified Institution, or (ii) as a segregated trust
account with the corporate trust department of a depository institution or trust
company having corporate trust powers and acting as trustee for funds deposited
in the Series 2002-1 Reserve Account; PROVIDED that, if at any time such
Qualified Institution is no longer a Qualified Institution or the credit rating
of any securities issued by such depositary institution or trust company shall
be reduced to below BBB- by S&P or Baa2 by Moody's, then AFC-II shall, within 30
days of such reduction, establish a new Series 2002-1 Reserve Account with a new
Qualified Institution. If the Series 2002-1 Reserve Account is not maintained in
accordance with the previous sentence, AFC-II shall establish a new Series
2002-1 Reserve Account, within ten (10) Business Days after obtaining knowledge
of such fact, which complies with such sentence, and shall instruct the Series
2002-1 Agent in writing to transfer all cash and investments from the
non-qualifying Series 2002-1 Reserve Account into the new Series 2002-1 Reserve
Account. Initially, the Series 2002-1 Reserve Account will be established with
The Bank of New York.

          (b)    ADMINISTRATION OF THE SERIES 2002-1 RESERVE ACCOUNT. The
Administrator may instruct the institution maintaining the Series 2002-1 Reserve
Account to invest funds on deposit in the Series 2002-1 Reserve Account from
time to time in Permitted Investments; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such
investment shall mature not later than the Business Day prior to the
Distribution Date following the date on which such funds were received, unless
any Permitted Investment held in the Series 2002-1 Reserve Account is held with
the Paying Agent, then such investment may mature on such Distribution Date and
such funds shall be available for withdrawal on or prior to such Distribution
Date. All such Permitted Investments will be credited to the Series 2002-1
Reserve Account.

          (c)    EARNINGS FROM SERIES 2002-1 RESERVE ACCOUNT. All interest and
earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) paid on funds on deposit in the
Series 2002-1 Reserve Account shall be deemed to be on deposit therein and
available for distribution.

          (d)    SERIES 2002-1 RESERVE ACCOUNT CONSTITUTES ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL
FOR SERIES 2002-1 NOTES. In order to secure and provide for the repayment and
payment of the AFC-II Obligations with respect to the Series 2002-1 Notes,
AFC-II hereby grants a security interest in and assigns, pledges, grants,
transfers and sets over to the Series 2002-1 Agent, for the benefit of the
Series 2002-1 Noteholders and the Surety Provider, all of AFC-II's right, title
and interest in and to the following (whether now or hereafter existing or
acquired): (i) the Series 2002-1

any time and from time to time with monies in the Series 2002-1 Reserve Account,
whether constituting securities, instruments, general intangibles, investment

instruments and other property from time to time received, receivable or
otherwise distributed in respect of or in exchange for the Series 2002-1 Reserve
Account, the funds on deposit therein from time to time or the investments made
with such funds; and (vi) all proceeds of any and all of the foregoing,
including, without limitation, cash (the items in the foregoing clauses (i)
through (vi) are referred to, collectively, as the "Series 2002-1 Reserve
Account Collateral"). The Series 2002-1 Agent shall possess all right, title and
interest in and to all funds on deposit from time to time in the Series 2002-1
Reserve Account and in all proceeds thereof, and shall be the only person
authorized to originate entitlement orders in respect of the Series 2002-1

          (e)    SERIES 2002-1 RESERVE ACCOUNT SURPLUS. In the event that the
Series 2002-1 Reserve Account Surplus on any Distribution Date, after giving
effect to all withdrawals from the Series 2002-1 Reserve Account, is greater
than zero, the Trustee, acting in accordance with the written instructions of
the Administrator (with a copy of such written instructions to be provided by
the Administrator to the Surety Provider) pursuant to the Administration
Agreement, shall withdraw from the Series 2002-1 Reserve Account an amount equal
to the Series 2002-1 Reserve Account Surplus and shall pay such amount to
AFC-II.

          (f)    TERMINATION OF SERIES 2002-1 RESERVE ACCOUNT. Upon the
termination of the Indenture pursuant to Section 11.1 of the Base Indenture, the
Trustee, acting in accordance with the written instructions of the
Administrator, after the prior payment of all amounts owing to the Series 2002-1
Noteholders and to the Surety Provider and payable from the Series 2002-1
Reserve Account as provided herein, shall withdraw from the Series 2002-1
Reserve Account all amounts on deposit therein for payment to AFC-II.

          Section 2.8 SERIES 2002-1 LETTERS OF CREDIT AND SERIES 2002-1 CASH
COLLATERAL ACCOUNT.

          (a)    SERIES 2002-1 LETTERS OF CREDIT AND SERIES 2002-1 CASH
     COLLATERAL ACCOUNT CONSTITUTE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL FOR SERIES 2002-1
     NOTES. In order to secure and provide for the repayment and payment of
     AFC-II's obligations with respect to the Series 2002-1 Notes, AFC-II hereby
     grants a security interest in and assigns, pledges, grants, transfers and
     sets over to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Series 2002-1 Noteholders

     Series 2002-1 Letter of Credit; (ii) the Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral
     Account, including any security entitlement thereto; (iii) all funds on
     deposit in the Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account from time to time;

     deposit therein from time to time; (v) all investments made at any time and
     from time to time with monies in the Series

                                      -33-
<Page>

     2002-1 Cash Collateral Account, whether constituting securities,
     instruments, general intangibles, investment property, financial assets or
     other property; (vi) all interest, dividends, cash, instruments and other
     property from time to time received, receivable or otherwise distributed in
     respect of or in exchange for the Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account,
     the funds on deposit therein from time to time or the investments made with
     such funds; and (vii) all proceeds of any and all of the foregoing,
     including, without limitation, cash (the items in the foregoing clauses
     (ii) through (vii) are referred to, collectively, as the "Series 2002-1
     Cash Collateral Account Collateral"). The Trustee shall, for the benefit of
     the Series 2002-1 Noteholders and the Surety Provider, possess all right,
     title and interest in all funds on deposit from time to time in the Series
     2002-1 Cash Collateral Account and in all proceeds thereof, and shall be
     the only person authorized to originate entitlement orders in respect of
     the Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account. The Series 2002-1 Cash
     Collateral Account shall be under the sole dominion and control of the
     Trustee for the benefit of the Series 2002-1 Noteholders and the Surety
     Provider.

          (b)    SERIES 2002-1 LETTER OF CREDIT EXPIRATION DATE. If prior to the
     date which is ten (10) days prior to the then scheduled Series 2002-1
     Letter of Credit Expiration Date with respect to any Series 2002-1 Letter
     of Credit, excluding the amount available to be drawn under such Series
     2002-1 Letter of Credit but taking into account each substitute Series
     2002-1 Letter of Credit which has been obtained from a Series 2002-1
     Eligible Letter of Credit Provider and is in full force and effect on such
     date, the Series 2002-1 Enhancement Amount would be equal to or more than
     the Series 2002-1 Required Enhancement Amount and the Series 2002-1
     Liquidity Amount would be equal to or greater than the Series 2002-1
     Required Liquidity Amount, then the Administrator shall notify the Trustee

     than the Series 2002-1 Required Enhancement Amount or the Series 2002-1
     Liquidity Amount would be less than the Series 2002-1 Required Liquidity

     by a Certificate of Termination Date Demand and shall cause the Termination
     Date Disbursement to be deposited in the Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral

          (f)    ESTABLISHMENT OF SERIES 2002-1 CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNT. On or
     prior to the date of any drawing under a Series 2002-1 Letter of Credit

     maintained, an account (the "Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account"),
     bearing a designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein
     are held for the benefit of the Series 2002-1 Noteholders and the Surety

     the corporate trust department of a depository institution or trust company
     having corporate trust powers and acting as trustee for funds deposited in

     AFC-II shall instruct the Trustee in writing to transfer all cash and
     investments from the non-qualifying Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account
     into the new Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account.

          (g)    ADMINISTRATION OF THE SERIES 2002-1 CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNT.
     AFC-II may instruct (by standing instructions or otherwise) the institution
     maintaining the Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account to invest funds on
     deposit in the Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account from time to time in
     Permitted Investments; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such investment shall
     mature not later than the Business Day prior to the Distribution Date
     following the date on which such funds were received, unless any Permitted
     Investment held in the Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account is held with

     so long as such funds shall be available for withdrawal on or prior to such
     Distribution Date. All such Permitted Investments will be credited to the
     Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account and any such Permitted Investments
     that constitute (i) physical property (and that is not either a United
     States security entitlement or a security entitlement) shall be physically
     delivered to the Trustee; (ii) United States security entitlements or
     security entitlements shall be controlled by the Trustee pending maturity
     or disposition, and (iii) uncertificated securities (and not United States
     security entitlements) shall be delivered to the Trustee by causing the
     Trustee to become the registered holder of such securities. The Trustee
     shall, at the expense of AFC-II, take such action as is required to
     maintain the Trustee's security interest in the Permitted Investments
     credited to the Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account. AFC-II shall not
     direct the Trustee to dispose of (or permit the disposal of) any Permitted
     Investments prior to the maturity thereof to the extent such disposal would
     result in a loss of principal of such Permitted Investment. In the absence
     of written investment instructions hereunder, funds on deposit in the
     Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account shall remain uninvested.

          (h)    EARNINGS FROM SERIES 2002-1 CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNT. All
     interest and earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) paid on funds
     on deposit in the Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account shall be deemed to
     be on deposit therein and available for distribution.

          (i)    SERIES 2002-1 CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNT SURPLUS. In the event
     that the Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account Surplus on any Distribution
     Date (or, after the Series 2002-1 Letter of Credit Termination Date, on any
     date) is greater than zero, the Trustee, acting in accordance with the
     written instructions (a copy of which shall be provided by the
     Administrator to the Surety Provider) of the Administrator, shall withdraw
     from the Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account an amount equal to the
     Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account Surplus and shall pay such amount:
     FIRST, to the Series 2002-1 Letter of Credit Providers to the extent of any
     unreimbursed drawings under the related Series 2002-1 Reimbursement
     Agreement, for application in accordance with the provisions of the related
     Series 2002-1 Reimbursement Agreement, and, SECOND, to AFC-II any remaining
     amount.

          (j)    POST-SERIES 2002-1 LETTER OF CREDIT TERMINATION DATE
     WITHDRAWALS FROM THE SERIES 2002-1 CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNT. If the Surety
     Provider notifies the Trustee in writing that the Surety Provider shall
     have paid a Preference Amount (as defined in the Surety Bond) under the
     Surety Bond, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the
     next succeeding sentence, the Trustee shall withdraw from the Series 2002-1
     Cash Collateral Account and pay to the Surety Provider an amount equal to
     the lesser of (i) the Series 2002-1 Available Cash Collateral Account
     Amount on such date and (ii) such Preference Amount. Prior to any
     withdrawal from the Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account pursuant to this
     Section 2.8(j), the Trustee shall have received a certified copy of the
     order requiring the return of such Preference Amount.

          (k)    TERMINATION OF SERIES 2002-1 CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNT. Upon the
     termination of this Supplement in accordance

                                      -37-
<Page>

     with its terms, the Trustee, acting in accordance with the written
     instructions of the Administrator, after the prior payment of all amounts
     owing to the Series 2002-1 Noteholders and to the Surety Provider and
     payable from the Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account as provided herein,
     shall withdraw from the Series 2002-1 Cash Collateral Account all amounts
     on deposit therein (to the extent not withdrawn pursuant to Section 2.8(i)
     above) and shall pay such amounts: FIRST, to the Series 2002-1 Letter of
     Credit Providers to the extent of any unreimbursed drawings under the
     related Series 2002-1 Reimbursement Agreement, for application in
     accordance with the provisions of the related Series 2002-1 Reimbursement
     Agreement, and, SECOND, to AFC-II any remaining amount.

          Section 2.9 SERIES 2002-1 DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT (a) ESTABLISHMENT OF
SERIES 2002-1 DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT. The Trustee shall establish and maintain in
the name of the Series 2002-1 Agent for the benefit of the Series 2002-1
Noteholders and the Surety Provider, or cause to be established and maintained,
an account (the "Series 2002-1 Distribution Account"), bearing a designation
clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of
the Series 2002-1 Noteholders and the Surety Provider. The Series 2002-1
Distribution Account shall be maintained (i) with a Qualified Institution, or
(ii) as a segregated trust account with the corporate trust department of a
depository institution or trust company having corporate trust powers and acting
as trustee for funds deposited in the Series 2002-1 Distribution Account;
PROVIDED that, if at any time such Qualified Institution is no longer a
Qualified Institution or the credit rating of any securities issued by such
depositary institution or trust company shall be reduced to below BBB- by S&P or
Baa3 by Moody's, then AFC-II shall, within 30 days of such reduction, establish
a new Series 2002-1 Distribution Account with a new Qualified Institution. If
the Series 2002-1 Distribution Account is not maintained in accordance with the
previous sentence, AFC-II shall establish a new Series 2002-1 Distribution
Account, within ten (10) Business Days after obtaining knowledge of such fact,
which complies with such sentence, and shall instruct the Series 2002-1 Agent in
writing to transfer all cash and investments from the non-qualifying Series
2002-1 Distribution Account into the new Series 2002-1 Distribution Account.
Initially, the Series 2002-1 Distribution Account will be established with The
Bank of New York.

          (b)    ADMINISTRATION OF THE SERIES 2002-1 DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT. The
Administrator may instruct the institution maintaining the Series 2002-1
Distribution Account to invest funds on deposit in the Series 2002-1
Distribution Account from time to time in Permitted Investments; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that any such investment shall mature not later than the Business Day
prior to the Distribution Date following the date on which such funds were
received, unless any Permitted Investment held in the Series 2002-1 Distribution
Account is held with the Paying Agent, then such investment may mature on such
Distribution Date and such funds shall be available for withdrawal on or prior
to such Distribution Date. All such Permitted Investments will be credited to
the Series 2002-1 Distribution Account.

          (c)    EARNINGS FROM SERIES 2002-1 DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT. All interest
and earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) paid on funds on deposit in
the Series 2002-1 Distribution Account shall be deemed to be on deposit and
available for distribution.

          (d)    SERIES 2002-1 DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT CONSTITUTES ADDITIONAL
COLLATERAL FOR SERIES 2002-1 NOTES. In order to secure and provide for the
repayment and payment of the AFC-II

                                      -38-
<Page>

Obligations with respect to the Series 2002-1 Notes, AFC-II hereby grants a
security interest in and assigns, pledges, grants, transfers and sets over to
the Series 2002-1 Agent, for the benefit of the Series 2002-1 Noteholders and
the Surety Provider, all of AFC-II's right, title and interest in and to the
following (whether now or hereafter existing or acquired): (i) the Series 2002-1
Distribution Account, including any security entitlement thereto; (ii) all funds
on deposit therein from time to time; (iii) all certificates and instruments, if
any, representing or evidencing any or all of the Series 2002-1 Distribution
Account or the funds on deposit therein from time to time; (iv) all investments
made at any time and from time to time with monies in the Series 2002-1
Distribution Account, whether constituting securities, instruments, general
intangibles, investment property, financial assets or other property; (v) all
interest, dividends, cash, instruments and other property from time to time
received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of or in exchange for
the Series 2002-1 Distribution Account, the funds on deposit therein from time
to time or the investments made with such funds; and (vi) all proceeds of any
and all of the foregoing, including, without limitation, cash (the items in the
foregoing clauses (i) through (vi) are referred to, collectively, as the "Series
2002-1 Distribution Account Collateral"). The Series 2002-1 Agent shall possess
all right, title and interest in all funds on deposit from time to time in the
Series 2002-1 Distribution Account and in and to all proceeds thereof, and shall
be the only person authorized to originate entitlement orders in respect of the
Series 2002-1 Distribution Account. The Series 2002-1 Distribution Account
Collateral shall be under the sole dominion and control of the Series 2002-1
Agent for the benefit of the Series 2002-1 Noteholders and the Surety Provider.

          Section 2.10 SERIES 2002-1 INTEREST RATE CAPS. (a) On the Series
2002-1 Closing Date, AFC-II shall acquire one or more interest rate caps
acceptable to the Surety Provider (each a "Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap")
from a Qualified Interest Rate Cap Counterparty. The aggregate initial notional
amount of all Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Caps shall equal the Series 2002-1
Initial Invested Amount, and the aggregate notional amount of all Series 2002-1
Interest Rate Caps may be reduced pursuant to the related Series 2002-1 Interest
Rate Cap but shall not at any time be less than the Series 2002-1 Invested
Amount. The strike rate of each Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap shall not be
greater than 5.5%.

          (b)    If, at any time, an Interest Rate Cap Counterparty does not
have at least one of (x) a short-term unsecured debt rating of at least "A-1" or
(y) a long-term unsecured debt rating of at least "A+" or (z) a counterparty
rating of "AAA", in each case, from S&P, then AFC-II will cause the Interest
Rate Cap Counterparty within 30 days following such occurrence (unless within
such period Standard & Poor's has reaffirmed the immediately prior Shadow
Rating), at the Interest Rate Cap Counterparty's expense, to do one of the
following (the choice of such action to be determined by the Interest Rate Cap
Counterparty) (i) obtain a replacement interest rate cap on the same terms as
the Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap from a Qualified Interest Rate Cap
Counterparty and simultaneously with such replacement AFC-II shall terminate the
Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap being replaced, (ii) obtain a guaranty from, or
contingent agreement of, another person who qualifies as a Qualified Interest
Rate Cap Counterparty to honor the Interest Rate Cap Counterparty's obligations
under the Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap and written confirmation from Standard
& Poor's that the substantive terms of the guaranty agreement are sufficient to
maintain or restore the immediately prior Shadow Rating, (iii) post and maintain
collateral, which Standard & Poor's has confirmed in writing is sufficient to
maintain or restore the immediately prior Shadow Rating or (iv) enter into any
arrangement satisfactory

                                      -39-
<Page>

to Standard & Poor's, Moody's and the Surety Provider, which is sufficient to
maintain or restore the immediately prior Shadow Rating; PROVIDED that no
termination of the Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap shall occur until AFC-II has
entered into a replacement Interest Rate Cap. Each Series 2002-1 Interest Rate
Cap must provide that if the Interest Rate Cap Counterparty is required to take
any of the actions described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the
preceding sentence and such action is not taken within 30 days, then the
Interest Rate Cap Counterparty must, until a replacement Series 2002-1 Interest
Rate Cap is executed and in effect, collateralize its obligations under such
Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap in an amount equal to the greatest of (i) the
marked to market value of such Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap, (ii) the next
payment due from the Interest Rate Cap Counterparty and (iii) 1% of the notional
amount of such Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap.

          (c)    If (x) an Interest Rate Cap Counterparty is not a Moody's
Qualified Interest Rate Cap Counterparty, or (y) the long-term senior and
unsecured debt rating of the Interest Rate Cap Counterparty falls below "Al"
from Moody's or "A+" by Standard & Poor's or (z) the short-term senior and
unsecured debt rating of the Interest Rate Cap Counterparty falls below "P-1"
from Moody's or "A-1" from Standard & Poor's, then, in each case AFC-II shall
cause the Interest Rate Cap Counterparty within 30 days following such
occurrence to do one of the following (i) enter into a replacement Series 2002-1
Interest Rate Cap with a Qualified Interest Rate Cap Counterparty on
substantially similar terms to the Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap being
replaced, and simultaneously with such replacement, AFC-II shall terminate the
Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap being replaced, (ii) obtain a guaranty of the
obligation of the Interest Rate Cap Counterparty under the Series 2002-1
Interest Rate Cap from another person who qualifies as a Qualified Interest Rate
Cap Counterparty, (iii) enter into a collateral agreement with the Interest Rate
Cap Counterparty, the Surety Provider and a third-party collateral agent, if
necessary, in form and substance and with collateral acceptable to the Surety
Provider to post and maintain collateral, in an amount at least equal to the
mark-to-market value of the Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap, which is sufficient
to restore the immediately prior Shadow Rating or (iv) enter into any
arrangement satisfactory to Standard & Poor's, Moody's and the Surety Provider.
If the Interest Rate Cap Counterparty fails to take any of the actions described
in clauses (i) through (iv) of the preceding sentence upon the occurrence of any
of the events described in clauses (y) or (z) of the preceding sentence, or if
at any time the long-term senior and unsecured debt rating of the Interest Rate
Cap Counterparty is withdrawn or falls below "Baal" by Moody's or "BBB+" by
Standard & Poor's, then the Surety Provider may terminate the Series 2001-2
Interest Rate Cap; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap
shall not terminate until the completion of either (A) or (B) below: (A) the
Interest Rate Cap Counterparty, or AFC-II at the direction of the Surety
Provider, and in each case at the expense of the Interest Rate Cap Counterparty,
obtains a replacement Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap with a Qualified Interest
Rate Cap Counterparty on substantially similar terms to the Series 2002-1
Interest Rate Cap being replaced (or with modifications acceptable to the Surety
Provider) or (B) the Interest Rate Cap Counterparty at its expense enters into
any arrangement satisfactory to Standard & Poor's, Moody's and the Surety
Provider.

          (d)    To secure payment of all obligations to the Series 2002-1
Noteholders and the Surety Provider, AFC-II grants a security interest in, and
assigns, pledges, grants, transfers and sets over to the Series 2002-1 Agent,
for the benefit of the Series 2002-1 Noteholders and the Surety Provider, all of
AFC-II's right, title and interest in the Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Caps

                                      -40-
<Page>

and all proceeds thereof (the "Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap Collateral").
AFC-II shall require all Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap Proceeds to be paid to,
and the Trustee shall allocate all Series 2002-1 Interest Rate Cap Proceeds to,
the Series 2002-1 Accrued Interest Account of the Series 2002-1 Collection
Account.

          Section 2.11 SERIES 2002-1 ACCOUNTS PERMITTED INVESTMENTS. AFC-II

          (i)    Permitted Investments that do not mature at least one Business
     Day before the next Distribution Date;

          (ii)   demand deposits, time deposits or certificates of deposit with
     a maturity in excess of 360 days;

     rated at least "AAA" by Standard & Poor's;

          (v)    eurodollar deposits that are not rated "P-1" by Moody's or that
     are with financial institutions not organized under the laws of a G-7
     nation; or

          (vi)   any investment, instrument or security not otherwise listed in
     clause (i) through (vi) of the definition of "Permitted Investments" in the
     Base Indenture that is not approved in writing by the Surety Provider.

          Section 2.12 SERIES 2002-1 DEMAND NOTES CONSTITUTE ADDITIONAL
COLLATERAL FOR SERIES 2002-1 NOTES.

          In order to secure and provide for the repayment and payment of the
obligations with respect to the Series 2002-1 Notes, AFC-II hereby grants a
security interest in and assigns, pledges, grants, transfers and sets over to
the Trustee, for the benefit of the Series 2002-1 Noteholders and the Surety
Provider, all of AFC-II's right, title and interest in and to the following
(whether now or hereafter existing or acquired): (i) the Series 2002-1 Demand
Notes; (ii) all certificates and instruments, if any, representing or evidencing
the Series 2002-1 Demand Notes; and (iii) all proceeds of any and all of the
foregoing, including, without limitation, cash. On the date hereof, AFC-II shall
deliver to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Series 2002-1 Noteholders and the
Surety Provider, each Series 2002-1 Demand Note, endorsed in blank. The Trustee,
for the benefit of the Series 2002-1 Noteholders and the Surety Provider, shall
be the only Person authorized to make a demand for payments on the Series 2002-1
Demand Notes.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                      RIGHT TO WAIVE PURCHASE RESTRICTIONS

          Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture or the
Related Documents, upon the Trustee's receipt of notice from any Lessee, any
Borrower or AFC-II (i) to the effect that a Manufacturer Program is no longer an
Eligible Manufacturer Program and that, as a result, the Series 2002-1 Maximum
Non-Program Vehicle Amount is or will be exceeded or (ii) that the Lessees, the
Borrowers and AFC-II have determined to increase any Series 2002-1 Maximum
Amount, (such notice, a "Waiver Request"), each Series 2002-1 Noteholder may, at
its option, waive the Series 2002-1 Maximum Non-Program Vehicle Amount or any
other Series 2002-1 Maximum Amount if (i) no Amortization Event exists, (ii) the
Requisite Noteholders and the Surety Provider consent to such waiver and (iii)
60 days' prior written notice of such proposed waiver is provided to the Rating
Agencies by the Trustee.

          Upon receipt by the Trustee of a Waiver Request (a copy of which the
Trustee shall promptly provide to the Rating Agencies), all amounts which would
otherwise be allocated to the Series 2002-1 Excess Collection Account
(collectively, the "Designated Amounts") from the date the Trustee receives a
Waiver Request through the Consent Period Expiration Date will be held by the
Trustee in the Series 2002-1 Collection Account for ratable distribution as
described below.

          Within ten (10) Business Days after the Trustee receives a Waiver
Request, the Trustee shall furnish notice thereof to the Series 2002-1
Noteholders and the Surety Provider, which notice shall be accompanied by a form
of consent (each a "Consent") in the form of EXHIBIT B hereto by which the
Series 2002-1 Noteholders may, on or before the Consent Period Expiration Date,
consent to waiver of the applicable Series 2002-1 Maximum Amount. If the Trustee
receives the consent of the Surety Provider and Consents from the Requisite
Noteholders agreeing to waiver of the applicable Series 2002-1 Maximum Amount
within forty-five (45) days after the Trustee notifies the Series 2002-1
Noteholders of a Waiver Request (the day on which such forty-five (45) day
period expires, the "Consent Period Expiration Date"), (i) the applicable Series
2002-1 Maximum Amount shall be deemed waived by the consenting Series 2002-1
Noteholders, (ii) the Trustee will distribute the Designated Amounts as set
forth below and (iii) the Trustee shall promptly (but in any event within two
days) provide the Rating Agency with notice of such waiver. Any Series 2002-1
Noteholder from whom the Trustee has not received a Consent on or before the
Consent Period Expiration Date will be deemed not to have consented to such
waiver.

                                      -43-
<Page>

          If the Trustee receives Consents from the Requisite Noteholders on or
before the Consent Period Expiration Date, then on the immediately following
Distribution Date, the Trustee will pay the Designated Amounts as follows:

          (i)    to the non-consenting Series 2002-1 Noteholders, if any, PRO
     RATA up to the amount required to pay all Series 2002-1 Notes held by such
     non-consenting Series 2002-1 Noteholders in full; and

          (ii)   any remaining Designated Amounts to the Series 2002-1 Excess
     Collection Account.

          If the amount paid pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding paragraph
is not paid in full on the date specified therein, then on each day following
such Distribution Date, the Administrator will allocate to the Series 2002-1
Collection Account on a daily basis all Designated Amounts collected on such
day. On each following Distribution Date, the Trustee will withdraw a portion of
such Designated Amounts from the Series 2002-1 Collection Account and deposit
the same in the Series 2002-1 Distribution Account for distribution as follows:

          (a)    to the non-consenting Series 2002-1 Noteholders, if any, PRO
     RATA an amount equal to the Designated Amounts in the Series 2002-1
     Collection Account as of the applicable Determination Date up to the
     aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Series 2002-1 Notes held by
     the non-consenting Series 2002-1 Noteholders; and

          (b)    any remaining Designated Amounts to the Series 2002-1 Excess
     Collection Account.

          If the Requisite Noteholders or the Surety Provider do not timely
consent to such waiver, the Designated Amounts will be re-allocated to the
Series 2002-1 Excess Collection Account for allocation and distribution in

the extent of the payments so made to be a Series 2002-1 Noteholder and (ii) the
