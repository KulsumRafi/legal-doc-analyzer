                             AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE
                               EL PASO CORPORATION
                             1995 COMPENSATION PLAN
                           FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS

      Pursuant to Section 8.7 of the El Paso Corporation 1995 Compensation Plan
for Non-Employee Directors, Amended and Restated effective as of January 29,
2002 (the "Plan"), the Plan is hereby amended as follows, effective as of
January 29, 2003:

      Sections 5.3 and 5.4 shall be renumbered as Sections 5.4 and 5.5,
respectively, and a new Section 5.3 shall be added to read as follows:

      "5.3 PHANTOM STOCK UNITS

      Notwithstanding Section 5.2, the Management Committee may determine that
the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may at any time be awarded
pursuant to Section 4.1 of the Plan (and, if appropriate, pursuant to Section
5.1 of the El Paso Corporation Strategic Stock Plan) have been issued and
phantom stock units which shall have an accounting value equal to the fair
market value of one (1) share of Common Stock ("PSUs") shall be credited to the
Participant's Memorandum Deferred Account for his or her Common Stock Deferral
and/or Deferred Retirement Benefit Credit for the Plan Year. [The amount of PSUs
credited to the Participant's Memorandum Deferred Account for his or her Common
Stock Deferral shall include the Conversion Premium (as defined below).]

      Each Participant who receives PSUs shall, once the PSUs have been credited
to his or her Memorandum Deferred Account, have the right to receive dividend
equivalents and other distributions on such PSUs, subject to applicable laws.
Any such dividend equivalents and other distributions shall be deemed reinvested
promptly in additional PSUs and such additional PSUs shall be credited to the
Memorandum Deferred Account until the Memorandum Deferred Account is
distributed. Participants do not have the right to vote the PSUs.

      PSUs shall be exchanged, on a pro rata basis, for an equivalent number of
shares of deferred Common Stock when, and if, additional shares of Common Stock
become available under the Plan. Such shares of deferred Common Stock shall be
treated as all other Common Stock Deferrals under the Plan. If no additional
shares of Common Stock become available under the Plan at the time of
distribution of the PSUs to the Participant, an amount equal to the PSU balance
of the Participant's Memorandum Deferred Account shall be paid to the
Participant (or the Participant's beneficiary in the case of the Participant's
death) in a lump sum cash payment based on the Common Stock's fair market value
(as defined in Section 6.2(b)) on the day preceding the date of such payment.
Payment of PSUs in cash shall be made in the month following the date on which
the Participant ceases to be a Director. PSUs credited to the Participant's

Memorandum Deferred Account for the Participant's Deferred Retirement Benefit
Credit shall be subject to any additional restrictions of such other Deferred
Retirement Benefit Credits under the Plan."

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, El Paso Corporation has executed this document as of
January 29, 2003.
