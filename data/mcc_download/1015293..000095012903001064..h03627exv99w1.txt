J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.

New York, New York  10017

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The Houston Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company")
and a subsidiary of KeySpan Corporation, a New York corporation ("KeySpan"),
proposes to sell to you (the "Underwriter") an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares
(the "Underwritten Shares") of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (the "Common Stock"). In addition, for the sole purpose of covering
over-allotments in connection with the sale of the Underwritten Shares, the
Company proposes to issue and sell to the Underwriter, at the option of the
Underwriter, up to an additional 300,000 shares (the "Option Shares") of Common
Stock. The Underwritten Shares and the Option Shares are herein referred to as
the "Shares."

     The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") in accordance with the provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"), a registration
statement, File No. 333-78843, including a prospectus, relating to the Shares.
The registration statement as amended to the date of this Agreement is referred
to in this Agreement as the "Registration Statement." The term "Base
Prospectus" means the prospectus included in the Registration Statement. The
Company has filed with, or transmitted for filing to, or shall promptly
hereafter file with or transmit for filing to, the Commission a prospectus
supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement") specifically relating to the Shares
pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act. The term "Prospectus" means the
Prospectus Supplement together with the Base Prospectus in the form first used
to confirm sales of the Shares. If the Company has filed an abbreviated
registration statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act (the
"Rule 462 Registration Statement"), then any reference herein to the term
"Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462 Registration
Statement. Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, any
supplemental prospectus (including the Prospectus Supplement) or the Prospectus
shall be
<PAGE>
                                      -2-

deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein
pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the effective
date of the Registration Statement or the date of such supplemental prospectus
or the Prospectus, as the case may be, and any reference to "amend,"
"amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, any
supplemental prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and
include any documents filed after such date under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder
(collectively, the "Exchange Act") that are deemed to be incorporated by
reference therein.

     1. The Company agrees to sell the Underwritten Shares to the Underwriter
as hereinafter provided, and the Underwriter, upon the basis of the
representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the conditions
hereinafter stated, agrees to purchase from the Company at a purchase price of
$26.40 per share (the "Purchase Price") the number of Underwritten Shares to be
purchased by the Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I hereto.

     In addition, the Company agrees to sell the Option Shares to the
Underwriter as hereinafter provided, and the Underwriter, upon the basis of the
representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the conditions
hereinafter stated, shall have the option to purchase from the Company at the
Purchase Price the number of Option Shares as to which such election shall have
been exercised.

     The Underwriter may exercise the option to purchase the Option Shares at
any time (but not more than once) on or before the thirtieth day following the
date of the Prospectus Supplement, by written notice from the Underwriter to
the Company. Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of Option Shares
as to which the option is being exercised and the date and time when the Option
Shares are to be delivered and paid for, which may be the same date and time as
the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) but shall not be earlier than the
Closing Date nor later than the tenth full Business Day (as hereinafter
defined) after the date of such notice. Any such notice shall be given at least
two Business Days prior to the date and time of delivery specified therein.

     2. The Company understands that the Underwriter intends (i) to make a
public offering of the Shares as soon after the parties hereto have executed
and delivered this Agreement as in the judgment of the Underwriter is advisable
and (ii) initially to offer the Shares upon the terms set forth in the
Prospectus.

     3. Payment for the Shares shall be made by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to the account specified by the Company to the Underwriter, in
the case of the Underwritten Shares, on February 26, 2003, or at such other
time on the same or such other date, not later than the fifth Business Day
thereafter, as the Underwriter and the Company may agree upon in writing, or,
in the case of the Option Shares, on the date and time specified by the
Underwriter in the written notice of the Underwriter's election to purchase
such Option Shares. The time and date of such payment for the Underwritten
Shares are herein referred to
<PAGE>
                                      -3-

as the "Closing Date," and the time and date for such payment for the Option
Shares, if other than the Closing Date, are herein referred to as the
"Additional Closing Date." As used herein, the term "Business Day" means any
day other than a day on which banks are permitted or required to be closed in
New York City.

     Payment for the Shares to be purchased on the Closing Date or the
Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, shall be made against delivery to
the Underwriter of the Shares to be purchased on such date registered in such
names and in such denominations as the Underwriter shall request in writing not
later than two full Business Days prior to the Closing Date or the Additional
Closing Date, as the case may be, with any transfer taxes payable in connection
with the transfer to the Underwriter of the Shares duly paid by the Company.
The certificates for the Shares will be made available for inspection and
packaging by the Underwriter at the office of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. set
forth above not later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Business Day
prior to the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be.

     or foreign regulatory agencies or bodies necessary to conduct the business
     now operated by them, except when the failure to have such Governmental
     Licenses would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
     expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; the Company and its subsidiary
     are in compliance with the terms and conditions of all such Governmental
     Licenses, except where the failure to so comply would not, individually or

     effect, except where the invalidity of such Governmental Licenses or the
     failure of such Governmental Licenses to be in full force and effect would
     not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
     Material Adverse Effect; neither the Company nor its subsidiary has
     received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or
     modification of any such Governmental Licenses which, individually or in
     the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or

     to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage,
     disposal, transport or handling of Hazardous Materials (collectively,
     "Environmental Laws"), (B) the Company and its subsidiary have all
     permits, authorizations and approvals required under any applicable

     with their requirements, (C) there are no pending or threatened
     administrative, regulatory or judicial actions, suits, demands, demand
     letters, claims, liens, notices of noncompliance or violation,
     investigations or proceedings relating to any Environmental Law against

     that may reasonably be expected to form the basis of an order for clean-up
     or remediation, or an action, suit or proceeding by any private party or
     governmental body or agency, against or affecting the Company or its
     subsidiary relating to Hazardous Materials or any Environmental Laws.

     5. The Company covenants and agrees with the Underwriter as follows:

          (a) if required, to file the final Prospectus with the Commission
     within the time periods specified by Rule 424(b) and Rule 430A under the
     Securities Act and to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy
     or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the
     Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange
     Act subsequent to the date of the Prospectus and for so long as the
     delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or
     sale of the Shares; and, at the expense of the Company, to furnish copies
     of the Prospectus to the Underwriter in New York City prior to 10:00 a.m.,
     New York City time, on the Business Day next succeeding the date of this
     Agreement in such quantities as the Underwriter may reasonably request;

          (b) to deliver or to make available, at the expense of the Company,
     to the Underwriter two signed copies of the Registration Statement (as
     originally filed) and each amendment thereto, in each case including
     exhibits and documents incorporated by reference therein, and each
     amendment thereto, in each case without exhibits but including the
     documents incorporated by reference therein and, during the period
     mentioned in paragraph (e) below, to deliver at the expense of the Company
     to the Underwriter as many copies of the Prospectus (including all
     amendments and supplements
<PAGE>
                                     -11-

     thereto) and documents incorporated by reference therein as the
     Underwriter may reasonably request;

          (c) before filing any amendment or supplement to the Registration
     Statement or the Prospectus, whether before or after the time the
     Registration Statement becomes effective, to furnish to the Underwriter a
     copy of the proposed amendment or supplement for review and not to file
     any such proposed amendment or supplement to which the Underwriter
     reasonably objects; provided that the following shall not apply to the
     filing by the Company of any document required to be filed in accordance
     with the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
     and the time period for which lapses within one Business Day of such
     filing;

          (d) to advise the Underwriter promptly, and to confirm such advice in
     writing, (i) when the Registration Statement has become effective, (ii)
     when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes
     effective, (iii) when any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended
     Prospectus has been filed and to furnish the Underwriter with copies
     thereof, (iv) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to the
     Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or
     for any additional information, (v) of the issuance by the Commission of
     any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement
     or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary
     prospectus or the Prospectus or the initiation or threatening of any
     proceeding for that purpose, (vi) of the occurrence of any event, during
     the period mentioned in paragraph (e) below, as a result of which the
     Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue
     statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
     in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
     when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, and (vii)
     of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to any
     suspension of the qualification of the Shares for offer and sale in any
     jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such
     purpose; and to use its best commercial efforts to prevent the issuance of
     any such stop order, or of any order preventing or suspending the use of
     any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, or of any order suspending
     any such qualification of the Shares, or notification of any such order
     thereof, and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal
     thereof;

          (e) if, during such period of time after the first date of the public
     offering of the Shares as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriter a
     prospectus relating to the Shares is required by law to be delivered in
     connection with sales by the Underwriter or any dealer, any event shall
     occur as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the
     Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
     circumstances when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not
     misleading, or if it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to
     comply with law, forthwith
<PAGE>
                                     -12-

     to prepare and furnish, at the expense of the Company, to the Underwriter
     and to the dealers (whose names and addresses the Underwriter will furnish
     to the Company) to which Shares may have been sold by the Underwriter and
     to any other dealers upon request, such amendments or supplements to the
     Prospectus as may be necessary so that the statements in the Prospectus as
     so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances
     when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that
     the Prospectus will comply with law;

          (f) to use its best commercial efforts to maintain the listing of the
     Shares on the New York Stock Exchange;

          (g) to endeavor to qualify the Shares for offer and sale under the
     securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriter shall
     reasonably request and to continue such qualification in effect so long as
     reasonably required for distribution of the Shares; provided that the
     Company shall not be required to file a general consent to service of
     process in any such jurisdiction;

          (h) to make generally available to its security holders and to the
     Underwriter as soon as practicable an earning statement covering a period
     of at least twelve months beginning with the first fiscal quarter of the
     Company occurring after the effective date of the Registration Statement,
     which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act
     and Rule 158 of the Commission promulgated thereunder;

          (i) during the period of two years after the date of this Agreement,
     to furnish or make available to the Underwriter copies of all reports or
     other communications (financial or other) furnished to holders of the
     Shares, and copies of any reports and financial statements furnished to or
     filed with the Commission;

          (j) for a period of 90 days after the date of the Prospectus
     Supplement, not to (i) directly or indirectly, offer, pledge, announce the
     intention to sell, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to
     purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right
     or warrant to purchase or otherwise transfer or dispose of any shares of
     Common Stock or any securities of the Company which are substantially
     similar to the Common Stock, including but not limited to any securities
     convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, or that represent the
     right to receive, Common Stock or any such substantially similar
     securities or (ii) enter into any swap, option, future, forward or other
     agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic
     consequences of ownership of the Common Stock or any such substantially
     similar securities, whether any such transaction described in clause (i)
     or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other
     securities, in cash or otherwise without the prior written consent of J.P.
     Morgan Securities Inc., other than (a) any options granted or shares of
     Common Stock of the Company issued upon the exercise of options granted or
     to be granted under the Company's employee stock option
<PAGE>
                                     -13-

     plans existing on the date of the Prospectus, (b) shares of restricted
     Common Stock granted to any officers or employers of the Company or any
     subsidiary as compensation under any incentive compensation plan of the
     Company, and (c) shares of Common Stock to be issued in any business
     combination to be consummated after such 90-day period; and

          (k) whether or not the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
     are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, to pay or cause to be
     paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations
     hereunder, including without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all
     costs and expenses (i) incident to the preparation, registration,
     transfer, execution and delivery of the Shares, (ii) incident to the
     preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the
     Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any preliminary prospectus,
     including in each case all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto
     prior to or during the period specified in paragraph (e) of this Section
     5, (iii) related to any filing with, and clearance of the offering by, the
     National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (iv) in connection with
     the printing (including word processing and duplication costs) and
     delivery of this Agreement, any blue sky survey and the furnishing to the
     Underwriter and dealers of copies of the Registration Statement and the
     Prospectus, including mailing and shipping, as herein provided, (v) any
     expenses incurred by the Company in connection with a "road show"
     presentation to potential investors, (vi) the cost of preparing stock
     certificates, (vii) the cost and charges of the Company's transfer agent
     and registrar, (viii) costs and expenses (including all filing fees)
     incurred in connection with the registration or qualification of the
     Shares under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriter may
     designate (including fees of counsel for the Underwriter and its
     disbursements with respect thereto) and (ix) all fees of counsel for the
     Company.

     6. The obligations of the Underwriter hereunder to purchase the Shares on
the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, are
subject to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to
the following additional conditions:

          (a) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
     Statement or any post-effective amendment shall be in effect, and no
     proceedings for such purpose shall be pending before or threatened by the
     Commission; the Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission
     pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for
     such filing by the rules and regulations under the Securities Act and in
     accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; and all requests for additional
     information shall have been complied with to the reasonable satisfaction
     of the Underwriter;
<PAGE>
                                     -14-

          (b) the representations and warranties of the Company and KeySpan
     contained herein shall be true and correct in all material respects on and
     as of the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be,
     as if made on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case
     may be, and the Company shall have complied in all material respects with
     all agreements and all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied
     hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date,
     as the case may be;

          (c) subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
     prior to the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may
     be, there shall not have occurred any downgrading, nor shall any notice
     have been given of (i) any downgrading, (ii) any intended or potential
     downgrading or (iii) any review or possible change that does not indicate
     an improvement, in the rating accorded any securities of or guaranteed by
     the Company or its subsidiary by any "nationally recognized statistical
     rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
     436(g)(2) under the Securities Act;

          (d) since the respective dates as of which information is given in
     the Prospectus, there shall not have been any change in the capital stock
     (other than any options granted or shares of Common Stock of the Company
     issued upon the exercise of options granted or to be granted under the
     Company's employee stock option plans existing on the date of the
     Prospectus) or any increase in the long-term debt of the Company or its
     subsidiary, or any Material Adverse Change, otherwise than as set forth or
     contemplated in the Prospectus, the effect of which in the judgment of the
     Underwriter makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the
     public offering or the delivery of the Shares on the Closing Date or the
     Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, on the terms and in the
     manner contemplated in the Prospectus; and neither the Company nor its
     subsidiary shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited
     financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the
     Prospectus any material loss or interference with its business from fire,
     explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance,
     or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or
     decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus;

          (e) the Underwriter shall have received on and as of the Closing Date
     or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, certificates of the
     Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of each of the Company
     and KeySpan, satisfactory to the Underwriter, to the effect set forth in
     subsections (a) through (d) (with respect to the respective
     representations, warranties, agreements and conditions of the Company and
     KeySpan) of this Section 6 and to the further effect that there has not
     occurred any Material Adverse Change from that set forth or contemplated
     in the Prospectus;
<PAGE>
                                     -15-

          (f) Andrews & Kurth LLP, counsel for the Company, shall have
     furnished to the Underwriter their written opinion, dated the Closing Date
     or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, with respect to
     matters set forth in Annex A which opinion shall be in form and substance
     satisfactory to the Underwriter;

          (g) on the date hereof and the effective date of the most recently
     filed post-effective amendment filed on or subsequent to the date hereof
     to the Registration Statement, if any, and also on the Closing Date or
     Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, Deloitte & Touche shall have
     furnished to the Underwriter letters, dated the respective dates of
     delivery thereof, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriter,
     containing statements and information of the type customarily included in
     accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the
     financial statements and certain financial information contained or
     incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the
     Prospectus;

          (h) the Underwriter shall have received on and as of the Closing Date
     or Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, an opinion of Cahill
     Gordon & Reindel, counsel to the Underwriter, with respect to the
     Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as the
     Underwriter may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received
     such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them
     to pass upon such matters;

          (i) the Engineers shall have delivered to the Underwriter on the
     Closing Date a letter (the "Reserve Letter") in form and substance
     reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriter and substantially in the form
     attached hereto as Annex B, stating, as of the date of such letter (or,
     with respect to matters involving changes or developments since the
     respective dates as of which specified information with respect to the oil
     and gas reserves is given or incorporated in the Prospectus as of the date
     not more than five days prior to the date of such letter), the conclusions
     and findings of such firm with respect to the oil and gas reserves of the
     Company;

          (j) on or prior to the Closing Date or Additional Closing Date, as
     the case may be, the Company and KeySpan shall have furnished to the
     Underwriter such further certificates and documents as the Underwriter
     shall reasonably request; and

          (k) the "lock-up" agreements, each substantially in the form of
     Exhibit A hereto, between each of KeySpan, THEC Holdings Corp., the
     directors and executive officers of the Company on the one hand and, in
     each case, the Underwriter on the other hand, relating to sales and
     certain other dispositions of shares of Common Stock or certain other
     securities, delivered to the Underwriter on or before the date hereof,
     shall be in full force and effect on the Closing Date or Additional
     Closing Date, as the case may be.

                                     -16-

       7.   (a) The Company and KeySpan agree, jointly and severally, to
     indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, each affiliate of the
     Underwriter which assists the Underwriter in the distribution of the
     Shares and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the
     meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
     Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and
     liabilities (including, without limitation, the legal fees and other
     expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any
     claim asserted) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
     of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the
     Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished
     any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or
     alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
     therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except
     insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any
     untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made
     in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to the
     Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by the Underwriter
     expressly for use therein.

          (b) The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
     Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement
     and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15
     of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act and KeySpan to
     the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the
     Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to the
     Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by the Underwriter
     expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any
     amendment or supplement thereto.

          (c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or
     regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted
     against any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to
     the preceding paragraphs of this Section 7, such person (the "Indemnified
     Person") shall promptly notify the person or persons against whom such
     indemnity may be sought (each an "Indemnifying Person") in writing, and
     such Indemnifying Persons, upon request of the Indemnified Person, shall
     retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to
     represent the Indemnified Person and any others the Indemnifying Persons
     may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and
     expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such
     proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own
     counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense
     of such Indemnified Person and not the Indemnifying Persons unless (i) the
     Indemnifying Persons and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed
     to the contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a
     reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
     Indemnified Person or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding
     (including any impleaded parties) include both an Indemnifying Person and
     the Indemnified Person and, based upon advice of counsel, representation
     of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual
     or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that no
     Indemnifying Person shall,
<PAGE>
                                     -17-

     in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same
     jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than
     one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified
     Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they
     are incurred. Any such separate firm for the Underwriter, each affiliate
     of the Underwriter which assists the Underwriter in the distribution of
     the Shares and such control persons of the Underwriter shall be designated
     in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and any such separate firm for
     the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration
     Statement and such control persons of the Company shall be designated in
     writing by the Company. No Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any
     settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if
     settled with such consent or if there be a final non-appealable judgment
     for the plaintiff, each Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify any
     Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of
     such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the
     prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of
     any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified
     Person is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought
     hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement includes an
     unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on
     claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

          (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
     this Section 7 is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in
     respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein,
     then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of
     indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the
     amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such
     losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is
     appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and
     KeySpan on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand from the
     offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i)
     above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is
     appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in
     clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and KeySpan on
     the one hand and the UNDERWRITER on the other hand in connection with the
     statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or
     liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
     relative benefits received by the Company and KeySpan on the one hand and
     the Underwriter on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same
     respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering (before
     deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting
     discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter, in each case as set
     forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate
     public offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company and
     KeySpan on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand shall be
     determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
     alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
     omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
     Company and KeySpan or by the Underwriter and the parties'
<PAGE>
                                     -18-

     relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
     correct or prevent such statement or omission.

     The Company, KeySpan and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a
result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the
immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event
shall the Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the
amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and
distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any
damages that the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of
such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

     The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall
not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any
indemnified party at law or in equity.

     The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 7 and
the representations and warranties of the Company and KeySpan set forth in this
Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i)
any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf
of the Underwriter or any person controlling the Underwriter or by or on behalf
of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company
or by and on behalf of KeySpan, its officers or directors or any person
controlling KeySpan and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.

     8. Notwithstanding anything herein contained, this Agreement (or the
obligations of the Underwriter with respect to the Option Shares) may be
terminated in the absolute discretion of the Underwriter, by notice given to
the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to
the Closing Date (or, in the case of the Option Shares, prior to the Additional
Closing Date) (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially
limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the
American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq National Market, the Chicago Board Options
Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii)
trading of any securities of or guaranteed by the Company or its subsidiary

             Re: The Houston Exploration Company - Public Offering
                 -------------------------------------------------

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned understands that you, as Underwriter (the "Underwriter"),
propose to enter into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement")
with The Houston Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
and KeySpan Corporation, a New York corporation ("KeySpan"), providing for the
sale by the Company to the Underwriter of Common Stock, $0.01 par value (the
"Common Stock"), of the Company and the public offering (the "Public Offering")
of the Common Stock by the Underwriter. Capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting
Agreement.

     In consideration of the Underwriter's agreement to purchase and make the
Public Offering of the Common Stock, and for other good and valuable
consideration receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned hereby
agrees that, without the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
the undersigned will not, during the period ending 90 days after the date of
the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Public Offering (the "Prospectus"),
(1) directly or indirectly offer, pledge, announce the intention to sell, sell,
contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option
or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or
otherwise transfer or dispose of, any shares of Common Stock or any securities
of the Company which are substantially similar to the Common Stock, including,
but not limited to, any securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, Common Stock or any
such substantially similar securities (including, but not limited to, Common
Stock which may be deemed to be beneficially owned by the undersigned in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission) or (2) enter into any swap, option, future, forward or other
agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences
of ownership of the Common Stock or any securities of the Company which are
substantially similar to the Common Stock, including, but not limited to, any
security convertible into or exercisable
<PAGE>
                                      -2-

or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, Common Stock or
any such substantially similar securities, whether any such transaction
described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery of Common
Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise; provided, however, that
the foregoing provisions in clauses (1) and (2) shall not be construed to
prohibit the receipt and sale of shares of Common Stock received upon the
exercise of options to purchase Common Stock held by the undersigned under any
incentive or compensation plan of the Company as of the date of the Prospectus
Supplement. In addition, the undersigned agrees that, without the prior written
consent of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., it will not, during the period ending
90 days after the Closing Date, make any demand for or exercise any right with
respect to the registration of any shares of Common Stock or any substantially
similar securities of the Company, including, but not limited to, any security
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock.

     In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company and any duly appointed
transfer agent for the registration or transfer of the securities described
herein are hereby authorized to decline to make any transfer of securities if
such transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this Lock-Up Agreement.

     The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has
full power and authority to enter into this Lock-Up Agreement. All authority
herein conferred or agreed to be conferred and any obligations of the
undersigned shall be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs or personal
representatives of the undersigned.

     The undersigned understands that, if the Underwriting Agreement does not
become effective, or if the Underwriting Agreement (other than the provisions
thereof which survive termination) shall terminate or be terminated prior to
payment for and delivery of the Common Stock to be sold thereunder, the
undersigned shall be released from all obligations under this Lock-Up
Agreement.

     The undersigned understands that the Underwriter is entering into the
Underwriting Agreement and proceeding with the Public Offering in reliance upon
this Lock-Up Agreement.

     THIS LOCK-UP AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.


                                         Very truly yours,

          (i) the Company is validly existing as a corporation in good standing

     clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;

          (iii) the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company have
     been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and
     non-assessable;

          (iv) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act
     and the Prospectus Supplement was filed on February 24, 2003 pursuant to
     Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act
     and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
     Registration Statement has been issued or proceeding for that purpose has
     been instituted or threatened by the Commission;

          (v) other than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, to the
     knowledge of such counsel there are no legal or governmental
     investigations, actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened
     against or affecting the Company or its subsidiary or any of their
     respective properties or to which the Company or its subsidiary is or may
     be a party or to which any property of the Company or its subsidiary is or
     may be the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or its
     subsidiary, could, individually or in the aggregate, have, or reasonably
     be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect; and, to such counsel's
     knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by
     governmental authorities or threatened by others; such counsel does not
     know of any statutes, regulations, contracts or other documents that are
     required to be described in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or to

     or filed as required;

          (vi) the sale of the Shares by the Company, the performance by the
     Company of its obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of
     the
<PAGE>
                                      -2-

     transactions contemplated herein and in the Prospectus (including, without
     limitation, the use of proceeds of the sale of the Shares) will not
     conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of,
     or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust,
     loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or
     its subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or its subsidiary is
     bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or its
     subsidiary is subject and which is listed on a schedule to such opinion
     (Note: to be material contracts included in THX-2002 10-K), nor will any
     such action result in any violation of the provisions of the certificate
     of incorporation or the by-laws of the Company or any Applicable Law or
     any order, rule or regulation known to such counsel of any court or
     governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company, its
     subsidiary or any of their respective properties, except in the case of
     the indentures, mortgages, deeds of trust, loan agreements and other
     agreements or instruments and which is listed on a schedule to such
     opinion (to be material contracts included in THX-2002 10-K), for such
     conflicts, breaches and defaults as would not, individually or in the
     aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect;

          (vii) no Governmental Approval is required for the consummation by
     the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
     Prospectus, except such Governmental Approval has been obtained under the
     Securities Act and as may be required under state securities or blue sky
     laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Shares by the
     Underwriter;

          (viii) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
     delivered by the Company;

          (ix) the Shares to be issued and sold by the Company to the
     Underwriter hereunder have been duly and validly authorized and, when

     duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of any
     preemptive or similar rights arising under the certificate of
     incorporation or bylaws of the Company or under any indenture, mortgage,
     deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument which is
     listed on a schedule to such opinion (to be the material contracts listed
     in 2002 10-K); and such shares will conform in all material respects to
     the description thereof contained in the Prospectus;

          (x) the authorized capital stock of the Company conforms in all
     material respects as to legal matters to the description thereof contained
     in the Prospectus under the caption "Description of Capital Stock";
<PAGE>
                                   -3-


          (xi) the statements in the Prospectus under the captions "Description
     of Capital Stock" and "Underwriting" (excluding the final three paragraphs
     of such section) and in the Registration Statement in Item 15, insofar as
     such statements constitute a summary of the legal matters or documents
     referred to therein, fairly summarize in all material respects such
     matters or documents; and

          (xii) the Company is not an "investment company" as such term is
     defined in the Investment Company Act.

     In rendering such opinions, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters
involving the application of laws other than the laws of the United States and
the States of New York and Texas and the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware, to the extent such counsel deems proper and to the extent
specified in such opinion, if at all, upon an opinion or opinions (in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriter's counsel) of other
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Underwriter's counsel, familiar with the
applicable laws; and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent such counsel
deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and its
subsidiary, as applicable, and certificates or other written statements of
officials of jurisdictions having custody of documents respecting the corporate
existence or good standing of the Company and its subsidiary. The opinion of
such counsel for the Company shall state that the opinion of any such other
counsel upon which they relied is in form satisfactory to such counsel and, in
such counsel's opinion, the Underwriter and they are justified in relying
thereon. With respect to the matters to be covered in subparagraph (xii) above,
counsel may state their opinion and belief is based upon their participation in
the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any
amendment or supplement thereto (other than the documents incorporated by
reference therein) and review and discussion of the contents thereof (including
the documents incorporated by reference therein) but is without independent
check or verification except as specified.

     In addition such counsel shall state that such counsel has participated in
the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and in
conference with certain officers and other representatives of the Company and
of the Underwriter and its counsel, representatives of the independent
accountants of the Company at which the contents of such instruments and
related matters were discussed and, although such counsel has not independently
verified and are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for the
accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained therein, on the
basis of such participation (relying with respect to factual matters to the
extent such counsel deems appropriate on statements by officers or
representatives of the Company) no facts have come to their attention to cause
them to believe that (A) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any
supplement or amendment thereto (other than any financial statements and
related schedules and other financial or statistical information included or
incorporated by reference therein, and the
<PAGE>
                                      -4-

information and data with respect to estimates of the Company's crude oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves included or incorporated by
reference therein, as to which no belief is expressed) do not comply as to form
in all material respects with the Securities Act; (B) the Registration
Statement (other than any financial statements and related schedules and other
financial or statistical information therein, and the information and data with
respect to estimates of the Company's crude oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids reserves included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which no
belief is expressed) at its effective date contained an untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading; (C) the
Prospectus (other than any financial statements and other financial or
statistical information included or incorporated by reference therein, and the
information and data with respect to estimates of the Company's crude oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves included or incorporated by
reference therein, as to which no belief is expressed), as of its date and as
of the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be,
contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or
omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; (D) the documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or
any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the
Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be (other than any
financial statements and related schedules and other financial or statistical
information therein, and the information and data with respect to estimates of
the Company's crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves, as to
which no belief is expressed), when they were filed with the Commission, did
not comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act; and (E) any of such documents referred to in clause (D), when
such documents were so filed (other than any financial statements and related
schedules and other financial or statistical information therein, and the
information and data with respect to estimates of the Company's crude oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves, as to which no belief is
expressed), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were
so filed, not misleading.

     "Applicable Laws" means those laws, rules and regulations of the United
States of America, the State of New York, the State of Texas or the DGCL that,
in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type

and which are not the subject of a specific opinion herein referring expressly
to a particular law or laws; provided that the term "Applicable Laws" does not

          (i) any law, rule or regulation that may have become applicable as a
     result of the involvement of the Underwriter with the transactions
     contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or because of any facts
     specifically pertaining to the Underwriter or because of the legal or
     regulatory status or the nature of the business of the Underwriter; and

          (j) any law, rule or regulation that may be applicable to any party
     by virtue of the particular nature of the business conducted by it or any
     goods or services produced by it or property owned or leased by it.
