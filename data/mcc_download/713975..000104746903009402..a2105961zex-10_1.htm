<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason, then he may give notice of intention to collect benefits under this Agreement by delivering a notice in writing (the "Notice of
Termination") and Corporation shall pay Executive an amount equal to one (1)&nbsp;times the Executive's Annual Base Salary as defined in Section&nbsp;5(a) of this Agreement, which amount shall be
payable in twelve (12)&nbsp;equal
monthly installments and shall be subject to federal, state and local tax withholdings. In addition, Executive shall receive a continuation, for a period of twelve (12)&nbsp;months from the date of
termination of employment, or until Executive secures substantially similar benefits through other employment, whichever shall first occur, of all health, accident, life and disability insurance
benefits in effect with respect to Executive on the date of termination of employment and that were in effect during the two (2)&nbsp;years prior to Executive's termination of employment, or, if
Corporation cannot provide such benefits because Executive is no longer an employee, a dollar amount equal to the cost to Executive of obtaining such benefits or substantially similar benefits.
Executive only becomes entitled to receive these payments and continuation of benefits if he executes a General Release in favor of Corporation, Bank and their subsidiaries and affiliates. However, in
the event the payments described herein, when added to all other amounts or benefits provided to or on behalf of the Executive in connection with his termination of employment, would result in the
imposition of an excise tax under Code Section&nbsp;4999, such payments shall be retroactively (if necessary) reduced to the extent necessary to avoid such excise tax imposition. Upon written notice
to Executive, together with calculations of Corporation's independent auditors, Executive shall remit to Corporation the amount of the reduction, plus such interest as may be necessary to avoid the
imposition of such excise tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this contract to the contrary, if any portion of the amount herein payable to the Executive is determined to be

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section&nbsp;4(a) of this Agreement, if, as a result of physical or mental injury or impairment, Executive is unable to
perform all of the essential job functions of his position on a full time basis, taking into account any reasonable accommodation required by law, and without posing a direct threat to himself and
others, for a period up to one hundred eighty (180)&nbsp;days, all obligations of Corporation and Bank to pay Executive an Annual Base Salary as set forth in Paragraph&nbsp;5(a) of this Agreement
are suspended. Any paid time off, sick leave, or short term disability pay Executive may be entitled to receive, pursuant to an established disability plan or program of the Bank and/or Corporation,
if any exists, shall be considered part of the compensation Executive shall receive while disabled, and shall not be in addition to the compensation received by Executive under this provision of the
Agreement. Executive further agrees that should he remain unable to perform all of the essential functions of his position on a full time basis, taking into account any reasonable accommodation
required by law, and without posing a direct threat to himself or others, after one hundred eighty (180)&nbsp;days, the Bank and Corporation will suffer an undue hardship by continuing Executive in

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event that Executive's employment is involuntarily terminated by Corporation without Cause and no Change in Control shall have occurred at the date of such
termination, Corporation shall pay Executive an amount equal to and no greater than three (3)&nbsp;times the Executive's Annual Base Salary as defined in Section&nbsp;5(a) of this Agreement, which
amount shall be payable in thirty-six (36)&nbsp;equal monthly installments. In addition, Executive shall be entitled to a continuation of health, accident, life and disability insurance
benefits for thirty-six (36)&nbsp;months or until Executive secures substantially similar benefits through other employment, whichever shall first occur. However, if the payment
described
herein, when added to all other amounts or benefits provided to or on behalf of the Executive in connection with his termination of employment, would result in the imposition of an excise tax under
Code Section&nbsp;4999, such payments shall be retroactively (if necessary) reduced to the extent necessary to avoid such imposition. Upon written notice to Executive, together with calculations of
Corporation's independent auditors, Executive shall remit to Corporation the amount of the reduction plus such interest as may be necessary to avoid the imposition of such excise tax. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision of this contract to the contrary, if any portion of the amount herein payable to the Executive is determined to be non-deductible pursuant to the
regulations promulgated under Section&nbsp;280G of the Code, then Corporation shall be required only to pay to Executive the amount determined to be deductible under Section&nbsp;280G. </FONT></P>

interpretation or implementation of this Agreement (except for any enforcement sought with respect to Sections 9, 10, 11, or 12, which may be litigated in court), lengthy and expensive litigation will
not afford a practical resolution of the issues within a reasonable period of time. Consequently, each party agrees that all disputes, disagreements and questions of interpretation concerning this
Agreement are to be submitted for resolution, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to the American Arbitration Association (the "Association") in accordance with the Association's National Rules for the
Resolution of Employment Disputes or other applicable rules then in effect ("Rules"). Corporation or Executive may initiate an arbitration proceeding at any time by giving notice to the other in
accordance with the Rules. Corporation and Executive may, as a matter or right, mutually agree on the appointment of a particular arbitrator from the Association's pool. The arbitrator shall not be
bound by the rules of evidence and procedure of the courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but shall be bound by the substantive law applicable to this Agreement. The decision of the arbitrator,
absent fraud, duress, incompetence or gross and obvious error of fact, shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall be enforceable in courts of proper jurisdiction. Following written notice
of a request for arbitration, Corporation, Bank and Executive shall be entitled to an injunction restraining all further proceedings in any pending or subsequently filed litigation concerning this
Agreement, except as otherwise provided herein or any enforcement sought with respect to Sections 9, 10, 11, or 12. </FONT></P>
