                           <U>Non-transferability</U>.  No Option granted hereunder shall be transferred by the Optionee to whom granted
                           otherwise then pursuant to a beneficiary designation made under Section 14(b) hereof or by will or the laws
                           of descent and distribution, and an Option may be exercised during the lifetime of such Optionee only by
                           the Optionee or his or her guardian or legal representative.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of
                           Options not intended to constitute Incentive Stock Options under Internal Revenue Code Section 422, the
                           Committee may, in its discretion, authorize all or a portion of the Options to be granted to an Optionee to
                           be on terms which permit transfer by such Optionee to (i) the spouse, children (including step-children) or
                           grandchildren of the Optionee (each such individual and the Optionee shall be referred to as an "Eligible
                           Group Member"), (ii) a trust or trusts for the exclusive benefit of one or more Eligible Group Members or
                           for the benefit of one or more Eligible Group Members and one or more organizations exempt from income tax
                           and described in Code Section 501(c)(3), (iii) a partnership or similar vehicle in which such Eligible
                           Group Members are the only partners or participants, (iv) an organization exempt from income tax and
                           described in Code Section 501(c)(3) in which an Eligible Group Member is involved in either participation
                           and/or management, or (v) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in the Code or Title
                           1 of the Employee Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, provided that (x) the instrument of transfer
                           must be approved by the Company's Administrative Committee of Employee Benefits or its designee (the
                           "Administrative Committee"), and (z) transferred Options shall not again be transferable other than by will
                           or by the laws of descent and distribution.  Following transfer, any such Options shall continue to be
                           subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer.  The events of
                           termination of employment of Section 7(d) hereof shall continue to be applied with respect to the original
                           Optionee, following which the Options shall be exercisable by the transferee only to the extent, and for
                           the periods, specified by such Section 7(d)."
