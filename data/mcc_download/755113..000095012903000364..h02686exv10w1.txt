                                WARRANT AGREEMENT

               WARRANT TO PURCHASE 152,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

                                 SURGICARE, INC.
                            (a Delaware corporation)

                              Houston, Texas 77024

                             Not Exercisable Except
                        upon Conditions Herein Specified

         SURGICARE, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), hereby certifies
that TLC CAPITAL CORPORATION, its registered successors and permitted assigns
registered on the books of the Company maintained for such purposes, as the

stated above at the purchase price per Share set forth in Section 1(b) below
(the number of Shares and Exercise Price being subject to adjustment as
hereinafter provided) upon the terms and conditions herein provided.

         1.       Exercise of Warrants.

                  (a) Subject to subsection (b) of this Section 1, upon
presentation and surrender of this Warrant Agreement, with the attached Purchase
Form duly executed, at the principal office of the Company, or at such other
place as the Company may designate by written notice to the Holder hereof,
together with a certified or bank cashier's check payable to the order of the
Company in the amount of the Exercise Price times the number of Shares being
purchased (or in the case of exercise pursuant to Section 1 (c)(i) or (ii), as
set forth in such sections), the. Company shall deliver to the Holder hereof
within five (5) days, certificates representing the Shares being purchased. This
Warrant may be exercised in whole or in part; and, in case of exercise hereof in
part only, the Company, upon surrender hereof, will deliver to the Holder a new
Warrant Agreement or Warrant Agreements of like tenor entitling the Holder to
purchase the number of Shares as to which this Warrant has not been exercised at
the same Exercise Price as determined by this Warrant Agreement.

                  (b) This Warrant may be exercised, as to any shares of Common
Stock pursuant to this Warrant Agreement, at a price of $0.32 per share (the
"Exercise Price"). Holder shall have right to purchase 152,000 shares of Common
Stock underlying this Warrant Agreement beginning December 2, 2002. The Warrant
shall expire upon the close of business December 2, 2007.

                  (c) The Exercise Price shall be payable at the time of
exercise. The Exercise Price may be paid in cash (by cashiers' check) or by: (i)
surrender of shares of Common Stock of the Company already owned by the Holder,
or (ii) by converting this Warrant Agreement into Shares as provided in this
Section 1 (c)(ii), each election to be effected by surrender of this


<PAGE>



Warrant Agreement to the Company, together with the Net Issuance Exercise Notice
in the form attached hereto indicating such election, in which case the Company
shall issue to the Holder the number of Shares determined as follows:


                  X = Y (A-B)      Where: X = the number of Shares to be issued
                      -------
                         A                Y = the number of Shares as to which
                                              the Warrant Agreement is being
                                              exercised

                                          A = the Fair Market Value (as defined
                                              below) of one Share

                                          B = Exercise Price

         For purposes of the above calculations, the Fair Market Value of a
Share shall be determined as of the time of exercise to be equal to the average
of the closing bid and asked prices of the Common Stock as quoted in the
Over-the Counter Market Summary or the last reported sale price of the Common
Stock quoted on the American Stock Exchange or the closing price on any exchange
on which the Common Stock is then listed.

         2.       Exchange of Warrant.

                  At any time prior to the exercise hereof, upon presentation
and surrender to the Company, this Warrant may be exchanged, alone or with other
Warrants of like tenor registered in the name of the Holder, for another Warrant
or other Warrants of like tenor in the name of such Holder exercisable for the
same aggregate number of Shares as the Warrant or Warrants surrendered.

         3.       Rights and Oblations of Warrant Holder.

                  (a) The Holder of this Warrant Agreement shall not, by virtue
hereof, be entitled to any rights of a stockholder in the Company, either at law
or in equity; provided, however, that in the event that any certificate
representing the Shares is issued to the Holder hereof upon exercise of this
Warrant, such Holder shall, for all purposes, be deemed to have become the
holder of record of such Shares on the date on which this Warrant Agreement,
together with a duly executed Purchase Form, was surrendered and payment of the
Exercise Price was made, irrespective of the date of delivery of such Share
certificate. The rights of the Holder of this Warrant are limited to those
expressed herein and the Holder of this Warrant, by its acceptance hereof,
consents to and agrees to be bound by and to comply with all the provisions of
this Warrant Agreement, including, without limitation, all the obligations
imposed upon the Holder hereof by Sections 2 and 5 hereof. In addition, the
Holder of this Warrant Agreement, by accepting the same, agrees that the Company
may deem and treat the person in whose name this Warrant Agreement is registered
on the books of the Company maintained for such purposes as the absolute, true
and lawful owner for all purposes whatsoever, notwithstanding any notation of
ownership or other writing thereon, and the Company shall not be affected by any
notice to the contrary.

                  (b) No Holder of this Warrant Agreement shall be entitled to
vote or receive dividends or to be deemed the holder of Shares for any purpose,
nor shall anything contained in



                                       2
<PAGE>




this Warrant Agreement be construed to confer upon any Holder of this Warrant
Agreement any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to
vote, give or withhold consent to any action by the Company, whether upon any
recapitalization, issue of stock, reclassification of stock, consolidation,
merger, conveyance or otherwise, receive notice of meetings or other action
affecting stockholders (except for notices provided for herein), receive
dividends, subscription rights, or otherwise, until this Warrant shall have been
exercised and the Shares purchasable upon the exercise thereof shall have become
deliverable as provided herein; provided, however, that any such exercise on any
date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall
constitute the person in whose name the certificate for those Shares are to be
issued as the record holder thereof for all purposes at the opening of business
on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open, and the
Warrant surrendered shall not be deemed to have been exercised, in whole or in
part as the case may be, until the next succeeding day on which stock transfer
books are open for the purpose of determining entitlement to dividends on the
Company's common stock.

         4.       Shares Underlying Warrants.

                  The Company covenants and agrees that all Shares delivered
upon exercise of this Warrant shall, upon delivery of payment therefor, be duly
and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free and
clear of all taxes, liens and charges of any kind whatsoever, with
transferability subject to compliance with applicable securities laws.

         5.       Disposition of Warrants or Shares.

                  It shall be a condition to the transfer of this Warrant that
any transferee of this Warrant deliver to the Company his/its written agreement
to accept and be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Warrant
Agreement.

         6.       Adjustments.

                  The number of Shares purchasable upon the exercise of each
Warrant is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of any of
the events enumerated below:

                  (a) If at any time after the date of this Warrant and so long
as this Warrant is outstanding, there is a stock split, stock dividend,
subdivision, or similar distribution with respect to the Common Stock, or a
combination of the Common Stock, then, in such event, the Exercise Price shall
be adjusted in accordance with (b) below.

                  (b) Immediately upon the effective date of any event requiring
adjustment pursuant to (a), the Company shall adjust the Exercise Price then in
effect (to the nearest whole cent) as follows:

                           (i) in the event such adjustment is caused by a
                  forward stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, or other
                  similar distribution of shares of Common Stock, the Exercise
                  Price in effect, immediately prior to the effective date of
                  such event shall be decreased to an amount which shall bear
                  the same relation to the Exercise Price in effect immediately
                  prior to such event as the total number of shares of Common
                  Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event bears to the


                                        3




<PAGE>

                  total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
                  after such event;

                           (ii) in the event such adjustment is caused by a
                  combination of shares of Common Stock, the Exercise Price in
                  effect immediately prior to the close of business on the
                  effective date of such event shall be increased to an amount
                  which shall bear the same relation to the Exercise Price in
                  effect immediately prior to such event as the total number of
                  shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
                  event bears to the total number of shares of Common Stock
                  outstanding immediately after such event.

                  (c) Upon each adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to (b)
above, the Warrant outstanding prior to such adjustment in the Exercise Price
shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Exercise Price,
that number of shares of Common Stock (calculated to the nearest hundredth)
obtained by (i) multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Warrant prior to adjustment of the number of shares of Common
Stock by the Exercise Price in effect prior to adjustment of the Exercise Price
and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Exercise Price in effect after
such adjustment of the exercise price.

                  (d) In case the Company (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) permits any other entity to consolidate with or
merge into the Company and the Company is the continuing or surviving Company
but, in connection with such consolidation or merger, the Common Stock is
changed into or exchanged for common stock or other securities of any other
entity or cash or any other assets, or (iii) transfers all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any other entity, or (iv) effects a
reorganization or reclassification of the equity of the Company in such a way
that holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities,
cash or assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that, upon the exercise of
this Warrant at any time after the consummation of such consolidation, merger,
transfer, reorganization or reclassification, the Holder shall be entitled to
receive (at the aggregate Exercise Price in effect for Common Stock issuable
upon such exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such consummation), in
lieu of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise of this Warrant prior to such
consummation, the stock and other securities, cash and assets to which such
Holder would have been entitled upon such consummation if such Holder had so
exercised this Warrant immediately prior thereto.

         7.       Loss or Destruction.

                  Upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the Company of the
loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant Agreement and, in the
case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon delivery of an indemnity

                                WARRANT AGREEMENT

                WARRANT TO PURCHASE 48,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

                                 SURGICARE, INC.
                            (a Delaware corporation)
                         12727 Kimberley Lane, Suite 200
                              Houston, Texas 77024

                             Not Exercisable Except
                        upon Conditions Herein Specified

         SURGICARE, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), hereby certifies
that THOMAS YERDEN, his registered successors and permitted assigns registered
on the books of the Company maintained for such purposes, as the registered
holder hereof ("Holder"), for value received in connection with that certain
Settlement Agreement by and between the Company, Holder and TLC Capital
Corporation dated December 2, 2002 (the "Settlement Agreement"), is entitled to
purchase from the Company the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of
Common Stock of the Company, $.005 par value ("Shares" or "Common Stock"),
stated above at the purchase price per Share set forth in Section 1(b) below
(the number of Shares and Exercise Price being subject to adjustment as
hereinafter provided) upon the terms and conditions herein provided.

         1. Exercise of Warrants.

                  (a) Subject to subsection (b) of this Section 1, upon
presentation and surrender of this Warrant Agreement, with the attached Purchase
Form duly executed, at the principal office of the Company, or at such other
place as the Company may designate by written notice to the Holder hereof,
together with a certified or bank cashier's check payable to the order of the
Company in the amount of the Exercise Price times the number of Shares being
purchased (or in the case of exercise pursuant to Section 1(c)(i) or (ii), as
set forth in such sections), the Company shall deliver to the Holder hereof,
within five (5) days, certificates representing the Shares being purchased. This
Warrant may be exercised in whole or in part; and, in case of exercise hereof in
part only, the Company, upon surrender hereof, will deliver to the Holder a new
Warrant Agreement or Warrant Agreements of like tenor entitling the Holder to
purchase the number of Shares as to which this Warrant has not been exercised at
the same Exercise Price as determined by this Warrant Agreement.

                  (b) This Warrant may be exercised, as to any shares of Common
Stock pursuant to this Warrant Agreement, at a price of $0.32 per share (the
"Exercise Price"). Holder shall have right to purchase 48,000 shares of Common
Stock underlying this Warrant Agreement beginning December 2, 2002. The Warrant
shall expire upon the close of business December 2, 2007.

                  (c) The Exercise Price shall be payable at the time of
exercise. The Exercise Price may be paid in cash (by cashiers' check) or by: (i)
surrender of shares of Common Stock of the Company already owned by the Holder,
or (ii) by converting this Warrant Agreement into Shares as provided in this
Section 1(c)(ii), each election to be effected by surrender of this



<PAGE>

Warrant Agreement to the Company, together with the Net Issuance Exercise Notice
in the form attached hereto indicating such election, in which case the Company
shall issue to the Holder the number of Shares determined as follows:

                  X = Y (A-B)       Where: X = the number of Shares to be issued
                      -------
                         A                 Y = the number of Shares as to which
                                               the Warrant Agreement is being
                                               exercised

                                           A = the Fair Market Value (as defined
                                               below) of one Share

                                           B = Exercise Price

         For purposes of the above calculations, the Fair Market Value of a
Share shall be determined as of the time of exercise to be equal to the average
of the closing bid and asked prices of the Common Stock as quoted in the
Over-the-Counter Market Summary or the last reported sale price of the Common
Stock quoted on the American Stock Exchange or the closing price on any exchange
on which the Common Stock is then listed.

         2. Exchange of Warrant.

                  At any time prior to the exercise hereof, upon presentation
and surrender to the Company, this Warrant may be exchanged, alone or with other
Warrants of like tenor registered in the name of the Holder, for another Warrant
or other Warrants of like tenor in the name of such Holder exercisable for the
same aggregate number of Shares as the Warrant or Warrants surrendered.

         3. Rights and Oblations of Warrant Holder.

                  (a) The Holder of this Warrant Agreement shall not, by virtue
hereof, be entitled to any rights of a stockholder in the Company, either at law
or in equity; provided, however, that in the event that any certificate
representing the Shares is issued to the Holder hereof upon exercise of this
Warrant, such Holder shall, for all purposes, be deemed to have become the
holder of record of such Shares on the date on which this Warrant Agreement,
together with a duly executed Purchase Form, was surrendered and payment of the
Exercise Price was made, irrespective of the date of delivery of such Share
certificate. The rights of the Holder of this Warrant are limited to those
expressed herein and the Holder of this Warrant, by his acceptance hereof,
consents to and agrees to be bound by and to comply with all the provisions of
this Warrant Agreement, including, without limitation, all the obligations
imposed upon the Holder hereof by Sections 2 and 5 hereof. In addition, the
Holder of this Warrant Agreement, by accepting the same, agrees that the Company
may deem and treat the person in whose name this Warrant Agreement is registered
on the books of the Company maintained for such purposes as the absolute, true
and lawful owner for all purposes whatsoever, notwithstanding any notation of
ownership or other writing thereon, and the Company shall not be affected by any
notice to the contrary.

                  (b) No Holder of this Warrant Agreement shall be entitled to
vote or receive dividends or to be deemed the holder of Shares for any purpose,
nor shall anything contained in



                                       2
<PAGE>

this Warrant Agreement be construed to confer upon any Holder of this Warrant
Agreement any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to
vote, give or withhold consent to any action by the Company, whether upon any
recapitalization, issue of stock, reclassification of stock, consolidation,
merger, conveyance or otherwise, receive notice of meetings or other action
affecting stockholders (except for notices provided for herein), receive
dividends, subscription rights, or otherwise, until this Warrant shall have been
exercised and the Shares purchasable upon the exercise thereof shall have become
deliverable as provided herein; provided, however, that any such exercise on any
date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall
constitute the person in whose name the certificate for those Shares are to be
issued as the record holder thereof for all purposes at the opening of business
on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open, and the
Warrant surrendered shall not be deemed to have been exercised, in whole or in
part as the case may be, until the next succeeding day on which stock transfer
books are open for the purpose of determining entitlement to dividends on the
Company's common stock.

         4. Shares Underlying Warrants.

                  The Company covenants and agrees that all Shares delivered
upon exercise of this Warrant shall, upon delivery of payment therefor, be duly
and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free and
clear of all taxes, liens and charges of any kind whatsoever, with
transferability subject to compliance with applicable securities laws.

         5. Disposition of Warrants or Shares.

                  It shall be a condition to the transfer of this Warrant that
any transferee of this Warrant deliver to the Company his/its written agreement
to accept and be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Warrant
Agreement.

         6. Adjustments.

                  The number of Shares purchasable upon the exercise of each
Warrant is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of any of
the events enumerated below:

                  (a) If at any time after the date of this Warrant and so long
as this Warrant is outstanding, there is a stock split, stock dividend,
subdivision, or similar distribution with respect to the Common Stock, or a
combination of the Common Stock, then, in such event, the Exercise Price shall
be adjusted in accordance with (b) below.

                  (b) Immediately upon the effective date of any event requiring
adjustment pursuant to (a), the Company shall adjust the Exercise Price then in
effect (to the nearest whole cent) as follows:

                           (i) in the event such adjustment is caused by a
                  forward stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, or other
                  similar distribution of shares of Common Stock, the Exercise
                  Price in effect, immediately prior to the effective date of
                  such event shall be decreased to an amount which shall bear
                  the same relation to the Exercise Price in effect immediately
                  prior to such event as the total number of shares of Common
                  Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event bears to the



                                       3
<PAGE>

                  total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
                  after such event;

                           (ii) in the event such adjustment is caused by a
                  combination of shares of Common Stock, the Exercise Price in
                  effect immediately prior to the close of business on the
                  effective date of such event shall be increased to an amount
                  which shall bear the same relation to the Exercise Price in
                  effect immediately prior to such event as the total number of
                  shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
                  event bears to the total number of shares of Common Stock
                  outstanding immediately after such event.

                  (c) Upon each adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to (b)
above, the Warrant outstanding prior to such adjustment in the Exercise Price
shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Exercise Price,
that number of shares of Common Stock (calculated to the nearest hundredth)
obtained by (i) multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Warrant prior to adjustment of the number of shares of Common
Stock by the Exercise Price in effect prior to adjustment of the Exercise Price
and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Exercise Price in effect after
such adjustment of the exercise price.

                  (d) In case the Company (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) permits any other entity to consolidate with or
merge into the Company and the Company is the continuing or surviving Company
but, in connection with such consolidation or merger, the Common Stock is
changed into or exchanged for common stock or other securities of any other
entity or cash or any other assets, or (iii) transfers all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any other entity, or (iv) effects a
reorganization or reclassification of the equity of the Company in such a way
that holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities,
cash or assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that, upon the exercise of
this Warrant at any time after the consummation of such consolidation, merger,
transfer, reorganization or reclassification, the Holder shall be entitled to
receive (at the aggregate Exercise Price in effect for Common Stock issuable
upon such exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such consummation), in
lieu of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise of this Warrant prior to such
consummation, the stock and other securities, cash and assets to which such
Holder would have been entitled upon such consummation if such Holder had so
exercised this Warrant immediately prior thereto.

         7. Loss or Destruction.

                  Upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the Company of the
loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant Agreement and, in the
case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon delivery of an indemnity
agreement or bond satisfactory in form, substance and amount to the Company or,
in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this
Warrant Agreement, the Company will execute and deliver, in lieu there of a new
Warrant Agreement of like tenor.

         This Registration Rights Agreement (this "Agreement"), dated as of
December 2, 2002, is by and between SURGICARE, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Company"), and Thomas Yerden ("Holder").

                                   WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, Holder was issued a warrant to purchase 48,000 shares of
common stock dated the date hereof and a First Amendment to a warrant to
purchase 32,829 shares of common stock (the 48,000 shares of common stock and
32,829 shares of common stock are collectively referred to as "Shares"); and

         WHEREAS, the Company desires to grant to Holder certain registration
rights with respect to the Shares.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE ONE
                          Registration Rights Agreement

         SECTION 1.1 Registration Rights Available. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Company agrees to provide Holder with unlimited rights to
register on a "piggy-back" basis all of the Shares upon any registration
statement filed by the Company with the SEC. Such rights are referred to herein
as "Registration Rights." With respect to the Shares described hereby, such
Shares would include other securities issued or issuable at any time or from
time to time in respect of the Shares upon a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization or other similar event involving the Company (collectively, the
"Securities").

         SECTION 1.2 Piggy-back Registration, With respect to Holder's
Registration Rights, the parties agree as follows:

         (a) Pursuant to Section 1.1, the Company will (i) promptly give to
Holder written notice of any registration statement relating to the Company
securities; and (ii) include in such registration (and related qualification
under blue sky laws or other compliance), all the Securities specified in
Holder's written request or requests, mailed in accordance with Section 3.8
herein within 30 days after the date of such written notice from the Company.

         SECTION 1.3 Registration Procedure. With respect to each Registration
Right, the following provisions shall apply:

         (a) Holder shall be obligated to furnish to the Company such
information regarding the Securities and the proposed manner of distribution of
the Securities as the Company may request in writing and as shall be required in
connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to herein
and shall otherwise cooperate with the Company in connection with such
registration, qualification or compliance.

         (b) With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and
regulations of the SEC which may at any time permit the sale of Restricted
Securities (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) to the public
without registration, the Company agrees to use its best lawful efforts to:

                  (i) Make and keep public information available, as those terms
         are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, at all
         times during which the Company is subject to the reporting requirements
         of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act");

                  (ii) File with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and
         other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and
         the Exchange Act (at all times during which the Company is subject to
         such reporting requirements); and

                  (iii) So long as Holder owns any Restricted Securities, to
         furnish to Holder forthwith upon request a written statement by the
         Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of said
         Rule 144 and with regard to the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at
         all times during which the Company is subject to such reporting
         requirements), a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of
         the Company, and such other reports and documents of the Company and
         other information in the possession of or reasonably obtainable by the
         Company as Holder may reasonably request in availing Holder of any rule
         or regulation of the Commission allowing Holder to sell any such
         securities without registration.

         (c) The Company agrees that it will furnish to Holder such number of
prospectuses, offering circulars or other documents incident to any
registration, qualification or compliance referred to herein as provided or, if
not otherwise provided, as Holder from time to time may reasonably request.

         (d) All expenses (except for legal fees for Holder's attorney and any
sales commission paid by Holder) of any registrations permitted pursuant to this
Agreement and of all other offerings by the Company (including, but not limited
to, the expenses of any qualifications under the blue-sky or other state
securities laws and compliance with governmental requirements of preparing and
filing any post-effective amendments required for the lawful distribution of the
Securities to the public in connection with such registration, of supplying
prospectuses, offering circulars or other documents) will be paid by the
Company.

         (e) In connection with the preparation and filing of a registration
statement under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will
give Holder, and Holder's counsel and accountants, the opportunity to
participate in the preparation of such registration statement, each prospectus
included therein or filed with the Commission, and each amendment thereof or
supplement thereto.

                                   ARTICLE TWO
                                 Indemnification

         SECTION 2.1 Indemnification by the Company. In the event of any
registration of the Securities of the Company under the Securities Act, the
Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Holder and each other person who
participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities
against any and all claims, demands, losses, costs, expenses, obligations,
liabilities, joint or several, damages, recoveries and deficiencies, including
interest, penalties and attorneys' fees (collectively, "Claims"), to which
Holder or underwriter may become subject under the Securities



                                       2
<PAGE>

Act or otherwise, insofar as such Claims (or actions or proceedings, whether
commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based on any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in
any registration statement under which Holder's Securities were registered under
the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary
prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and
the Company will reimburse Holder and each such underwriter for any legal or any
other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any such Claim (or action or proceeding in respect thereof); provided
that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any
such Claim (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of
or is based on an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission made in such registration statement, any such preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in
reliance on and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company
through an instrument duly executed by Holder specifically stating that it is
for use in the preparation thereof. Such indemnity shall remain in full force
and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Holder or any
such underwriter and shall survive the transfer of the Securities by Holder.

         SECTION 2.2 Indemnification by Holder. The Company may require, as a
condition to including the Securities in any registration statement filed
pursuant to this Agreement, that the Company shall have received an undertaking
satisfactory to it from Holder, to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same
manner and to the same extent as set forth in Section 2.1) the Company, each
director of the Company, each officer of the Company and each other person, if
any, who controls the Company, within the meaning of the Securities Act, with
respect to any statement or alleged statement in or omission or alleged omission
from such registration statement, any preliminary prospectus contained therein,
or any amendment or supplement thereto, if such statement or alleged statement
or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance on and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company through an instrument duly executed
by Holder specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation of such
registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary
prospectus, amendment or supplement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum
liability hereunder which any holder shall be required to suffer shall be
limited to the net proceeds to such Holder from the Shares sold by such Holder
in the offering. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect,
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any such
director, officer or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of the
Securities by Holder.

         SECTION 2.3 Notices of Claims, etc. Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding
involving a Claim referred to in this Article Two, such indemnified party will,
if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give
written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action, provided that
the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not
relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this Article Two, except
to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure
to give notice. In case any such action is brought against an indemnifying
party, unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect
of such Claim, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to
assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly
notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the
defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying
party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of
any judgment or enter



                                       3
<PAGE>

into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from
all liability in respect of such Claim.



                                  ARTICLE THREE
                                  Miscellaneous

         SECTION 3.1 Consent to Amendments. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, the provisions of this Agreement may be amended or waived only
by the written agreement of the Company and Holder and shall be effective only
to the extent specifically set forth in such writing.

Agreement will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision will be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of this Agreement.

         SECTION 3.5 Delays or Omissions. No failure to exercise or delay in the
exercise of any right, power or remedy accruing to Holder on any breach or
default of the Company under this Agreement shall impair any such right, power
or remedy nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such breach or
default.

         SECTION 3.6 Remedies Cumulative. All remedies under this Agreement, or
by law or otherwise afforded to any party hereto shall be cumulative and not
alternative.

         SECTION 3.7 Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings of this

Act or otherwise, insofar as such Claims (or actions or proceedings, whether
commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based on any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in
any registration statement under which Holder's Securities were registered under
the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary
prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and
the Company will reimburse Holder and each such underwriter for any legal or any
other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any such Claim (or action or proceeding in respect thereof); provided
that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any
such Claim (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of
or is based on an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission made in such registration statement, any such preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in
reliance on and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company
through an instrument duly executed by Holder specifically stating that it is

and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Holder or any
such underwriter and shall survive the transfer of the Securities by Holder.

         SECTION 2.2 Indemnification by Holder. The Company may require, as a
condition to including the Securities in any registration statement filed
pursuant to this Agreement, that the Company shall have received an undertaking
satisfactory to it from Holder, to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same
manner and to the same extent as set forth in Section 2.1) the Company, each
director of the Company, each officer of the Company and each other person, if
any, who controls the Company, within the meaning of the Securities Act, with
respect to any statement or alleged statement in or omission or alleged omission
from such registration statement, any preliminary prospects contained therein,
or any amendment or supplement thereto, if such statement or alleged statement
or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance on and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company through an instrument duly executed
by Holder specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation of such
registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary
prospectus, amendment or supplement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum
liability hereunder which any holder shall be required to suffer shall be
limited to the net proceeds to such Holder from the Shares sold by such Holder
in the offering. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect,
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any such
director, officer or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of the
Securities by Holder.

         SECTION 2.3 Notices of Claims. etc. Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding
involving a Claim referred to in this Article Two, such indemnified party will,
if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give
written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action, provided that
the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not
relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this Article Two, except
to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure
