<FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT made as of the 3rd day of February, 2003 by and between ARROW ELECTRONICS, INC., a New York corporation with its principal office at 50 Marcus Drive, Melville, New York 11747 (the "Company"), and William E. Mitchell, 223 Atherton Avenue, Atherton, California 94027 (the "Executive").</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company wishes to employ the Executive as President and Chief Executive Officer, with the responsibilities and duties of a principal executive officer of the Company; and</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Executive wishes to accept such employment and to render services to the Company on the terms set forth in, and in accordance with the provisions of, this Agreement (the "Agreement");</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Employment and Duties</U>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Employment</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company hereby employs the Executive for the Employment Period defined in Paragraph 3, to perform such duties for the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates and to hold such offices as may be specified from time to time by the Company's Board of Directors, subject to the following provisions of this Agreement.  The Executive hereby accepts such employment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Duties and Responsibilities</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is contemplated that the Executive will be the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company but the Board of Directors shall have the right to adjust the duties, responsibilities and title of the Executive as the Board of Directors may from time to time deem to be in the interests of the Company (provided, however, that during the Employment Period, without the consent of the Executive, he shall not be assigned any titles, duties or responsibilities which, in the aggregate, represent a material diminution in, or are materially inconsistent with, his title, duties, and responsibilities as President and Chief Executive Officer).  If the Board of Directors does not either continue the Executive in the office of President and Chief Executive Officer or elect him to some other principal executive office satisfactory to the Executive, the Executive shall have the right to decline to give further service to the Company and shall have the rights and obligations which would accrue to him under Paragraph 7 if he were discharged without cause.  If the Executive decides to exercise such right to decline to give further service, he shall within forty-five days after such action or omission by the Board of Directors give written notice to the Company stating his objection and the action he thinks necessary to correct it, and he shall permit the Company to have a forty-five day period in which to correct its action or omission.  If the Company makes a correction satisfactory to the Executive, the Executive shall be obligated to continue to serve the Company.  If the Company does not make such a correction, the Executive's rights and obligations under Paragraph 7 shall accrue at the expiration of such forty-five day period.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Time Devoted to Duties</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive shall devote substantially all of his normal business time and efforts to the business of the Company, its subsidiaries and its affiliates, the amount of such time to be sufficient, in the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors, to permit him diligently and faithfully to serve and endeavor to further their interests to the best of his ability.  The Company acknowledges that the Executive is currently serving as a member of the Board of Directors of Rogers Corporation and certain educational and non-profit organizations and agrees that the Executive will be permitted to continue to occupy such positions during the Employment Period.  The Executive will seek the consent of the Board of Directors prior to agreeing to serve on any other corporate board of directors.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Family Relocation</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;So as to facilitate performance of his responsibilities, the Executive undertakes that by November 1, 2003 he will have caused his family to relocate to the New York area.  If he does not do so, the Company's sole remedy, at its option, shall be to terminate the Executive's employment by giving him one year's notice of termination during which he shall receive full salary and benefits, including SERP accrual.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Member of Board of Directors</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors shall appoint the Executive as a member of the Board of Directors as of the first day of the Employment Period.  It is contemplated that the Executive will be renominated for election as a director by the shareholders at all subsequent Annual Meetings of Shareholders during the Employment Period.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Compensation</U>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Monetary Remuneration and Benefits</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Employment Period, the Company shall pay to the Executive for all services rendered by him in any capacity:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.&nbsp;&nbsp;a minimum base salary at the rate of $750,000 per year (payable in accordance with the Company's then prevailing practices, but in no event less frequently than in equal monthly installments), subject to increase from time to time in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company; provided that, should the Company institute a company-wide pay cut/furlough program, such salary may be decreased by up to 15%, but only for as long as said company-wide program is in effect; </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;such additional compensation by way of salary or bonus or fringe benefits as the Board of Directors of the Company in its sole discretion shall authorize or agree to pay, payable on such terms and conditions as it shall determine; and</P>

The Executive's incentive payment for any year will be appropriately pro-rated to reflect a partial year of employment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive shall participate in the Company's Unfunded Pension Plan for Selected Executives (the "SERP").</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Expenses</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Employment Period, the Company agrees to reimburse the Executive, upon the submission of appropriate vouchers, for out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, expenses for travel, lodging and entertainment) incurred by the Executive in the course of his duties hereunder.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Office and Staff</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company will provide the Executive with an office, secretary and such other facilities as may be reasonably required for the proper discharge of his duties hereunder.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Participation in Plans</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Executive shall have the right to participate in any and all of the plans or programs made available by the Company (or its subsidiaries, divisions or affiliates) to, or for the benefit of, executives (including the annual stock option and restricted stock grant programs) or employees in general, on a basis consistent with other senior executives.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>The Employment Period</U>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Employment Period", as used in the Agreement, shall mean the period beginning as of the date hereof and terminating on the last day of the calendar month in which the first of the following occurs:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the death of the Executive;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)&nbsp;&nbsp;the disability of the Executive as determined in accordance with Paragraph 4 hereof and subject to the provisions thereof;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)&nbsp;&nbsp;the termination of the Executive's employment by the Company for cause in accordance with Paragraph 5 hereof; or</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)&nbsp;&nbsp;January 31, 2006; provided, however, that, if either the Company or the Executive does not give the other at least twelve months notice of its intention to permit this Agreement to expire on the then scheduled termination date of the Employment Period (unless sooner terminated as otherwise provided herein), the Employment Period shall automatically be extended for one or more additional twelve month periods beyond the then scheduled expiration date thereof.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Disability</U>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this Agreement, the Executive will be deemed "disabled" upon the earlier to occur of (i) his becoming disabled as defined under the terms of the disability benefit program applicable to the Executive, if any, and (ii) his absence from his duties hereunder on a full-time basis for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days as a result of his incapacity due to accident or physical or mental illness.  If the Executive becomes disabled (as defined in the preceding sentence), the Employment Period shall terminate on the last day of the month in which such disability is determined.  Until such termination of the Employment Period, the Company shall continue to pay to the Executive his base salary, any additional compensation authorized by the Company's Board of Directors, and any other remuneration and benefits provided in accordance with Paragraph 2, all without delay, diminution or proration of any kind whatsoever (except that his remuneration hereunder shall be reduced by the amount of any payments he may otherwise receive as a result of his disability pursuant to a disability program provided by or through the Company), and his medical benefits and life insurance shall remain in full force.  After termination of the Employment Period as a result of the disability of the Executive, the medical benefits covering the Executive and his family shall remain in place (subject to the eligibility requirements and other conditions continued in the underlying plan, as described in the Company's employee benefits manual, and subject to the requirement that the Executive continue to pay the "employee portion" of the cost thereof), and the Executive's life insurance policy under the Management Insurance Program shall be transferred to him, as provided in the related agreement, subject to the obligation of the Executive to pay the premiums therefor.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company agrees to provide the Executive with supplemental long-term disability payments in an amount which, when added to the amounts payable to the Executive under the Arrow Electronics Long-Term Disability Plan, will be equal to two-thirds of the Executive's base salary provided in paragraph 2(a), provided that, for purposes of this calculation any amounts payable to the Executive which are payable free of tax shall be grossed up to the equivalent taxable amount.  Such additional long-term disability payments shall be subject to the same qualifications and limitations as are set forth in the Arrow Electronics Long-Term Disability Plan.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that, notwithstanding such a determination of disability, the Executive is determined not to be totally and permanently disabled prior to the then scheduled expiration of the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to resume employment with the Company under the terms of this Agreement for the then remaining balance of the Employment Period.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Termination for Cause</U>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of any malfeasance, willful misconduct, active fraud or gross negligence by the Executive in connection with his employment hereunder, the Company shall have the right to terminate the Employment Period by giving the Executive notice in writing of the reason for such proposed termination.  If the Executive shall not have corrected such conduct to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company within thirty days after such notice, the Employment Period shall terminate and the Company shall have no further obligation to the Executive hereunder but the restriction on the Executive's activities contained in Paragraph 8 and the obligations of the Executive contained in Paragraph 9(b) and 9(c) shall continue in effect as provided therein.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Death Benefit</U>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive is a participant in the Company's Management Insurance Program.  During the Employment Period, the Company will continue to maintain in effect for the Executive such program or some other form of life insurance providing the Executive's estate or named beneficiary a benefit upon the Executive's death at least equal to the net after-tax benefit provided by the Management Insurance Program.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Termination Without Cause</U>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the Company discharges the Executive without cause, the Executive shall be entitled to the salary provided in Paragraph 2(a), two thirds100 percent of his base salary in place of the incentive provided in Paragraph 2(b), the vesting of any restricted stock awards and the immediate exercisability of any stock options, as well as his rights under Paragraph 4, which would have vested or become exercisable during the full Employment Period (which, in that event, shall continue until the then scheduled termination date unless sooner terminated by the Executive's disability or death), and the Company shall have no right to set off payments due the Executive with any amounts he may earn from gainful employment elsewhere.  It is expressly agreed and understood that the Executive shall be under no obligation to seek such employment.  The provisions of Paragraph 8 restricting the Executive's activities and Executive's obligations under Paragraph 9(b) and 9(c) shall continue in effect.  The provisions of this Paragraph 7 shall not act to limit the Executive's ability to recover damages from the Company for breaching this Agreement by terminating the Employment Period without cause, except as otherwise permitted by Paragraph 3.</P>
