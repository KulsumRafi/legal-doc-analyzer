     strategy for the marketing and Promotion of the Products. However, other

     Committee, chaired by Columbia and consisting of up to three (3) members
     from each party. The chairperson's duties shall include site selection,

     member of the Committee shall be an employee or member of the Board of
     Directors of the party that appointed such member. Initial appointments
     shall be made within fourteen (14) days of the date of this Agreement. A
     member of the Committee may be removed at any time, with or without cause,
     by the party that appointed such member. The Committee shall meet each
     quarter, or otherwise at the call of the chairperson to review, coordinate,
     and discuss issues regarding the Promotional Program. In addition, the
     Committee shall review and resolve issues pertaining to this Agreement. The
     members of the Committee will use reasonable efforts to reach consensus on
     all decisions.

In Witness Whereof, Columbia and Innovex have caused this Work Order # 8872 to
