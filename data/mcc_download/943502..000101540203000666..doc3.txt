                                  MEDIA RELEASE


                     PROGEN HALF-YEAR REPORT - GOOD PROGRESS

BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA MARCH 6TH 2003, Progen Industries Ltd (ASX: PGL) (Nasdaq:
PGLAF) reporting its half-year results today announced progressive results from
all divisions.

Strong revenue contributions are being made by Commercial Services (Contract
Manufacturing and Lifesciences Sales & Distribution). Contract Manufacturing
revenue was up by 332% to $927,000 and Lifesciences Sales & Distribution income
increased by 13.5% to $1.4 million, compared to the previous corresponding
period. Recent negotiation of several international and local contracts for
Contract Services and a new Lifesciences agency distribution agreement for a new
product line should enable the division to reach the $4.2 million budget and the
profitability target for 2003. Total operating revenue increased by 28.7%.

Research and Development expenditure increased by 19.7% as anticipated compared
to the previous half-year reflecting the increased level of activities over the
reporting period. New initiatives include the commencement of a fourth Phase
I/II clinical trial with PI-88 in lung cancer, a new collaboration agreement
with the Australian National University's Research School of Chemistry to
complement our Drug Discovery efforts and the in-licensing of an additional
potential anti-cancer treatment for liver cancer code-named PI-166.

The operating loss before equity accounting for the investment in Medigen
Biotechnology Corp. (MBC) has been maintained at $3.33 million in comparison
with $3.28 million for the corresponding period. This result has been achieved
through vigilant cash management, significantly increased Commercial Services
revenue and focused research and development activities.

The increase in the company's share of MBC's loss by 52.9% from $580,000 to
$887,000 is indicative of the increased level of expenditure incurred by the MBC
through its own; in-licensing initiatives, investment in biotech ventures and
ongoing operational costs.

The operating loss from ordinary activities after tax of $4.2 million compared
to $3.8 million is in line with the Company's expectations.

Progen's CFO Milton McColl commented. "The half-year report card indicates that
we are on track and the company remains focused towards continuing this
performance into the second half-year".
