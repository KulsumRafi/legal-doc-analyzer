                           (i) that the Exchange Offer is being made pursuant to

                  tendered will be accepted for exchange;

                  notice is mailed) (the "EXCHANGE DATES");

                         (iii) that any Registrable Security not tendered will
                  remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest, but will
                  not retain any rights under this Agreement;

                          (iv) that Holders electing to have a Registrable
                  Security exchanged pursuant to the Exchange Offer will be
                  required to surrender such Registrable Security, together with
                  the enclosed letters of transmittal, to the institution and at

                  business on the last Exchange Date; and

                           (v) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their
                  election, not later than the close of business on the last
                  Exchange Date, by sending to the institution and at the
                  address (located in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New
                  York) specified in the notice, a telegram, telex, facsimile
                  transmission or letter setting forth the name



                                       5
<PAGE>

                  of such Holder, the principal amount of Registrable Securities
                  delivered for exchange and a statement that such Holder is
                  withdrawing his election to have such Registrable Securities
                  exchanged.

                  As soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date, the
         Company shall:

                                    (A) accept for exchange Registrable
                           Securities or portions thereof tendered and not
                           validly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange Offer; and

                                    (B) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
                           the Trustee for cancellation all Registrable
                           Securities or portions thereof so accepted for
                           exchange by the Company and issue, and cause the
                           Trustee to promptly authenticate and mail to each
                           Holder, an Exchange Security equal in aggregate
                           principal amount to the aggregate principal amount of
                           the Registrable Securities surrendered by such
                           Holder.

                  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to complete
         the Exchange Offer as provided above and shall comply with the
         applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and other
         applicable laws and regulations in connection with the Exchange Offer.
         The Exchange Offer shall not be subject to any conditions, other than
         that the Exchange Offer does not violate applicable law or any
         applicable interpretation of the staff of the SEC. The Company shall
         inform the Initial Purchasers of the names and addresses of the Holders
         to whom the Exchange Offer is made, and the Initial Purchasers shall
         have the right, subject to applicable law, to contact such Holders and
         otherwise facilitate the tender of Registrable Securities in the
         Exchange Offer.

                  If, during the period the Exchange Offer Registration
         Statement is effective, an event occurs which makes any statement made
         in such Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the related Prospectus
         untrue in any material respect or which requires the making of any
         changes in such Exchange Offer Registration Statement in order to make
         the statements therein not misleading or in such Prospectus in order to
         make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
         which they were made, not misleading, the Company shall use its
         reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a supplement
         or post-effective amendment to the Exchange Offer Registration
         Statement or the related Prospectus or any document incorporated
         therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as
         thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities,
         such Prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material
         fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
         therein, in light of the circumstances under



                                       6
<PAGE>

         which they were made, not misleading. The Company agrees to notify the
         Holders to suspend the exchange of the Registrable Securities as
         promptly as practicable after the occurrence of such an event, and the
         Holders hereby agree to suspend such exchange until the Company has
         amended or supplemented the Prospectus to correct such misstatement or
         omission.

                  (b) If (i) the Company determines that the Exchange Offer
         Registration provided for in Section 2(a) above is not available or may
         not be consummated as soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date
         because it would violate applicable law or the applicable
         interpretations of the staff of the SEC, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not
         for any other reason consummated within 260 days following the Closing
         Date or (iii) in the written opinion of counsel for the Holders a Shelf
         Registration Statement must be filed and a Prospectus must be delivered
         by any Holder in connection with any reoffering or resale of
         Registrable Securities, the Company shall (x) file with the SEC within
         75 days following such determination, date or notice of such opinion of
         counsel is given to the Company a Shelf Registration Statement
         providing for the resale by the Holders (other than those who fail to
         comply with the paragraph immediately following clause (p) of Section
         3) of all of their Registrable Securities and (y) use its reasonable
         best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to become
         effective within 60 days of the filing of such Shelf Registration
         Statement. If the Company is required to file a Shelf Registration
         Statement solely as a result of the matters referred to in clause (iii)
         of the preceding sentence, the Company shall use its reasonable best
         efforts to file and have declared effective by the SEC both an Exchange
         Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) with respect to
         all Registrable Securities and a Shelf Registration Statement (which
         may be a combined Registration Statement with the Exchange Offer
         Registration Statement) with respect to reoffers and resales of
         Registrable Securities held by the Holders who must deliver the related
         Prospectus. The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
         keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the
         expiration of the period referred to in Rule 144(k) of the 1933 Act
         with respect to the Registrable Securities or such shorter period that
         will terminate when all of the Registrable Securities covered by the
         Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf
         Registration Statement or cease to be Registrable Securities within the
         meaning of this Agreement. The Company further agrees to supplement or
         amend the Shelf Registration Statement if required by the rules,
         regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by
         the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the 1933 Act or
         by any other rules and regulations thereunder for shelf registration or
         if reasonably requested by a Holder with respect to information
         relating to such Holder, and to use its reasonable best efforts to
         cause any such amendment to become effective and such Shelf
         Registration Statement to become usable as soon as thereafter
         practicable. The Company agrees to furnish to the Holders of
         Registrable




                                       7
<PAGE>

         Securities copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after
         its being used or filed with the SEC.

                  (c) The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in
         connection with the registration pursuant to Section 2(a) or Section
         2(b). Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts, if any, and
         commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or
         disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf
         Registration Statement.

                  (d) An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to
         Section 2(a) hereof or a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to
         Section 2(b) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless
         it has been declared effective by the SEC; provided, however, that, if,
         after it has been declared effective, the offering of Registrable
         Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement is interfered
         with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the
         SEC or any other governmental agency or court, such Registration
         Statement will be deemed not to have become effective during the period
         of such interference until the offering of Registrable Securities
         pursuant to such Registration Statement may legally resume.

                  (e) The Company and the Initial Purchasers agree that the
         Holders will suffer damages if the Company fails to fulfill its
         obligations under Section 2(a) or Section 2(b) hereof and that it would
         not be feasible to ascertain the extent of such damages with precision.
         Accordingly, the Company agrees that if:

                           (i)   the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is
                  not filed with the SEC on or prior to the 90th day following
                  the Closing Date,

                           (ii)  the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is
                  not declared effective on or prior to the 210th day following
                  the Closing Date,

                           (iii) the Exchange Offer is not completed on or prior
                  to the 260th day following the Closing Date, or

                           (iv)  the Shelf Registration Statement is required to
                  be filed but is not filed or declared effective within the
                  time period set forth herein or is declared effective but
                  thereafter ceases to be effective or usable prior to the
                  expiration of the period referred to in Rule 144(k) with
                  respect to the Registrable Securities other than after the
                  Registrable Securities have been disposed of under the Shelf
                  Registration Statement or cease to be Registrable Securities,
                  without being succeeded within two Business Days by a
                  post-effective amendment which cures the failure and that is
                  itself immediately declared effective,

                  (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) a
         "REGISTRATION DEFAULT"), liquidated damages ("LIQUIDATED DAMAGES") will
         accrue on the affected Registrable Securities and the affected Exchange
         Securities, as applicable. The rate of Liquidated Damages will be 0.25%
         per annum of the principal amount of Registrable Securities held by
         such Holder for the first 90-day period immediately following the
         occurrence of a Registration Default, increasing by 0.25% per annum
         with respect to each subsequent 90-day period, up to a maximum of 1.00%
         per annum, from and including the date on which any such Registration
         Default shall occur to, but excluding, the earlier of (1) the date on
         which all Registration Defaults have been cured or (2) the date on
         which all the Registrable Securities and Exchange Securities otherwise
         become freely transferable by Holders other than affiliates of the
         Securities without further registration under the 1933 Act.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) the amount of Liquidated
         Damages payable shall not increase because more than one Registration
         Default has occurred and is pending and (2) a Holder of Registrable
         Securities or Exchange Securities who is not entitled to the benefits
         of the Shelf Registration Statement (i.e., such Holder has not elected
         to including information) shall not be entitled to Liquidated Damages
         with respect to a Registration Default that pertains to the Shelf
         Registration Statement.

                  (f) The Company shall notify the Trustee within one Business
         Day after each date on which an event occurs in respect of which
         Liquidated Damages are required to be paid. Any amounts of Liquidated
         Damages due pursuant to this Section 2 will be payable in addition to
         any other interest payable from time to time with respect to the
         Registrable Securities in cash semi-annually on the interest payment
         dates specified in the Indenture (to the holders of record as specified
         in the Indenture), commencing with the first such interest payment date
         occurring after any such Liquidated Damages commence to accrue. The
         amount of Liquidated Damages will be determined in a manner consistent
         with the calculation of interest under the Indenture.

                  (g) Without limiting the remedies available to the Holders,
         the Company acknowledges that any failure by the Company to comply with
         its obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof may result
         in material irreparable injury to the Holders for which there is no
         adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages
         for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure,
         the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be
         required to specifically enforce the Company's obligations under
         Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof.

         3. Registration Procedures.

         In connection with the obligations of the Company with respect to the

                  (a) prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on
         the appropriate form under the 1933 Act, which form shall (x) be
         selected by the Company, (y) in the case of a Shelf Registration, be
         available for the sale of the Registrable Securities by the selling
         Holders thereof and (z) comply as to form in all material respects with
         the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and rules and regulations
         promulgated thereunder and include all financial statements required by
         the SEC to be filed therewith, and use reasonable best efforts to cause

         accordance with Section 2 hereof;

                  (b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and
         post-effective amendments to each Registration Statement as may be
         necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for the
         applicable period and cause each Prospectus to be supplemented by any
         required prospectus supplement and, as so supplemented, to be filed
         pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act; and keep each Prospectus
         current during the period described under Section 4(3) and Rule 174
         under the 1933 Act that is applicable to transactions by brokers or
         dealers with respect to the Registrable Securities or Exchange
         Securities;

                  (c) in the case of a Shelf Registration, furnish to each
         Holder of Registrable Securities, to counsel for the Initial Purchasers
         and to counsel for the Holders and to each Underwriter of an
         Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities, if any, without
         charge, as many copies of each Prospectus, including each preliminary
         Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto and such other
         documents as such Holder or Underwriter may reasonably request, in
         order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the
         Registrable Securities; and, subject to Section 3(i), the Company
         consents to the use of such Prospectus and any amendment or supplement
         thereto in accordance with applicable law by each of the selling
         Holders of Registrable Securities and any such Underwriters in
         connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities
         covered by and in the manner described in such Prospectus or any
         amendment or supplement thereto in accordance with applicable law;

                  (d) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the
         Registrable Securities under all applicable state securities or blue
         sky laws of such jurisdictions as any Holder of Registrable Securities
         covered by a Registration Statement shall reasonably request in writing
         by the time the applicable Registration Statement is declared effective
         by the SEC, and to cooperate with such Holders in connection with any
         filings required to be made with the National Association of Securities
         Dealers, Inc. and do any and all other acts and things which may be
         reasonably necessary or advisable to




                                       10
<PAGE>

         enable such Holder to consummate the disposition in each such
         jurisdiction of such Registrable Securities owned by such Holder;
         provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to (i)
         qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any
         jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but
         for this Section 3(d), (ii) file any general consent to service of
         process or (iii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction if
         it is not so subject;

                  (e) in the case of a Shelf Registration, notify each Holder of
         Registrable Securities, counsel for the Holders and counsel for the
         Initial Purchasers (or, if applicable, separate counsel for the
         Holders) promptly and, if requested by any such Holder or counsel,
         confirm such advice in writing, (i) when a Registration Statement has
         become effective and when any post-effective amendment thereto has been
         filed and becomes effective, (ii) of any request by the SEC or any
         state securities authority for amendments and supplements to a
         Registration Statement and Prospectus or for additional information
         after the Registration Statement has become effective, (iii) of the
         issuance by the SEC or any state securities authority of any stop order
         suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or the
         initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iv) if, between the
         effective date of a Registration Statement and the closing of any sale
         of Registrable Securities covered thereby, the representations and
         warranties of the Company contained in any underwriting agreement,
         securities sales agreement or other similar agreement, if any, relating
         to the offering cease to be true and correct in all material respects
         or if the Company receives any notification with respect to the
         suspension of the qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale
         in any jurisdiction or the initiation of any proceeding for such
         purpose, (v) of the happening of any event during the period a Shelf
         Registration Statement is effective which makes any statement made in
         such Shelf Registration Statement or the related Prospectus untrue in
         any material respect or which requires the making of any changes in
         such Registration Statement in order to make the statements therein not
         misleading or in such Prospectus in order to make the statements
         therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
         not misleading and (vi) of any determination by the Company that a
         post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be
         appropriate;

                  (f) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal
         of any order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement
         at the earliest possible moment and provide immediate notice to each
         Holder of the withdrawal of any such order;

                  (g) in the case of a Shelf Registration, furnish to each
         Holder of Registrable Securities, without charge, at least one
         conformed copy of each Registration Statement and any post-effective
         amendment thereto (without




                                       11
<PAGE>

         documents incorporated therein by reference or exhibits thereto, unless
         requested in writing);

                  (h) in the case of a Shelf Registration, cooperate with the
         selling Holders of Registrable Securities to facilitate the timely
         preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable
         Securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends (unless
         required by applicable securities laws) and enable such Registrable
         Securities to be in such denominations (consistent with the provisions
         of the Indenture) and registered in such names as the selling Holders
         may reasonably request at least two Business Days prior to the closing
         of any sale of Registrable Securities;

                  (i) in the case of a Shelf Registration, upon the occurrence
         of any event contemplated by Section 3(e)(v) hereof, use its reasonable
         best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a supplement or
         post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement or the related
         Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file
         any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the
         purchasers of the Registrable Securities, such Prospectus will not
         contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
         material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
         the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
         Company agrees to notify the Holders to suspend use of the Prospectus
         as promptly as practicable after the occurrence of such an event, and
         the Holders hereby agree to suspend use of the Prospectus until the
         Company has amended or supplemented the Prospectus to correct such
         misstatement or omission and has furnished copies of the amended or
         supplemented Prospectus to the Holders or until the Company notifies
         the Holders that the sale of the Registrable Securities may be resumed;

                  (j) a reasonable time prior to the filing of any Registration
         Statement, any Prospectus, any amendment to a Registration Statement or
         amendment or supplement to a Prospectus, or any document which is to be
         incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement or Prospectus
         after the initial filing of a Registration Statement, provide copies of
         such document to the Initial Purchasers and their counsel (and, in the
         case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Holders and their counsel)
         and make such of the representatives of the Company as shall be
         reasonably requested by the Initial Purchasers or their counsel (and,
         in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Holders or their
         counsel) available for discussion of such document, and shall not at
         any time file or make any amendment to the Shelf Registration
         Statement, any Prospectus or any amendment of or supplement to a Shelf
         Registration Statement or a Prospectus or any document which is to be
         incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement or a
         Prospectus, of which the Initial Purchasers and their counsel (and, in
         the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Holders or their
         counsel) shall not have previously been advised and furnished a copy or
         to which the Initial




                                       12
<PAGE>

         Purchasers or their counsel (and, in the case of a Shelf Registration
         Statement, the Holders or their counsel) shall reasonably object;

                  (k) obtain a CUSIP number for all Exchange Securities or
         Registrable Securities, as the case may be, not later than the
         effective date of the applicable Registration Statement;

                  (l) cause the Indenture to be qualified under the Trust
         Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "TIA"), in connection with the
         registration of the Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as
         the case may be, and cooperate with the Trustee and the Holders to
         effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for the
         Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the TIA
         and execute, and use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the
         Trustee to execute, all documents as may be required to effect such
         changes and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the
         SEC to enable the Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner;

                  (m) in the case of a Shelf Registration, make available for
         inspection by a representative of the Holders of the Registrable
         Securities, any Underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant
         to such Shelf Registration Statement, and attorneys and accountants
         designated by the Holders, at reasonable times and in a reasonable
         manner, all relevant financial and other records, pertinent documents
         and properties of the Company, and cause the respective officers,
         directors and employees of the Company to supply all information
         reasonably requested by any such representative, Underwriter, attorney
         or accountant in connection with a Shelf Registration Statement, in
         each case that would customarily be reviewed or examined in connection
         with "due diligence" review of the Company;

                  (n) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange
         Securities to continue to be rated by two nationally recognized
         statistical rating organizations (as such term is defined in Rule
         436(g)(2) under the 1933 Act), if the Registrable Securities have been
         rated prior to the initial sale of such Registrable Securities;

                  (o) if reasonably requested by any Holder of Registrable
         Securities covered by a Registration Statement, (i) promptly
         incorporate in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such
         information with respect to such Holder as such Holder reasonably
         requests to be included therein and (ii) make all required filings of
         such Prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as
         reasonably practicable after the Company has received notification of
         the matters to be incorporated in such filing; and

                  (p) in the case of a Shelf Registration, enter into such
         customary agreements and take all such other actions in connection
         therewith (including those reasonably requested by the Holders of a
         majority of the Registrable




                                       13
<PAGE>

         Securities being sold thereunder) in order to expedite or facilitate
         the disposition of such Registrable Securities thereunder including,
         but not limited to, pursuant to an Underwritten Offering and in such
         connection, (i) to the extent possible, make such representations and
         warranties to the Holders and any Underwriters of such Registrable
         Securities with respect to the business of the Company and its
         subsidiaries, the Registration Statement, Prospectus and documents
         incorporated by reference or deemed incorporated by reference, if any,
         in each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by
         issuers to underwriters in underwritten offerings and confirm the same
         if and when requested, (ii) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company
         (which counsel and opinions, in form, scope and substance, shall be
         reasonably satisfactory to the Holders of a majority in principal
         amount of the Registrable Securities being sold under such Shelf
         Registration Statement, such Underwriters and their respective counsel)
         addressed to each selling Holder and Underwriter of Registrable
         Securities, covering the matters customarily covered in opinions
         requested in underwritten offerings, (iii) obtain "cold comfort"
         letters from the independent certified public accountants of the
         Company (and, if necessary, any other certified public accountant of
         any subsidiary of the Company, or of any business acquired by the
         Company for which financial statements and financial data are or are
         required to be included in the Registration Statement) addressed to
         each selling Holder and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, such
         letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type
         customarily covered in "cold comfort" letters in connection with
         underwritten offerings, and (iv) deliver such documents and
         certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Holders of a
         majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities being sold
         under such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Underwriters, and
         which are customarily delivered in underwritten offerings, to evidence
         the continued validity of the representations and warranties of the
         Company made pursuant to clause (i) above and to evidence compliance
         with any customary conditions contained in an underwriting agreement.

                  In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company may
         require each Holder of Registrable Securities to furnish to the Company
         such information regarding the Holder and the proposed distribution by
         such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from time
         to time reasonably request in writing. No Holder of Registrable
         Securities may include its Registrable Securities in such Shelf
         Registration Statement unless and until such Holder furnishes such
         information to the Company. Each Holder including Registrable
         Securities in a Shelf Registration Statement shall agree to furnish
         promptly to the Company all information regarding such Holder and the
         proposed distribution by such Holder of such Registrable Securities
         required to make the information previously furnished to the Company by
         such Holder not materially misleading.

                  In connection with an Exchange Offer Registration, each Holder
         exchanging Securities for Exchange Securities shall be required to
         represent that (i) the Exchange Securities are being obtained in the
         ordinary course of business of the Person receiving such Exchange
         Securities, whether or not such Person is a Holder, (ii) neither such
         Holder nor any such other Person has an arrangement or understanding
         with any Person to participate in the distribution of Securities or
         Exchange Securities, (iii) other than as set forth in Section 4, if the
         Holder is not a broker-dealer, or is a broker-dealer but will not
         receive Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for
         Securities, neither the Holder nor any such other Person is engaged in
         or intends to participate in a distribution of the Exchange Securities
         and (iv) neither the Holder nor any such other Person is an "affiliate"
         of the Company within the meaning of Rule 405 under the 1933 Act or, if
         such Person is an "affiliate," that such Holder will comply with the
         registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the 1933 Act to
         the extent applicable.

                  In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder
         agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the
         happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(e)(v) hereof,
         such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable
         Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement until such Holder's
         receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus
         contemplated by Section 3(i) hereof, and, if so directed by the
         Company, such Holder will destroy or deliver to the Company (at its
         expense) all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies
         then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such
         Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice.

                  If the Company shall give any such notice to suspend the
         disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration
         Statement, the Company shall extend the period during which the
         Registration Statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this
         Agreement by the number of days during the period from and including
         the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when
         the Holders shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended
         Prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions. The Company may give
         such notice so long as there are no more than 90 days during any 365
         day period in which such suspensions are in effect.

                  The Holders of Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf
         Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Registrable
         Securities in an Underwritten Offering. In any such Underwritten
         Offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or
         managers (the "UNDERWRITERS") that will administer the offering will be
         selected by the Majority Holders of the Registrable Securities included
         in such offering, provided that such Underwriters shall be reasonably
         acceptable to the Company.

         4. Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer.

                  (a) The parties hereto understand that the staff of the SEC
         has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange
         Securities for its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for
         Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of
         market-making or other trading activities (a "PARTICIPATING
         BROKER-DEALER"), may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the
         meaning of the 1933 Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the
         requirements of the 1933 Act in connection with any resale of such
         Exchange Securities.

                  The Company understands that it is currently the staff's
         position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer
         Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a
         statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating
         Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the
         Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange
         Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by
         Participating Broker-Dealers to satisfy their prospectus delivery
         obligation under the 1933 Act in connection with resales of Exchange
         Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise
         meets the requirements of the 1933 Act.

                  (b) In light of the above, notwithstanding the other
         provisions of this Agreement, the Company agrees that the provisions of
         this Agreement as they relate to a Shelf Registration shall also apply
         to an Exchange Offer Registration to the extent, and with such
         reasonable modifications thereto as may be, reasonably requested by the
         Initial Purchasers or by one or more Participating Broker-Dealers, in
         each case as provided in clause (ii) below, in order to expedite or
         facilitate the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating
         Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in
         Section 4(a) above; provided that:

                           (i) the Company shall not be required to amend or
                  supplement the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer
                  Registration Statement, as would otherwise be contemplated by
                  Section 3(i), for a period exceeding 180 days after the last
                  Exchange Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to the
                  penultimate paragraph of Section 3 of this Agreement) and
                  Participating Broker-Dealers shall not be authorized by the
                  Company to deliver and shall not deliver such Prospectus after
                  such period in connection with the resales contemplated by
                  this Section 4; and

                           (ii) the application of the Shelf Registration
                  procedures set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement to an
                  Exchange Offer Registration, to the extent not required by the
                  positions of the staff of the SEC or the 1933 Act and the
                  rules and regulations thereunder, will be in conformity with
                  the reasonable request in




                                       16
<PAGE>

                  writing to the Company by the Initial Purchasers or with the
                  reasonable request in writing to the Company by one or more
                  broker-dealers who certify to the Initial Purchasers and the
                  Company in writing that they anticipate that they will be
                  Participating Broker-Dealers; and provided further that, in
                  connection with such application of the Shelf Registration
                  procedures set forth in Section 3 to an Exchange Offer
                  Registration, the Company shall be obligated (x) to deal only
                  with one entity representing the Participating Broker-Dealers,
                  which shall be Salomon Smith Barney Inc. unless it elects not
                  to act as such representative, (y) to pay the fees and
                  expenses of only one counsel representing the Participating
                  Broker-Dealers, which shall be counsel to the Initial
                  Purchasers unless such counsel elects not to so act and (z) to
                  cause to be delivered only one, if any, "cold comfort" letter
                  with respect to the Prospectus in the form existing on the
                  last Exchange Date and with respect to each subsequent
                  amendment or supplement, if any, effected during the period
                  specified in clause (i) above.

                  (c) The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the
         Company, other than as Holders in accordance with the terms hereof, or
         to any other Holder with respect to any request that they may make
         pursuant to Section 4(b) above.

         5. Indemnification and Contribution.

                  (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
         Initial Purchasers, each Holder and each Person, if any, who controls
         the Initial Purchasers or any Holder within the meaning of either
         Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, or is under
         common control with, or is controlled by, the Initial Purchasers or any
         Holder (each, a "PARTICIPANT"), from and against all losses, claims,
         damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal fees
         or other expenses reasonably incurred by a Participant in connection
         with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any
         untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
         contained in any Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto)
         pursuant to which Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities were
         registered under the 1933 Act, including all documents incorporated
         therein by reference, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to
         state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
         necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or caused by
         any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
         contained in any Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company
         shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) forming a
         part of such Registration Statement, or caused by any omission or
         alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the
         statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were
         made not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
         liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or
         alleged




                                       17
<PAGE>

         untrue statement or omission based upon and in conformity with
         information relating to the Initial Purchasers or any Holder furnished
         to the Company in writing by the Initial Purchasers or any selling
         Holder expressly for use therein; provided that the foregoing indemnity
         with respect to any Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any
         Holder from whom the Person asserting any such losses, claims, damages
         or liabilities purchased Securities, or any Person controlling such
         Holder, if a copy of the final Prospectus (as then amended or
         supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or
         supplements thereto) was not sent by, or delivered on behalf of, such
         Holder to such Person at or prior to the written confirmation of the
         sale of the Securities to such Person, if the final Prospectus (as so
         amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to
         such loss, claim, damage or liability. In connection with any
         Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3, the Company will also
         enter into an underwriting agreement pursuant to which the Company will
         agree to indemnify the Underwriters, if any, selling brokers, dealers
         and similar securities industry professionals participating in such
         Underwritten Offering, their officers and directors and each Person who
         controls such Persons (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the
         1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act) to the same extent as provided
         above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested
         in connection with any Registration Statement for such Underwritten
         Offering.

                  (b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to
         indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Initial Purchasers and the
         other selling Holders, and each of their respective directors and
         officers who sign the Registration Statement and each Person, if any,
         who controls the Company, the Initial Purchasers and any other selling
         Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or
         Section 20 of the 1934 Act to the same extent as the foregoing
         indemnity from the Company to the Initial Purchasers and the Holders
         pursuant to Section 5(a), but only with reference to information
         relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such
         Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement (or any
         amendment thereto) or any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
         thereto).

                  (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental
         investigation) shall be instituted involving any Person in respect of
         which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or
         paragraph (b) above, such Person (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall
         promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought
         (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") in writing, but the failure to so promptly
         notify the Indemnifying Party shall not negate the obligation to so
         indemnify such Indemnified Party unless the Indemnifying Party is
         materially prejudiced by such delay, and the Indemnifying Party, upon
         request of the Indemnified Party, shall retain counsel reasonably
         satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to represent the Indemnified
         Party and




                                       18
<PAGE>

         any others the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and
         shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such
         proceeding. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Party shall have
         the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such
         counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless (i)
         the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually
         agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to
         any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the
         Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and, in the opinion of
         counsel to the Indemnifying Party, representation of both parties by
         the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
         differing interests between them. It is understood that the
         Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or
         related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (a) the
         fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any
         local counsel) for the Initial Purchasers and all Persons, if any, who
         control the Initial Purchasers within the meaning of either Section 15
         of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, (b) the fees and
         expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local
         counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the
         Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the
         Company within the meaning of either such Section and (c) the fees and
         expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local
         counsel) for all Holders and all Persons, if any, who control any
         Holders within the meaning of either such Section, and that all such
         fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In such
         case involving the Initial Purchasers and Persons who control the
         Initial Purchasers, such firm shall be designated in writing by the
         Initial Purchasers. In such case involving the Holders and such Persons
         who control Holders, such firm shall be designated in writing by the
         Majority Holders. In all other cases, such firm shall be designated by
         the Company. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
         settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but,
         if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the
         plaintiff, the Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify the Indemnified
         Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such
         settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior
         written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any
         pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which such Indemnified
         Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been
         sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement
         includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
         liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

                  (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or
         paragraph (b) of this Section 5 is unavailable to an Indemnified Party
         or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
         liabilities, then each Indemnifying Party under such paragraph, in lieu
         of indemnifying such Indemnified Party thereunder, shall contribute to
         the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of
         such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in




                                       19
<PAGE>

         such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
         Indemnifying Party or parties on the one hand and of the Indemnified
         Party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or
         omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities,
         as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
         fault of the Company and the Holders shall be determined by reference
         to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement
         of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
         material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the
         Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
         information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
         omission. The Holders' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to
         this Section 5(d) are several in proportion to the respective principal
         amount of Registrable Securities of the applicable Holder that were
         registered pursuant to a Registration Statement.

                  (e) The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be
         just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d) were
         determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation
         that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to
         in Section 5(d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified
         Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities
         referred to in Section 5(d) above shall be deemed to include, subject
         to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses
         reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
         investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding
         the provisions of this Section 5, no Holder shall be required to
         indemnify or contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the
         total price at which Registrable Securities were sold by such Holder
         exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been
         required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or
         omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent
         misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act)
         shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of
         such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this
         Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies
         which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Party at law or in
         equity.

                  The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this
         Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect
         regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any
         investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers, any
         Holder or any Person controlling the Initial Purchasers or any Holder,
         or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any
         Person controlling the Company, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange
         Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a
         Shelf Registration Statement.

         6. Miscellaneous.

                  (a) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company has not entered
         into, and on or after the date of this Agreement will not enter into,
         any agreement which is inconsistent with the rights granted to the
         Holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise
         conflicts with the provisions hereof. The rights granted to the Holders
         hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with
         the rights granted to the holders of the Company's other issued and
         outstanding securities under any such agreements.

                  (b) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement,
         including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified
         or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the
         provisions hereof may not be given unless the Company has obtained the
         written consent of Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
         principal amount of the outstanding Registrable Securities affected by
         such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent; provided,
         however, that no amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent
         to any departure from the provisions of Section 5 hereof or this
         paragraph (b) shall be effective as against any Holder of Registrable
         Securities unless consented to in writing by such Holder.

                  (c) Notices. All notices and other communications provided for
         or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery,
         registered first-class mail, telecopier, or any courier guaranteeing
         overnight delivery (i) if to a Holder, at the most current address
         given by such Holder to the Company by means of a notice given in
         accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(c), which address
         initially is, with respect to the Initial Purchasers, the address set
         forth in the Purchase Agreement; and (ii) if to the Company, initially
         at the Company's address set forth in the Purchase Agreement and
         thereafter at such other address, notice of which is given in
         accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(c).

                  All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have
         been duly given at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered;
         five Business Days after being deposited in the mail, postage pre-paid,
         if mailed; when answered back, if telexed; when receipt is
         acknowledged, if telecopied; and on the next Business Day if timely
         delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery.

                  Copies of all such notices, demands, or other communications
         shall be concurrently delivered by the Person giving the same to the
         Trustee, at the address specified in the Indenture.

                  (d) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the
         benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, assigns and
         transferees of each of the parties, including, without limitation and
         without the need for an




                                       21
<PAGE>

         express assignment, subsequent Holders of Registrable Securities;
         provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to permit any assignment,
         transfer or other disposition of Registrable Securities in violation of
         the terms of the Securities and the Purchase Agreement. If any
         transferee of any Holder shall acquire Registrable Securities, in any
         manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such Registrable
         Securities shall be held subject to all of the terms of this Agreement,
         and by taking and holding such Registrable Securities such Person shall
         be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all
         of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and such Person shall be
         entitled to receive the benefits hereof. The Initial Purchasers shall
         have no liability or obligation to the Company with respect to any
         failure by a Holder to comply with, or any breach by any other Holder
         of, any of the obligations of such Holder under this Agreement.

                  (e) Purchases and Sales of Securities. The Company shall not,
         and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its affiliates (as
         defined in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act) not to, purchase and then
         resell or otherwise transfer any Securities.

                  (f) Third Party Beneficiary. Each Holder shall be a third
         party beneficiary to the agreements made hereunder between the Company,
         on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, shall
         be bound by all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and shall
         have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent it
         deems such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect its rights or
         the rights of Holders hereunder.

                  (g) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number
         of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts,
         each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and
         all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
         agreement.

                  (h) Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for
         convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect
         the meaning hereof.

                  (i) Governing Law This Agreement shall be governed by, and
         construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

                  (j) Severability. In the event that any one or more of the
         provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any
         circumstance, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable the validity,
         legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other
         respect and of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be
         affected or impaired thereby.
