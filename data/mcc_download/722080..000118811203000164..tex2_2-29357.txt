        (1)     The Parties reserve the right to amend, modify and/or supplement
                this Plan of Arrangement at any time and from time to time
                provided that any such amendment, modification or supplement
                must be contained in a written document which is (i) agreed to
                by the Parties pursuant to the Combination Agreement, (ii) filed
                with the Court and, if made following the Meetings (or any of

                communicated to shareholders in the manner required by the
                Court.

        (2)     Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of
                Arrangement may be proposed by the Parties at any time prior to
                or at the Meetings, with or without any prior notice or
                communication, and if so proposed and accepted by the persons
                voting at the Meetings (other than as may be required under the
                Interim Order), shall become part of this Plan of Arrangement
                for all purposes.

        (3)     Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of
                Arrangement which is approved by the Court following the

                Parties pursuant to the Combination Agreement.

                such Party, provided that (i) it is agreed to by the Parties
                pursuant to the Combination Agreement, and (ii) it concerns a
                matter which, in the reasonable opinion of the Parties, is of an
                administrative or ministerial nature required to better give
                effect to the implementation of this Plan of Arrangement and is
                not materially adverse to the financial or economic interests of
                any of the shareholders of such Party.
