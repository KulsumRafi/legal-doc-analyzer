&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          If a Participant&#146;s employment is terminated by the Company, other than for
          Cause, Death or Disability, all unpaid Installments will be immediately due and
          payable to such Participant as of his or her termination of employment.
          &#147;Cause&#148; for purposes of this accelerated payment will mean the
          Participant&#146;s willful and continued failure to substantially perform his or
          her reasonable assigned duties (other than as a result of incapacity due to
          physical or mental condition), or the Participant&#146;s willful engagement in
          illegal conduct or gross misconduct (which in the case of a Senior Officer is
          materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company or Arch Wireless, Inc.
          (&#147;AWI&#148;)), or conviction of a felony. A Senior Officer is the CEO, the
          President and Chief Operating Officer (the &#147;COO&#148;), the Executive Vice
          President and Chief Financial Officer (&#147;CFO&#148;), an Executive Vice
          President, a Senior Vice President, a Division President and an Executive Level
          Vice President. If a Participant dies or is terminated in connection with
          becoming disabled within the meaning of the Company&#146;s long term disability
          benefit program, the Participant (or his estate) will receive a fraction of the
          next Installment to be paid which is determined by multiplying the dollar amount
          of that Installment by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of weeks
          the Participant worked since the Installment payment prior to his death or
          disability (or, if none, the Start Date) and denominator of which is the total
          number of weeks from such last Installment (or, if none, the Start Date) to the
          next Installment; and </FONT></P>

          if a Change in Control occurs prior to the Final Installment other than a Change
          of Control involving a significant investment as described in the next sentence,
          then all unpaid Installments will be immediately due and payable to all
          Participants as of the Change in Control. A Change in Control for purposes of
          this Retention Plan, will be the sale of substantially all of the assets of the
          Company (or its direct or indirect parent entity) as an operating business, a
          merger of the Company, (or its direct or indirect parent entity with an entity
          other than the Company), or a significant investment, with a value of at least
          twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000), in the Company, its subsidiaries or
          its direct or indirect parent entity on terms satisfactory to the Administrative
          Agent for the Secured Lenders if such investment occurs prior to the
          Reorganization Plan Effective Date (a &#147;Change in Control&#148;). </FONT></P>

          Net Transaction Value. The Net Transaction Value will equal the total value of
          the transaction less the transaction costs directly associated with such
