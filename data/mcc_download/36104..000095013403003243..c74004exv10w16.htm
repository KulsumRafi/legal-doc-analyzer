<P align="center"><FONT size="2"><B>INTRODUCTION</B></FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">1.01. <B>History</B>. Effective January&nbsp;1, 1987, the Star Banc Corporation (formerly
First National Cincinnati Corporation) adopted the Star Banc Corporation
Non-Qualified Retirement Plan. Effective January&nbsp;1, 1983, Firstar Corporation
(formerly First Wisconsin Corporation) adopted the Firstar Corporation Pension
Benefits Equalization Plan. Firstar Corporation also maintained the Firstar
Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan for Key Executives and had liabilities
for deferred compensation under certain other plans and arrangements
established by entities acquired by Firstar Corporation prior to November&nbsp;20,
1998.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">Effective November&nbsp;20, 1998, Star Banc Corporation and Firstar Corporation
merged through an exchange of shares to form a new Firstar Corporation. On
September&nbsp;20, 1999, Firstar Corporation acquired substantially all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Mercantile Bancorporation Inc., which
maintained the Mercantile Bancorporation Inc. Supplemental Retirement Plan.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">Effective January&nbsp;1, 1984, First Bank System, Inc. established the First Bank
System, Inc. Excess Benefit Plan. Effective January&nbsp;1, 1992, First Bank
System, Inc. established the First Bank System, Inc. Nonqualified Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan. In 1997 First Bank System changed its name to U.S.
Bancorp and thereafter, the plans, as amended and restated, became known as the
U.S. Bancorp Defined Benefit Excess Plan and the U.S. Bancorp Nonqualified
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, respectively.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">Firstar Corporation merged into U.S. Bancorp effective February&nbsp;27, 2001.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">On October&nbsp;16, 2001, the Board of Directors of U.S. Bancorp ratified and
approved actions taken on July&nbsp;17, 2001 by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors freezing certain benefits under the U.S. Bancorp
Nonqualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, modifying the Company&#146;s
various excess benefits to reflect changes in the underlying tax-qualified
pension plans, and consolidating the Company&#146;s various nonqualified deferred
compensation plans into a single combined plan.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">1.02. <B>Plan Mergers</B>. This Plan reflects the following plan mergers, effective
as of the date specified, except where an earlier or later effective date is
specified in this plan document (or an amendment hereto):

</TABLE>
<P><FONT size="2">1.03. <B>Purpose</B>. The primary purpose of this Plan is to restore retirement
benefit payments to those eligible employees whose retirement benefits under
the Qualified Plan will be reduced by the limitations imposed by Sections
401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
&#147;Code&#148;), and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(&#147;ERISA&#148;), or by reason of their election to defer receipt of income that would
otherwise have been taken into account for purposes of calculating benefits
under the Qualified Plan. The Plan is also intended to provide supplemental
retirement benefits to selected executives, and to provide for payment of
certain other liabilities for deferred compensation as described in the
Appendices hereto.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">1.04. <B>Separate Excess Benefit Plan</B>. Notwithstanding anything in this plan
document to the contrary, the separable part of this Plan that is maintained
solely for the purpose of providing benefits in excess of the limitations on
contributions and benefits imposed by Section&nbsp;415 of the Code to persons who do
not qualify as members of &#147;a select group of management or highly compensated
employees&#148; (as that phrase is used in ERISA) shall be treated as a separate
plan that is an excess benefit plan. Such separate excess benefit plan shall
be referred to as the &#147;U.S. Bancorp 415 Excess Benefit Plan&#148;.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">1.05. <B>Relation to Qualified Plan</B>. This Plan is completely separate from any
tax-qualified retirement plan.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">1.06. <B>No Effect on Former Employees</B>. Except as may be otherwise required by
law or hereinafter specifically provided, this amended and restated plan
document shall not affect the rights of or benefits payable to, or with respect

<P><FONT size="2">7.01. <B>Eligibility, Commencement</B>. Except as otherwise provided in the
applicable Appendix&nbsp;B, if a Participant who is eligible for Supplemental
Benefits or named in Appendix&nbsp;A-3 is determined to be Disabled prior to
termination of his or her employment with the Employer, the Participant shall
be entitled to receive a Disability Benefit as provided in this Article&nbsp;VII.
Such benefit shall commence on the Participant&#146;s Disability Commencement Date
and shall continue until the Participant dies, ceases to have a Disability, or
attains his or her Normal Retirement Date, whichever happens first.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">7.02. <B>Amount</B>. The benefit payable to the Disabled Participant shall be sixty
percent (60%) of his or her current Monthly Earnings reduced by any benefits
payable to such Participant from the Qualified Plan, Social Security, Workers&#146;
Compensation or any long-term disability plan sponsored by the Employer. The
amount by which each monthly Disability Benefit payment shall be reduced on
account of benefits payable under the Qualified Plan shall be the monthly
benefit payable under the Qualified Plan to the Disabled Participant in the
single life annuity form, whether or not the Participant&#146;s Qualified Plan
benefit is actually paid in that form.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">7.03. <B>Cessation of Disability</B>. If the Disabled Participant ceases to be
Disabled prior to his Normal Retirement Date, Disability Benefits hereunder
shall cease. Upon subsequent termination of the Disabled Participant&#146;s
employment with the Employer, the Disabled Participant&#146;s Excess and
Supplemental Benefits shall be calculated including service credit for the
period of Disability.

<P><FONT size="2">7.04. <B>Normal Retirement</B>. If the Disabled Participant&#146;s Disability continues
until his or her Normal Retirement Date, Disability benefits hereunder shall
cease and the Participant shall be treated as having terminated employment with
the Employer at his or her Normal Retirement Date. The Disabled Participant&#146;s
Excess or Supplemental Benefit at Normal Retirement Date shall be calculated by
assuming that his or her &#147;Benefit Service&#148; (as defined in the Qualified Plan)
and Monthly Earnings continued uninterrupted from his or her date of Disability
until his or her Normal Retirement Date.

<P><FONT size="2">9.01. <B>Unfunded Plan</B>. The obligation of the Employer to make payments under
this Plan constitutes only the unsecured promise of the Employer to make such
payments. The Participant shall have no lien, prior claim or other security
interest in any property of the Employer. If a fund is established by the
Employer in connection with this Plan, the property therein shall remain
subject to the claims of the creditors of the Employer in the event the
Employer is (i)&nbsp;is unable to pay its debts as they become due, or (ii)&nbsp;is
subject to a pending proceeding as a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy
Code, or (iii)&nbsp;is determined to be insolvent by a federal or state regulatory
agency having the authority to do so.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">9.02. <B>Insurance</B>. If the Employer elects to finance all or a portion of its
costs in connection with this Plan through the purchase of life insurance or
other investments, the Participant agrees, as a condition of participation in
this Plan, to cooperate with the Employer in the purchase of such investment to
any extent reasonably required by the Employer and relinquishes any claim he or
she may have either for himself or herself or any beneficiary to the proceeds
of any such investment or any other rights or interests in such investment. If
a Participant fails or refuses to cooperate, then notwithstanding any other
provision of this Plan all benefits payable to or with respect to the
Participant under the Plan shall be immediately and irrevocably terminated and
forfeited, and the person shall cease to be a Participant.

<P><FONT size="2">9.03. <B>Limitation on Liability</B>. Neither the Employer&#146;s officers nor any member
of its Board of Directors in any way secures or guarantees the payment of any
benefit or amount which may become due and payable hereunder to or with respect
to any Participant. Each Participant and other person entitled at any time to
payments hereunder shall look solely to the assets of the Employer for such
payments as an unsecured, general creditor. After benefits shall have been
paid to or with respect to a Participant and such payment purports to cover in
full the benefit hereunder, such former Participant or other person or persons,
as the case may be, shall have no further right or interest in the other assets
of the Employer in connection with this Plan. Neither the Employer nor any of
its officers nor any member of its Boards of Directors shall be under any
liability or responsibility for failure to effect any of the objectives or
purposes of the Plan by reason of the insolvency of the Employer.

may have the effect of reducing the Excess Benefits, Supplemental Benefits or
Other Benefits accrued prior to January&nbsp;1, 2002, by any Participant or any

<P><FONT size="2">13.01. <B>No Employment Contract</B>. Nothing contained in this Plan shall be deemed
to give any Participant or Employee the right to be retained in the service of
the Employer or to limit the right of the Employer to discharge any Participant
or Employee at any time regardless of the effect which such discharge shall
have upon him as a Participant of the Plan.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">13.02 <B>Effect on Other Plans</B>. This Plan shall not alter, enlarge or diminish
any person&#146;s employment rights or obligations or rights or obligations under
the Qualified Plan or any other plan. It is specifically contemplated that the
Qualified Plan will, from time to time, be amended and possibly terminated.
All such amendments and termination shall be given effect under this Plan (it
being expressly intended that this Plan shall not lock in the benefit
structures of the Qualified Plan as they exist at the adoption of this Plan or
upon the commencement of participation, or commencement of benefits by any
Participant).

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">13.02. <B>Errors in Computations</B>. Neither the Company, the Employer, or the Plan
Administrator shall be liable or responsible for any error in the computation
of any benefit payable to or with respect to any Participant resulting from any
misstatement of fact made by the Participant or by or on behalf of any survivor
to whom such benefit shall be payable, directly or indirectly, to the Company,
the Employer or the Plan Administrator and used in determining the benefit.
Neither the Company, the Employer or the Plan Administrator shall be obligated
or required to increase the benefit payable to or with respect to such
Participant which, on discovery of the misstatement, is found to be understated
as a result of such misstatement of the Participant. However, the benefit of
any Participant which is overstated by reason of any such misstatement or any
other reason shall be reduced to the amount appropriate in view of the truth
(and to recover any prior overpayment).

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">13.03. <B>No Salary Reduction</B>. This Plan does not involve a reduction in salary
for the Participants or a foregoing of an increase in future salary by the
Participant.

</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">13.04. <B>Payments to Minors, Incompetents</B>. In making any distribution to or for
the benefit of any minor or incompetent Beneficiary, the Plan Administrator, in
his sole, absolute and uncontrolled discretion, may, but need not, make such
distribution to a legal or natural guardian or other relative of such minor or
court appointed committee of such incompetent, or to any adult with whom such
minor or incompetent temporarily or permanently resides, and any such authority
and discretion to expend such distribution for the use and benefit of such
minor or incompetent. The receipt of such guardian, committee, relative or
other person shall be a complete discharge to the Employer, without any
responsibility on its part or on the part of the Plan Administrator to see to
the application thereof.

actual payment to such person. The Employer shall not recognize any such
effort to convey any interest under this Plan. No benefit payable under this
Plan shall be subject to attachment, garnishment, execution following judgment
or other legal process before actual payment to such person. This Plan is not

may be required to withhold by applicable laws. Such taxes may be withheld
from any benefits due hereunder or from any other compensation to which the
Participant is entitled from the Employer.

attained a given age on the individual&#146;s birthday for that age (and not on the

deemed to be February&nbsp;28 in any year that is not a leap year. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Plan Statement or any election or designation made
under the Plan, any individual who feloniously and intentionally kills a
Participant shall be deemed for all purposes of this Plan and all elections and
designations made under this Plan to have died before such Participant. A
final judgment of conviction of felonious and intentional killing is conclusive
for the purposes of this Section. In the absence of a conviction of felonious
and intentional killing, the Principal Sponsor shall determine whether the
killing was felonious and intentional for the purposes of this Section.
Whenever appropriate, words used herein in the singular may be read in the

various Sections of this Plan are inserted for convenience of reference only
and are not part of this Plan, and they shall not be considered in determining
the purpose, meaning or intent of any provision hereof. Any reference in this
Plan to a statute or regulation shall be considered also to mean and refer to
any subsequent amendment or replacement of that statute or regulation.
