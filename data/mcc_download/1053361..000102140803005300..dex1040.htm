to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change of control as a means of enhancing stockholder value. The Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;) recognizes that such consideration can be
a distraction to the Employee and can cause the Employee to consider alternative employment opportunities. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the
continued dedication and objectivity of the Employee, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

Control. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">D. Certain capitalized terms used in the Agreement are
