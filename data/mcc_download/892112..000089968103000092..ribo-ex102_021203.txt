Stockholder's Shares, pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Stockholder is a party or by which Stockholder or any of

AND (III), for any such breaches, defaults or other occurrences that would not
prevent or materially delay the performance by Stockholder of Stockholder's
obligations under this Agreement.

          (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder does
not, and the performance of this Agreement by Stockholder will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Entity (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement), except
where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits,
or to make such filings or notifications, would not prevent or materially delay

                                   ARTICLE 3

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     Section 3.1 DEFINITIONS. Each capitalized term used but not otherwise
defined in this Agreement has the meaning ascribed to such term in the Stock
Purchase Agreement.

     Section 3.2 TERMINATION. This Agreement shall terminate and be of no
further force and effect (a) by the written mutual consent of the parties hereto
or (b) automatically and without any required action of the parties hereto upon
the earlier to occur of the Closing and the valid termination of the Stock
Purchase Agreement in accordance with its terms. No such termination of this
Agreement shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for any breach of
this Agreement prior to termination.

     Section 3.3 FURTHER ASSURANCE. The rights and obligations of Stockholder
contained herein are separate from and shall not affect any rights and
obligations, including any applicable fiduciary duties, that Stockholder may
have under applicable law in such Stockholder's capacity as an officer or
director of the Company. Any such rights and obligations, including any
applicable fiduciary duties, that Stockholder may have under applicable law in
any such other capacity shall not affect the rights and obligations of
Stockholder contained herein.

     Section 3.4 CERTAIN EVENTS. Stockholder agrees that this Agreement and
Stockholder's obligations hereunder shall attach to Stockholder's Shares and
shall be binding upon any person or entity to which legal or beneficial
ownership of such Shares shall pass, whether by operation of law or otherwise,
including, without limitation, Stockholder's heirs, guardians, administrators,
or successors. Notwithstanding any transfer of Shares, the transferor shall
remain liable for the performance of all its obligations under this Agreement.

     Section 3.5 NO WAIVER. The failure of any party hereto to exercise any
right, power, or remedy provided under this agreement or otherwise available in
respect hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other
party hereto with its obligations hereunder, any custom or practice of the
parties at variance with the terms hereof shall not constitute a waiver by such
party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power or remedy or to
demand such compliance.

     Section 3.6 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Stockholder acknowledges that if
Stockholder fails to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement
immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused to each of the
Investors for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. In such
event, Stockholder agrees that each of the Investors shall have the right, in
addition to any other rights it may have, to specific performance of this
Agreement. Accordingly, if any of the Investors should institute an action or
proceeding seeking specific enforcement of the provisions hereof, Stockholder
hereby waives the claim or defense that each of the Investors, as the case may
be, has an adequate remedy at law and hereby agrees not to assert in any such
action or proceeding the claim or defense that such a remedy at law exists.
Stockholder further agrees to waive any requirements for the securing or posting
of any bond in connection with obtaining any such equitable relief.

     Section 3.7 NOTICE. All notices and other communications given or made
pursuant hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given

     Section 3.10 SEVERABILITY. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is

validity or enforceability of the invalid, void or unenforceable term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority declares that

agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to and
shall, subject to the discretion of such court, reduce the scope, duration, area
or applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases,
or to replace any invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision with a term
or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

     Section 3.11 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This
Agreement, including the documents and the instruments referred to herein and

provision contained herein.

     Section 3.12 ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement not any of the rights,

the other parties, except that each of the Investors may assign, in its sole
discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any
of its Affiliates and such assignment shall not relieve any of the Investors of
any obligation under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

     Section 3.13 GOVERNING LAW; FORUM; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL

OF ANY JURISDICTION. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States
located in the State of Delaware or in a Delaware state court, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In
addition, each of the parties (a) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware of and for the
County of New Castle in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement, (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from such court and (c) agrees that it will
not bring any action relating to this Agreement in any court other than the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware of and for the County of New Castle.

parties hereto contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and

conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only as against such party and only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party. The failure of any
party hereto to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights.

     Section 3.16 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each
of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which shall
constitute one and the same agreement.
