<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
purpose of the Water Pik Technologies,&nbsp;Inc. Broad-Based Stock Option Plan (the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>"Plan"</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) is to promote the interest of Water Pik
Technologies,&nbsp;Inc. (the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>"Company"</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) and its subsidiaries (the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>"Subsidiaries"</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) by providing a
vehicle under which the Company can offer to eligible employees the opportunity to obtain equity interests in the Company, thereby increasing employee ownership of Company stock, better enabling the
Company to recruit and retain top talent and allowing eligible employees to share in the benefits of future growth in the value of the Company that they help to create. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan shall be administered by the Personnel and Compensation Committee (the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>"Committee"</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) of the Board of Directors of the Company (the </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>"Board"</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>). The
Committee shall have the sole and absolute power, authority and discretion to interpret the Plan, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules
and regulations to further the purposes of the Plan, and to make all other determinations necessary for the administration of the Plan. All such actions by the Committee shall be final and binding. To
the extent permitted by law, members of the Committee shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company with respect to any loss, cost, liability or expense that may be reasonably incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding which arises by reason of any act or omission under the Plan so long as such act or omission is taken in good faith and within the scope of the
authority delegated herein. The Committee may, subject to compliance with applicable legal requirements, delegate such of its powers and authority under the Plan as it deems appropriate to designated
officers or employees of the Company. In the event of any such delegation of authority, references in the Plan to the Committee shall be deemed to refer to the delegate of the Committee. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awards
under the Plan shall be in the form of non-qualified stock options (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>"Options"</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>), i.e., stock options which do not
qualify as "incentive stock options" within the meaning of Section&nbsp;422 or any successor provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>"Code"</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>). Each Option award shall be evidenced
by a written award agreement or notice in such form as the Committee shall approve from time to time. </FONT></P>

total number of shares authorized to be issued under the Plan shall equal 5% of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company (the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>"Common
Stock"</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) immediately following the effective date of the Plan. If the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is increased after the effective date of the Plan, the total
number of shares available under the Plan will be increased by 5% of such increase. If any Option shall cease to be exercisable in whole or in part for any reason, the shares which were covered by
such Option but as to which the Option had not been exercised shall again be available under the Plan. Shares issuable under the Plan shall be made available from authorized and unissued or reacquired
Common Stock. </FONT></P>

Employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement (as defined by the Secretary of Labor) between employees' representatives and the Company are not eligible to receive grants under the Plan if
the benefits provided hereunder were the subject of good faith bargaining between such employees' representatives and the Company and such collective bargaining agreement does not provide for grants
to be made to such employees under the Plan. As of the Initial Effective Date, each eligible employee shall receive an Option for such number of shares of Common Stock as the Committee shall determine
based upon such eligible employee's position within the Company and its Subsidiaries. Employees who are hired after the Initial Effective Date or who are not otherwise eligible to receive the initial
grant of
Options will participate in the Plan only if and to the extent that the Committee decides (i)&nbsp;to issue converted Options under Section&nbsp;5(b), or (ii)&nbsp;to make additional Option
grants after the Initial Effective Date pursuant to Section&nbsp;5(c) and the employee is eligible to participate in such additional grants under the eligibility criteria established by the

certain stock options held by eligible employees of the Company for the purchase of ATI common stock, which options were issued under the Allegheny Teledyne Incorporated 1996 Incentive Plan or a
similar stock compensation plan maintained by ATI or one of its subsidiaries. The Committee will determine the applicable terms and conditions of such converted options according to the provisions of
