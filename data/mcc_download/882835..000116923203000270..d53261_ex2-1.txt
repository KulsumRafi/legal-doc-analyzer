            Subsidiary incurred after the date of the Financial Statements were
            incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business, arose from bona fide
            transactions, and are usual and normal in amount both individually
            and in the aggregate. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiary are
            directly or indirectly liable to or obligated to provide funds in
            respect of or to guaranty or assume any obligation of any person
            except to the extent reflected and fully reserved against in the

            (c) Undisclosed Liabilities.

            Neither the Company nor its Subsidiary have any Liability arising
from a fact or circumstance that is not the subject of a representation or
warranty contained in Section 3.B of this Agreement,, except for: (i)
Liabilities set forth on the face of the Financial Statements; (ii) Liabilities
which have arisen after the date of the Financial Statements in the Ordinary
Course of Business; and (iii) Liabilities set forth on Section 3.B(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule ("Undisclosed Liabilities").

            (d) Legal Compliance.

            The Company and its Subsidiary have complied with all applicable
laws (including rules, regulations, codes, injunctions, judgments, orders,
decrees, rulings, and charges thereunder) of federal, state, local, and foreign
governments (and all agencies or instrumentality thereof), the failure to comply
with which, individually or in the aggregate, will result in Adverse
Consequences in excess of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000). To the
Knowledge of the Company, no action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation,
charge, complaint, claim, demand, audit or notice has been filed or commenced
against the Company and its Subsidiary alleging or relating to any failure so to
comply. The Company and its Subsidiary have duly filed all reports and returns
required to be filed by it with governmental authorities and obtained all
governmental permits and licenses and other governmental consents which are
required in connection with the businesses and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiary; all of such permits, licenses and consents are in full force and
effect, and no proceedings for the suspension or cancellation of any of them are
pending or threatened, except where any of the above would not have a material
adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiary. The Company and its Subsidiary
is not and has not been threatened with being suspended or debarred from
contracting with any federal, state, or local government.

            (e) Tax Matters.

                  (i) From its inception until April 1, 1988, the Company was a
            C Corporation within the meaning of the Code for tax purposes. From
            that date until January 29, 1997, the Company had in effect a valid
            and binding election to be treated either as an "S Corporation" or a
            "qualified subchapter S subsidiary", as the case may be, within the
            meaning of Code Sections 1361 et seq. for federal income tax
            purposes. From January 30, 1997, to the present, the Company has
            been treated as a "C Corporation."

                  (ii) The Company and its Subsidiary have filed all Tax Returns
            that they were required to file. All such Tax Returns were true,
            correct and complete in all material respects. All Taxes owed by the
            Company and its Subsidiary which are required to be paid prior to
            Closing, except as otherwise set forth on Section 3B(e)(ii) of the
            Company Disclosure Schedule and except for sales or use Taxes
            reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, have been paid. The
            reserves set forth on the Financial Statements and on the Closing
            Date Balance Sheet are adequate to satisfy in full any and all Tax
            Liabilities arising in respect to those matters set forth on Section
            3B(e)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. All


                                       19
<PAGE>

            Taxes owing but not yet due as a result of operations of the Company
            prior to Closing will be accrued on the Financial Statements of the
            Company. There are no Security Interests on any of the assets of the
            Company or its Subsidiary that arose in connection with any failure
            (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax. Neither the Company nor its
            Subsidiary have been a member of an Affiliated Group (other than a
            group the common parent of which was the Company) that has filed a
            "consolidated return" within the meaning of Code Section 1501, or
            has filed a combined or consolidated return with any entity other
            than its Subsidiary with any other taxing authority.

                  (iii) The Company and its Subsidiary withheld the Taxes as
            required in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,
            independent contractor, creditor, shareholder, or other third party
            and such withheld amounts have either been paid to the appropriate
            governmental agency or set aside in appropriate accounts for such
            purpose.

                  (iv) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiary are currently
            under audit with respect to Taxes by any authority, and have not
            received any notice or other indication that any authority is
            considering assessing any additional Taxes for any period for which
            Tax Returns have been filed. There is no dispute or claim concerning
            any Tax Liability of the Company or its Subsidiary either to the
            Company's Knowledge has been claimed or raised by any authority in
            writing or based upon personal contact with any agent or
            representative of such authority. The Company has previously
            disclosed to the Parent true and accurate copies of all federal
            income tax returns filed with respect to the Company and its
            Subsidiary for taxable periods ended on or after December 31, 1997.
            State tax returns filed by the Company for that period have also
            been made available to the Parent, and the Company has disclosed to
            the Parent the existence of disputes relating to state and local tax
            issues.

                  (v) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiary have waived any
            statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any
            extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.

                  (vi) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiary have made any
            payments, are obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any
            agreement that could obligate any of them to make any payments that
            will not be deductible under Code Section 280G. Neither the Company
            nor its Subsidiary is a party to any Tax allocation or sharing
            agreement. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiary (A) have been a
            member of an Affiliated Group filing a consolidated federal income
            Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which was the
            Company) or (B) have any Liability for the Taxes of any Person
            (other than the Company) under Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any
            similar provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee
            or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

            lists all real property leased to the Company and its Subsidiary
            (the "Leased Real Property"). The Company has delivered to the Buyer
            true, correct and complete copies of the leases for the Leased Real
            Property (as amended to date). With respect to each lease for Leased
            Real Property:

                        (A) the lease or sublease is legal, valid, binding,

                  the Knowledge of the Company and its Subsidiary, no party to
                  the lease or sublease is, in breach or default, and no event
                  has occurred which, with ;notice or lapse of time, would
                  constitute a breach or default on the part of the Company or
                  permit termination, modification or acceleration thereunder;

                        (C) neither the Company nor its Subsidiary have, and to

                  or encumbered any interest in the leasehold; or

                        (F) During the period the premises have been occupied by
                  the Company, all facilities leased thereunder have received
                  all approvals of governmental authorities (including licenses

                  material respects in accordance with applicable laws, rules,

            belonging to the Company or its Subsidiary.

            Company nor its Subsidiary have ever received within the past five
            (5) years any charge, complaint, claim, demand, or notice alleging
            any such interference, infringement, misappropriation, or violation
            (including any claim that the Company or its Subsidiary must license
            or refrain from using any Intellectual Property rights of any third
            party) . To the Knowledge of the Company, no third party has
            interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated, or otherwise come

            the Closing Date, that relate to income Tax periods or portions
            thereof ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the
            account of the Stockholders, and the Surviving Corporation shall pay
            over to the Stockholders any such refund or the amount of any such
            credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement
            thereto. In addition, subject to the last sentence of this Section

            Balance Sheet, the Surviving Corporation shall pay such amount to
            the Stockholders within fifteen (15) days after receipt or
            entitlement thereto. The Stockholders, however, shall not be
            entitled to any portion of any refund or credit received by the
            Surviving Corporation, or to which the Surviving Corporation is
            entitled to receive, unless and until the Surviving Corporation
            shall have received, or be entitled to receive, such refunds and
            credits which in the aggregate exceed Three Hundred Fifty Thousand
            Dollars ($350,000), and then only to the extent such refunds and
            credits exceed Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000).

                  (ii) The Surviving Corporation will be responsible for all
            Taxes, subject to the right to make a claim against the Escrow Fund
            for any breach of the representations and warranties contained in
            Section 3.B(e) With respect to the transactions contemplated by this
            Agreement, Parent, Surviving Corporation, and the Stockholders will
            provide each other with such cooperation and information as either
            of them may reasonably require of the other in connection with the
            filing of any Tax Return, including Tax Returns relating to the
            application of the successor employer rules for payroll Tax purposes
            contained in Code Sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1), the
            determination of a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund for
            Taxes, or the preparation for litigation or investigation of any
            claim for Taxes or a right to a refund for Taxes, and the
            cooperation and information shall include all relevant Tax Returns,
            and other documents and records, or portions thereof relating to or
            necessary in connection with the preparation of records, or portions
            thereof relating to or necessary in connection with the preparation
            of such Tax Returns or other determination of Tax Liability. Each
            Party shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules, workpapers, and all
            other related materials, records or documents until the expiration
            of the statute of limitations for the taxable years to which such
            Tax Returns and other related documents relate. After expiration of
            the statute of limitations, a Party shall notify each other Party in
            writing that it


                                       43
<PAGE>

            desires to dispose of or destroy the Tax Returns and other documents
            and shall provide such other Parties with the right for thirty (30)
            days after the tendering of such notice to copy or take possession
            of such Tax Returns and other related documents. Any information
            obtained under this provision shall be kept confidential by the
            Parties, except as may be necessary in connection with the filing of
            such Tax Returns.

            (e) Company Charter Provisions.

            The Surviving Corporation will not take any action to modify or
terminate the rights of present or former officers or directors of the Company
to exculpation and indemnification under the terms of the Company's Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws.

8.    REMEDIES FOR BREACHES OF THIS AGREEMENT.

            (a) Survival of Representations and Warranties.

            All of the representations and warranties of the Stockholders
contained in Section 3.A of this Agreement and of the Parent and the Buyer
contained in Section 4 of this Agreement shall survive the Closing and continue
in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years following the Effective
Date. All of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
Section 3.B and all covenants shall survive the Closing and continue in full
force and effect for a period of one (1) year following the Effective Date. No
action, claim, or proceeding may be brought by any Party hereto against any
other Party resulting from, arising out of, or caused by a breach of a
representation or warranty or covenant contained herein, after the time such
representation or warranty ceases to survive pursuant to the preceding sentence,
unless written notice of such claim setting forth with specificity the basis for
such claim is delivered to the applicable Party prior to the expiration of such
time.

            (b) Indemnification Provisions Relating to Section 3.A
Representations for Benefit of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation.

                  (i) In the event that any of the Section 3.A Representations
            of the Stockholders are untrue (or in the event any third party
            alleges facts that, if true, would mean any of the Section 3.A
            Representations are untrue), then, provided that either the Parent
            or the Surviving Corporation makes a written claim for
            indemnification setting forth the basis for such claim against the
            Stockholders pursuant to Section 8(g) below within six (6) years
            following the Effective Date, then the Stockholders shall, Severally
            indemnify the Parent and the Surviving Corporation, subject to the
            limitations set forth herein, from and against the entirety of any
            Adverse Consequences the Parent or the Surviving Corporation may
            suffer through and after the date of the claim for indemnification
            (including any Adverse Consequences the Parent or the Surviving
            Corporation may suffer after the end of any applicable survival
            period) resulting from, arising out of, or caused by the breach (or
            the alleged breach); provided, however, that:


                                       44
<PAGE>

                        (A) No Stockholder shall have any obligation to
                  indemnify the Parent or the Surviving Corporation from and
                  against any Adverse Consequences resulting from, arising out
                  of, or caused by the breach (or alleged breach) of any Section
                  3.A Representations which exceed the portion of the Merger
                  Consideration received by such Stockholder; and

                        (B) No Stockholder shall have any obligation to
                  indemnify the Parent or the Surviving Corporation from and
                  against any Adverse Consequences resulting from, arising out
                  of, or caused by the breach (or alleged breach) of any Section
                  3.A Representations until and unless and only to the extent
                  that: (1) the R&W Insurance Policy fails or refuses to provide
                  such indemnification to the Parent and the Surviving
                  Corporation; and (2) funds are not available from the Section
                  3.A Funds (as that term is defined in the Escrow Agreement) in
                  the Escrow Fund. Funds in the Escrow Fund in excess of the
                  Section 3.A Funds may only be used to pay a claim (in
                  accordance with Section 5(b) of the Escrow Agreement) arising
                  from a Section 3.A Representation if the Parent in its sole
                  discretion approves such use of the funds.

                  (ii) In the event that any claim, action suit or proceeding is
            commenced against the Parent, the Company, the Buyer, or the
            Surviving Corporation, or any of their current or former officers,
            directors, or shareholders, based on or arising from the issuance,
            sale, transfer, or redemption of any shares of capital stock of the
            Company (including but not limited to the Redemptions), whether such
            action, suit or proceeding arises at law or at equity, by contract,
            by the terms of the governing documents of the Company, or
            otherwise, that claim shall be deemed to constitute a breach of the
            Section 3.A Representations for which the Stockholders are obligated
            to provide indemnification in accordance with Section 8(a).

            (c) Indemnification Provisions Relating to Section 3.B
Representations and Covenants for Benefit of the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation.

In the event that any of the Section 3.B Representations of the Company are
untrue (or in the event any third party alleges facts that, if true, would mean
any of the Section 3.B Representations are untrue), or any of the covenants for
the benefit of the Parent are breached, then, provided that either the Parent or
the Surviving Corporation makes a written claim for indemnification setting
forth the basis for such claim within one (1) year following the Effective Date,
then the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled, subject to the
limitations set forth herein, to indemnification from and against the entirety
of any Adverse Consequences the Parent or the Surviving Corporation may suffer
through and after the date of the claim for indemnification (including any
Adverse Consequences the Parent or the Surviving Corporation may suffer after
the end of any applicable survival period) resulting from, arising out of, or
caused by the breach (or the alleged breach); provided, however, that:

                  (i) The sole source of funds for such indemnification shall be
            the funds in the Escrow Fund, which shall be released in accordance
            with the terms of


                                       45
<PAGE>

            the Escrow, Release and Indemnification Agreement. No claim may be
            asserted directly against any Stockholder for any breach or alleged
            breach of the Section 3.B Representations.

                  (ii) No claim may be made against the Escrow Funds with
            respect to such breaches (or alleged breaches) contained in Section
            3.B until the Parent or the Surviving Corporation has suffered
            Adverse Consequences by reason thereof in excess of Three Hundred
            Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000.00) and only to the extent that
            such Adverse Consequences exceed that amount.

            (d) Escrow.

            In order to provide the Parent and the Surviving Corporation with a
nonexclusive source of funds for the indemnity obligations of the Stockholders
for the Section 3.A. Representations and an exclusive source of funds for
breaches of the Company's Section 3.B Representations and the covenants of the
Company and the Stockholders, the Parties and the Stockholders shall have
executed the Escrow Agreement prior to the Closing Date, which shall be funded
with Five Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,800,000.00) of the
Aggregate Consideration otherwise payable to the Stockholders, which will be
held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement for a period of one (1) year. Amounts held
under the Escrow Agreement shall be an exclusive source of indemnification with
respect to the Section 3.B Representations and the covenants of the Company and
the Stockholders (except for the covenants contained in the Minimum Net Working
Capital Adjustment set forth in Section 2(j) of this Agreement, and except for
any covenants that are contained in the Escrow Agreement or the Noncompetition
and Assignment of Inventions Agreements), and a nonexclusive source of
indemnification with respect to the Section 3.A Representations. Under no
circumstance shall the Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to
satisfy amounts payable by the Stockholders pursuant to the Minimum Net Working
Capital Adjustment set forth in Section 2(j) of this Agreement from amounts held
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

            (e) Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the Stockholders.

            In the event Parent or Buyer breaches (or in the event any third
party alleges facts that, if true, would mean Parent or Buyer has breached) any
of their representations, warranties, and covenants contained in this Agreement,
then, provided that the Stockholder Representatives make a written claim for
indemnification setting forth the basis for such claim against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 8(g) below within six (6) years
following the Effective Date, then Parent and the Surviving Corporation, jointly
and severally, agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholders
from and against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences (up to but not in
excess of the Merger Consideration) the Stockholders may suffer through and
after the date of the claim for indemnification (including any Adverse
Consequences the Stockholders may suffer after the end of any applicable
survival period) resulting from, arising out of, or caused by the breach (or the
alleged breach).

<PAGE>

            (f) Matters Involving Third Parties.

                  (i) If any third party shall notify any Party (the
            "Indemnified Party") with respect to any matter (a "Third Party
            Claim") which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against
            any other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") under this Section 8,
            then the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify each Indemnifying
            Party thereof in writing; provided, however, that no delay on the
            part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying Party
            shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder
            unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party
            thereby is prejudiced.

                  (ii) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the
            Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its
            choice satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (A) the
            Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within
            fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of
            the Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the
            Indemnified Party from and against the entirety of any Adverse
            Consequences the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from,
            arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the
            Third Party Claim, (B) the Indemnifying Party provides the
            Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to the
            Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party will have the
            financial resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and
            fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder, (C) the Third
            Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an
            injunction or other equitable relief, (D) settlement of, or an
            adverse judgment with respect to, the Third Party Claim is not, in
            the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, likely to
            establish a precedential custom or practice materially adverse to
            the continuing business interest of the Indemnified Party, and (E)
            the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim
            actively and diligently.

                  (iii) So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the
            defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 8(f)(ii)
            above, (A) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at
            its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the
            Third Party Claim, (B) the Indemnified Party will not consent to the
            entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to
            the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
            Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
            withheld).

                  (iv) In the event any of the conditions in 8(f)(ii) above is
            or becomes unsatisfied, however, (A) the Indemnified Party may
            defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
            into any settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim in any
            manner it may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not
            consult with, or obtain any consent from, any Indemnifying Party in
            connection therewith), (B) the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the
            Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for the costs of
            defending against the Third Party Claim (including reasonable
            attorneys' fees and expenses), and (C) the Indemnifying Party will
            remain responsible for any Adverse Consequences the


                                       47
<PAGE>

            Indemnified Party may suffer resulting, arising out of, relating to,
            in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim to the fullest
            extent provided in this Section 8.

            (g) Determination of Adverse Consequences.

            Adverse Consequences shall be determined net of insurance proceeds
actually received, and the Parties shall take into account the time cost of
money (using the Applicable Rate as the discount rate) in determining Adverse
Consequences for purposes of this Section 8. Available insurance coverage with
respect to policies purchased prior to the Closing Date shall be made available
by the Surviving Company as a source of funds to satisfy claims against the
Escrow and the Stockholder under Section 8. All indemnification payments under
this Section 8 shall be deemed adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

            (h) Post-Closing.

            Following the Closing, the remedy of the Stockholders, on the one
hand, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation on the other hand, with respect
to any breach or threatened breach of a representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement or with respect to any event, circumstance or
condition occurring on or before the Closing shall be limited to the enforcement
of the indemnification obligations set forth in Section 8; provided, however,
that nothing provided in this Section 8(g) shall limit the right of any Party to
seek any equitable remedy available to enforce his or its rights hereunder .

9.    TERMINATION.

            (a) Termination Events.

            This Agreement may, by notice given prior to or at the Closing, be

            (ii) the Company on the other hand, if a material breach of any
            provision of this Agreement has been willfully committed by the
            other Party and such material breach has not been waived or cured
            within fifteen (15) days of Notice to the other Party of such
            material breach, and the terminating Party is not in breach of any
            provision of this Agreement;

                  (ii) By either (i) Buyer and the Parent on the one hand, or
            (ii) the Company on the other hand, if the Closing has not occurred
            (other than through the failure of the Party seeking to terminate
            this Agreement to comply fully with its obligations under this
            Agreement) on or before August 31, 2002, or such later date as the
            Parties may agree upon;

                  (iii) By the Parent or the Buyer, pursuant to the provisions
            of Section 3.C of this Agreement; or

further obligations of the Parties under this Agreement will terminate, except
the obligations in Section 10 (Miscellaneous); provided, however, that if this
Agreement is terminated by a Party as a result of the other Party's fraud, or
willful or intentional breach of its representations, warranties or obligations
hereunder, the terminating Party shall have the right to pursue all remedies
available to it at law or in equity.

10.   MISCELLANEOUS.

            Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the other Party

Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise
are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that the other Party shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the

            (o) Submission to Jurisdiction.

            Each of the Parties submits to the jurisdiction of any state or
federal court sitting in Seattle, Washington in any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of
the action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court. Each
Party also agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each of the Parties waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so
brought and waives any bond, surety, or other security that might be required of
any other Party with respect thereto. Parent and Buyer appoint The Prentice-Hall
Corporation System, Inc. as their agent to receive on its behalf service of
copies of the summons and complaint and any other process that might be served
in the action or proceeding. The Stockholders appoint the Stockholder
Representatives designated in the Escrow Agreement as his, her, or its agent to
receive on his, her, or its behalf service of copies of the summons and
complaint and any other process that might be served in the action or proceeding
(the Prentice-Hall Corporation System, Inc. and the Stockholder Representatives
are referred to together in this Section 10(o) as the "Process Agent"). Any
Party (or the Stockholder Representatives in the case of the Stockholders) may
make service on any other Party by sending or delivering a copy of the process
(i) to the Party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in Section 10(g) above or (ii) to the Party to be served in
care of the Process Agent at the address and in the manner provided for the

or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law or in equity.

            (p) Arbitration.

            Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, all disputes
arising out of or under this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration in a
location in Seattle, Washington mutually acceptable to the Parties before a
single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association. Arbitration may be commenced at any time by any of the
Parties by giving written notice to each other than such dispute has been
referred to arbitration under this Section 10(p). The arbitrator shall be
selected by the joint agreement of the Parties, but if they do not so agree
within twenty (20) days after the date of receipt of the notice referred to
above, the selection shall be made pursuant to the rules from the panels of
arbitrators maintained by the American Arbitration Association. Any award
rendered by the arbitrator shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties
hereto; provided, however, that any such award shall be accompanied by a written
opinion of the arbitrator giving the reason for the award. This provision for
arbitration shall be specifically enforceable by the Parties and the decision of
the arbitrator in accordance herewith shall be final and binding and there shall
be no right of appeal therefrom. The arbitrator shall assess, as part of his
award to the prevailing Party, all or such part as the arbitrator deems proper
of the arbitration expenses of the prevailing Party (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) and of the arbitrator against the Party that is unsuccessful in
such claim, defense or objection.
