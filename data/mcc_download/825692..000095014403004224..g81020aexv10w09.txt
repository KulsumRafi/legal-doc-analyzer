         or Tangible Net Worth, as the case may be) (a) for each fiscal year
         beginning with the 2002 fiscal year, any year-end non-cash adjustment

         Additional Minimum Liability (as defined below), and (b) for the fiscal
         quarters ending December 31, 2002 and March 31, 2003, any restructuring
         charges (cash or non-cash) taken during such fiscal quarters in

         Lender pro rata according to such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment

         Administrative Agent's legal counsel), and fees and other amounts
         payable to the Administrative Agent, in each case in connection with
         the arrangement, negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of
         this Amendment.

                  (d)      Accuracy of Representations and Warranties. The
         representations and warranties contained in Sections 4 and 6 of this
         Amendment shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as

                  (f)      Guaranty Amendments. The Administrative Agent shall
         have received evidence satisfactory to it that the Borrower shall have
         obtained amendments to its guaranties in connection with the Premier
         Boxboard Credit Facility and the Standard Gypsum Credit Facility that
         conform to the applicable terms of this Agreement, including, without
         limitation, modification or elimination of financial covenants so that
         such provisions are not more restrictive than those contained in the
         Credit Agreement.

         other things, a springing Lien on the Borrower's owned machinery and
         equipment that will attach on July 1, 2003.

         4.       Representations and Warranties. Each Credit Party hereby
represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that (a) no
Default or Event of Default exists; (b) all of the representations and
warranties set forth in the Loan Documents are true and correct in all material

and amended in this Amendment, all of the terms, provisions and conditions of
the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect. The term
"this Agreement" or "Credit Agreement" and all similar references as used in
each of the Loan Documents shall hereafter mean the Credit Agreement as amended
by this Amendment. Except as herein specifically agreed, the Credit Agreement is
hereby ratified and confirmed and shall remain in full force and effect
according to its terms.

         6.       Authority/Enforceability. Each of the Credit Parties hereto
represents and warrants as follows:

                  (a)      It has taken all necessary action to authorize the

                  (b)      This Amendment has been duly executed and delivered
         by such Person and constitutes such Person's legal, valid and binding
         obligations, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such
         enforceability may be subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency,
         reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or
         similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general
         principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
         considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

                  (c)      No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or
         filing, registration or qualification with, any court or governmental
         authority or third party is required in connection with the execution,
         delivery or performance by such Person of this Amendment. The
         execution, delivery and performance by such Person of this Amendment do
         not and will not conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute a
         default under the articles of incorporation, bylaws or other
         organizational documents of any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries
         or any indenture or other material agreement or instrument to which
         such Person is a party or by which any of its properties may be

expenses in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of this
Amendment, including without limitation the reasonable fees and expenses of

         8.       Counterparts/Telecopy. This Amendment may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Delivery of executed counterparts by telecopy shall be effective as an original
and shall constitute a representation that an original will be delivered.

         9.       GOVERNING LAW. THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NORTH
CAROLINA.

         10.      Entirety. This Amendment and the other Loan Documents embody
the entire agreement between the parties and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, if any, relating to the subject matter hereof. These Loan
Documents represent the final agreement between the parties and may not be
contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral agreements
of the parties. There are no oral agreements between the parties.

         11.      Acknowledgment of Guarantors. The Guarantors acknowledge and
consent to all of the terms and conditions of this Amendment and agree that this
Amendment and any documents executed in connection herewith do not operate to
reduce or discharge the Guarantors' obligations under the Credit Agreement or

security interests created and granted by it in the Loan Documents (including,
