The Deferred Stock Account shall be credited with earnings and charged with losses, if any, and subject to other adjustments on the same basis as the Altria Group, Inc. Stock Fund.

Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, withholding obligations arising from an Award may be settled with Common Stock, including Common Stock that is part of, or is received upon exercise of the Award that gives rise to the withholding requirement. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company, shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due
to the participant. The Committee may establish such procedures as it deems appropriate, including the making of irrevocable elections, for the settling of withholding obligations with Common Stock. </font></p>

The Plan, as amended and restated as of March 1, 2003, became effective upon approval  by a majority of the Board at a duly called meeting on February 26, 2003, at which a quorum was  present. Except as otherwise provided by the Board, no Awards shall be made after the Awards made immediately following the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, provided that any Awards granted prior to that date may extend beyond it. </font></p>
