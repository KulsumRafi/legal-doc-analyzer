giving effect to all payments under clause (x)) such prepayments are to be
applied to C Term Loans-Fixed Rate as to which the FRE Date has not occurred,
such prepayment amount shall, unless otherwise agreed by the Borrower and the
Lender, be allocated among the outstanding principal amounts of such C Term
Loans-Fixed Rate, as determined by the Lender. To the extent any such prepayment
