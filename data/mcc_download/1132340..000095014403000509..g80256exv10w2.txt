<PAGE>

the Surety, each Guarantor, each Chilean Creditor and the Agent Bank shall also
be hereinafter called individually a "Party" and collectively the "Parties". All
those terms and words which are capitalized herein despite their grammatical
function and those which have not been assigned a special meaning therein, shall

April twenty-six of year two thousand at the Notary Public's office under the
charge of Eduardo Pinto Peralta, in Santiago, hereinafter also called the "Local

The Debtor has fully and timely paid the first six installments of the loan
principal amount, plus the relevant interest thereon, and the balance of the
loan principal amount currently due by the Debtor to Creditors amounts to seven
hundred and fifty-four thousand four hundred and thirty-eight Unidades de
Fomento. TWO) FOREIGN LOAN AGREEMENT AND EARLY TERMINATION. Concurrently with
execution of the Local Loan Agreement, the Debtor and Deutsche Bank, formerly
Bankers Trust Company, as Foreign Creditor, entered into the Foreign Loan
Agreement whereby, subject to the terms and conditions stated therein, Deutsche
Bank made available to the Debtor a loan facility for up to five million Dollars
and the Debtor could apply for one or more loans to be charged to such facility.
Through a private instrument dated October seven of year two thousand and two,
the Debtor and Deutsche Bank agreed to terminate on an early basis the
aforementioned Foreign Loan Agreement, all and each of the obligations contained
in such instrument being fully terminated. A copy of the instrument evidencing
termination of the Foreign Loan Agreement is included as Exhibit number Two
hereto, which is registered in this notary public's office and dated on the date
hereof under the same digest number as this deed and is construed to be an
integral part thereof to all legal effects, the appearing parties stating they
fully know and accept these presents. During the term of the Foreign Loan
Agreement, the Debtor did not apply for loans to be charged to the loan facility
and, therefore, owes nothing to Deutsche Bank on such account. THREE) LETTERS OF
CREDIT. By reason of execution of the Local Loan Agreement and at the Debtor's
request, Deutsche Bank, formerly Bankers Trust Company, issued those Letters of
Credit included in the Local Loan Agreement, to guarantee to BankBoston and
Banco de Chile the payment of a portion of the loan granted to the Debtor by
such banks under the Local Loan Agreement, all the foregoing under the terms and
conditions established by such Letters of Credit. By reason of the amendment to
the Local Loan Agreement mentioned in this instrument, at the Debtor's request
and with the consent of the Creditors the beneficiaries of the Letters of
Credit, Deutsche Bank cancelled and amended the Letters of Credit originally
issued under the terms stated below: A) CANCELLED LETTERS OF CREDIT. On December

cancel and revoke as from such date stand by letter of credit number S - one

Banco de Chile agreed to amend, as from such date, stand by

<PAGE>

letter of credit number S - one three three six five, issued in favor of Banco
de A. Edwards on April twenty-six of year two thousand and the initial amount of
which was five million Dollars, to adjust the amount of such letter of credit
and the payment schedule established therein to the terms of the Local Loan
Agreement to be agreed upon in this instrument; and (II) BANKBOSTON LETTER OF
CREDIT: On December twelve of year two thousand and two, Deutsche Bank and
BankBoston agreed to amend, as from such date, stand by letter of credit number

to adjust the amount of such letter of credit and the payment schedule
established therein to the terms of the Local Loan Agreement to be agreed upon
in this instrument. Stand by letters of credit referred-to in b) above,
including the relevant amendments thereto, are currently in force and
hereinafter shall be collectively called the "Letters of Credit". A copy of the
amended Letters of Credit that remain in force are registered on the date hereof
and in this same Notary Public's office under digest number four thousand two
hundred and sixty-seven - two thousand and two. The amount committed by the
Foreign Creditor under each amended Letter of Credit shall continue being
reduced during the term of the Local Loan Agreement in proportion to the
reduction of the current balance of the loan principal amount after any payment
or prepayment of such loan made by the Debtor or any third party bound to make
payment. FOUR) REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT. Through a private instrument dated April
twenty-four of year two thousand, the Debtor, as applicant of the Letters of
Credit, and Deutsche Bank, formerly Bankers Trust Company, as issuer thereof,
entered into the Reimbursement Agreement under which the Debtor and Deutsche
Bank established the issue, maintenance, payment and reimbursement terms of the
letters of Credit and other amounts due thereunder. By reason of the amendment
to the Local Loan Agreement mentioned in this instrument and the amendments to
the Letters of Credit referred to in Three) above, through a private instrument
dated on the date hereof, the Debtor, as applicant of the new Letters of Credit,
and Deutsche Bank, as issuer thereof, agreed to amend the Reimbursement
Agreement to make it comprise the obligations of the Debtor and the Guarantors
under the new terms of the Local Loan Agreement and of the Letters of Credit,
which is registered on the date hereof and in this Notary Public's Office under
number fourteen thousand two hundred and sixty-six - two thousand and two. That
part of the disbursement to be made by Deutsche Bank in case that the Letters of
Credit become effective and that is not duly documented by the Local Promissory
Notes executed by the Debtor to the order of BankBoston and/or Banco de Chile,
shall be documented in one or more promissory notes executed by the Debtor to
the order of Deutsche Bank or its successor or assignee, and guaranteed by each
Guarantor, which promissory notes shall also be referred to as "Reimbursement
Promissory Notes". FIVE) GUARANTIES. To secure full and faithful performance of

performed their payment obligations in respect of the contracted local loan,
including agreed principal amount and interest, within the terms and as provided
for in the Local Loan Agreement, and the Creditors have considered the remaining
ancillary affirmative and negative covenants contained in sections Eight and
