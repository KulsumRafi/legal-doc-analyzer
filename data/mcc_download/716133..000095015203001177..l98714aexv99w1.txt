the Success Plan and prior to the earlier of the Completion of the Success Plan
or the termination of either of such agreements, Employee will receive the

pro rata basis (based on the percentage of the calendar year during which
Employee was employed) and (ii) Employee's stock options shall be treated as if
such termination had occurred under Section 13.E rather than Section 13.D.

4.      All capitalized terms used in this Amendment shall have the meaning
ascribed to them in the Employment Agreement and all other terms and conditions
of the Employment Agreement not specifically amended herein shall remain in full
force and effect as previously agreed upon by the parties.
