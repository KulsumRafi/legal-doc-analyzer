<I>Remedies. </I>In view of the position of confidence which Executive will
enjoy with the Company and the anticipated relationship with the clients,
customers, and employees of the Company and its affiliates pursuant to his
employment hereunder, and recognizing both the access to confidential financial
and other information which Executive will have pursuant to his employment,
Executive expressly acknowledges that the restrictive covenants set forth in
Section 5 are reasonable and necessary in order to protect and maintain the
proprietary interests and other legitimate business interests of the Company and
its affiliates. Executive further acknowledges that (1) it would be difficult to
calculate damages to the Company and its affiliates from any breach of his
obligations under this Section 5, (ii) that injury to the Company and its
affiliates from any such breach would be irreparable and impossible to measure,
and (iii) that the remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach of Section
5 would therefore be an inadequate remedy and, accordingly, the Company shall,
in addition to all other available remedies (including without limitation
seeking such damages as it can show it and its affiliates has sustained by
reason of such breach and/or the exercise of all other rights it has under this

seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment
provided for under this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by
Executive as a result of employment by another employer or by retirement
benefits after the Date of Termination, except as specifically provided
hereunder. The provisions of this Agreement, and any payment provided for
