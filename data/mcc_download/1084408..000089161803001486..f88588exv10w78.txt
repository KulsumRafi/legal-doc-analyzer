PAYMENTS

-     This is a semi-annual plan, with bonus calculation and payment following
      mid year (June 30th) and year-end (December 31st).

-     Individual bonus recommendations are based upon management determination
      of participant performance, and as such will vary by employee. There are
      no guaranteed payments associated with this plan.

-     Although every effort is made to process payments on a timely basis, there
      is no guaranteed payment date associated with this plan. Bonus payments
      can be processed only after the following is determined and/or
      communicated:

            -     Proforma operating profit has been calculated.

            -     Earnings, and all relevant performance measurements have been
                  communicated externally.

            -     Recommendations have been collected and submitted to the CEO
                  for final approval.

DISCRETION OF CEO AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS

-     Notwithstanding the above, the Company's CEO and/or Compensation Committee
      of the Board of Directors, at his/its sole discretion, may, for reasonable
      cause, modify or change this Plan or its implementation at any time.
