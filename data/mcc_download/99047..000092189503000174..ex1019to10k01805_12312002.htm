<PAGE>


          (i)  engage in any activity or employment in the faithful  performance
               of which it could be reasonably anticipated to cause Executive to
               use or disclose any confidential  information or trade secrets of
               the Company or NYFIX Millennium;

          (ii) enter into employment with an ATS (alternative trading system) or
               ECN (electronic  communication  network)  organization  using FIX
               protocol to  communicate  equity order flow from customers to the
               ECN  and/or  ATS  execution  facility,  except  if  Executive  is
               terminated without cause.

     10.  ENFORCEMENT;  SEVERABILITY.  It is the  desire  and the  intent of the
parties hereto that the  provisions of this Agreement  hereof be enforced to the
fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policy of the jurisdictions
in which  enforcement  is  sought.  Accordingly,  if any  particular  portion or
provision of this Agreement shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable,
the  remaining  portion or such  provision or the  remaining  provisions of this
Agreement,  or the application of such provision or portion of such provision as
is held invalid or unenforceable to persons or circumstances other than those to
which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be effected thereby.

     11.  TERMINATION.  This Agreement may not be terminated  during its term by
the Employer for any reason other than (i) a material breach by the Executive of
any of  the  terms  of  this  Agreement,  (ii)  Executive  engaging  in  conduct
materially injurious to the company, NYFIX Millennium, its affiliates, customers
or  suppliers,  (iii)  Executive  engaging  in any  act  of  fraud  which  would
constitute a felony under federal or state law.

Notwithstanding   anything  to  the  contrary  contained  herein,  Employer  may
terminate  this Agreement (i) upon ten (10) days' written  notice,  in the event
that Executive is unable to perform his assigned duties and responsibilities due
to  illness,  physical  or  mental  disability  or any  other  reason,  and such
disability  continues  for a period of 180 days  within any  twelve  consecutive
months, or (ii) upon the death of the Employee.

     The Executive  shall have Good Reason for  terminating  his employment with
the Corporation under this Agreement if one or more of the following occurs:

          (a)  layoff or involuntary  termination of the Executive's employment,
               except in  connection  with the  termination  of the  Executive's
               employment as a result of termination for Cause,  the non-renewal
               of this  Agreement  or of the  Executive's  disability,  death or
               retirement;

          (b)  a reduction by the Corporation in the Executive's Base Salary; or

          (c)  any material violation by the Company of this Agreement;

     Notwithstanding the foregoing,  no action by the Company shall give rise to
a Good Reason if it results from the Executive's termination for Cause, death or
retirement, and no action by the Corporation specified in paragraphs (a) through
(c) of this  section  shall give rise to a Good  Reason if it  results  from the
Executive's disability.

     Should  Employer  involuntary   terminate   Executive's   employment,   and
involuntary  termination  occurs  after  Executive's  six-month  anniversary  of
employment  and  involuntary  termination  is  not  as a  result  of a  "Hostile
Acquisition,"  Executive  will receive six months of base salary in one lump sum
payment,  and an  immediate  vesting  of the  nearest  options  to be  vested as


<PAGE>


reflected in paragraph  5.2.i of this  agreement,  as severance at the effective
date  of  the  involuntary  termination;  or  Should  the  Employer  involuntary
terminate Executive after the one year anniversary of employment, and not result
from a "Hostile Acquisition,"  Executive will receive one year of base salary in
one lump sum  payment  and an  immediate  vesting of the  nearest  options to be
vested as  reflected in  paragraph  5.2.i of this  agreement as severance at the
effective date of the involuntary termination.

In the event NYFIX Millennium is involved in a "Hostile Acquisition," and should
the acquiring company terminate Executive's services, Executive will receive two
times  Executive's  annual  base  salary.  In  addition,  fifty  percent  of any
"unvested" options will become fully vested.

In the event NYFIX  Millennium  should Merge with another  Non-NYFIX  Inc. owned
Company or NYFIX, Inc should Divest NYFIX Millennium, and Executive were to have
employment  terminated,  and if this event  should occur  following  Executive's
second  anniversary  of  employment,  Executive  will  receive  100%  vesting of
executive's bonus grant of 100,000 options mentioned above.

     12.  GOVERNING  LAW  AND  VENUE.  This  Agreement  shall  be  construed  in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

     13. NOTICES

     Any  notice  required  to be  given  pursuant  to this  Agreement  shall be
effective  only if in writing and  delivered  personally or by mail. If given by
mail, such notice must be sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid,
mailed to the parties at the addresses  set forth on the signature  page hereof,
or at such other  addresses as the parties may designate,  from time to time, by
written  notice.  Mailed notices shall be deemed  received two (2) business days
after the date of deposit in the mail.

     14.  ASSIGNMENT: EFFECT ON AGREEMENT

     It is hereby  acknowledged  and  agreed  that the  Executive's  rights  and
obligations  under  this  Agreement  are  personal  in  nature  and shall not be
assigned  or  delegated.  This  agreement  shall be  binding on and inure to the
benefit of the heirs,  personal  representatives,  successors and assigns of the
parties,  subject,  however,  to the  restrictions  on assignment and delegation
contained herein.

Agreement)  contains the entire agreement and understanding  between the parties
and supersedes  all prior  agreements and  understandings,  oral or written.  No
