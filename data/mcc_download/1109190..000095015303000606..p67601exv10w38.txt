Dear Jerry

         Reference is made to that certain Executive Retention Agreement, dated
as of June 17, 2002, by and between eFunds Corporation and you. I am writing to
inform you that the Company is waiving the requirement set forth in Section
2(iv) of the Agreement that you execute the Release attached to the Agreement as
Exhibit A as a condition to your receipt of the lump-sum payment described in
Section 1(a). I would anticipate that this payment will be made shortly.

Very truly yours,
