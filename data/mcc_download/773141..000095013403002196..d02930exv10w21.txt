2.1      VESTING SCHEDULE FOR MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS

         If there are matching contributions subject to a vesting schedule that
         does not satisfy EGTRRA, then unless otherwise elected below, for
         participants who complete an hour of service in a plan year beginning
         after December 31, 2001, the following vesting schedule will apply to
         all matching contributions subject to a vesting schedule:

         If the plan has a graded vesting schedule (i.e., the vesting schedule
         includes a vested percentage that is more than 0% and less than 100%)
         the following will apply:

<Table>
<Caption>
                           Years of vesting service           Nonforfeitable percentage

<S>                                                          <C>
                                    2                                   20%

                                    4                                   60%
                                    5                                   80%

</Table>

         If the plan does not have a graded vesting schedule, then matching
         contributions will be nonforfeitable upon the completion of 3 years of
         vesting service.

         In lieu of the above vesting schedule, the employer elects the
         following schedule:

         a.     [ ] 3 year cliff (a participant's accrued benefit derived from
                employer matching contributions shall be nonforfeitable upon the

         standards as set forth in Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(2)(iv),
         then, unless the option below is elected, the suspension period

         deferrals and employee contributions under this and all other plans of
         the employer for 6 months after receipt of the distribution.
         Furthermore, if elected by the employer in Section 2.3 of this
         amendment, a participant who receives a distribution of elective

implementing the required limitations of Sections 402(g) and 415 of the Code.
The plan shall not be treated as failing to satisfy the provisions of the plan
implementing the requirements of Section 401(k)(3), 401(k)(11), 401(k)(12),
410(b), or 416 of the Code, as applicable, by reason of the making of such

Increase in Compensation Limit. The annual compensation of each participant
taken into account in determining allocations for any plan year beginning after
December 31, 2001, shall not exceed $200,000, as adjusted for cost-of-living
increases in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code. Annual
compensation means compensation during the plan year or such other consecutive
12-month period over which compensation is otherwise determined under the plan

         the meaning of Section 401(h) or Section 419A(f)(2) of the Code) which
         is otherwise treated as an annual addition.

                                    ARTICLE X
                         MODIFICATION OF TOP-HEAVY RULES

10.1     Effective date. This Article shall apply for purposes of determining
         whether the plan is a top-heavy plan under Section 416(g) of the Code
         for plan years beginning after December 31, 2001, and whether the plan
         satisfies the minimum benefits requirements of Section 416(c) of the
         Code for such years. This Article amends the top-heavy provisions of
         the plan.

10.2     Determination of top-heavy status.

10.2.1   Key employee. Key employee means any employee or former employee
         (including any deceased employee) who at any time during the plan year
         that includes the determination date was an officer of the employer
         having annual compensation greater than $130,000 (as adjusted under
         Section 416(i)(1) of the Code for plan years beginning after December
         31, 2002), a 5-percent owner of the employer, or a 1-percent owner of
         the employer having annual compensation of more than $150,000. For this
         purpose, annual compensation means compensation within the meaning of
         Section 415(c)(3) of the Code. The determination of who is a key
         employee will be made in accordance with Section 416(i)(1) of the Code
         and the applicable regulations and other guidance of general
         applicability issued thereunder.

10.2.2   Determination of present values and amounts. This Section 10.2.2 shall
         apply for purposes of determining the present values of accrued
         benefits and the amounts of account balances of employees as of the
         determination date.

         a.       Distributions during year ending on the determination date.
                  The present values of accrued benefits and the amounts of
                  account balances of an employee as of the determination date
                  shall be increased by the distributions made with respect to
                  the employee under the plan and any plan aggregated with the
                  plan under Section 416(g)(2) of the Code during the 1-year
                  period ending on the determination date. The preceding
                  sentence shall also apply to distributions under a terminated
                  plan which, had it not been terminated, would have been
                  aggregated with the plan under Section 416(g)(2)(A)(i) of the
                  Code. In the case of a distribution made for a reason other
                  than separation from service, death, or disability, this
                  provision shall be applied by substituting "5-year period" for
                  "1-year period."

         b.       Employees not performing services during year ending on the
                  determination date. The accrued benefits and accounts of any
                  individual who has not performed services for the employer
                  during the 1-year period ending on the determination date
                  shall not be taken into account.

10.3     Minimum benefits.

10.3.1   Matching contributions. Employer matching contributions shall be taken
         into account for purposes of satisfying the minimum contribution
         requirements of Section 416(c)(2) of the Code and the plan. The
         preceding sentence shall apply with respect to matching contributions
         under the plan or, if the plan provides that the minimum contribution
         requirement shall be met in another plan, such other plan. Employer
         matching contributions that are used to satisfy the minimum
         contribution requirements shall be treated as matching contributions
         for purposes of the actual contribution percentage test and other
         requirements of Section 401(m) of the Code.

10.3.2   Contributions under other plans. The employer may provide, in an
         addendum to this amendment, that the minimum benefit requirement shall
         be met in another plan (including another plan that consists solely of
         a cash or deferred arrangement which meets the requirements of Section
         401(k)(12) of the Code and matching contributions with respect to which
         the requirements of Section 401(m)(11) of the Code are met). The
         addendum should include the name of the other plan, the minimum benefit
         that will be provided under such other plan, and the employees who will
         receive the minimum benefit under such other plan.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                                DIRECT ROLLOVERS

11.1     Effective date. This Article shall apply to distributions made after
         December 31, 2001.

11.2     Modification of definition of eligible retirement plan. For purposes of
         the direct rollover provisions of the plan, an eligible retirement plan
         shall also mean an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the
         Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is
         maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency
         or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and
         which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such
         plan from this plan. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall
         also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a
         spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
         domestic relation order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code.

11.3     Modification of definition of eligible rollover distribution to exclude
         hardship distributions. For purposes of the direct rollover provisions
         of the plan, any amount that is distributed on account of hardship
         shall not be an eligible rollover distribution and the distributee may
         not elect to have any portion of such a distribution paid directly to
         an eligible retirement plan.

11.4     Modification of definition of eligible rollover distribution to include
         after-tax employee contributions. For purposes of the direct rollover
         provisions in the plan, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to
         be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion
         consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible
         in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an
         individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or
         (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described
         in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately
         account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for
         the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income
         and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible.

                                   ARTICLE XII
                           ROLLOVERS FROM OTHER PLANS

Rollovers from other plans. The employer, operationally and on a
nondiscriminatory basis, may limit the source of rollover contributions that may
be accepted by this plan.

                                  ARTICLE XIII
                           REPEAL OF MULTIPLE USE TEST

Repeal of Multiple Use Test. The multiple use test described in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.401(m)-2 and the plan shall not apply for plan years
beginning after December 31, 2001.

                                   ARTICLE XIV
                               ELECTIVE DEFERRALS

14.1     Elective Deferrals - Contribution Limitation. No participant shall be
         permitted to have elective deferrals made under this plan, or any other
         qualified plan maintained by the employer during any taxable year, in
         excess of the dollar limitation contained in Section 402(g) of the Code
         in effect for such taxable year, except to the extent permitted under
         Article VI of this amendment and Section 414(v) of the Code, if
         applicable.

14.2     Maximum Salary Reduction Contributions for SIMPLE plans. If this is a
         SIMPLE 401(k) plan, then except to the extent permitted under Article
         VI of this amendment and Section 414(v) of the Code, if applicable, the
         maximum salary reduction contribution that can be made to this plan is
         the amount determined under Section 408(p)(2)(A)(ii) of the Code for
         the calendar year.

                                   ARTICLE XV
                           SAFE HARBOR PLAN PROVISIONS

Modification of Top-Heavy Rules. The top-heavy requirements of Section 416 of
the Code and the plan shall not apply in any year beginning after December 31,
2001, in which the plan consists solely of a cash or deferred arrangement which
meets the requirements of Section 401(k)(12) of the Code and matching
contributions with respect to which the requirements of Section 401(m)(11) of
the Code are met.

                                   ARTICLE XVI
                    DISTRIBUTION UPON SEVERANCE OF EMPLOYMENT

16.1     Effective date. This Article shall apply for distributions and
         transactions made after December 31, 2001, regardless of when the
         severance of employment occurred.

16.2     New distributable event. A participant's elective deferrals, qualified
         nonelective contributions, qualified matching contributions, and
         earnings attributable to these contributions shall be distributed on
         account of the participant's severance from employment. However, such a
         distribution shall be subject to the other provisions of the plan
         regarding distributions, other than provisions that require a
         separation from service before such amounts may be distributed.
