          the  name  of  the  Proposed  Purchaser  and  shall, in the case of an
          intended  offer  by  the  Optionor, disclose the personn or persons to
          whom  the  Optionor  intends  to  offer its interest and, if the offer
          received  by the Optionor from the Proposed Purchaser provides for any
          consideration  payable  to  the  Optionor  otherwise than in cash, the
          Offer  shall  include  the  Optionor's good faith estimate of the cash
          equivalent  of  the  non-cash  consideration.

     (iii)  If  within  a  period  of  60  days  of the receipt of the Offer the
          Optionee  notifies  the  Optionor  in  writing that it will accept the
          Offer,  the  Optionor  shall  be  bound  to  sell such interest to the
          Optionee  on  the  terms  and conditions of the Offer. If the Offer so
          accepted  by  the Optionee contains the Optionor's good faith estimate
          of the cash equivalent of the non cash consideration as aforesaid, and
          if  the  Optionee  disagrees  with  the  Optionor's best estimate, the
          Optionee  shall  so  notify the Optionor at the time of acceptance and
          the Optionee shall, in such notice, specify what it considers, in good
          faith,  the  fair  cash  equivalent  to  be and the resulting purchase
          price. If the Optionee so notifies the Optionor, the acceptance by the
          Optionee  shall  be  effective  and  binding upon the Optionor and the
          Optionee,  and  the cash equivalent of any such non-cash consideration
          shall  be  determinated by binding arbitration and shall be payable by
          the Optionee, subject to prepayment as hereinafter provided, within 60
          days following its determination by arbitration. The Optionee shall in
          such case pay to the Optionor, against receipt of an absolute transfer
          of  clear and unencumbered title to the
<PAGE>


          interest of the Optionor being sold, the total purchase price which is
          specified  in  its  notice  to  the  Optionor and such amount shall be
          credited  to the amount determinated following arbitration of the cash
          equivalent  of  any  non-cash  consideration.

     (iv) If  the Optionee fails to notify the Opfionor before the expiration of
          the  time limited therefor that it will purchase the interest offered,
          the  Optionor  may  sell  and  transfer  such interest to the Proposed
          Purchaser  at  the  price and on the terms and conditions specified in
          the  Offer  for  a  period of 60 days, but the terms of this paragraph
          shall  again  apply  to  such  interest  if  the  sale to the Proposed
          Purchaser  is  not  completed  within  such  60  days.

     (v)  Any  sale  hereunder  shall be conditional upon the Proposed Purchaser
          delivering  a  written  undertaking  to  the  Optionee,  in  form  and
          substance  satisfactory  to  its counsel, to be bound by the terms and
          conditions  of  this  Agreement.

     in  good  standing  under  the  laws  of the jurisdiction in which they are

     abandonment, the mineral claims so abandoned shall for all purposes of this
     Agreement  cease  to form part of the Property and, if title to such claims

          performance  by  the  Optionee  of  its obligations hereunder shall be
          extended  by  a  period  of time equal in length to the period of each
          such  prevention  or  delay,  but  nothing  herein shall discharge the
          Optionee  from  its  obligations hereunder to maintain the Property in
          good  standing;

     (b)  The Optionee shall give prompt notice to the Optionor of each event of
          force  majeure  and  upon cessation of such event shall furnish to the
          Optionor  with  notice to that effect together with particulars of the
          number of days by which the obligations of the Optionee hereunder have
          been  extended  by  virtue  of  such  event  of  force majeure and all

13.  (a)  All  questions  or  matters  in  dispute under this Agreement shall be
          submitted  to  arbitration  pursuant  to  the  terms  hereof.

     (b)  It  shall be a condition precedent to the right of any party to submit
          any  matter  to  arbitration  to the provisions hereof, that any party
          intending to refer any matter to arbitration shall have given not less
          than  10  days'  prior  notice  of its intention to do so to the other
          patty,  together  with  particulars  of  the matter in dispute. On the
          expiration of such 10 days, the party who gave such notice may proceed

     (c)  The party desiring arbitration shall appoint one arbitrator, and shall
          notify the other party of such appointment, and the other party shall,
          within  15  days  after  receiving  such notice, either consent to the
          appointment  of  such  arbitrator  which  shall  then  carry  out  the
          arbitration  or  appoint  an  arbitrator,  and  the two arbitrators so
          named,  before  proceeding  to  act,  shall,  within  30  days  of the
          appointment of the last appointed arbitrator, unanimously agree on the
          appointment  of a third arbitrator to act with them and be chairman of
          the  arbitration herein provided for. If the other party shall fail to
          appoint  an  arbitrator  within  15 days after receiving notice of the
          appointment of the first arbitrator, the first arbitrator shall be the
          only arbitrator. If the two arbitrators appointed by the parties shall
          be  unable  to  agree on the appointment of the chairman, the chairman
          shall  be appointed under the provisions of the Commercial Arbitration
          Act  of  Bntish Columbia. Except as specifically otherwise provided in
          this  section,  the arbitration herein provided for shall be conducted
          in  accordance  with such Act. The chairman, or in the case where only
          one  arbitrator  is appointed, the single arbitrator, shall fix a time
          and  place  in  Vancouver, Bntish Columbia, for the purpose of hearing
          the  evidence and representations of the parties, and he shall preside
          over  the  arbitration  and  determine  all questions of procedure not
          provided  for  under  such  Act  or  this  section.  After hearing any
          evidence  and  representations that the parties may submit, the single
          arbitrator,  or  the  arbitrators,  as  the case may be, shall make an
          award  and reduce the same to writing, and deliver one copy thereof to
          each  of  the parties. The expense of the arbitration shall be paid as
          specified  in  the  award.

<PAGE>


     (d)  The  parties agree that the award of a majority of the arbitrators, or
          in the case of a single arbitrator, of such arbitrator, shall be final
          and  binding  upon  each  of  them.

     provision in this Agreement (other than the provisions of subparagraph 4(b)
     for  which  no notice of default need be given), the Optionor may terminate
     this  Agreement  but  only  if:

     (a)  it  shall  have  first  given  to  the  Optionee  a  notice of default
          containing  particulars  of  the obligation which the Optionee has not
          performed,  or  the  warranty  breached;  and

     (b)  the Optionee has not, within 45 days following delivery of such notice
          of  default,  cured such default or commenced proceedings to cure such
          default  by  appropriate  payment  or  perfomance, the Optionee hereby
          agreeing  that  should  it  so  commence  to  cure any default it will
          prosecute  the  satne  to  completion  without  undue  delay.

the Optionor may thereafter terminate this Agreement by giving notice thereof to
