                               I. SUMMARY OF PLAN


         The following introduction and summary is a general overview only and
is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the
more detailed discussions, information, and financial statements and notes
thereto appearing elsewhere in this Disclosure Statement and the Joint Plan of
Reorganization of Kmart Corporation and its Affiliated Debtors and Debtors-in-
Possession (the "Plan"). All capitalized terms not defined in this Disclosure
Statement have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan. A copy of the
Plan is annexed hereto as Appendix A.

         This Disclosure Statement contains, among other things, descriptions
and summaries of provisions of the Plan being proposed by Kmart Corporation
("Kmart") and thirty-seven of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates (the
"Affiliate Debtors"), debtors and debtors-in-possession (collectively, the
"Debtors"), as filed on January 24, 2003, with the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division (the "Bankruptcy
Court"). Certain provisions of the Plan, and thus the descriptions and summaries
contained herein, are the subject of continuing negotiations among the Debtors
and various parties, have not been finally agreed upon, and may be modified.
Such modifications, however, will not have a material effect on the
distributions contemplated by the Plan.

A. BUSINESS OVERVIEW

         Kmart is the successor to the business developed by its founder, S.S.
Kresge, who opened his first store in 1899. The first store using the Kmart name
was opened in March 1962. Since that time, Kmart has become the nation's third
largest discount retailer and the fourth largest general merchandise retailer.
As of the commencement of these Chapter 11 Cases, Kmart operated approximately
2,114 stores, primarily under the Big Kmart or Kmart Supercenter format, in all
50 United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. As of the
Petition Date, approximately 75% of the U.S. population shopped at Kmart each
year, and about 85% of the U.S. population lived within 15 miles of a Kmart
store. As of October 15, 2002, Kmart's retail operations were located in 308 of
the 324 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States.

         Kmart focuses its merchandising and marketing approach on its brand
positioning, pricing strategies, and presentation to build customer loyalty and
increase shopping frequency. Kmart does so by featuring popular national brands
at competitive prices combined with new, distinct brands to differentiate itself
in the marketplace. Kmart is continually focused on growing its exclusive
private brand product offerings, which is highlighted by important agreements
with nationally recognized names such as Martha Stewart, Disney, Sesame Street,
Joe Boxer, Route 66, Jaclyn Smith, Kathy Ireland, and Thalia.

         Kmart's need to restructure its business through a Chapter 11
reorganization proceeding arose due to the combined effects of a number of
factors. These factors include the intense competition experienced by all
retailers in the discount retailing industry, a series of unsuccessful sales and
marketing initiatives, and the continuing recession. Other factors, which arose
quickly in the final days of 2001 and the very early part of January 2002,
included the rapid decline in


                                      -iii-
<PAGE>
Kmart's liquidity resulting from below-plan sales and earnings performance in
the fourth quarter of 2001.

         In light of these business issues, Kmart determined that Chapter 11
would afford the company the best opportunity for restructuring its affairs and
for developing and implementing a long-term, go-forward, retail business
strategy. To this end, Kmart has worked to implement a number of key initiatives
during the time that the company has been in Chapter 11. Kmart believes that it
has accomplished or will accomplish prior to emergence from Chapter 11 nearly
all of the actions which it required Chapter 11 to address, including, among
other things, elimination of unprofitable stores and leases, improvement of
store operations and inventory management, and the restructuring of its balance
sheet through the conversion of substantially all debt into equity.

         A primary focus of Kmart and its constituents during these Chapter 11
Cases has been on rationalizing and optimizing the company's store and lease
portfolio. To this end, Kmart will have reduced its total number of stores from
2,114 as of the Petition Date to 1,509 as of emergence from Chapter 11, which
constitutes a total reduction of 605 stores. Concurrent with Kmart's goal of
rationalizing and optimizing the store and lease portfolio, Kmart has also
obtained substantial value through the renegotiation and/or assumption of
several significant executory contracts, including licensing agreements with its
key brand partners and a contract with Cardinal Health, Inc., Kmart's exclusive
supplier of pharmaceutical and related products.

         As of the commencement of these Chapter 11 Cases, Kmart employed
approximately 234,000 employees. As of January 21, 2003, approximately 32,000
employee relationships had been severed, most of them in connection with Kmart's
closure of 283 stores in the spring of 2002. Kmart anticipates that an
additional 35,000 employee relationships will be severed in connection with the
closure of up to 326 additional stores in early 2003. In part as a result of
these store closures and Kmart's overall cost-rationalization strategy, the
company has significantly reduced its overhead costs during these Chapter 11
Cases through a reduction in the number of support employees located at its
headquarters in Troy, Michigan. The number of such employees has been reduced
from approximately 4,900 as of the Petition Date to approximately 3,600 as of
January 21, 2003, a total reduction of 1,300 employees.

         Kmart's asset rationalization and optimization strategies have been
complemented throughout these Chapter 11 Cases by a number of business
initiatives designed to attract customers to Kmart stores, cement vendor
support, and increase sales and gross margins. Kmart has successfully expanded
and redesigned its weekly advertising circulars, and has implemented a strategic
marketing plan aimed at Hispanics and African Americans, who collectively
comprise one of the fastest-growing customer segments. The company has had
positive results with its "Stuff of Life" advertising campaign featuring the
Martha Stewart Everyday and Jaclyn Smith brands. The company has also commenced
implementation of a "store of the neighborhood" approach to servicing its
customers, which allows individual store managers to customize their merchandise
assortment to suit local community needs and allows greater focus on high volume
and advertised items.

         Kmart's asset rationalization and optimization strategies, along with
the other business initiatives implemented throughout these Chapter 11 Cases,
have begun to bear positive results, including stabilization of the business and
improved liquidity. Although Kmart has



                                      -iv-
<PAGE>
accomplished many important goals through the tools afforded by Chapter 11,
Kmart believes that the prospects for further operational improvement will be
best achieved outside of Chapter 11. There are continued costs of remaining in
Chapter 11 that Kmart believes warrant emergence at this time, including the
administrative costs of the Chapter 11 process, and the continued diversion of
management time by the Chapter 11 proceedings.

         As part of the process to emerge from Chapter 11, Kmart undertook a
thorough and detailed process to develop a five-year business plan. Under the
business plan, 2003 will be a transition period. Kmart will not begin to realize
its long-term potential until 2004 and beyond. Kmart projects that the business
will continue to recover and grow. The business plan is premised upon Kmart's
continued implementation of several key initiatives, including the "store of the
neighborhood" and the long-term rollout of the "store of the future." With the
continued support of its vendor community through the vendor lien contemplated
by the Plan and a $2 billion exit financing facility, Kmart anticipates being
able to improve its customer shopping experience and ultimately returning to
profitability.

         When Kmart commenced these Chapter 11 Cases on January 22, 2002, it
announced its intention to pursue a "fast-track" reorganization and emerge from
Chapter 11 by July 2003. The company recently has announced its intention to
emerge from Chapter 11 earlier than originally projected, and in any event no
later than April 30, 2003. While Kmart believes that it has completed its
Chapter 11 objectives, Kmart's operational and financial turnaround will
continue after emergence, including during the remainder of the 2003 transition
year. Kmart's early emergence and implementation of its five-year business plan
are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Certain of such risks are
discussed in detail in Section VIII of this Disclosure Statement.

B. GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE PLAN

         Each of Kmart and its thirty-seven (37) debtor affiliates is a
proponent of the Plan within the meaning of Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code.
The Plan provides for the substantive consolidation of the Estates that comprise
the Debtors for distribution purposes only. The Plan contains separate classes
and proposes recoveries for holders of Claims against and Interests in the
Debtors. After careful review of the Debtors' current business operations,
estimated recoveries in a liquidation scenario, and the prospects of ongoing
business, the Debtors have concluded that the recovery to the Debtors' creditors
will be maximized by the reorganization of Kmart and the Affiliated Debtors as
contemplated by the Plan.

         Specifically, the Debtors believe that their businesses and assets have
significant value that would not be realized in a liquidation, either in whole
or in substantial part. According to the valuation analysis prepared by the
Debtors' investment banker and financial advisor, Miller Buckfire Lewis & Co.,
LLC ("Miller Buckfire"), the liquidation analysis prepared by the Debtors'
restructuring advisors, Alix Partners, LLC ("Alix Partners"), and the other
analyses prepared by the Debtors with the assistance of their financial
advisors, the Debtors believe that the value of the Estates of the Debtors is
significantly greater in the proposed reorganization than in a liquidation.



                                       -v-

C. SUMMARY OF THE PLAN STRUCTURE

         Set forth below is a brief summary of the Plan. The effectiveness of
the Plan, and thus the consummation of the distributions provided for in the
Plan, is subject to a number of conditions precedent. There can be no assurances
that these conditions will be satisfied. In addition, the Debtors have reserved
the right to amend or modify the Plan as to any particular Debtor.

         Under the Plan, unsecured creditors whose claims will not be paid in
full or otherwise reinstated have been classified into four primary groups for
distribution purposes. The first such group is comprised of the Debtors'
pre-petition lenders who are owed approximately $1.08 billion. Kmart is directly
obligated on this indebtedness and several other Affiliate Debtors are
guarantors of this indebtedness. Certain parties, including other unsecured
creditors, have challenged the enforceability of the Affiliate Debtors'
guarantees. In settlement and compromise of these issues, the lenders shall
receive under the Plan shares of new common stock of Reorganized Kmart, provided
that Reorganized Kmart shall purchase such shares from the lenders for an amount
equal to forty percent (40%) of the principal amount of their claims in
settlement of all of their claims against the Debtors.

         A substantial portion of the cash to be utilized by Reorganized Kmart
to make these payments to the lenders will be provided by two significant
creditors - ESL Investments, Inc. ("ESL") and Third Avenue Trust, on behalf of
certain of its investment series (collectively, the "Plan Investors"). The Plan
Investors have agreed to make a substantial investment in Kmart in furtherance
of Kmart's financial and operational restructuring pursuant to an Investment
Agreement dated as of January 24, 2003. In exchange for this investment, which
will total at least $293.4 million, the Plan Investors will receive shares of
stock of Reorganized Kmart (the "Total Investor Shares").

         Of the total investment amount, approximately $153.4 million will be
comprised of cash payable to ESL pursuant to the Plan as a prepetition lender
(and which will be deemed contributed by ESL to the Debtors in exchange for the
new shares), and the remaining $140 million represents an additional investment
to be made by the Plan Investors pursuant to the terms of the Investment
Agreement. In addition, the Plan Investors have agreed to invest up to an
additional $60 million in exchange for a convertible note to the extent
necessary to help the Debtors satisfy their cash obligations under the Plan, all
as more fully set forth in the Investment Agreement. The shares issued in
exchange for the additional investment of $140 million is sometimes referred to
herein as the "Plan Investors Shares."

         Two other significant groups of unsecured creditors whose claims will
be treated under the plan include (i) holders of pre-petition notes and
debentures issued by Kmart in the total face amount of approximately $2.3
billion and (ii) trade creditors, service providers, and landlords with lease
rejection claims that the Debtors estimate will be allowed in the aggregate
amount of approximately $4.3 billion. These two groups of creditors will share
pro rata in the stock of Reorganized Kmart, other than the Total Investor
Shares, in satisfaction of their claims.

         The final significant group of creditors is comprised of personal
injury and other litigation claimants, governmental claimants, and other
contingent claim holders. Under the



                                      -vi-
<PAGE>
Plan, these claimants will receive a deferred cash payment in an amount that
will afford them a percentage recovery on their claims comparable to the
estimated percentage recovery to holders of the prepetition notes and
debentures, trade vendor claims, service provider claims, and lease rejection
claims.

         Under the Plan, a trust will be established for the limited purpose of
pursuing causes of action arising out of the Debtors' stewardship investigation,
which is discussed in more detail below. Any recoveries from claims brought by
the trust will be distributed pursuant to the terms of the Plan to holders of
(a) pre-petition notes and debentures; (b) trade creditors, service providers,
and landlords with lease rejection claims; and (c) subject to approval of the
Plan by the holders of certain trust preferred obligations, holders of certain
trust preferred obligations as well as holders of Kmart common stock.

         Under the Plan, there are certain other classes of creditors and
obligation-holders, including holders of certain trust preferred obligations,
existing Kmart common stock, and a "convenience" class that affords creditors
with claims under $30,000 and creditors who elect to have their claims allowed
in relatively small amounts the option to be paid a portion of their claim
amounts in cash. These other classes are discussed in more detail below.

         Under the Plan, Kmart's restructured business will be owned and
operated through a new corporate structure. This new structure will be comprised
of a new holding company ("Reorganized Kmart") that will own a new operating
company ("New Operating Company") that will be an intermediary company that
houses upper-level management of the reorganized enterprise and that will in
turn own, directly or indirectly, various corporate and other entities that will
own and operate the business of the Reorganized Debtors. The New Operating
Company and one or more of its subsidiaries may be comprised of existing Kmart
entities. This new corporate structure is being implemented for various business
planning reasons and is designed to assist the reorganized business to maximize
value for all constituents.

         Although the reorganized enterprise will be operated through a new set
of corporate entities, each of the thirty-eight (38) Debtors in the Chapter 11
proceedings will emerge from Chapter 11 under the Plan except that certain
assets related to those stores that the Debtors intend to close in early 2003
shall remain in Chapter 11 so that such assets may be disposed of consistent
with procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court relating to sales of owned
assets and assignments of real property leases. Thus, pending such disposition,
such assets shall remain in the estates and not revest in the Debtors. The
proceeds from disposition of the closing store assets will be contributed to the
Reorganized Debtors and utilized consistent with the Plan. Creditor
classifications have been established under the Plan with respect to the Debtors
that own these assets and creditors of such Debtors, including landlords that
ultimately may hold lease rejection claims, will share in distributions
consistent with the Plan. Except as provided in the Plan, and with respect to
the closing store real estate only, the Debtors owning such assets will be
deemed to emerge from Chapter 11 as Reorganized Debtors (upon final disposition
of such assets) and either dissolved in accordance with applicable
non-bankruptcy law or maintained consistent with the corporate restructuring
transactions contemplated by the Plan as the business needs of the Reorganized
Debtors warrant.

D. SUMMARY OF TREATMENT OF CLAIMS AND INTERESTS UNDER THE PLAN

         As set forth above, the Plan constitutes a joint plan of reorganization
providing for the substantive consolidation of the Debtors' Estates for
distribution purposes. The Plan contains separate classes for holders of Claims
against and Interests in the Debtors. As required by the Bankruptcy Code,
Administrative Claims and Priority Tax Claims are not classified.

         The table below summarizes the classification and treatment of the
principal prepetition Claims and Interests in the Plan. The classification and
treatment for all Classes are described in more detail in Section VII. The table
below also sets forth the Debtors' estimates of the amount of Claims that will
ultimately become Allowed in each Class based upon review by the Debtors of all
Claims scheduled by the Debtors, consideration of the provisions of the Plan
that affect the allowance of certain Claims, and a general estimate of the
amount by which Allowed Claims may ultimately exceed the amount of Claims
scheduled by the Debtors. The table below also includes an estimated percentage
recovery for holders of Claims in each Class. For purposes of estimating the
percentage recoveries as set forth below, the New Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to the Plan was assumed to be valued at as provided for in the
valuation analysis attached hereto as Appendix D. The estimated percentage
recoveries set forth below that are based upon distributions of New Common Stock
were calculated using the mid-point of the valuation ranges.

         The Debtors' investment banker and financial advisor, Miller, Buckfire,
performed a valuation of the Reorganized Debtors and the New Common Stock based
on information and financial projections provided by the Debtors. The valuation
assumptions include, among other things, an assumption that the results
projected for the Reorganized Debtors will be achieved in all material respects.
However, no assurance can be given that the projected results will be achieved.
To the extent that the valuation assumptions are dependent upon the achievement
of the results projected by the Debtors, the valuation assumptions must be
considered speculative. The valuation assumptions also consider, among other
matters, (i) market valuation information concerning certain publicly traded
securities of certain other companies that are considered relevant, (ii) certain
general economic and industry information considered relevant to the business of
the Reorganized Debtors, and (iii) such other investigations and analyses as
were deemed necessary or appropriate. The Debtors and Miller, Buckfire believe
these valuation assumptions are reasonable.

         The foregoing valuation assumptions are not a prediction or reflection
of post-Confirmation trading prices of the New Common Stock or any other
securities. Such securities may trade at substantially higher or lower prices
because of a number of factors, including those discussed in Section VIII. The
trading prices of securities issued under a plan of reorganization are subject
to many unforeseeable circumstances and therefore cannot be predicted.

         In addition, for certain Classes of Claims, the actual amounts of
Allowed Claims could materially exceed or could be materially less than the
estimated amounts shown in the table that follows. Accordingly, for these
reasons, no representation can be or is being made with respect to whether the
estimated percentage recoveries shown in the table below will actually be
realized by the holders of Allowed Claims in any particular Class. FOR PURPOSES
OF CALCULATING ESTIMATED RECOVERIES, THE FOLLOWING TABLE GIVES EFFECT TO THE
SUBORDINATION RIGHTS OF VARIOUS




                                     -viii-
<PAGE>
PARTIES, AND DOES NOT GIVE EFFECT TO THE RECOVERIES, IF ANY, ON ACCOUNT OF
CLAIMS OF THE DEBTORS ON ACCOUNT OF THE STEWARDSHIP AND RELATED INVESTIGATIONS.

CLASS 1 - SECURED              Except as otherwise provided in and subject to
CLAIMS                         Section 9.8 of the Plan, at the sole option of
                               the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors, (i) the
                               legal, equitable, and contractual rights of each
                               Allowed Secured Claimholder shall be Reinstated
                               or (ii) each Allowed Secured Claimholder shall
                               receive, in full satisfaction, settlement and
                               release of, and in exchange for, its Allowed
                               Secured Claim (A) Cash in an amount equal to the
                               value of the Secured Claimholder's interest in
                               the property of the Estate which constitutes
                               collateral for such Allowed Secured Claim, or (B)
                               the property of the Estate which constitutes
                               collateral for such Allowed Secured Claim, or (C)
                               such other treatment as to which the Debtors (or
                               the Reorganized Debtors) and the holder of such
                               Allowed Secured Claim have agreed upon in
                               writing, provided that such treatment is not more
                               favorable than the treatment in clause (A) or
                               clause (B) above. The Debtors' failure to object
                               to such Secured Claims in their Chapter 11 Cases
                               shall be without prejudice to the Reorganized

                               against such Claims in the Bankruptcy Court or
                               other appropriate non-bankruptcy forum (at the
                               option of the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors)

                               by the Secured Claimholder. Notwithstanding
                               section 1141(c) or any other provision of the
                               Bankruptcy Code, all prepetition liens on

                               the Secured Claimholders with respect to such
                               Claims shall survive the Effective Date and

                               are paid in full. The Debtors believe that this
                               Class is comprised primarily of mortgage liens on
                               certain owned real property.

                               Claimholder shall receive, in full satisfaction,

                               treatment in clause (a) or clause (b) above. The
                               Debtors' failure to object to an Other Priority
                               Claim in their Chapter 11 Cases shall be without

                               contest or otherwise defend against such Claim in
                               the Bankruptcy Court or other appropriate

                               Priority Claimholder. This Class is comprised
                               primarily of potential wage and wage-related
                               claims. Because the Debtors received authority to

                               business, and have in fact paid such claims
                               during the Chapter 11 Case, the Debtors do not
                               believe that there will be a material amount of
                               such Claims.

                           III. HISTORY OF THE DEBTORS

A. OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS

         1. Summary of the Debtors' Business History.

         Kmart was incorporated under the laws of the State of Michigan on March
9, 1916, as the successor to the business developed by its founder, Sebastian
Spering Kresge, who opened his first store in 1899. When Kresge opened his first
store, he sold everything for five or ten cents. The low prices appealed to
shoppers and allowed him to expand to 85 stores by 1912, with annual sales of
more than $10 million. When war and financial depressions hit America over the
next several decades, the Kresge stores continued to offer families products at
prices they could afford and jobs to support American families. By the
mid-1920s, Kresge was opening locations that sold items for $1 or less, a
precursor to the current discount store. These "green-front" stores often were
right next to the traditional red-front, five-and-dime Kresge stores.

         As the retail environment became more competitive, Kresge again blazed
the trail for future retailers by launching a newspaper advertising program to
entice shoppers to its stores. Those print ads were the precursor to radio
promotions, which followed 20 years later, and then television commercials which
began to air in 1968. Kmart continues to be the leading print promotional
retailer, with weekly circulars reaching more than 70 million households.

         By the 1950s, it was evident that the company needed to change to
continue to be a leader in the growingly competitive retail environment. That
change came through Harry B. Cunningham, who became President in 1959.
Cunningham had been studying other discount houses and developed a new strategy
for the organization. Under Cunningham's leadership, the first Kmart discount
department store opened in 1962 in Garden City, Michigan. Seventeen additional
Kmart stores opened that year, leading to corporate sales of more than $483
million. Just four years later in 1966, sales from 162 Kmart stores and 753
Kresge stores topped the $1 billion mark. In 1976, Kresge made history by
opening 271 Kmart stores in one year, becoming the first-ever retailer to launch
17 million square feet of sales space in a single year.

         In 1977, nearly 95 percent of Kresge company sales were generated by
Kmart stores. To reflect this dramatic impact, the company officially changed
its name to Kmart Corporation. Ten years later, Kmart sold the remaining Kresge
stores to fully concentrate on discount merchandising. In 1990, Kmart unveiled a
bold new logo and a bold new plan: a five-year, $3.5 billion new-store opening,
enlargement, and modernization program to focus the business on its Kmart
stores. In 1991, as part of the new plan, Kmart opened the first Kmart
Supercenter in Medina, Ohio, offering a full-service grocery along with general
merchandise 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

         Kmart began expanding its business operations in 1984 through the
acquisition of several specialty stores. In that year, Kmart acquired Walden
Book Company and Home Centers of America, which was subsequently renamed
Builders Square. Six years later in 1990, Kmart purchased The Sports Authority,
a chain of sporting goods super stores, and a twenty-two percent (22%) ownership
interest in OfficeMax (later increased to over ninety percent (90%) in 1991). In
1992, Kmart acquired Borders, a chain of book super stores in the Midwest and
Northeast. While Kmart acquired interests in these businesses in order to
diversify its business lines, Kmart incurred a significant amount of debt in






                                       6
<PAGE>
connection with the acquisitions and ultimately was diverted from its core
business as a discount merchandise retailer. In 1994, Kmart therefore began to
divest itself of its interests in certain of these entities by completing
initial public offerings of portions of its interests in The Sports Authority,
OfficeMax, and Borders. In 1995 and 1997, Kmart sold its remaining interests in
The Sports Authority, OfficeMax, and Builders Square. Although Kmart no longer
has any interests in these specialty stores, it remains obligated on significant
lease guarantee obligations in connection with these businesses. These
liabilities are summarized in greater detail in Section IV.D. of this Disclosure
Statement.

         In 1996, a complete redesign of the Kmart store was launched, making
them cleaner, brighter and easier to shop. A "Pantry" department, selling
frequently-purchased consumable goods, was moved toward the front of the store
and a new focus was placed on the Children's and Home Fashions departments.
These "big" changes were signified by a new name for the remodeled stores: "Big
Kmart." To further expand the reach of the company, in December of 1999, Kmart
launched a new Internet presence with investment partners, BlueLight.com, which
operated an e-commerce site and provided internet service. By initially offering
free Internet service, BlueLight was able to register a record-breaking number
of users in its first few months. Shoppers now know the e-commerce and
information site as www.kmart.com.

         2. The Debtors' Position in the Retail Industry; Exclusive Brands.

         As of the commencement of these Chapter 11 Cases, Kmart was the
nation's second largest discount retailer and the third largest general
merchandise retailer, operating 2,114 stores, including 136 supercenters, with
locations in each of the 50 United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands
and Guam, and an e-commerce shopping site. As of October 15, 2002, Kmart's
retail operations were located in 308 of the 324 metropolitan statistical areas
in the United States.

         Kmart employed approximately 234,000 employees nationwide, making it
one of the largest employers in the United States with annual payroll and
benefits of over $5 billion. For the fiscal year ended January 2002, Kmart had
consolidated net sales of approximately $36 billion, administered $14.3 billion
in assets at book value, and reported total liabilities of approximately $10
billion.

         Kmart has relationships with more than 4,000 merchandise vendors
worldwide and is one of the country's largest purchasers of products. Kmart's
stores are generally one-floor, free-standing units ranging in size from 40,000
to 190,000 square feet. Most of Kmart's store locations are leased from
unrelated third parties. As of the commencement of these Chapter 11 Cases, Kmart
was a party to over 5,000 leases and subleases, had relationships with
approximately 3,240 landlords and subtenants, and was a party to over 6,300
additional executory contracts. Kmart had two principal equity investments,
including a 49% interest in substantially all of the Meldisco subsidiaries of
Footstar, Inc., operator of the footware departments in Kmart stores, and a 36%
interest in Penske Auto Centers, LLC, which formerly operated Penske auto
service centers at certain Kmart stores.

         Kmart has several major competitors on a national level, including
Wal-Mart, Target, Sears, Kohl's, and J.C. Penney, and many competitors on a
local and regional level which compete with Kmart's individual stores. Success
in this competitive retail environment is based on factors such as price,
quality, service, product assortment and convenience. Due to the seasonal nature
of the retail industry, where merchandise sales and cash flows from operations
are historically higher in the fourth calendar quarter than any other period, a
disproportionate amount of revenues and operating cash flows are generated
during the holiday season. In preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season,
Kmart



                                       7
<PAGE>
significantly increases its merchandise inventories, which traditionally have
been financed by cash flow from operations, bank lines of credit, and trade
credit from vendors. Kmart's profitability and cash flow are primarily dependent
upon the large sales volume generated during the fourth quarter of its fiscal
year. Fourth quarter sales represented over 30% of total net sales in fiscal
2001.

         A key component of Kmart's strategy is its investment in merchandising
and marketing initiatives that enhance its strategic position by offering
exclusive brands that differentiate Kmart from its competitors. Pursuant to this
strategy, Kmart has license agreements with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia,
Inc. for Martha Stewart Everyday home, garden, housewares and seasonal products;
Jaclyn Smith G.H. Production, Inc. for Jaclyn Smith women's apparel, jewelry and
accessories; Kathy Ireland

equipment; Disney Enterprises, Inc. for Disney non-character apparel for infants
and children; Sesame Workshop for Sesame Street apparel for infants and
children; Joe Boxer Licensing, LLC for Joe Boxer apparel, accessories and home
furnishings; Route 66, L.P. for Route 66 apparel and accessories; Avmark, Inc.
for Curtis Mathes consumer video, audio and telecommunications products; and T
Enterprises, LLC for the right to utilize the name, likeness, and signature of
Ariadna Sodi Miranda, professionally known as Thalia.

         Kmart believes that focusing its merchandising and marketing approach
on quality name brands builds customer loyalty and increases shopping frequency.
Indeed, Martha Stewart is a leading brand for home fashions and is widely
recognized for quality. The Martha Stewart brand increases customer purchases of
other products and has significant product expansion opportunities for Kmart.
Similarly, the Jaclyn Smith line of products is Kmart's premier ladies
sportswear brand and has consistently ranked among the most recognizable in the
industry. The Kathy Ireland brand is Kmart's contemporary sportswear line and
generates substantial customer loyalty. The Disney brand has universal customer
appeal and very broad customer awareness. The Disney brand is repeatedly ranked
among the top consumer brands for quality and value, and is the leading brand
for children in the three to eleven age group. The Joe Boxer product launch in
August 2002 was the most successful in Kmart's history and creates a fun,
high-quality image among Generation Y shoppers.

         The Sesame Street line of products represents the "gold standard" with
moms and kids, whereas the Route 66 line of products is a cross-divisional brand
offering trendy casual clothing. The Curtis Mathes line of products represents a
value brand that offers functionality equivalent to the leading national brands
yet provides Kmart with better than average gross margins. The Curtis Mathes
line of products consistently produces high sales volume. Finally, the Thalia
brand represents an opportunity to strengthen business among Hispanics. This
demographic group accounts for more than 17% of the Debtors' total sales and
represents the fastest growing segment of the population.

         Kmart recently unveiled a new round of commercials focused on two of
its key assets: its high-quality, exclusive brands and its across-the-store
value proposition. The latest commercials in its "Stuff of Life" advertising
campaign include the Martha Stewart Everyday brand, featuring Martha Stewart and
the Jaclyn Smith brand featuring Jaclyn Smith. These commercials were directed
by award-winning film maker Spike Lee. Other commercial spots focus on Kmart's
outstanding value-for-the-money proposition and the corporate branding message,
positioning Kmart as the one store where consumers can get all their everyday
needs and wants. Finally, Kmart recently unveiled a multi-faceted media campaign
including television, print and direct mail for Joe Boxer apparel. The Joe Boxer
media campaign focused on the fun, irreverent nature of the Joe Boxer brand.

C. TRUST SECURITIES

         In June 1996, Kmart Financing I, a trust sponsored and wholly-owned by
Kmart, issued to the public 20,000,000 trust convertible preferred securities in
the face amount of $1 billion (the "Trust Securities") pursuant to that certain
Convertible Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated June 6, 1996, between Kmart and
The Bank of New York, as trustee. The proceeds from the sale of the Trust
Securities, together with the proceeds of a sale of common trust securities to
Kmart, were used to purchase from Kmart 7 3/4% subordinated convertible
debentures due June 15, 2016 in the face amount of $1 billion. The debentures
are the sole asset of the trust. The Trust Securities accrue and pay cash
distributions quarterly at a rate of 7 3/4% per annum. Kmart guaranteed, on a
subordinated basis, distributions and other payments due on the Trust
Securities. Kmart has stopped accruing distributions on the Trust Securities.
Contractual distributions for fiscal year 2001 on the Trust Securities were $72
million.

         The Trust Securities are convertible at the option of the holder at any
time at the rate of 3.3333 shares of Kmart common stock for each Trust Security,
and are mandatorily redeemable upon repayment of the debentures, either at
maturity on June 15, 2016, or upon their earlier redemption. The debentures
became callable at Kmart's option beginning June 15, 1999. During fiscal year
2000, Kmart repurchased approximately 2 million shares of Trust Securities at a
cost of approximately $84 million. After taking into consideration recent
conversions, the face value of the outstanding obligations as of January 1, 2003
was $648,043,500.

         The rights of holders of the Trust Securities to certain distributions
in the event of reorganization proceedings of the Debtors are subordinated to
the rights of the lenders under the Three-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day
Credit Agreement, and to the rights of holders of the Prepetition Notes.
Pursuant to these subordination rights, distributions proposed to be made to
holders of the Trust Securities therefore must be made to holders of the
Prepetition Notes.

D. OTHER MATERIAL DEBT OBLIGATIONS

         As of October 30, 2002, Kmart had (i) guaranteed obligations for real
property leases of certain current and former subsidiaries of Kmart including,
but not limited to, The Sports Authority, Inc., Borders Group, Inc., and Office
Max, Inc., some of which leases have been assigned pre-petition; (ii) a
contingent liability under real property leases assigned by Kmart pre-petition;
and (iii) guaranteed approximately $70 million of indebtedness of other parties
related to certain leased properties financed by industrial revenue bonds.
Kmart's rights and obligations with respect to its guarantee of leases of the
former subsidiaries as of October 30, 2002, which are detailed below, are
governed by Lease Guaranty,

E. EQUITY

         As of December 17, 2002, there were 519,050,664 shares of common stock
of Kmart issued, outstanding and publicly traded. Prior to December 19, 2002,
Kmart's common stock was listed on the New York, Pacific and Chicago Stock
Exchanges. There were a number of continuing requirements that had to be
satisfied in order for Kmart's stock to remain eligible for quotation on the New
York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"). On July 10, 2002, Kmart received notification
from the NYSE that Kmart was not in compliance with the requirements for
continued listing and, accordingly, that Kmart could be subject to trading
suspension and delisting. As of December 19, 2002, Kmart's common stock and the
trust preferred securities were suspended for trading by the NYSE and the
Pacific and Chicago Exchanges. The new ticker symbols KMRTQ and KMTPQ have been
assigned to Kmart's common stock and the trust preferred securities,
respectively, by the over-the-counter bulletin board (the "OTCBB"). Kmart's
common stock and the trust preferred securities are presently being quoted on
the Pink Sheets Electronic Quotation Service.

                            VI. THE CHAPTER 11 CASES

A. EVENTS LEADING TO COMMENCEMENT OF THE CHAPTER 11 CASES

         Kmart's decision to commence Chapter 11 reorganization cases was based
on a combination of factors. Some of these factors - including intense
competition in the discount retailing industry, a series of unsuccessful sales
and marketing initiatives - developed over a relatively long period of time
prior to the Chapter 11 filing. Other factors, however, arose quickly in the
final days of 2001 and the very early part of January 2002. These factors
included a rapid decline in the Debtors' liquidity resulting from below-plan
sales and earnings performance in the fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year,
the evaporation of the surety bond market, erosion of supplier confidence, and
exceptional volatility in the capital markets.

         As a result of these factors, Kmart concluded that the commencement of
the Chapter 11 Cases was in the best interests of all stakeholders and was
necessary to protect the estates from the risk of remedial action by certain
creditors. Kmart also determined that it would be difficult, outside of
reorganization proceedings, for Kmart and its affiliated debtors to withstand
the downturn in the economic environment. Finally, Kmart determined that it
would benefit from orderly asset sales and lease dispositions under a process
supervised by the Bankruptcy Court. Based upon the foregoing, Kmart believed
that the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases would enable the company to move
forward with a refocused strategic plan while restructuring certain of its
business operations.

B. CONTINUATION OF BUSINESS; STAY OF LITIGATION

         On January 22, 2002, Kmart and thirty-seven affiliate debtors filed
voluntary petitions in the Bankruptcy Court for reorganization relief under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Since the Petition Date, the Debtors have
continued to operate as debtors-in-possession subject to the supervision of the
Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors are
authorized to operate their business in the ordinary course of business, with
transactions out of the ordinary course of business requiring Bankruptcy Court
approval.

         An immediate effect of the filing of the Debtors' bankruptcy petitions
was the imposition of the automatic stay under the Bankruptcy Code which, with
limited exceptions, enjoined the commencement or continuation of all collection
efforts by creditors, the enforcement of liens against property of the Debtors,
and the continuation of litigation against the Debtors. This relief provided the
Debtors with the "breathing room" necessary to assess and reorganize their
business. The automatic stay remains in effect, unless modified by the
Bankruptcy Court, until consummation of a plan of reorganization.

C. SUMMARY OF CERTAIN RELIEF OBTAINED AT THE OUTSET OF THE CHAPTER 11 CASES

         1. First Day Orders.

         On January 22, 2002, the Debtors filed several motions seeking the
relief provided by certain so- called "first day orders." First day orders are
intended to facilitate the transition between a debtor's prepetition and
postpetition business operations by approving certain regular business conduct
that may not be authorized specifically under the Bankruptcy Code or as to which
the Bankruptcy Code requires prior approval by the Bankruptcy Court.

         The first day orders in the Chapter 11 Cases, which were entered over
the course of several days after the January 22, 2002, petition date,
authorized, among other things:

         -        the retention of the following professionals to serve on
                  behalf of the Debtors: Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom
                  (Illinois) and its affiliated law practice entities as
                  restructuring counsel; PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as financial
                  advisor; Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, Inc. (the
                  restructuring practice of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, Inc.
                  was spun off into an independent entity in July 2002 and is
                  known as Miller Buckfire Lewis & Co., LLC ("Miller Buckfire
                  Lewis")) as financial advisor and investment banker; Rockwood
                  Gemini Advisors as real estate advisor; and Trumbull Services,
                  LLC as claims and noticing agent;

         -        the continued retention of professionals regularly employed by
                  the Debtors in the ordinary course of their business;

         -        the maintenance of the Debtors' bank accounts and operation of
                  their cash management systems substantially as such systems
                  existed prior to the Petition Date;

         -        the payment of employees' accrued prepetition wages and
                  employee benefit claims;

         -        the payment of certain prepetition obligations to customers
                  and the continuation of customer programs and practices;

         -        the payment of certain prepetition shipping and delivery
                  charges;

         -        the payment of prepetition obligations necessary to obtain
                  imported merchandise;

         -        payment of prepetition claims of certain critical trade
                  vendors;

         -        procedures for the resolution and payment of valid
                  reclamation, PACA and PASA claims;

         -        the payment of certain prepetition mechanics' liens of
                  contractors and services providers;

         -        the initial rejection of leases of dark stores;

         -        the continuation of utility services during the pendency of
                  the Chapter 11 Cases;

                                       17
<PAGE>

         -        the payment of certain prepetition tax claims; and

         -        the joint administration of each of the Debtors' bankruptcy
                  cases.

         2. Appointment of Statutory Committees.

         On January 31, 2002, the Office of the United States Trustee for the
Northern District of Illinois (Eastern Division) (the "United States Trustee")
appointed, pursuant to Section 1102 of the Bankruptcy Code, an Official
Creditors' Committee (the "Creditors' Committee"), which is generally comprised
of trade vendors and other general unsecured creditors, and an Official
Financial Institutions' Committee, which is generally comprised of certain of
the Debtors' Prepetition Lenders and holders of other unsecured notes.

         The following creditors were selected from the trade vendors and other
general unsecured creditors as members of the Creditors' Committee: (i) American
Greetings Corp.; (ii) Bridgeford Food of Illinois Corp.; (iii) Buena Vista Home
Video; (iv) Euler American Credit Indemnity Company; (v) Fuji Photo Film U.S.A.,
Inc.; (vi) GMAC Commercial Credit Corp.; (vii) Kimco Realty Corporation; (viii)
Mattel, Inc.; (ix) Newell Rubbermaid, Inc.; (x) the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation; (xi) PepsiCo, Inc.; (xii) Sara Lee Corporation; (xiii) Twentieth
Century Fox Home Entertainment, Inc. Newell Rubbermaid resigned on October 9,
2002, and was replaced by The Gillett Company.

         The Creditors' Committee is represented by Otterbourg, Steindler,
Houston & Rosen, P.C., whose office is located in New York, New York. Co-Counsel
to the Creditors' Committee is the law firm of Winston & Strawn of Chicago,
Illinois. The Creditors' Committee's financial advisor is KMPG LLP.

         The following creditors were selected from the Prepetition Lenders and
noteholders as members of the Financial Institutions' Committee: (i) Bank of New
York; (ii) Credit Suisse First Boston; (iii) First Union National Bank; (iv)
Fleet National Bank; (v) HSBC Bank USA; (vi) JP Morgan Chase Bank; and (vii)
Wilmington Trust Company. On March 21, 2002, HSBC Bank USA resigned from the
Financial Institutions' Committee. On July 10, 2002, Wachovia Bank National
Association (f/k/a First Union National Bank) and Credit Suisse First Boston
resigned from the Financial Institutions' Committee and Comerica Bank was
appointed as a member of the Financial Institutions' Committee. On September 11,
2002, Third Avenue Value Fund and ESL Investments, Inc. were each appointed
members of the Financial Institutions' Committee. Comerica Bank thereafter
resigned.

         The Financial Institutions' Committee is represented by Jones, Day,
Reavis & Pogue, whose offices involved in this case are located in Cleveland,
Ohio and Chicago, Illinois. The Financial Institutions' Committee's financial
advisor is FTC Consulting, Inc.

         On June 17, 2002, the United States Trustee appointed an Official
Committee of Equity Holders (the "Equity Committee") pursuant to Section 1102 of
the Bankruptcy Code to represent the interests of all equity holders in these
cases. The following equity holders were selected to serve as members of the
Equity Committee: (i) Frank J. Howylak; (ii) Gerald J. Switzer; (iii) Paul Naz;
(iv) Peter Eide; (v) Trevor Stores, Inc.; (vi) Softbank Technology Ventures; and
(vii) The Yucaipa Companies, LLC. On January 17, 2003, The Yucaipa Companies
resigned from the Equity Committee.



                                       18
<PAGE>

         The Equity Committee originally was represented by Traub, Bonacquist &
Fox, LLP in New York, New York. Co-Counsel to the Equity Committee is the law
firm of Goldberg, Kohn, Bell, Black, Rosenbloom & Moritz, Ltd. of Chicago,
Illinois. The Equity Committee's financial advisor was Saybrook Restructuring
Advisors. On January 20, 2003, Traub, Bonacquist and Saybrook resigned as
counsel and financial advisor, respectively, to the Equity Committee.

D. POST-PETITION FINANCING

         On January 25, 2002, the Debtors obtained interim approval from the
Bankruptcy Court for $1.15 billion of a $2 billion Revolving Credit and Guaranty
Agreement facility (the "DIP Facility") with JPMorgan Chase Bank as
administrative agent, collateral agent and co-collateral monitor, J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. as co-lead arranger and joint bookrunner, Fleet Securities, Inc.
as co-lead arranger and joint bookrunner, Fleet Retail Finance Inc. as
co-collateral monitor and documentation agent, General Electric Capital
Corporation as co-syndication agent and co-collateral monitor, and Credit Suisse
First Boston, Cayman Islands Branch, as co-syndication agent. Under the terms of
the DIP Facility, the lenders party to the DIP Facility agreed to provide
financing to the Debtors in an amount up to $2 billion, subject to borrowing
base and other limitations. A final order with respect to the DIP Facility was
approved by the Bankruptcy Court on March 6, 2002.

         The Debtors sought approval of the DIP Facility to ensure necessary
liquidity during the Chapter 11 Cases. The DIP Facility allowed the Debtors to
pay permitted prepetition claims, fulfill working capital needs, obtain letters
of credit, and pay for other general corporate matters. The funds available
under the DIP Facility also provided comfort to vendors and resulted in the
Debtors generally being able to obtain goods and services on the same terms as
prior to filing the Chapter 11 Cases. Specifically, the DIP Facility provided
the necessary security to the Debtors' vendors so that they would continue to do
business with the Debtors, thereby minimizing the harm to the Debtors'
businesses as the Debtors pursued their reorganization efforts. The DIP Facility
requires that the Debtors maintain certain financial covenants and restricts
liens, indebtedness, capital expenditures, dividend payments, and sales of
assets.

         On August 29, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court approved an amendment to the
DIP Facility negotiated between the Debtors and the lenders parties to the DIP
Facility. The amendment to the DIP Facility modified certain financial covenants
in order to provide additional flexibility under the financial covenants
contained therein that require certain minimum levels of cumulative earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other charges.

         On January __ 2003, the Bankruptcy Court approved a further amendment
to the DIP Facility. This second amendment further modified the financial
covenants related to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization, and other charges, and also modified other covenants to allow
closures of certain stores. Other modifications related to borrowing base
calculations and authorized use of proceeds from asset sales.

E. OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE CHAPTER 11 CASES

         1. Vendor Relations.

         Since the Petition Date, the Debtors have attempted to maintain and
improve their relationships with vendors (i) to ensure an uninterrupted supply
of goods for their retail stores and (ii) to rebuild and maintain sufficient
levels of trade credit. These efforts largely were made informally through
business contacts and have continued throughout the Chapter 11 Cases. In
addition, efforts were made to address specific issues relating to certain
groups of vendors.

                  (a) Reclamation Claims Program.

         Shortly before and after the Petition Date, a significant number of the
Debtors' vendors and factors asserted demands, pursuant to section 2-702 of the
Uniform Commercial Code and section 546(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (the
"Reclamation Claims"). Reclamation Claims were asserted by 693 entities in the
total face amount of $274.7 million. Certain vendors and factors indicated that
resolution of their Reclamation Claims would be critical to their ongoing
business relationships with the Debtors, including the provision of trade
credit. Thus, if unresolved, the Reclamation Claims posed a significant threat
to the Debtors' businesses and potentially represented a source of significant
and costly litigation.

         To address these concerns, the Debtors sought approval of a
comprehensive program to reconcile, resolve consensually, and satisfy the
Reclamation Claims asserted against their estates. By final order dated February
27, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court established a streamlined procedure for
reconciling Reclamation Claims. In addition, by order dated September 25, 2002,
the Bankruptcy Court approved a process for payment of valid Reclamation Claims
by the voluntary election of the reclamation claimant of either (a) payment of
75% of the allowed Reclamation Claim during the 2002 holiday season, subject to
agreement of certain terms, including the reclamation claimant's agreement to
provide historical trade terms, or (b) payment of 100% of the allowed
Reclamation Claim upon the Debtors' emergence from Chapter 11.

         As of December 17, 2002 the Debtors have settled 680 of the 693
entities' Reclamation Claims for a total of approximately $122.2 million. One
hundred sixty-four reclamation claimants requested to participate in the early
payment plan, resulting in a savings to the Debtors of approximately $5.1
million.

                  (b) Return to Vendor Program.

         As of the Petition Date, the Debtors' stores were stocked with seasonal
merchandise. Additionally, prior to the Petition Date, the Debtors had received
certain defective merchandise. Under established industry practice, as well as
the Debtors' agreements with their vendors, these items typically would be
subject to return to vendors in exchange for a credit equal to the Debtors'
invoiced cost for the merchandise. At the outset of the Chapter 11 Cases, the
Debtors determined that their ability to continue making such returns of
prepetition merchandise was critical to their successful operations. Among other
things, such returns would permit the Debtors to (a) balance their inventory
stocks, (b) dispose of merchandise that was unsaleable or had substantially
diminished value, (c) replace merchandise with current, more saleable
merchandise, and (d) normalize the Debtors' trade terms with vendors.


                                       20
<PAGE>

         To accomplish these critical goals, the Debtors sought approval of a
voluntary program, pursuant to Section 546(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, to return
to their vendors seasonal, slow-moving, unsaleable or defective merchandise in
accordance with existing policies and practices in exchange for a full credit
against the vendors' prepetition claims at the invoiced cost. The voluntary
program gave vendors 20 days to decide whether to participate in the program,
which participation was subject to a vendor's agreement to postpetition trade
terms agreeable to the Debtors. In addition, for goods received prepetition to
qualify for the program, they must have (a) been originally shipped to Kmart on
credit, and (b) not have been paid for by Kmart. The amount of goods returned to
a vendor could not exceed the amount of goods of the same type shipped by the
vendor prepetition to Kmart that were in Kmart's possession on the Petition
Date. Where the invoiced cost of returned merchandise exceeded the amount of the
vendors' prepetition claims, the Debtors' program provided that the excess
amount would be applied first against the vendors' postpetition claims and,
second, the excess would be returned as a cash refund. This program was approved
by the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to an order dated February 13, 2002. As of
December 16, 2002, 2,364 vendors agreed to participate in the program, resulting
in $142.8 million worth of goods being returned to vendors by the Debtors.

                  (c) Consignment Vendor Program and Related Matters.

         A significant portion of the items that the Debtors sell in their
retail stores is comprised of goods delivered to the Debtors on consignment.
Prior to the Petition Date, consigned goods were delivered to the Debtors for
resale by a number of consignment vendors who provide various goods to Kmart
stores, including jewelry, videos, CDs, DVDs, vacuum cleaners, car care
products, health care products, and a host of other seasonal items such as sun
glasses, sprinklers and electric blankets. Many of the Debtors' consignment
vendors depend upon their business with the Debtors, including timely remittance
of sales proceeds, to sustain their operations. Likewise, the Debtors depend
upon the availability of consigned goods on favorable trade terms in order to
offer the fullest range of retail goods to their customers. Accordingly, on
January 22, 2002, the Debtors filed a motion seeking authority to pay
prepetition claims of consignment vendors in the ordinary course of business and
approval of other procedures concerning consigned goods (the "Consignment
Motion").

         Pursuant to the Consignment Motion, the Debtors requested that they be
permitted to continue to accept consigned goods from any consignment vendor
operating under a consignment agreement with the Debtors and to continue to pay
such consignment vendor in the ordinary course of the Debtors' business. In
addition, to the extent that the consignment vendors agreed to continue to
provide consigned goods to the Debtors under ordinary and customary trade terms,
the Debtors requested authority to pay such consignment vendors in the ordinary
course, including those consigned goods ordered and delivered, but not paid for,
prepetition.

         On January 25, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court entered an interim order (the
"Interim Consignment Order") approving the Consignment Motion. Pursuant to the
terms of the Interim Consignment Order, the Debtors made a payment of $25
million to Universal Music and Video Distribution Company ("Universal") and
payments to a limited number of other consignment vendors. Thereafter, the
Creditors' Committee and the Financial Institutions' Committee filed objections
to the application of the Interim Consignment Order to unperfected consignment
vendors, including Universal. After lengthy negotiations, however, the parties
were able to resolve their issues surrounding the payment to Universal. On
October 3, 2002, the Debtors filed a motion to approve a settlement agreement
with Universal. As part of the settlement agreement, Universal retained the
payment, applied the payment to its prepetition consignment claim, and
effectively waived the balance of its remaining consignment



                                       21
<PAGE>

claim. As of the date of this Disclosure Statement, the objections of the
Creditors' Committee and the Financial Institutions' Committee to further
payments under the Interim Consignment Order have been continued and no payments
are being made on these claims.

         Similarly, Kmart sought approval to assume modified consignment
agreements with two of its key jewelry consignment vendors, M. Fabrikant & Sons,
Inc. and Samuel Aaron International, Inc. Although the Financial Institutions'
Committee initially objected to the proposed assumption, an agreed order was
eventually entered by the Bankruptcy Court after these vendors agreed to provide
further concessions to the estates, including significant reductions in their
prepetition consignment claims.

         In addition to the Consignment Order, the Debtors undertook other
actions during the Chapter 11 Cases to cement relationships with certain key
consignment vendors. For instance, Cardinal Health, Inc. provides to Kmart
stores substantially all prescription pharmaceutical and related products,
except for those Kmart stores located in Puerto Rico. Sales of these products
generated revenues of approximately $3 billion for the fiscal year ended January
2002. During the Chapter 11 Cases, Kmart and Cardinal agreed to modify the
parties' consignment arrangement to ensure Kmart's continued receipt of
pharmaceutical goods on consignment. Kmart obtained significant price and
related concessions as a result of this modification. The Bankruptcy Court
approved Kmart's assumption of this modified agreement on October 30, 2002.

                  (d) Vendor Lien Program.

         At the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, continued, immediate trade
support from Kmart's vendors was a key element to the Debtors' efforts to
successfully reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly,
Kmart prepared and sought approval of a trade vendor lien program (the "Trade
Vendor Lien Program") pursuant to which Kmart would grant to certain approved
trade creditors ("Approved Trade Creditors") liens on Kmart's merchandise junior
to the liens of the lenders under the DIP Facility on the same merchandise.
Approved Trade Creditor status was generally afforded to any vendor that (a) was
an authorized vendor of Kmart, (b) agreed to continue customary trade terms with
Kmart, (c) agreed to continue to participate in Kmart's electronic data
interchange program, (d) agreed to comply with Kmart's code of business conduct,
and (e) agreed not to restrict business operations with Kmart's subsidiaries or
international operations. The Trade Vendor Lien Program was approved by the
Bankruptcy Court on March 6, 2002. As of March 22, 2002, approximately 841 of
Kmart's vendors applied for the Trade Vendor Lien Program, of which 747 have
been approved.

                  (e) Critical Vendor Program.

         The Debtors determined at the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases that
their operations would have been critically jeopardized without a continuous
supply of new merchandise and services provided by a certain, select group of
vendors that are essential to the uninterrupted functioning of the Debtors'
business operations (the "Critical Vendors"). Specifically, the Debtors
determined that several categories of such Vendors were critical to their
reorganization efforts: (i) Fleming Companies, Inc. ("Fleming"), (ii) Handleman
Company ("Handleman"), (iii) egg and dairy suppliers (the "Egg and Dairy
Vendors"), (iv) newspapers, printers, paper suppliers, and other vendors who
supply goods and services related to Kmart's advertising program (the
"Advertisers"), (v) foreign vendors, (vi) certain letter of credit issuers, and
(vii) liquor vendors. The Critical Vendors' importance to the Debtors derived
from many factors. Often, these vendors are the only source from which the
Debtors can procure certain



                                       22
<PAGE>

goods or services. In addition, some of these Vendors provide not only
merchandise but also indispensable infrastructure and support to certain of the
Debtors' store operations. Accordingly, the Debtors filed a motion seeking
authority to pay prepetition claims of the Critical Vendors (the "Critical
Vendors Motion"), which the Bankruptcy Court granted on January 25, 2002.

                           (i) Fleming

         Fleming is Kmart's largest supplier and distributes substantially all
food and consumables to Kmart. Sales of Fleming products accounted for 11% (or
$4.2 billion) of the Debtors' total annual sales as of the Petition Date.
Fleming was owed approximately $76 million as of the Petition Date, or 1.8% of
Kmart's annual sales of Fleming products. Kmart has made total payments to
Fleming of approximately $76 million on account of Fleming's pre-petition claim.

                           (ii) Handleman

         Handleman is Kmart's sole music vendor, accounting for 1.5% (or $500
million) of the Debtors' total annual sales as of the Petition Date. Handleman
furnishes the infrastructure for Kmart's music department. It places
geographically-sensitive merchandise orders for stores, stocks shelves, sets up
displays for new music releases, and operates the merchandise return process.
Handleman was owed approximately $64 million as of the Petition Date. Kmart has
made payments of $49 million to Handelman on account of Handelman's pre-petition
claim.

                           (iii) Egg and Dairy Vendors

         Certain food items like eggs and dairy products drive the whole
"frequency" component of Kmart's business: approximately 8% of all Kmart
shoppers purchase this merchandise category on a given shopping trip to Kmart's
stores. Egg and dairy sales account for approximately $160 million of total
sales by Kmart on an annual basis. Without these items, shoppers would likely
not choose Kmart for their daily shopping needs. Egg and Dairy Vendors are
generally small, and Kmart's failure to pay these vendors could have threatened
their very existence. Kmart estimated that, as of the Petition Date, the Egg and
Dairy Vendors collectively were owed approximately $6.8 million. Kmart has made
total payments of approximately $5.2 million to Egg and Dairy Vendors on account
of their pre-petition claims.

                           (iv) Advertisers

         Much of Kmart's sales volume is driven by its weekly advertising
circular program, which prints approximately 78 million circulars each week and
distributes them nationally via newspapers to Kmart's markets. As of the
Petition Date, advertised items accounted for approximately 30% (or $11 billion)
of Kmart's annual sales. Without this in-place advertising program continuing,
Kmart's overall business could have been severely jeopardized. Kmart has made
total payments of approximately $133.4 million to Advertisers on account of
their prepetition claims.

                           (v) Foreign Vendors

         The Debtors imported approximately $2.2 billion of merchandise from
foreign vendors (the "Foreign Vendors") in 2001. Foreign Vendors provide the
Debtors with their key product offerings that are among the most profitable of
the Debtors' offerings, such as Martha Stewart, Jaclyn Smith, Kathy



                                       23

Ireland, Joe Boxer and Sesame Street. Many of these goods were in transit as of
the Petition Date and could not readily be obtained from other sources.

         As the Debtors prepared to file these Chapter 11 cases, they were
concerned that, despite the automatic stay, Foreign Vendors might not agree that
they would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and might
withhold goods or initiate foreign actions to collect on the Debtors' unpaid
obligations. Additionally, the Debtors determined that if they did not remain
current on their foreign obligations, they would face the risk that the Foreign
Vendors, including foreign taxing and licensing authorities, might seize or
impound assets within their respective jurisdictions and seek to invoke civil or
criminal penalties against the Debtors and their local employees and agents.
Accordingly, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Debtors' request to pay the
pre-petition claims of Foreign Vendors. Pursuant to the terms of the order, the
Debtors made payments of approximately $16.8 million to Foreign Vendors.

                           (vi) Letters of Credit

         Payment for much of the merchandise ordered from the Foreign Vendors is
arranged through the issuance of documentary letters of credit in favor of the
Foreign Vendors. Under this practice, the Debtors generally order goods from a
Foreign Vendor pursuant to a letter of credit issued by a bank. The Foreign
Vendor then presents the Debtors' purchase order and the Foreign Vendor's
invoice along with the ordered goods to the issuing bank (the "Issuer"). If the
goods conform to the purchase order and the invoice, the Issuer pays the Foreign
Vendor pursuant to the letter of credit agreement and the Debtors reimburse the
Issuer. As of the Petition Date, there were approximately 1,500 outstanding
letters of credit with a face value of approximately $190 million. In addition,
as of the Petition Date, the Debtors had not been able to pay the reimbursement
obligations to the Issuers in the amount of $6 million. In order to prevent any
delay by Issuers in honoring the documentary letters of credit and to avoid
shipping delays and garner support for the Foreign Vendor letter of Credit
program, the Debtors sought Bankruptcy Court approval to pay the $6 million
reimbursement obligation. On February 13, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court entered an
order authorizing the Debtors to pay this amount.

                           (vii) Liquor Vendors

          Liquor is sold in most of Kmart's stores and is an integral component
of the Debtors' inventory mix. Inasmuch as liquor is a high-turnover item having
great popularity and customer draw, the Debtors determined that the elimination
of liquor sales would result in the loss of customers to the Debtors'
competitors who sell liquor. After the Petition Date, approximately 100 liquor
vendors, suppliers and wholesalers (the "Liquor Vendors") informed the Debtors
that certain state statutes and regulations relating to licensing of Liquor
Vendors prohibited them from extending credit on unpaid balances for the sale of
liquor. Accordingly, on February 13, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order
authorizing the Debtors to pay the prepetition claims of Liquor Vendors.
Pursuant to the terms of the order, the Debtors made payments of approximately
$2.0 million to Liquor Vendors.

         2. Real Property and Related Matters.

                  (a) Extension of Time to Assume or Reject Unexpired Leases.

         Pursuant to a Bankruptcy Court order dated April 15, 2002, the
Bankruptcy Code Section 365(d)(4) deadline for assuming or rejecting the
majority of the Debtors' unexpired leases of nonresidential real property is the
earlier of confirmation of a plan of reorganization or July 31, 2003. For
certain other leases of nonresidential real property, the Debtors and the
landlords for such properties agreed to March 31, 2003 as the deadline for the
Debtors to assume or reject such leases, with certain landlords receiving
holiday protection in the form of the Debtors' agreement not to reject stores
between October 2002 through January 15, 2003. With respect to a handful of the
Debtors' leases, the Debtors and the landlords for those leases agreed to
various other deadlines for the Debtors to assume or reject such leases. The
Debtors will file a motion requesting extension of the deadline through the
Effective Date of the Plan.

                  (b) Rationalization of Store Base and Distribution Centers.

         Prior to commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors engaged
Rockwood Gemini Advisors ("Rockwood") as real estate advisor to assist the
Debtors in analyzing and evaluating the Debtors' real estate properties,
including leases and owned real estate, on a global basis. The Bankruptcy Court
approved the retention of Rockwood on February 13, 2002. In addition, the
Debtors retained Abacus Advisory & Consulting Corp., LLC ("Abacus") as inventory
valuation consultant for the Debtors to assist the Debtors with the liquidation
of the inventory at a number of their stores. The Debtors' retention of Abacus
was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on by order entered on March 8, 2002.

         Thereafter, the Debtors, with the assistance of Miller Buckfire Lewis,
analyzed various aspects of the financial performance of all of their retail
store locations and certain other real properties. As a result of this review,
the Debtors decided to seek Bankruptcy Court approval on March 20, 2002 to close
283 stores in 40 states and Puerto Rico. The Debtors sought to close these
stores due to their diminishing profitability, because the stores were becoming
a cash drain on the Debtors, and because their performance was substantially
undercutting the overall performance of the Kmart stores. The decision to close
these stores was based on these financial considerations, and not on any
strategic considerations pertaining to the Debtors' operating plan.

         In furtherance of their store closing efforts, the Debtors sought
approval from the Bankruptcy Court to conduct store closing sales at each of
these closed stores. On March 20, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court approved an order
authorizing Kmart to close these stores and conduct store closing sales at each
of these locations. To assist in the process of closing the stores, the Debtors,
with the assistance of Abacus, negotiated and entered into an agency agreement
with a joint venture comprised of SB Capital Group, LLC, The Nassi Group, LLC,
The Ozer Group, LLC, Buxbaum Group, Gordon Brothers Retail Partners, LLC, Hilco
Merchant Resources, LLC and Great American Group to assist with the conduct of
the store closing sales. By order dated March 20, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court
approved the agency agreement with the joint venture group. The liquidation of
the Debtors' inventory at the 283 closing stores was completed by June 2002. The
Debtors received approximately $633 million in net proceeds
from the store closing sales and from discontinued merchandise that was
transferred to the closing stores for liquidation.



                                       25
<PAGE>

         After the 2002 holiday season, the Debtors, again with the assistance
of Miller Buckfire Lewis, analyzed the financial performance of all of their
other retail store locations. As a result of this review, the Debtors decided to
seek Bankruptcy Court approval to close up to an additional 326 stores in 44
states (with a possible reduction in the total number of such stores to 322). As
with the initial set of store closings, the Debtors sought to close these
additional stores due to their diminishing profitability, because the stores
were becoming a cash drain on the Debtors, because their performance was
substantially undercutting the overall performance of the Kmart stores, and
because these stores did not fit into the Debtors' long-term strategic operating
plan. Unlike the initial set of store closings, however, the Debtors based their
decision to close these stores primarily on strategic considerations, including
an analysis of the competitive environment in local and regional markets,
distance from distribution centers, and the location and number of other Kmart
stores in the market. These store closures completed the strategic review of the
company's store base and distribution centers, which Kmart has previously said
it would undertake prior to emergence from Chapter 11.

         In furtherance of these additional store closing efforts, the Debtors
have sought approval from the Bankruptcy Court to conduct store closing sales
for this set of stores. To assist in the process of closing these stores, the
Debtors negotiated and entered into an operating and monitoring agreement with
Abacus, with additional agents to be designated by Abacus. The Debtors
anticipate that the liquidation of the Debtors' inventory at the stores will be
completed by April 2003. Such amounts will be used to fund certain amounts under
the Plan and for general corporate purposes.

         In light of the store closings in 2002 and the contemplated store
closings discussed above, Kmart is discussing with Fleming, its largest supplier
and the distributer of substantially all food and consumables to Kmart,
necessary modifications to their supply relationship which reflect the
rationalization of Kmart's store base and distribution centers. These
discussions include the modification and assumption of the existing supply
agreement or the rejection of the agreement.

                  (c) Disposition of Closed Stores.

         In order to maximize the value of the stores closed in early 2002 and
other real estate related assets, the Debtors engaged the joint venture of DJM
Asset Management, LLC and ChainLinks Retail Advisors, Inc. as the Debtors'
broker and disposition consultant for the purpose of marketing and selling
leases, fees and other real estate ownership interests of the Debtors. The
Bankruptcy Court approved the brokers' retention on April 24, 2002.

         Concurrently with the liquidation of their inventory at the first set
of closing store locations, the Debtors commenced preparation for the
disposition of their real estate holdings for these stores. To that end, the
Debtors devised a strategy to maximize recoveries from these assets while
minimizing potentially substantial administrative rent charges that would be
incurred following the completion of the store closing sales. On April 15, 2002,
the Debtors therefore filed with the Bankruptcy Court a real estate disposition
motion that set forth disposition procedures for the sale of the exclusive
rights to find buyers for the Debtors' real property interests in the closed
stores, which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on May 10, 2002.

         Thereafter, certain of the Debtors entered into several Asset Purchase
and Designation Rights Agreements (the "Agreements") with Kimco Realty
Corporation, Schottenstein Stores Corporation, Klaff Realty, LP, and other
purchasers (the "Purchasers"). Under the terms of the Agreements, Kmart agreed
to sell to the Purchasers the designation rights with respect to 56 leaseholds
for closed stores and



                                       26
<PAGE>

such Debtors' interest in the leasehold for one closed store, the Purchaser of
which defaulted under its Agreement and the lease was rejected. During the
designation period (as defined under the Agreements,) the Purchasers of the
designation rights have the sole, exclusive, and continuing right to select,
identify, and designate (i) which leases shall be assumed and assigned (and if
assigned, to whom) or terminated, and (ii) which properties shall be excluded
from the transaction.

         In consideration for the designation rights acquisitions, the
Purchasers agreed to pay $46 million, all of which was paid by December 31,
2002. The Purchasers are responsible for paying all carrying costs related to
such properties during the designation period in accordance with the Agreements.
In addition, the Debtors may be entitled to additional proceeds in the event
that designation rights transactions exceed a specified level of proceeds.

         As explained above, certain Debtors own the real estate and inventory
at the closing stores. These assets will not revest in the Debtors after the
Effective Date and will remain in the applicable Estates so that the closing
store real estate and inventory may be disposed of consistent with procedures
approved by the Bankruptcy Court relating to sales of owned assets and
assignments of real property leases. The proceeds from disposition of the
closing store real estate, fixtures, furniture, equipment and inventory will be
contributed to the Reorganized Debtors and utilized consistent with the Plan.
Upon final disposition of such assets, the estates will be closed.

                  (d) Significant Real Estate Rulings.

         During the course of these Chapter 11 Cases, the Bankruptcy Court
issued significant rulings with respect to four real estate matters: (i) payment
of real estate taxes that accrued prepetition yet came due postpetition; (ii)
enforcement of "go-dark" lease provisions; (iii) attempts by landlords to
require the Debtors to establish escrow accounts for postpetition real estate
taxes not yet due and/or procure liability insurance; and (iv) payment of
percentage rent obligations that accrued prepetition yet came due postpetition.

                           (i) Accrued Real Estate Taxes

         During these Chapter 11 Cases, many landlords filed motions seeking to
compel the Debtors to pay real estate taxes that accrued pre-petition but came
due post-petition, notwithstanding well-settled law in the Seventh Circuit in In
re Handy Andy Home Improvement Centers, Inc., 144 F.3d 1125, 1127-28 (7th Cir.
1998), that such taxes constitute prepetition claims and are not postpetition
obligations. On July 24, 2002, the Court denied a motion filed by a landlord
seeking to compel the Debtors to pay real estate taxes that accrued pre-petition
but were billed post-petition. In denying this motion, the Court concluded that
"the amount [of real estate taxes] due and owing [by the Debtors] is that amount
between the petition date and the date of rejection irrespective of what the
lease may provide." The Bankruptcy Court denied similar requests made by several
other landlords. One such landlord is seeking reconsideration of the Court's
ruling. The Court's ruling is significant in that Kmart has deferred pre-
petition tax obligations while restructuring its affairs in accordance with
established Seventh Circuit precedent.

                           (ii) Enforcement of "Go-Dark" Lease Provisions

         Many of Kmart's store leases contain so-called "go-dark" provisions
that permit a landlord to terminate the lease upon Kmart's decision to
discontinue operations at such store. After the Debtors



                                       27
<PAGE>

commenced their store closing efforts in March 2002, several landlords filed
motions seeking to modify the automatic stay in order to exercise these
"go-dark" provisions. The Bankruptcy Court has ruled on several of these
requests, denying each and every one. In so ruling, the Court held that such a
provision is "a de facto restriction on assignment" and unenforceable during the
Debtors' bankruptcy. The Court also held, in the context of leases, the
designation rights of which have been sold to designation rights purchasers who
often must cease store operations while finding a suitable tenant, that the
"go-dark" provision was an unenforceable restraint on alienation under the
Bankruptcy Code because (i) the assignment depended on the suspension of the
"go-dark" provision until the end-user re-opened a store on the premises, and
(ii) the enforcement of the "go-dark" provision would prevent the Debtors from
realizing the full value of the lease. Certain of these rulings are on appeal.

                           (iii) Tax Escrows/Insurance Procurement

         During these Chapter 11 cases, many landlords filed motions seeking to
compel the Debtors to procure liability insurance and/or establish escrow
accounts for estimated, post-petition real estate taxes not yet due. With
respect to the requests that the Debtors procure insurance, the landlords'
leases generally authorize the Debtors to self-insure if their book net worth
exceeds $100 million. All of the Debtors' public filings reflected a positive
net worth exceeding $2.6 billion at the time these motions were filed. As for
the landlords' requests that the Debtors establish real estate tax escrows, none
of the Debtors' leases with these landlords contained provisions requiring such
escrows.

         Had these landlord's requests been granted, the impact on the Debtors'
cashflows would have been significant. On August 29, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court
denied the requests. The Court found that the Debtors' net worth far exceeded
the thresholds established in the leases authorizing the Debtors to self-insure.
With respect to the requests for tax escrows, the Court found that none of these
landlords' leases provided for tax escrows and that the Debtors were current on
their post-petition real estate tax obligations to these landlords. Several of
these landlords have appealed the Court's rulings.

                           (iv) Percentage Rent

         Three landlords filed motions to compel the Debtors to pay, as a
postpetition obligation under Section 365(d)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code,
percentage rent that accrued prepetition but came due postpetition. At the time
of the filing of these motions, the Debtors determined such percentage rent
obligations by allocating a portion of the total percentage rent to the
postpetition period based on the number of postpetition days (the "Accrual
Method"). In contrast, these landlords took the position that where the
percentage rent accrued both prepetition and postpetition but came due
postpetition, the entire year's percentage rent is a postpetition expense (the
"Billing Date Method"). A third approach adopted by courts in determining such
percentage rent obligations is to presume that percentage rent obligations begin
to arise only after the existing obligation to pay percentage rent first becomes
fixed - that is, after a "breakpoint" is reached and the obligation is no longer
contingent (the "Breakpoint Method").

         On September 25, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling on the
motions regarding the proper method of allocating percentage rent between the
pre-petition and post-petition periods. In that ruling, the Court adopted the
Breakpoint Method. Under the Court's ruling, if the breakpoint under a lease is
exceeded after the Petition Date, all percentage rent owing under the lease is
recoverable under Section 365(d)(3). If the breakpoint is exceeded prior to the
Petition Date and the lease ends after the Petition Date, only the percentage
rent from sales subsequent to the Petition Date is recoverable under Section
365(d)(3). Immediately after the Court's announcement of its ruling, the Debtors
began



                                       28
<PAGE>

implementing procedures for calculating and making payments to landlords
consistent with the Court's ruling. As of January 21, 2003, the Debtors believe
that all payments due and owing to landlords on account of post-petition
percentage rent have been made in accordance with the Court's ruling.

                  (e) Other Lease and Real Property Dispositions.

         During the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors, with the assistance of their
advisors, disposed of a number of real estate leases through other transactions.
For instance, the Debtors (i) assumed and assigned leases to third parties for
various forms of consideration, including assumption of cure costs and cash
payments; (ii) terminated other leases pursuant to the agreement of the affected
landlords and/or subtenants; and (iii) rejected other leases that the Debtors
determined had no value to the estates.

         3. Key License Agreements.

         As explained above, the Debtors believe that focusing their
merchandising and marketing approach on quality name brands builds customer
loyalty and increases shopping frequency. A key component of Kmart's strategy
therefore is its investment in merchandising and marketing initiatives that
enhance its strategic position through exclusive brands that differentiate Kmart
from its competitors, including its license agreements with Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia, Inc. for Martha Stewart Everyday home, garden, housewares and
seasonal products; Jaclyn Smith G.H. Production, Inc. for Jaclyn Smith women's
apparel, jewelry and accessories; Kathy Ireland World Wide, Inc. for Kathy
Ireland women's apparel, accessories and exercise equipment; Disney Enterprises,
Inc. for Disney apparel for infants and children; Sesame Workshop for Sesame
Street apparel for infants and children; Joe Boxer Licensing, LLC for Joe Boxer
apparel, accessories and home furnishings; Route 66, L.P. for Route 66 apparel
and accessories; Avmark, Inc. for Curtis Mathes consumer video, audio and
telecommunications products; and T Enterprises, LLC for the right to utilize the
name, likeness, and signature of Ariadna Sodi Miranda, professionally known as
Thalia.

         Kmart believes that each of these brands fills a niche in Kmart's brand
portfolio and is critical to maintaining its customer base and attracting new
shoppers to Kmart stores. Also, Kmart believes that the combination of the
profit realized from the sale of the products with these national brands and the
continued association of quality products with Kmart will enhance the success of
the Debtors' reorganization. During the Chapter 11 Cases, Kmart therefore
received Court approval to assume and/or enter into these license agreements and
therefore continue its relationships with these key brand partners.

         4. Surety Bond Settlement.

         The Debtors conduct retail business in all fifty states and are subject
to numerous state regulations that require the Debtors to provide assurances to
state authorities of the Debtors' financial ability to meet their regulatory
obligations, including obligations relating to payment of workers' compensation
claims, utility charges, business licenses, and appeal and supersedeas bonds.
Most prominent among these is the requirement to post bonds in favor of state
authorities so that the Debtors can maintain their self-insured status under
state workers' compensation laws, and so that they can maintain various business
licenses and permits necessary to the Debtors' retail operations. Prepetition,
the Debtors sought and received financial accommodations from certain sureties
in the form of surety bonds in order to ensure compliance with these
state-mandated requirements. However, just prior to the Petition Date, and in
light of the commencement of the Debtors' Chapter 11 Cases, certain of those



                                       29
<PAGE>

sureties attempted to cancel their surety bonds, which could have jeopardized
the Debtors' ability to do business in a number of states.

         Rather than litigating the ability of the sureties to cancel their
respective surety bonds, the Debtors entered into a compromise and settlement
with the sureties whereby their prepetition financial accommodations would be
continued. Additionally, the sureties agreed to provide the Debtors with certain
additional postpetition financial accommodations in the form of new surety bonds
so that the Debtors' ability to conduct business would not be jeopardized. In
return, the Debtors issued letters of credit of $38.7 million in favor of the
sureties in order to secure certain obligations owed to the sureties related to
surety bonds, whether arising prepetition or postpetition. Any loss in excess of
the amount of the letters of credit will be treated as an unsecured claim to the
extent it relates to prepetition events and will be treated as an administrative
expense claim to the extent it relates to events occurring postpetition. This
compromise and settlement allowed the Debtors to save the estates tens of
millions of dollars that would otherwise have been incurred by the Debtors if
the Debtors were forced to obtain private insurance and replacement bonds and
avoided interruption of the Debtors' business operations.

         On March 5, 2002, as supplemented on March 18, 2002, the Debtors filed
a motion (the "Surety Bond Motion") to approve the settlement of surety-related
claims, authorizing the continuation of their surety program, approving an
extension of surety credit, granting liens and superpriority administrative
expense claims in favor of the sureties and related entities and seeking related
relief. On March 21, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court entered a final order approving
the relief sought in the Surety Bond Motion. This order is the subject of a
pending appeal by one of Kmart's general unsecured creditors.

         5. Omnibus Procedures.

                  (a) Resolution of Personal Injury Claims.

         On June 14, 2002, the Debtors filed a motion requesting approval of
procedures for (a) liquidating and settling certain specified personal injury
claims (the "Personal Injury Claims") through direct negotiation or alternative
dispute resolution and (b) modifying the automatic stay to the extent necessary
to allow orderly liquidation of the Personal Injury Claims. In so doing, the
Debtors sought to facilitate the efficient and inexpensive liquidation of the
Personal Injury Claims asserted against the Debtors prior to the Petition Date.
Such procedures are necessary in part because of the volume of such Claims. The
Debtors estimate that approximately 3,500 Personal Injury Claims were involved
in pending litigation as of the Petition Date, and that an additional 16,500
Personal Injury Claims had been asserted against the Debtors informally or in a
non-litigation fashion. On July 17, 2002, following requested amendments by the
Bankruptcy Court and negotiations with certain personal injury claimants, the
Bankruptcy Court approved the procedures for liquidating and settling Personal
Injury Claims.

         The procedures contain different resolution processes for various
Claims based on the estimated amount of such Claims. For instance, the
procedures include a cost-effective, streamlined, telephonic settlement
procedure for Personal Injury Claims that are estimated to be allowed in amounts
equal to $5,000 or less. Such Claims and certain larger Claims also are subject
to a settlement process involving written questionnaires, response statements,
and replies. Additionally, Claims in estimated amounts in excess of $50,000 are
subject to mediation and arbitration. To the extent Personal Injury Claims are
not resolved through these procedures, claimants will be entitled to
modification of the automatic stay so that their Claims may be resolved in
non-bankruptcy forums.




                                       30
<PAGE>
         Claims have been divided into four categories, based upon estimated
Claim amounts, for purposes of the foregoing procedures: (i) small claims as to
which the Debtors have reserved under $5,000; (ii) claims as to which the
Debtors have reserved between $5,001 and $50,000; (iii) claims over $50,001, and
(iv) judgment claims. The Debtors estimate that approximately 97% of all
Personal Injury Claims will be allowed in amounts equal to $50,000 or less.
Additionally, the Debtors estimate that approximately 80% of all such Claims
will be allowed in amounts equal to $5,000 or less.

         For settlement amounts of $50,000 or less, the Debtors are authorized
to settle Personal Injury Claims up to an aggregate cap of $50 million without
further order of the Court or notice to any parties. For settlement amounts in
excess of $50,000, the Debtors are authorized to settle Personal Injury Claims
without further court order upon ten days' notice to certain notice parties,
which include the Statutory Committees, the Debtors' post-petition lenders, the
United States Trustee, and any other party that requests notice in accordance
with the procedure. Each settling Claimant is deemed to hold an allowed,
pre-petition general unsecured non-priority claim in the settled amount, to be
paid in accordance with the Plan.

         The proofs of claim related to Personal Injury Claims filed in the
Chapter 11 Cases generally track the Debtors' expectations. As of January 3,
2003, a total of 7,778 timely proofs of claim have been filed. Of the proofs of
claim filed, 4,334 asserted amounts of $5,000 or less. A total of 3,406 proofs
of claim were filed asserting amounts in excess of $5,000. A total of 38 claims
were filed by judgment creditors. As of January 3, 2003, the Debtors had
resolved 1,404 of the 4,334 proofs of claim evidencing small Personal Injury
Claims for a total dollar amount of $2.4 million. That is an average of $1,733
each. Of the 3,406 Claims asserted in amounts greater than $5,000, the Debtors
had resolved a total of 591 as of January 3, 2003, for a total of $9 million, or
an average of approximately $15,363 per Claim.

         On December 19, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court established a supplemental
bar date of January 22, 2003 with respect to approximately 4,000 personal injury
and related claimants who were only recently identified and who therefore did
not receive notice of the Bar Date. As of January 15, 2003, a total of 204 of
such claimants had filed proofs of claim with the Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors
have begun efforts to resolve the personal injury claims asserted in these
proofs of claim consistent with the omnibus claims resolution procedures.

                  (b) Resolution of Mechanics' Lien Claims.

         As of June 6, 2002, the Debtors had received notices of 3,044
mechanics' lien claims (the "Mechanics Lien Claims") asserted against the
Debtors' leaseholds and other properties. Over 950 of the Debtors' operating
stores were affected by these Lien Claims, which could arguably have triggered
defaults under the Debtors' leases. Pursuant to the first day orders, the
Debtors were authorized to pay such Claims, but the volume of such Claims was
such that the Debtors needed a process for resolving them. Accordingly, the
Debtors devised detailed procedures for the orderly and efficient resolution of
Mechanics' Lien Claims. The Debtors thereafter filed a motion to establish
specific procedures for (a) liquidating and settling their Mechanics' Lien
Claims and (b) staying the enforcement of Mechanics' Lien Claims pending
resolution of disputed Claims to allow their orderly liquidation. After lengthy
negotiations with landlords about the terms of the procedures, on July 25, 2002,
the Bankruptcy Court approved the Debtors' proposed procedures.


                                       31
<PAGE>
         The Mechanics' Lien Claim resolution procedures provide that if the
Debtors dispute a Mechanics' Lien Claim, they can send a notice (the "Dispute
Notice") to such Claim holder indicating the Debtors' dispute and containing a
payment proposal to discharge the asserted lien. The service of the Dispute
Notice by the Debtors on the claimant stays the enforcement of the Mechanics'
Lien Claim and any default arising therefrom until further order from the
Bankruptcy Court with respect to the Debtors and their landlords. Within thirty
days of service of the Dispute Notice, the claimant is required to respond in
writing indicating acceptance, rejection, or disagreement with the Debtors'
proposal. The Debtors have sixty days thereafter to negotiate a settlement with
the claimant. If a Mechanics' Lien Claim is not resolved in that time period,
the Debtors are permitted to file an objection to such Claim with the Bankruptcy
Court and the dispute will be resolved by the Bankruptcy Court.

         As noted above, approximately 3,000 Mechanics' Lien Claims have been
filed against the Debtors' properties; the total amount of the Claims is
approximately $89.4 million. As of December 11, 2002, the Debtors had resolved
approximately 2,500 of the Mechanics' Lien Claims and had paid approximately $63
million to such claim holders. This represents a savings of approximately $25.5
million for the Debtors' estates with respect to the resolved Mechanics' Lien
Claims. The Debtors continue to use the Mechanics' Lien Claim resolution
procedures to resolve the remaining Mechanics' Lien Claims.

                  (c) Resolution of Prepetition Claims.

         On January 14, 2003, the Debtors filed a motion requesting authority
from the Bankruptcy Court to settle or compromise pre-petition claims, without
further Court approval, pursuant to a comprehensive claims resolution procedure.
On January __, 2003, the Court entered an order granting the motion (the "Claims
Resolution Order"). Pursuant to such Order, the Court established certain
parameters by which the Debtors may reconcile and resolve prepetition claims in
these Chapter 11 Cases. Specifically, the Claims Resolution Order authorizes the
Debtors to settle disputed claims where the amount in controversy is $1 million
or less, so long as the aggregate amount in controversy resolved under such
authority does not exceed $1 billion, and also includes a mechanism for
resolving other claims through mediation. Of the 44,935 proofs of claim filed in
these Chapter 11 Cases, a total of 17,917 of such claims differ from the amounts
shown in the Debtors' books and records by amounts that are less than $1
million. These claims account for approximately 40% of all proofs of claim filed
and 12% of the total dollar amount of all of the claims filed in these Chapter
11 Cases. This approved mechanism provides a cost effective means of resolving
the many thousands of smaller claims in these Cases, thereby avoiding the undue
burden on the Court and unnecessary drain on the time, funds, and other
resources of the Debtors and Reorganized Debtors that would be caused by
requiring the Debtors to file motions to approve each settlement individually.

                  (d) Resolution of De Minimis Controversies.

         On August 9, 2002, the Debtors filed a motion to authorize the Debtors
to compromise or settle certain classes of de minimis controversies that are
normal and expected in a business of the size of the Debtors. On August 29,
2002, the Bankruptcy Court approved procedures for the compromise and settlement
of (a) controversies where the amount originally claimed by the Debtors to be
due and owing to them is $2 million or less with respect to each matter or
related series of matters, (b) the final settlement of the controversy does not
exceed the sum of $2 million, and (c) the final settlement amounts of all
controversies outside the ordinary course does not exceed $75 million in the
aggregate.

                  (e) Sales of De Minimis Assets.

         On August 29, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court approved procedures by which
the Debtors were authorized to sell miscellaneous surplus, non-core assets from
time to time and pay applicable broker commissions in the ordinary course of
business in connection with such sales without further Court approval. Pursuant
to these procedures, the Debtors were authorized to consummate sales of real
property and personal property outside the ordinary course of business where the
purchase price was $2 million or less for each transaction or in the aggregate
for a related series of transactions, up to an aggregate amount of $75 million
in net sales proceeds.

         6. Employee Compensation Programs.

         Prior to the commencement of these Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors
constructed employee compensation programs (the "Compensation Programs")
designed to minimize management and other key employee turnover by providing
incentives for employees, including senior management, to remain in the Debtors'
employ and to maintain the value of the Debtors' estates during these
proceedings. Indeed, the Debtors' ability to maintain their business operations
and preserve value for their estates has been dependent upon the continued
employment, active participation, and dedication of the employees who possess
the knowledge, experience, and skills necessary to support the Debtors'
businesses. The Debtors and their financial and other advisors therefore
undertook a comprehensive analysis of their compensation systems and, as a
result, modified certain existing plans and developed and implemented new plans
designed to retain key employees. As a result of these efforts, the Debtors
sought and received authority from the Court to implement the following
Compensation Programs.

                  (a) The Key Employee Retention Program.

         The Debtors instituted a Key Employee Retention Program (the "KERP")
which was designed to reduce employee turnover and the loss of industry
knowledge. Approximately 8,000 employees are eligible to participate in the
KERP. The KERP assigns classes of employees to organizational tiers which
determine eligibility and vesting requirements for the various components of the
KERP. A summary of those organizational tiers, including the estimated number of
employees in each tier as of January 1, 2003, follows (although certain
employees in certain tiers are parties to employment agreements that contain
provisions related to incentives and/or severance compensation that effectively
supercede the KERP):

                           (1)      Chief Executive Officer ("Tier One") (one
                                    employee);

                           (2)      Executive Vice Presidents ("Tier Two")
                                    (three employees);

                           (3)      Senior Vice Presidents, Divisional
                                    Presidents, certain Vice Presidents, certain
                                    Divisional Vice Presidents and equivalents
                                    ("Tier Three") (22 employees);

                           (4)      Vice Presidents, Regional Vice Presidents,
                                    certain Divisional Vice Presidents and
                                    equivalents ("Tier Four") (99 employees);

                           (5)      Certain Divisional Vice Presidents,
                                    Directors, District Managers and equivalents
                                    ("Tier Five") (652 employees);





                                       33
<PAGE>
                           (6)      Corporate Managers (including, Pharmacy
                                    District Managers) and equivalents ("Tier
                                    Six") (1,551 employees);

                           (7)      Corporate/Distribution Center Salaried
                                    employees ("Tier Seven") (1,062 employees);

                           (8)      Store Managers ("Tier Eight") (1,745
                                    employees); and

                           (9)      Pharmacists/Pharmacy Managers ("Tier Nine")
                                    (2,710 employees).

                           (i) Corporate Annual Performance Plan.

         The purpose of the Corporate Annual Performance Plan was to focus
participant attention on the Debtors' financial turn around and business
improvement. Employees in Tiers One through Seven are eligible to participate in
the Corporate Annual Performance Plan. Performance is measured based on the
Debtors' financial performance for each fiscal year. Employees in the
above-referenced Tiers become vested on January 31 of each respective year.
Awards, when earned, are payable as soon as practicable following the filing of
Kmart's report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the
fiscal year.

                           (ii) Stay Bonus.

         The purpose of the Stay Bonus is to provide an incentive to key
employees to continue their employment with the Debtors during these Chapter 11
Cases. Employees in Tiers Three through Nine are eligible to participate in the
Stay Bonus. Progress payments are earned consistent with an established schedule
and conclude when the Debtors emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases. Employees
entitled to participate in the Stay Bonus received 30% of the Stay Bonus on
September 30, 2002, 20% of the Stay Bonus on January 1, 2003, and are entitled
to receive 20% of the Stay Bonus on the earlier of the Debtors' emergence from
Chapter 11 or June 30, 2003, with the remaining 30% of the Stay Bonus payable
upon emergence of the Debtors from Chapter 11. Employees who remain employed
with the Debtors throughout the measurement period and who attain at least a
"satisfactory" rating on their most recent performance evaluation are entitled
to the Stay Bonus amount for their respective tier.

                           (iii) Transition Payment Plan.

         The purpose of the Transition Payment Plan is to provide management
with a discretionary program to incentivize selected employees (whose positions
were and will be terminated after a date certain, but whose services were
required during a transition period) to remain employed with the Debtors
throughout a specified period. Payments have been and will be authorized for a
period of time beginning upon notification to such employees that their current
positions were terminated, and end upon the Debtors' termination of the
participant's employment other than for cause. To be eligible for the Transition
Payment Plan, employees have to remain employed with the Debtors and remain in
good standing throughout the measurement period. Eligible employees in Tiers
Five, Six and Seven are eligible to receive (in addition to base salary) one
week's base salary for each week worked during the transition period. Eligible
Employees in Tier Nine and other selected employees are eligible to receive (in
addition to base salary) one-half of one week's base salary for each week worked
during the transition period. Payments under the Transition Payment Plan vest
upon the earlier of termination, other than for cause, or completion of a
transition period.

<PAGE>
                           (iv) CEO Discretionary Pool.

         The purpose of the CEO Discretionary Pool is to provide protection for
the Debtors against unnecessary employee turnover. Any employee deemed to be at
risk for voluntary termination of employment with the Debtors, as identified by
management and approved as a participant by the chief executive officer of
Kmart, is eligible for participation in the CEO Discretionary Pool. The CEO
Discretionary Pool was established in the amount of $1.5 million; authorized
payment dates and payment amounts are determined by the chief executive officer
of Kmart. As of January 1, 2003, awards totaling $765,000 have been made under
the CEO Discretionary Pool.

                  (b) Deferred Compensation Plans.

         On February 14, 2002, the Debtors sought authority from the Bankruptcy
Court to modify two deferred compensation plans established prior to the
Petition Date (the "Deferred Compensation Plans") for the distribution of funds
to certain of their employee-beneficiaries. The beneficiaries of the Deferred
Compensation Plans included over 3,000 employees and directors who had
contributed a portion of their regular compensation to one of two trusts, one
for each of the Deferred Compensation Plans. These contributions were payable to
the employees at a later time in accordance with the terms of the respective
trusts. The trusts collectively held approximately $13 million in employee and
director contributions at the time the Debtors filed their request with
Bankruptcy Court.

         The Financial Institutions' Committee objected to this request. The
Debtors thereafter engaged in extensive negotiations with the Financial
Institutions' Committee regarding the terms of the proposed distribution to
Kmart employees. As a result of these negotiations, the Debtors and the
Financial Institutions' Committee agreed on the terms of distributions from the
Deferred Compensation Plans. These terms were memorialized in an order submitted
to the Bankruptcy Court. On April 23, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court entered the
order, which authorized the distribution of trust assets of the Deferred
Compensation Plans in an amount equal to the lesser of the beneficiaries'
account balances or $10,000 to those beneficiaries that had not held the
position of senior vice president, divisional president, or higher with any of
the Debtors. Under the Plan, the Debtors propose to distribute the trust assets
to the plan beneficiaries, other than certain beneficiaries who are the subject
of possible stewardship-related causes of action (described in more detail
below).

         7. Senior Management Contracts.

         Within the first fifty days of these Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors
replaced almost all members of senior management. Prior to the Petition Date,
Mr. Charles C. Conaway was Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mark S. Schwartz was
President, Mr. John T. McDonald was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, and Mr. David P. Rots was Executive Vice President and Chief
Administrative Officer. On January 15, 2002, seven days prior to the Petition
Date, Mr. Schwartz was separated from his employment with Kmart. On March 11,
2002, Mr. Conaway, Mr. McDonald, and Mr. Rots were separated from their
employment with Kmart.

         Kmart did not assume any of the employment agreements with any of the
foregoing individuals and declined to pursue a separate obligation to assume Mr.
Conaway's contract. Further information concerning Kmart's former management is
contain in Section III.F., "The Accounting, Stewardship, and Related
Investigations."




                                       35
<PAGE>
         Shortly after Mr. Schwartz's separation on January 15, 2002, Mr. James
B. Adamson, a member of Kmart's Board of Directors, was named Non-Executive
Chairman of the Board. On the Petition Date, Mr. Ronald B. Hutchison was named
Chief Restructuring Officer. On March 11, 2002, when the employment
relationships of Mr. Conaway and Mr. McDonald were ended, Mr. Adamson was named
Chief Executive Officer. Also on that date, Mr. Albert A. Koch was named Chief
Financial Officer, and Mr. Edward J. Stenger was named Treasurer. Mr. Julian C.
Day was named President and Chief Operating Officer effective April 9, 2002.
Michael T. Macik was appointed to the position of Executive Vice President,
Human Resources, effective April 8, 2002. William Underwood was appointed to the
position of Executive Vice President, Kmart Sourcing & Global Operations of the
Company, effective June 3, 2002.

         The Debtors entered into employment agreements with each of Mr.
Adamson, Mr. Day and Mr. Hutchison. Under the terms of Mr. Adamson's employment
agreement, Mr. Adamson was to serve as Chief Executive Officer until April 30,
2004, subject to extension. Mr. Adamson received an annual base salary of
$1,500,000, and was eligible for annual reviews for increases. He also was
eligible for certain incentive awards and success payments. Effective January
17, 2003, Mr. Adamson was succeeded by Mr. Day as Chief Executive Officer. Mr.
Adamson will continue to serve as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board through
the final stages of the company's reorganization.

         Under the terms of Mr. Day's original employment agreement as President
and Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Day was to serve as President and Chief
Operating Officer until April 30, 2004, subject to extension. Mr. Day received
an annual base salary of $775,000 in such capacity, and was eligible to receive
certain bonuses and incentives with respect to Kmart's performance and emergence
from Chapter 11. He received a lump sum payment of $775,000 upon execution of
his employment agreement.

         In connection with his appointment as Chief Executive Officer effective
January 17, 2003, Mr. Day will enter into a restated employment agreement to
reflect his new responsibilities. Under the agreement, which will have a term
expiring January 31, 2006, Mr. Day will have an annual base salary of $1 million
dollars. In addition, Mr. Day will be entitled to a $1 million payment upon the
Effective Date of the Plan. The agreement will provide for the opportunity to
earn annual cash incentive bonuses. For fiscal year 2003, such bonus will be
determined in the discretion of the compensation committee of the Reorganized
Debtors' Board of Directors. In subsequent fiscal years, the bonus will be
expressed as a percentage of Mr. Day's base salary and will be based on
achievement against adjusted EBITDA targets included in the business plan
approved in connection with the Plan, with a target bonus opportunity of 100% of
base salary. The new contract will also provide for a 10-year stock option to
purchase a number of shares of common stock representing 1.5% of the Reorganized
Debtors' fully diluted equity at emergence. The option generally will vest
ratably over four years provided Mr. Day is employed by the Reorganized Debtors
on each vesting date.

         The appointment of Mr. Day as Chief Executive Officer was made as Kmart
begins to implement a reorganized management structure and an emergence
management team in anticipation of Kmart's exit from Chapter 11. The timing of
this announcement was designed to afford Mr. Day adequate time to select
additional key executives for Kmart's emergence team, including a chief merchant
and general counsel, as well as permanent finance leadership to succeed the
interim services provided by Albert A. Koch and Edward J. Stenger, principals
of Alix Partners.

         Mr. Hutchison, as Chief Restructuring Officer, receives $475,000 in
annual compensation under his employment agreement. The term of his agreement
runs to the Effective Date of the Pla]. He received a lump sum cash payment of
$250,000 upon execution of his employment agreement, and is entitled to receive
a lump sum cash payment of $1 million within ten days after confirmation of the
Plan and the Debtors' emergence from Chapter 11.

         Mr. Macik entered into an employment agreement having a term that runs
to April 30, 2004, subject to extension. Mr. Macik's employment agreement
provides for a base salary of $425,000 and the opportunity to earn annual
bonuses and incentives related to the Debtors' emergence from Chapter 11. He
received a lump sum payment of $425,000 upon execution of his employment
agreement.

         Mr. Underwood entered into an employment agreement having a term that
runs to June 2, 2004, subject to extension. Mr. Underwood's employment agreement
provides for a base salary of $485,000 and the opportunity to earn annual
bonuses and incentives related to the Debtors' emergence from Chapter 11.

         8. Sale of Bluelight.com LLC Assets.

         Bluelight.com LLC is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Kmart that
operates the Debtors' eCommerce business and operated its internet service
provider and private label internet access services. Bluelight provided low
cost, high quality dial-up internet access services covering areas that comprise
more than 90% of the U.S. population. Bluelight continues to operate an
e-commerce site.

         After a comprehensive strategic review, the Debtors decided to sell
certain of the Debtors' assets related to Bluelight's business of providing
branded dial-up internet access and e-mail services and private label internet
access services. The Debtors determined that these businesses were not critical
to the reorganization efforts and, as such, should be sold if a reasonable offer
was received. Thereafter, Bluelight entered into an agreement, subject to higher
and better offers, with United Online, Inc. and NetBrands, Inc. for the purchase
of these assets for $8.39 million. The purchasers continue to offer internet
services under the Bluelight name.

         On October 7, 2002, the Debtors conducted an auction to sell the
Bluelight assets. United Online and NetBrands emerged as the winning bidders at
the conclusion of such auction. On October 30, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court
entered an order authorizing the sale of the assets to these purchasers.

         9. Exclusivity.

         Pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court dated July 24, 2002, the
Bankruptcy Court extended the Debtors' exclusive period to propose a plan of
reorganization (the "Filing Period") through February 28, 2003, and to solicit
acceptances of such plan (the "Solicitation Period") to April 22, 2003. Pursuant
to a further order of the Court entered on _________, 2003, the Filing Period
and Solicitation Period were further extended to _________, 2003, and _________,
2003, respectively.

F. THE ACCOUNTING, STEWARDSHIP AND RELATED INVESTIGATIONS

         1. Introduction

         On January 12, 2002, the Debtors received a copy of an anonymous letter
addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), dated January 9,
2002. The letter purported to be from Kmart employees who alleged that they had
been directed to make improper accounting entries in the books and records of
the company. On January 14, 2002 - one week after the Debtors had retained the
law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP ("Skadden") to advise it
in connection with a possible restructuring, and eight days before the Debtors
filed petitions for protection under Chapter 11 - the board of directors
instructed Skadden, under the supervision of the Audit Committee, to conduct an
internal investigation into the allegations contained in the letter (the
"Accounting Investigation"). The goal was to review accounting matters raised by
the anonymous letter and other issues identified in the course of such an
inquiry, with the intent of completing such an investigation prior to the
company's filing of its Form 10-K Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2001, which it
did on May 15, 2002.

         Subsequent to January 2002, and continuing until as recently as January
17, 2003, the Debtors, Skadden, members of Kmart's board of directors, the
Statutory Committees and certain of their members, selected media outlets and
certain government entities received more than 65 additional anonymous letters
relating allegations of misfeasance and malfeasance by past management. Skadden
was directed by the Audit Committee to investigate the allegations contained in
these letters, as well as other matters that came to Skadden's attention during
the course of the inquiry. This phase of the inquiry, which was taken up
following the substantial completion of the Accounting Investigation, was
denominated the "Stewardship Investigation".

         At the same time, the SEC and the United States Attorney's Office for
the Eastern District of Michigan ("USAO"), aided by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and a federal grand jury, opened inquiries into events that
occurred at the Debtors leading up to the filing of the petitions (the
"Government Inquiries"). The board directed the company and Skadden to cooperate
fully with the SEC and USAO investigations. To facilitate this cooperation, the
company, through its counsel, entered into confidentiality agreements with the
SEC and the USAO.

         In June 2002, the Debtors consulted with the three Statutory Committees
regarding the conduct and completion of the Investigations and thereafter, with
the approval of the board of directors, invited legal counsel and forensic
accounting professionals retained by the three Statutory Committees (the
"Professional Advisors to the Committees") to participate on a joint interest
basis in the Investigations, subject to a confidentiality agreement among all
the participating parties. With the support of the Debtors and the Statutory
Committees, that agreement was incorporated in an order of the Court dated
September 4, 2002 (the "Order"). The Order also recognized the confidentiality
agreements between the Debtors and the SEC and the USAO. Pursuant to that
agreement and that Order, the Professional




                                       38
<PAGE>
Advisors to the Committees were given substantial, confidential access to
investigatory materials, participated in witness interviews and depositions, and
reviewed documents collected in the course of the Investigations.

         2. Scope and Conduct of the Investigations

         In the conduct of the Accounting and Stewardship Investigations,
including with respect to all matters authorized by the Order, and in connection
with responding to government inquiries (collectively, the "Investigations"),
the Audit Committee and Kmart management have given Skadden unfettered access to
the company's employees and records and directed the company's management to
cooperate fully and to assist in the Investigations. Neither the board nor
management limited the scope of the Investigations in any way.

         As of January 24, 2003, Skadden, assisted by forensic accountants from
the firms of Chicago Partners, LLC, and Ten Eyck Associates Inc., have conducted
more than 570 interviews of current and former Kmart employees; have collected,
reviewed and analyzed in excess of 1.5 million pages of documents, including
accounting records, audit work papers, company policies and electronic mail; and
have processed more than 620,000 pages of documents for production in response
to subpoenas and voluntary requests for documents from the SEC, the USAO and the
U.S. House of Representatives.

         Generally, the allegations that were the subject of the Investigations
pertained to the following subjects, among others:

         --       The accuracy of representations made by former management to
                  the board of directors, vendors and the public concerning the
                  financial condition of the Debtors in 2001

         --       The payment of retention loans and retention bonuses to Kmart
                  managers in late 2001

         --       The recording of vendor allowances (also known as vendor
                  rebates or vendor credits)

         --       Management of inventory and inventory accounting

         --       Relations with Kmart vendors, including whether certain
                  employees received improper payments from vendors

         --       Hiring practices implemented by former management

         --       Abuse of corporate aircraft privileges and other corporate
                  perquisites

         --       Certain aspects of the Debtors' operations in the Caribbean

         The Order also authorized the issuance of subpoenas pursuant to
Bankruptcy Rule 2004. Accordingly, the Debtors issued subpoenas for testimony
and documents to 20 former Kmart employees and three third party witnesses. The
table below identifies those deponents and the dates on which their depositions
occurred or are scheduled to occur.

         Three witnesses - Messrs. Hofmeister, Montini and Rots - have asserted
their Fifth Amendment right not to testify in response to any and all questions
posed by counsel for the Debtors and the Committees. Mr. Rots also refused to
produce documents on the basis that to do so would incriminate him. A fourth
witness, Mr. Montoya, interposed a Fifth Amendment objection with respect to
questions on one specific topic.

         It is envisioned that immediately upon completion of the depositions of
former management, Rule 2004 depositions of some or all of the members of the
Kmart board of directors will proceed, in order to determine whether and to what
extent the board was apprised of certain events and activities that occurred at
the company, among other matters. Pursuant to a protocol established between
Skadden and the Statutory Committees, it is anticipated that counsel for the
Statutory Committees will have the opportunity to take the lead in examining
individual directors, and Skadden will also participate in those examinations.
These depositions, which constitute the final steps in the Investigations, are
scheduled to occur during the first quarter of fiscal 2003.

         The period for completion of the Investigations was extended to the
first quarter of 2003 due in part to the letter writers' insistence on remaining
anonymous. While the authors often provided useful and constructive information
to the Investigation, they failed to respond to several appeals from Skadden,
the Company and the USAO to come forward with "audit trails," audiotapes and
videotapes that they purported to possess substantiating their sometimes vague
or cryptic allegations. These appeals were made through electronic mail, at
company assemblies, and in Court filings and Court hearings. The letter writers,
moreover, were invited at their option to provide information and records either
to the company's new compliance officer, independent outside counsel, or the
government, and were given assurances from the company and the USAO that there
would be no retaliation against anyone for coming forward. Indeed, in
cooperation with the USAO, one such appeal was made as recently as the




                                       41
<PAGE>
week of January 12, 2003 via company-wide e-mail. Notwithstanding these
assurances, and notwithstanding warnings by the USAO that the withholding of
such evidence, if it exists, could constitute obstruction of justice or violate
other applicable laws, these appeals have gone unheeded. Had such records been
provided, and had the letter writers come forward to elaborate on the
allegations, the Investigations would have been substantially expedited and the
cost greatly reduced. It would still be of tremendous assistance to the
investigators if the letter writers were to proffer their documents and
information at this time.

         3. Results.

                  a. Potential Legal Claims

         The Debtors, after consultation with their Statutory Committees, have
determined that a Creditors' Litigation Trust (the "Trust") is the preferred
available mechanism for resolving any legal claims that may arise out of in the
Investigations. As part of the Plan, the trustee of the Trust would be charged
with responsibility for determining which claims to pursue and litigating such
claims. Pursuant to the Plan, the Debtors will share with the trustee all of the
evidence gathered during the Investigations that is relevant to such claims. As
noted above, certain investigatory work is continuing, and nothing herein is
intended to limit in any way the causes of action that may exist or that the
trustee may bring.

         Based on evidence developed to date in the Investigations, the Debtors
believe that the estates may have, inter alia, legal claims against certain
former officers on grounds that they were grossly derelict in performing their
duties to the company, its associates, its vendors, and its investors. These
would include, without limitation, such claims as breach of the fiduciary duties
of due care, loyalty and candor, gross negligence, and certain
bankruptcy-related causes of action.

         In addition, evidence developed during the Investigations indicates
that the Debtors' estates may have claims for breach of contract and related
misconduct against certain third party vendors who purported to provide
consulting services to Kmart.

         It cannot be predicted at this date which claims the trustee will
determine exist or would choose to pursue. Nor can the outcome of any such
litigation be foreseen. Nor would it be in the Creditors' or the Debtors'
interest at this juncture to lay out a road map for potential defendants by
providing a detailed report of the evidentiary basis for such claims. However,
consistent with their obligations under Section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code,
Skadden has reported to the Debtors that credible and persuasive evidence
adduced to date supports the following findings, among others:

         --       Beginning in September 2001, in an effort to avert a potential
                  liquidity crisis, former management of Kmart undertook a
                  program known internally as "Project Slow It Down", or
                  "Project SID", pursuant to which payments to vendors were
                  systemically deferred or reduced; vendors were purposefully
                  denied access to computerized accounts payable records; and
                  deceptive responses were given to vendors who inquired
                  concerning the reasons they were not being paid.

         --       In October and November 2001, when the Compensation and
                  Incentives Committee of the board of directors was asked to
                  approve a $24 million retention loan program for senior
                  executives, management failed to disclose to the committee
                  certain information that the committee believes would have
                  been material to their decision making. Further,




                                       42
<PAGE>



                  the retention loan and bonus program implemented by former
                  management in December 2001 deviated in certain significant
                  respects from the program that the committee had approved. In
                  addition, management created purported committee documents
                  that varied materially from the loan program documents
                  submitted to the committee for approval, and these documents
                  were inserted in the Company's official board files
                  after-the-fact. Finally, in the course of the present
                  Investigations, certain former employees acted to
                  intentionally withhold information from Skadden relating to
                  the retention program.

         --       Former senior managers frequently imposed gross margin and
                  vendor allowance target numbers on Kmart's merchandising
                  personnel, while being warned repeatedly that the numbers
                  imposed from the top were unattainable. Certain employees were
                  demoted or transferred when they resisted a manager's demand
                  to incorporate numbers they believed to be unrealistic into
                  the company forecasts and financial reports. As a result of
                  the "top down" imposition of numbers in this manner, a
                  substantially inflated forecast was submitted to the board
                  during the fourth quarter of 2001, at the time the
                  Compensation and Incentives Committee was considering final
                  approval of the retention loan program.

         --       With respect to the booking of vendor payments and allowances,
                  the evidence disclosed that:

                  --       In 2001, the Kmart merchant community was under
                           extraordinary pressure from senior managers to record
                           incremental allowances, i.e., allowances that were in
                           excess of the plan for the year.

                  --       The Investigations identified at least $92 million in
                           allowances recorded during the first three quarters
                           of 2001 that were questionable, in that there were
                           failures to have appropriate signed documentation in
                           place or adequate records demonstrating that the
                           allowances were collectible, or were other indicia
                           that the allowances otherwise failed to comply with
                           Kmart's then-existing policies.

                  --       The company's net loss for fiscal year 2001 was
                           overstated by approximately $78 million due to vendor
                           allowances that were prematurely recorded in Kmart's
                           fiscal year 2000 fourth quarter results.

                  --       One substantial up-front payment from a vendor was
                           improperly recorded and required a significant
                           adjustment of the company's financial statements for
                           the second and third quarters of 2001, due to the
                           existence of an undisclosed side agreement with the
                           vendor.

                  As accounting issues related to allowances and vendor payments
                  were identified in the course of the Investigations,
                  disclosure on appropriate restatements were made in the
                  company's public filings, as discussed in detail below.

         --       In the summer of 2001, a former senior executive directed
                  initiatives that resulted in the excessive purchases of
                  inventory without sufficient analysis and oversight, and
                  without appropriate consultation with the merchant community
                  or Kmart's treasury officials.




                                       43
<PAGE>
                  These purchases, which together amounted to approximately $850
                  million, substantially contributed to Kmart's liquidity crisis
                  in the fall of 2001.

         --       In 2000-2001, former management hired numerous personnel into
                  the company without completion of formal applications,
                  submission of background information, or interviews by
                  appropriate personnel. Certain former managers often dictated
                  the terms and compensation packages to be offered to these
                  individuals, without consulting Human Resources officials. As
                  a result, their compensation packages far exceeded not only
                  company norms but also the compensation they had received from
                  previous employers. Many of these hires proved unqualified for
                  their positions and ultimately were terminated.

         --       One former executive received a substantial improper payment
                  from a consultant to the company.

         --       Former management in 2001 authorized the expenditure of $12
                  million to purchase corporate aircraft, notwithstanding that
                  moneys for the purchase were not included in the company's
                  capital budget. Some former executives also abused an already
                  generous corporate aircraft policy by masking personal travel
                  as store visits and by loading aircraft with Kmart personnel
                  who otherwise had no need to travel, in order to avoid having
                  personal travel expenses imputed to their incomes.

                  b. Terminations

         As noted above, through the Investigations, the Debtors discovered
information showing that certain former managers were responsible for
misfeasance and malfeasance, and/or violated company policy, in connection with
the events that were the subject of inquiry. All individuals so identified
either already had been terminated, or were terminated as a result of the
investigatory findings.

                  c. Retention Loans

         A major subject of inquiry in the Investigations was the company's
retention loan programs. In November 2000, the Compensation and Incentives
Committee of the Kmart board unanimously approved the Executive Leadership Team
Retention Program (the "2000 Retention Program"). Under the terms of the 2000
Retention Program, seven senior executives each received an up-front cash
payment, a grant of restricted stock (including an opportunity to earn
additional performance-based restricted shares of Kmart's common stock subject
to the attainment of applicable performance goals), and enhanced protection in
the event of a change-in-control, among other benefits. In return for these
benefits, the recipients committed to stay at Kmart for four years and executed
Confidentiality, Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements. If, under
certain specified circumstances, a recipient departed the company prior to four
years, he or she would be obligated to repay the cash payment.

         In May 2001, the Compensation and Incentives Committee also approved a
special, one-time long-term compensation award for former Chief Executive
Officer Charles C. Conaway. Mr. Conaway's award consisted of a $5 million dollar
cash loan and a performance option grant in return for a commitment to stay at
the company.





                                       44
<PAGE>


         In December 2001, former management of the Debtors implemented another
retention program pursuant to which a total of $23.89 million was paid to 24
senior managers in the form of forgivable loans (the "2001 Retention Program").
The 2001 Retention Program covered two groups of executives: CEO direct reports
and key Executive Vice Presidents ("EVPs") (Tier A) and other EVPs and Senior
Vice Presidents ("SVPs") (Tier B). With respect to Tier A recipients who
participated in the 2000 Retention Program, the 2001 Retention Program provided
that the special restricted stock grant under the 2000 Retention Program would
be converted into a four-year forgivable cash loan, and the existing share
performance restricted stock award opportunity would be converted into stock
options with performance vesting. Tier B of the 2001 Retention Program was
directed at other EVPs and SVPs, none of whom participated in the 2000 Retention
Program. Tier B provided for a three-year forgivable cash loan. Pursuant to the
terms of the loan agreements, the loans, otherwise forgivable, would be due and
owing upon termination of employment "for cause", as defined in each agreement.

         The table below identifies those individuals who received Tier A and
Tier B retention loans; the amount of the loan; and the date they were separated
from the company.

</TABLE>


         As discussed above, credible and persuasive evidence developed during
the Investigations showed that the 2001 Retention Program for Tier A and B
recipients, as implemented by former management, varied in certain key respects
from the program that the




                                       46
<PAGE>


Compensation and Incentives Committee was asked to approve. Moreover,
information was not made known to the outside directors that they believe would
have been material to their decision- making at the time the program was
approved.

         Moreover, after implementing the 2001 Retention Program for Tier A and
B recipients, former management undertook to provide bonuses to certain
so-called "Tier C" and "Tier D" executives below the Senior Vice President
level. This program was partially implemented prior to the filing of the Chapter
11 petitions. It was not, however, approved by the Compensation and Incentives
Committee. When the board, through this Investigation, discovered the existence
of the Tier C and D program, the program was promptly cancelled and the company
obtained repayment from all bonus recipients.

         No Tier A or Tier B loan recipient is still employed by the company.
Two employees, Lorna Nagler and Leeland Viliborghi, have repaid their loans. On
January 13, 2003, the board of directors authorized the company to demand the
return of the full loan amounts from any recipient who has yet to repay them,
which the company currently is undertaking to do. The mere fact that an
individual received a loan or bonus, or that the company demanded repayment, or
the separation of an employee from the company should not in and of themselves
be taken as indicia of wrongful conduct by any individual former employee.

         On January 17, 2002, the Company announced that it had severed
employment relationships with any remaining executives who received special
retention loans in 2001. The executives involved were Janet Kelley, Mariana
Keros, Douglas Meissner, Paula Paquette, and Leland Viliborghi. This action was
taken by the company as it began to implement a reorganized management structure
and establish an emergence management team in anticipation of emergence from
Chapter 11 reorganization on or about April 30, 2003. In connection with these
separations, the company acknowledged that, while these individuals had
independently made substantial contributions to Kmart, the company felt it was
important to put the controversy surrounding employees involved in the special
Retention Loan Program behind it as the company prepared to emerge from Chapter
11. Subject to the repayment of any outstanding special retention loans and
subject to findings that may be made in connection with the Investigations, if
any, the Company agreed to provide these five former executives with severance
packages equivalent to either one or two years of base salary, which is subject
to mitigation.

         Moreover, on January 23, 2003, based on the investigatory results to
date, the company determined that the following loan recipients had engaged in
conduct that would constitute a material breach of the termination "for cause"
provisions of their employment agreements: Mark S. Schwartz, Anthony B.
D'Onofrio, Cecil B. Kearse, John T. McDonald, David P. Rots, Enio A. Montini,
Jr., David W. Montoya, John P. Owen, Timothy M. Crow, and Michael K. Frank. The
company is withholding a determination as to other individual recipients until
completion of the Investigations.

         In addition, deposition testimony was taken from former Chief Executive
Officer Charles C. Conaway on January 22-23, 2003. Upon review of that testimony
and other evidence gathered in the Investigations, the board of directors will
make a determination as to whether grounds exist to make a finding that Mr.
Conaway engaged in conduct that would have warranted termination "for cause" as
defined in his employment agreement. In any event,




                                       47
<PAGE>


Skadden has reported to the Debtors that evidence exists that would support
other legal claims against Mr. Conaway.

                  d. Disclosures Pertaining to the Debtor's Financial Results
for FY 2001

         Over the course of the Investigations, the Debtors developed
information concerning the accounting for certain transactions affecting the
previously- filed financial statements of the company. Based in part on this
information, Kmart made certain disclosures in its public filings, and restated
certain interim period financial results for 2001, as follows:

--       On May 15, 2002, Kmart filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
         fiscal year ended January 30, 2001, reporting that (1) an adjustment
         should be made to previously reported quarterly results with respect to
         the accounting for up-front consideration in a transaction from a
         vendor which more appropriately should have been deferred and
         recognized over the life of the contract and (2) the recording of
         additional general liability reserves in the fourth quarter of 2001 was
         more appropriately designated as a second quarter event. The first item
         resulted in a net reduction to operating results in the second quarter
         of $42 million ($28 million after-tax), and an increase in third
         quarter operating results of $15 million ($10 million after-tax). The
         second item increased general liability reserves in the second quarter,
         rather than the fourth quarter, by approximately $167 million ($112
         million after-tax).

--       Also, in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
         January 30, 2001, Kmart observed that embedded in an accounting change
         adopted in the fourth quarter of the 2001 fiscal year was an adjustment
         for an indeterminate amount of supplemental or "incremental" allowances
         that were initially recorded in the first three quarters prior to
         having been documented, or otherwise deemed appropriate, pursuant to
         Kmart's historical policy. As reported by Kmart, during the fourth
         quarter of fiscal 2001, Kmart adopted a new accounting policy effective
         as of February 1, 2001, for interim financial reporting only, requiring
         that the cost recoveries from vendors be recognized only when a formal
         agreement for such amount has been obtained and the underlying activity
         for which the amount was provided has been performed.

--       Kmart reported further developments in its Investigation in the
         company's Form 10-Q for the period ended July 31, 2002, filed on
         September 16, 2002. In particular, the company reported that it had
         learned that certain vendor allowances had been prematurely recorded in
         Kmart's fiscal year 2000 fourth quarter results, and to a lesser
         extent, in other prior fiscal periods, and that the Vendor Allowance
         Tracking ("VAT") agreements with vendors relating to these transactions
         did not in all cases reflect certain existing oral understandings or
         separate written agreements with such vendors. As a result, Kmart noted
         that its net loss for fiscal year 2000 was understated by approximately
         $38 million ($26 million net of tax), while the net loss reported for
         fiscal year 2001 was overstated by approximately $78 million (both
         before and after taxes). (The net loss for fiscal year 2000 was
         increased by $14 million, based on further review of certain allowances
         in connection with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the 13-week
         period ended October 31, 2002.) Kmart also noted that clearance
         markdowns of inventory in the second and third quarters of fiscal year
         2001 appeared low in relation to historic markdown experience,
         apparently as a result, among other things, of




                                       48
<PAGE>
         decisions by former management to minimize markdown activity in light
         of the company's operating performance during that period.

--       Finally, in Kmart's Form 10-Q for the period ended October 30, 2002,
         filed on December 23, 2002, the company reported additional results of
         the Investigations, including, among other things, that an inquiry into
         certain selected allowances that were recorded during the first three
         quarters of 2001 indicated that at least $92 million of these
         allowances were questionable, in that there were failures to have
         appropriate signed documentation in place, failures to have adequate
         records demonstrating that the allowance was collectible, or that the
         allowance otherwise failed to comply with Kmart's historic policies for
         vendor rebates.

         4. Enhanced Controls.

         The Investigations and further review by current management made clear
the need for enhanced controls with respect to accounting for allowances,
inventory management, and corporate perquisites, among other areas of the
Debtors' operations. Current management has taken steps to strengthen and
tighten the applicable controls, even prior to completion of the Investigations.
Among the measures implemented are the following:

                  a. Controls Over Vendor Allowances

         In August 2002, Kmart strengthened its vendor allowance policy by,
among other things:

         --       enhancing the VAT form itself to require the clear disclosure
                  of information needed to assess the propriety of the allowance
                  and when and how it should be recorded;

         --       requiring that all pertinent contracts, correspondence or
                  other agreements with the vendor be appended to the VAT form
                  before the allowance is forwarded to the appropriate persons
                  for approval and processing;

         --       requiring the Merchandise Controller's approval for all
                  allowances in excess of $500,000;

         --       creating a standing Allowance Committee comprising senior
                  managers of the Merchandise Finance, Financial Reporting and
                  Vendor Allowance groups that meets monthly to review issues
                  concerning allowances; and

         --       enhancing the responsibilities of the company's Gross Margin
                  Council, which includes the Chief Financial Officer, Corporate
                  Controller and Merchandise Controller, who also review issues
                  pertaining to allowances and vendor credits at a weekly
                  meeting.

         Moreover, all merchandise and merchandise finance personnel were
required to undergo training in the new allowance policies and procedures, which
training was designed to educate them about the proper procedures and accounting
treatments for allowances, as well as




                                       49
<PAGE>
to sensitize them to the significance of the information required by the VAT
form in ensuring that allowances are given appropriate accounting treatment.
These personnel also were provided with a detailed written allowance policy that
includes, among other items, specific guidance for documenting and accounting
for a variety of types of allowances, as well as directions about whom to
contact should they have any questions about an allowance. Finally, all
Merchandise Divisional Vice Presidents, Finance Divisional Vice Presidents,
General Merchandise Managers and the Merchandise Controller are now required to
sign quarterly representation letters acknowledging their responsibility for
accurate financial information, including information about vendor credits, and
certifying compliance with the vendor allowance policy.

                  b. Inventory Controls

         Kmart also has put in place additional controls with respect to
inventory management and accounting, including periodic inventory quality
reviews, regular meetings of management to review clearance markdowns, exception
reporting for excess quantities of active replenished merchandise and reducing
the number of inventory categories to more effectively manage inventory control
quality through more focused exception reporting. Other improvements include
reducing the number of personnel authorized to approve new purchase orders from
more than 200 to less than 30, temporarily discontinuing the ability of a
merchant to issue replenishment orders if inventory on hand does not support a
repurchase, and adjusting the overall buy of seasonal merchandise based on
current trends in the business.

                  c. Certain Other Measures

         --       Kmart has terminated the corporate executive lease car
                  program.

         --       In October 2002, Kmart significantly revamped the management
                  and organization of its Audit Services Department, which
                  department is now undertaking a systematic review of the
                  company's policies and controls with respect to capital
                  expenses, purchase orders for non-vendor items and other
                  significant compliance systems.

         5. Remaining Steps.

         The Debtors believe the Investigations into the issues identified above
are substantially complete, save for the remaining depositions of former
management and certain directors, as described above. The Company will continue
to cooperate with and respond to inquiries from the SEC, the USAO and other
governmental authorities. Moreover, the Investigations identified some remaining
subsidiary issues that are more efficiently pursued by the company at this
juncture. Skadden, after consultation with the Statutory Committees, will
identify those issues to the company's compliance officer. Finally, once a
trustee is appointed to oversee the Kmart Creditor Trust, the results of the
investigation will be turned over to the trustee.

G. SUMMARY OF CLAIMS PROCESS, BAR DATE, CLAIMS FILED, AND PROFESSIONAL FEES

         1. Schedules and Statements of Financial Affairs.



                                       50
<PAGE>



         On April 15, 2002, the Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court
Schedules of Assets and Liabilities and Statements of Financial Affairs
(collectively, the "Schedules and Statements"). Separate Schedules and
Statements were filed for the following ten Debtors: Kmart Corporation, Kmart of
Indiana, Kmart of Michigan, Inc., Kmart of North Carolina, LLC, Kmart of
Pennsylvania, LP, Kmart of Texas, LP, Kmart Overseas Corporation, Troy CMBS
Property, LLC, Bluelight.com, LLC, and The Coolidge Group, n/k/a, TC Group I,
LLC. A consolidated set of Schedules and Statements was filed reflecting
information for all thirty-eight (38) Debtors.

         The Schedules and Statements of Kmart Corporation include information
for Kmart and each of the other twenty-eight Affiliate Debtors for which
separate Schedules and Statements were not prepared. Information, if any,
pertaining to such Affiliate Debtors was included in the Schedules and
Statements for Kmart because (i) such Debtors have de minimis assets,
liabilities, and operations, (ii) such Debtors' records reflect primarily
intercompany balances, and/or (iii) such Debtors hold an interest only in a
single asset (such as a shopping center).

         Summarized below are the total amount of the Claims listed in each of
the eleven (11) sets of Schedules and Statements. For financial reporting
purposes, Kmart prepares consolidated financial statements that are filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission and that are audited annually. Unlike
these consolidated financial statements, the Schedules and Statements reflect
the assets and liabilities of each Debtor as assigned to each Debtor on the
basis of the Debtors' non-audited book and tax records. Kmart does not, other
than annually for tax purposes, prepare detailed financial statements for
certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, and the Debtors do not maintain
full, separate, stand-alone accounting records in their general ledger for
certain entities. This means that audited financial statements and supporting
schedules have not been prepared for each Debtor.

         Intercompany claims were listed in the schedules for Kmart Corporation
rather than in the consolidated schedules. For this reason, the total amount of
claims in the Kmart Corporation schedules exceeds the total amount of claims in
the consolidated schedules.

         2. Claims Bar Date.

         On March 26, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the "Bar Date
Order") establishing the general deadline for filing proofs of claim against the
Debtors (the "Bar Date"). The deadline established by the Bankruptcy Court was
July 31, 2002 for Claims, including Claims of governmental units, but excluding
certain other Claims, including Claims based on the rejection of executory
contracts and unexpired leases as to which the bar date is the later of (i) the
Bar Date, or (ii) 30 days after the effective date of such rejection. The
Debtors' claims and notice agent provided notice of the Bar Date by mailing: (i)
a notice of the Bar Date; (ii) a proof of claim form to each person listed in
the Schedules and Statements; and (iii) statements which indicated whether the
Claim of each recipient was listed in the Schedules and Statements as either
unliquidated, contingent and/or disputed. In addition, the Debtors published
notice of the Bar Date in The New York Times (national edition), The Wall Street
Journal (national, European and Asian editions) and USA Today (worldwide) on
March 28, 2002. A supplemental bar date was established on December 19, 2002
with respect to approximately 4,000 personal injury and related claims that were
not listed in the original Schedules and Statements. The Schedules and
Statements were amended at that time to include these claims.

         3. Proofs of Claim and Other Claims.

         According to information provided by the Claims Agent, a total of
44,935 proofs of claim have been filed against the Debtors asserting claims in
the total face amount of approximately $75.2 billion. In addition, numerous
claims were asserted by various alleged creditors in unliquidated amounts. The
Debtors believe that certain claims that have been asserted are without merit
and intend to object to all such claims. Moreover, there are many large,
duplicative claims that have been filed against the Debtors. For example, the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC"), which is the government
agency that affords certain guarantees of pension plan liabilities, has filed
contingent proofs of claim in the amount of $1,078,600,000, representing the
PBGC's estimate of the difference between liabilities to Kmart plan
beneficiaries and the current value of the plan assets (the "PBGC Claim"). The
PBGC Claim was filed in each Chapter 11 Case of each of the thirty-eight (38)
Debtors in these proceedings, meaning that the total, aggregate amount of the
PBGC Claim is almost $41 billion. However, under Kmart's Plan of Reorganization,
the PBGC Claim will be Reinstated, meaning that Kmart's obligations under
applicable law with respect to continued funding of the plan will remain
unaltered. Thus, there will be no distributions under the Plan on account of the
PBGC Claim.

         There are other classes of duplicative and disputed claims that have
been filed in these Chapter 11 Cases. For instance, the Debtors have identified
approximately $12.4 billion in claims that the Debtors believe are duplicates of
one another, or that represent the same claim filed against multiple different
Debtors, only one of whom may be liable on the asserted debt. These duplicate
claims, plus the duplicate PBGC claims, total over $53 billion, representing
approximately 70% of the face amount of all claims filed to date (although, as
noted above, there are many claims that were filed in unliquidated amounts,
i.e., claims that did not contain a



                                       52
<PAGE>
specific dollar amount). Other significant categories of disputed claims include
claims in litigation, which include claims in the total face amount of
approximately $4.1 billion; claims for damages under rejected real estate leases
and executory contracts in the total face amount of approximately $3.6 billion;
and trade claims that exceed the amounts identified on the Debtors' books and
records by approximately $2 billion. The Debtors dispute the litigation claims.
The claims for damages for rejected real estate contracts and executory
contracts also are disputed because many of them exceed the statutory
limitations imposed by the Bankruptcy Code and/or pertain to leases and
contracts that have not, and will not, be rejected.

         As a result of the foregoing, preliminary, analysis conducted by
AlixPartners, the Debtors do not believe that Allowed Claims in these Chapter 11
Cases will exceed approximately $9.2 billion in the aggregate. However, there
can be no assurance that the Debtors will be successful in contesting any of
such claims. The actual allowed amount of claims in these proceedings will
impact the estimated percentage distribution to creditors. Although the results
of the claims reconciliation process cannot be predicted with certainty, on
January __, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court entered orders on the Debtors' first
omnibus objection to claims disallowing certain duplicative and amended claims.
On January 21, 2003, the Debtors' filed a second omnibus objection to
approximately 6,300 claims filed against multiple debtors in the aggregate face
amount of over $10 billion. A hearing on this objection is scheduled for
February 25, 2003. Additional omnibus objections to claims will be prepared,
filed, and prosecuted in due course.

         4. Securities and Related Claims

         Since February 21, 2002, five separate purported class actions have
been filed on behalf of purchasers of Kmart common stock. The initial complaints
were filed on behalf of purchasers of common stock between May 17, 2001 and
January 22, 2002, inclusive, and named Charles C. Conaway, former CEO and
Chairman of the Board of Kmart, as the sole defendant. The complaints filed in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan allege
that Mr. Conaway made material misstatements or omissions during the alleged
class period that inflated the trading prices of Kmart's common stock and seek,
among other things, damages under Section 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934. On October 15, 2002, an amended consolidated complaint was filed
that enlarged the class of persons on whose behalf the action was brought to
include purchasers of Kmart securities between March 13, 2001 and May 15, 2002,
and added former officers Jeffrey N. Boyer, Mark S. Schwartz, Matthew F.
Hilzinger, Martin E. Welch III, and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as defendants.
Kmart is not a defendant in this litigation.

         On July 31, 2002, attorneys for plaintiffs in the pending class action
lawsuits filed a class proof of claim in the Bankruptcy Court (the "Class Proof
of Claim") on behalf of the plaintiffs and all purchasers of Kmart common stock
between May 17, 2001 and January 22, 2002, inclusive. The Class Proof of Claim,
which is asserted against the Debtors, reserved the right to identify additional
claimants or members of the class group in the future. In support of the Class
Proof of Claim, the claimants rely on the above-referenced class actions filed
against the former officers and directors of Kmart identified above. The
claimants state that the grounds for liability are alleged damages for
violations of federal securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, in connection with the purchase or acquisition of Kmart common stock by
the claimants during the class period. The Class Proof of Claim alleges that



                                       53
<PAGE>

the Debtors are liable to the claimants for damages in a sum not presently
determinable, but believed to be not less than $700 million in the aggregate,
plus interest, costs and allowed attorneys' fees.

         On March 18, 2002, a purported class action was filed in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on behalf of
participants or beneficiaries of the Kmart Corporation Retirement Savings Plan
against various current and former employees and directors of Kmart alleging
breach of fiduciary duty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act for
excessive investment in Kmart stock; failure to provide complete and accurate
information about Kmart common stock; and failure to provide accurate
information about Kmart's financial condition. On October 15, 2002, an amended
complaint was filed that added additional current and former employees and
directors of Kmart as defendants. Kmart is not a defendant in this litigation.

         On April 26, 2002, a lawsuit was filed in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on behalf of three limited
partnerships that purchased stock of BlueLight.com, a subsidiary of Kmart,
naming Charles C. Conaway, as former CEO and Chairman of the Board of Kmart, as
the sole defendant. The Complaint alleged that Mr. Conaway breached his
fiduciary duty, took certain actions and made certain misrepresentations that
induced plaintiffs to exchange their Bluelight.com stock for Kmart stock and
prevented plaintiffs from realizing the market value of their stock. The
complaint also alleged violations of Section 10b-5 of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 410 of the Michigan Uniform Securities Act.
Kmart was not a defendant in this litigation. On January 16, 2003, the District
Court dismissed the complaint.

         In connection with the investigation by the United States Attorney in
Puerto Rico of alleged actions by Kmart's employees following the 1998 Hurricane
Georges, on October 28, 2002, Kmart's wholly owned subsidiary, S.F.P.R., Inc., a
Puerto Rico corporation, pled guilty to one count of mail fraud in violation of
18 U.S.C. Sections 1341 and 1342 pursuant to a plea agreement providing for a
three year probation period, a fine in the amount of $2 million, and other
agreements. Kmart has agreed to fund the payment of the fine and to take certain
other actions, none of which are anticipated to have any material adverse effect
on Kmart's liquidity, financial position or results of operations.

         Kmart is a defendant in six putative class actions and one
multi-plaintiff case pending in California, all relating to Kmart's
classification of assistant managers and various other employees as "exempt"
employees under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act and the California Labor
Code and Kmart's alleged failure to pay overtime wages as required by these
laws. These seven wage-and-hour cases were all filed during 2001 and are
currently pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of California, the United States District Court for the Central District of
California (the multi-plaintiff case, which was originally brought in state
court) and the Superior Courts of the State of California for the Counties of
Alameda, Los Angeles and Riverside. If all of these cases were determined
adversely to Kmart, the resulting damages would have a material adverse impact
on its results of operations and financial condition. However, there have been
no class certifications, all of the cases are stayed as a result of Kmart's
bankruptcy and, based on Kmart's initial investigations, Kmart believes that it
has numerous defenses to each of these claims. As a result, Kmart currently is
unable to quantify the financial exposure of these cases.



                                       54
<PAGE>

         Kmart currently is a party to a substantial number of other claims,
lawsuits, and pending actions, most of which are routine and all of which are
incidental to Kmart's business. Some matters involve claims for large amounts of
damages as well as other relief. Kmart assesses the likelihood of potential
losses on an ongoing basis and when they are considered probable and reasonably
estimable, records an estimate of the ultimate outcome. If there is no single
point estimate of loss that is considered more likely than others, an amount
representing the low end of the range of possible outcomes is recorded. Although
the final consequences of these proceedings are not presently determinable, in
the opinion of management, they are not expected to have a material adverse
effect on liquidity, financial position or results of operations.

         In addition to the foregoing, there are numerous other matters filed
with the Bankruptcy Court in Kmart's reorganization proceedings by creditors,
landlords or other third parties related to Kmart's business operations or the
conduct of Kmart's reorganization activities. Although none of these individual
matters which have been filed to date have had or are expected to have a
material adverse effect on Kmart, the company's ability to successfully manage
the reorganization process and develop an acceptable reorganization plan could
be negatively impacted by adverse determinations by the Court on certain of
these matters.

         5. Professional Fees

         At the commencement of these Chapter 11 Cases, the Bankruptcy Court
entered an order establishing procedures for interim compensation and
reimbursement of expenses of professionals (the "Compensation Order"). The
Compensation Order requires professionals retained in these cases to submit
monthly fee statements to the Debtors and requires the Debtors to pay ninety
percent of the requested fees and one hundred percent of the requested expenses
pending interim approval by the Bankruptcy Court. The remaining ten percent of
fees requested in such fee statements are paid only upon further order of the
Bankruptcy Court (the "Holdback"). The Compensation Order requires the
professionals retained in these Chapter 11 Cases to file an application for
approval of their fees and expenses for the preceding four month period
approximately every four months.

         On March 20, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court appointed a fee review
committee (the "Joint Fee Review Committee") consisting of (a) a representative
of the Office of the United States Trustee; (b) three representatives of the
Debtors; and (c) one representative from each of the Financial Institutions'
Committee, the Creditors' Committee and the Equity Committee. The Joint Fee
Review Committee's duties included reviewing the fee applications of retained
professionals, assisting with budgeting for anticipated fees, and providing
written reports to the Bankruptcy Court with recommendations regarding the fee
applications submitted.

         On September 19, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court approved on an interim
basis the first interim fee applications for the period from January 22, 2002
through April 30, 2002, of certain professionals retained by the Debtors, the
Financial Institutions' Committee and the Creditors' Committee. During the first
interim fee application period, such professionals earned $21,958,471 in fees
and incurred $2,610,997 in expenses.

         On December 19, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court approved on an interim basis
the second interim fee applications for the period from May 1, 2002 through
August 31, 2002, of certain



                                       55
<PAGE>

professionals retained by the Debtors, the Financial Institutions' Committee,
the Creditors' Committee, and the Equity Committee. However, the Bankruptcy
Court continued the release of the Holdback until further order of the
Bankruptcy Court. In addition, the Bankruptcy Court requested the appointment of
a fee examiner to the Joint Fee Review Committee. During the second interim fee
application period, such professionals earned $24,077,002 in fees and incurred
$2,328,610 in expenses.

         The third interim fee application period included the period from
September 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002. The third interim fee applications
for professional retained by the Debtors, the Financial Institutions' Committee,
the Creditors' Committee and the Equity Committee are due February 17, 2003.
Such professionals have budgeted their fees for the third interim fee
application period at $31,148,000. The Debtors plan to emerge from Chapter 11
during the fourth interim fee application period, running from January 1, 2003
through April 30, 2003. All fee applications filed in these cases are subject to
final approval by the Bankruptcy Court.

H. PENSION ISSUES

         Prior to 1996, Kmart maintained a defined benefit pension plan covering
eligible employees. Effective January 31, 1996, the pension plan was frozen, and
employees no longer earn additional benefits under the plan, except for purposes
of the subsidized early retirement program provided by the plan. The plan's
assets consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities. For the past 8
years, Kmart has not been required to make a contribution to the plan.

         In light of the returns in the equity markets over the past several
years and the effect of such returns on the value of the plan's assets, Kmart
presently expects that it likely will be required to commence making
contributions to the plan in 2005, although it is possible that some
contributions could be required earlier. Indeed, as noted above, the PBGC, which
is the government agency that affords certain guarantees of pension plan
liabilities, has filed contingent proofs of claim in the Chapter 11 Cases in the
amount of $1,078,600,000.00 for each Debtor, representing the PBGC's estimate of
the difference between plan liabilities to plan beneficiaries and the current
value of the plan assets.

         Under Kmart's Plan of Reorganization, the PBGC Claim will be
Reinstated, meaning that Kmart's obligations under applicable law with respect
to continued funding of the plan will remain unaltered. Given that the plan is
frozen, the timing for the commencement of future funding requirements will
depend, in large part, on the future investment performance of the plan's
assets. Once Kmart's funding obligations commence, Kmart presently anticipates
that such obligations could continue for a period of five or six years at an
average rate of between $100 million and $200 million a year, or between $800
million and $900 million in the aggregate. The actual level of contributions,
however, will depend upon a number of factors, including the actual demographic
and other changes affecting valuations.

         In addition to the funding described above, as a result of the returns
over the most recent years, expected decreases in Kmart's annual discount rate,
and expected rate of return on assets, there will likely be an expense recorded
for 2003 as opposed to income as has been recorded in the most recent years.



                                       56

I. DEVELOPMENT AND SUMMARY OF BUSINESS PLAN

         As pointed out above, Kmart's need to restructure its business through
a Chapter 11 reorganization proceeding arose due to the combination of a number
of factors. In light of these factors, Kmart concluded that commencement of
these Chapter 11 Cases would afford the company the best opportunity for
restructuring its affairs and for developing and implementing a long-term,
go-forward, retail business strategy. To this end, Kmart has successfully
implemented a number of key initiatives during the time that the company has
been in Chapter 11. Kmart believes that it has accomplished or will accomplish
prior to emergence from Chapter 11 nearly all of the actions which it required
Chapter 11 to address, including, among other things, termination of
unprofitable stores and leases and restructuring its balance sheet through the
conversion of substantially all debt into equity.

         A primary focus of Kmart and its constituents during these Chapter 11
Cases has been on rationalizing and optimizing the company's store and lease
portfolio. To this end, Kmart will have reduced its total number of stores from
2,114 as of the Petition Date to 1,509 as of emergence from Chapter 11, which
constitutes a total reduction of 605 stores. Several factors were considered in
the store closing analysis, including historical and projected operating
results; the anticipated impact of current and future competition; future lease
liability and real estate value; store age, size, and capital spending
requirements; the expected impact of store closings on Kmart's competitive
position; the estimated potential savings from exiting markets and regions; the
potential impact of store closings on purchasing power and allowances; and the
potential impact of store closings on market coverage.

         While Kmart's closure of under-performing stores has been a priority,
the company believes that there are disadvantages to a substantially smaller
chain. There are significant economies of scale relating to purchasing,
advertising, distribution, and licensing that will be jeopardized if a large
number of additional stores are closed. The store closings to date have resulted
in increased sales and cash flow per remaining store, consistent with the
overall aim of optimizing the number of stores in the portfolio.

         Concurrent with Kmart's goal of rationalizing and optimizing the store
and lease portfolio, Kmart has also obtained substantial value through the
renegotiation of, assumption of, and/or entry into several significant executory
contracts, including licensing agreements with key brand partners that
differentiate Kmart from its competitors. These include the license agreements
relating to Martha Stewart Everyday home, garden, housewares and seasonal
products; Jaclyn Smith women's apparel, jewelry and accessories; Kathy Ireland
women's apparel, accessories and exercise equipment; Disney apparel for infants
and children; Sesame Street apparel for infants and children; Joe Boxer apparel,
accessories and home furnishings; Route 66 apparel and accessories; Curtis
Mathes consumer video, audio and telecommunications products; and Thalia-
branded products. They also include a renegotiated contract with Cardinal
Health, Inc., Kmart's exclusive supplier of pharmaceutical and related products.

         As of the commencement of these Chapter 11 Cases, Kmart employed
approximately 234,000 employees. As of January 21, 2003, approximately 32,000
employee relationships had been severed, most of them in connection with Kmart's
closure of 283 stores in the spring of 2002. Kmart anticipates that an
additional 35,000 employee relationships will be severed in



                                       57
<PAGE>

connection with the closure of up to 326 additional stores in early 2003. In
part as a result of these store closures and Kmart's overall
cost-rationalization strategy, the company has significantly reduced its
overhead costs during these Chapter 11 Cases through a reduction in the number
of support employees located at its headquarters in Troy, Michigan. In part as a
result of these efforts, corporate annual selling, general, and administrative
costs ("SG&A") have been reduced from $1,044 million to $791 million, a
reduction of over $250 million. However, as a percentage of sales, SG&A
increased in 2002 partially because of store closings and partially because
comparable store sales declined from 2001 to 2002. As part of these initiatives,
corporate management has been significantly reduced, including at the most
senior levels.

         Kmart's asset rationalization and optimization strategies have been
complemented throughout these Chapter 11 Cases by a number of business
initiatives designed to attract customers to Kmart stores, cement vendor
support, and increase sales and gross margins. For instance, Kmart has
significantly improved its inventory management practices, resulting in
noticeable progress in keeping its store shelves stocked with popular items.
Prior to filing these Chapter 11 Cases, Kmart had experienced a number of
difficulties in keeping its shelves properly stocked, which in turn seriously
impacted the customer shopping experience and hence, overall sales. Kmart has
managed to reverse this negative trend in part through improved inventory
replenishment forecasting, implementation of new controls on the inventory
buying process, reduction in the number of corporate employees authorized to
give final approval to purchase orders from 220 to 30, and increased ordering
discretion granted to store managers. As a result, weekly in-stock levels have
improved throughout the Chapter 11 Cases and since have consistently exceeded
the corporate goal of 95%.

         Kmart has also worked to improve store appearance and hence, the
overall customer shopping experience. The company has returned to its strategy
as a "promotional" retailer focused on its exclusive brand merchandise, rather
than attempting to beat its competition solely based on pricing strategies.
Kmart has expanded and redesigned its weekly advertising circulars, and has
implemented a strategic marketing plan aimed at Hispanics and African-
Americans, who collectively comprise one of the fastest-growing customer
segments. The company has also implemented a "store of the neighborhood"
approach to servicing its customers, which allows individual store managers to
customize their merchandise assortment to suit local community needs and allows
greater focus on high volume and advertised items.

         During the Chapter 11 Cases, Kmart has also begun aggressively testing
and implementing a number of other strategic initiatives. For instance, the
company developed a "top sellers" program, which focuses on improving sales and
in-stock positions for each store's 300 top selling items. This program empowers
store managers with more discretion in terms of purchasing. It was initially
tested in a number of Chicago stores, and the results were very positive and
have been sustained. Comparable store sales increased by approximately 10% in
the test stores, especially with respect to sales of high volume items. It was
next tested in the Detroit market and met with early success, although such
success has not continually sustained itself as has occurred in the Chicago test
stores. The "top sellers" program was expanded to substantially all Kmart
markets in July 2002.

         Kmart also has been testing a "store of the future" that focuses on
improving the in-store experience with new signs, a new color scheme, wider
aisles, better lighting, more



                                       58
<PAGE>

accessible shelf and product layout, and a cleaner overall experience. Customer
feedback for the "store of the future" has been positive. To date, Kmart has
begun testing the "store of the future" through five stores in various markets.
Test stores have recorded various levels of comparable store sales growth and
margin increases over last year, with some of them recording significant
increases in these performance categories. New layout, structural changes,
carpeting and signage changes have improved gross margin productivity in all
apparel divisions; average gross margin rates of certain Martha Stewart product
lines have improved significantly per store; and the relocation of infant
apparel to the front of the stores has positively impacted sales and margin
rates in these stores. Kmart's next action steps with respect to the "store of
the future" concept include continued evaluation and adjustments to the test
stores; completion of consumer opinion evaluations; and possible future
implementation of a modest roll-out of the concept to a larger group of stores
within the chain.

         The company's "Have to Have It" advertising campaign, tested in Chicago
and Detroit, has focused on competitive pricing and Kmart's superior product
offers. Comparable store sales in the Chicago test market have exceeded the rest
of the Kmart store chain by approximately 5%. Other successful advertising
campaigns during the Chapter 11 Cases have included "Customer Appreciation
Days," which generated 1.1% in comparable sales, and Kmart's Joe Boxer product
launch, which was the most successful in Kmart's history, generating over $140
million in sales during the first 18 weeks.

         Kmart's asset rationalization and optimization strategies, along with
the other business initiatives implemented throughout these Chapter 11 Cases,
have begun to bear positive results, including stabilization of the business and
improved liquidity. Although Kmart is confident that its performance will
continue to improve, the improvement has taken longer than expected to achieve.
And although Kmart has accomplished many important goals through the tools
afforded by Chapter 11, Kmart believes that the prospects for further
operational improvement will be best achieved outside of Chapter 11, and that
Chapter 11, in fact, is neither necessary nor conducive to moving forward with
the operational turnaround of the business.

         Among Kmart's key remaining operational challenges are the
all-important goal of continued enhancement of the in-store shopping experience
and the establishment of a clearly- defined pricing strategy designed to drive
sales and improve margins. However, these challenges, in Kmart's judgment, do
not require Chapter 11 and, in fact, are better addressed outside of Chapter 11.
In this respect, there are continued costs to remaining in Chapter 11 that
warrant emergence at this time, including customer perception regarding Kmart's
long-term viability that impacts sales of larger items and Kmart's layaway
program; the reluctance of new exclusive brand partners to do business with
Kmart; the concern of employees over job security; the continued administrative
costs of the Chapter 11 process; and the continued diversion of management time.

         As part of the process to emerge from Chapter 11, Kmart undertook a
thorough and detailed initiative to develop a five-year business plan. The
business plan was developed "bottoms up," i.e., on a store-by-store basis
utilizing assumptions specific to each store and guidance from field
organization personnel as well as at the merchant level where category group
sales and margin plans were developed by line of business. After a detailed
review by local management, the business plan underwent a similar review by
corporate personnel, and



                                       59
<PAGE>

finally a detailed review by Kmart's senior management. The business plan
includes the projections attached hereto as Appendix D.

         Under the business plan, the current 2003 fiscal year, part of which
will occur during the Chapter 11 Cases and part of which will occur after
emergence, will be a transition year and Kmart will not return to profitability
until 2004. Kmart projects that the business will continue to recover and that
EBITDA will grow to $1.3 billion by 2007. The business plan assumes moderate
annual increases in comparable store sales. Kmart's business has been extremely
difficult to forecast, partly because of the impact of Chapter 11 on in-stock
levels, but mostly because the expected return of customer store traffic to
levels that existed when Kmart filed for Chapter 11 protection have thus far not
yet materialized. However, management is implementing a number of initiatives
that it hopes will control the variance around sales and gross margin, including
reconciling the expectations of the merchant group with those of the field
organization; evaluating daily the need for markdowns by region and merchandise
category; and taking into account advertising plans and historical selling
experience.

         The business plan is premised on Kmart's continued implementation of
several key initiatives discussed above, including the "store of the
neighborhood" and further testing of the "store of the future." It also is
premised on continued optimization of Kmart's merchandising through elimination
of under-performing stock keeping units ("SKU's"), or individual items of
inventory, and the continued reallocation of shelf-space to more profitable
items. Marketing will focus on Kmart's exclusive brand identity. With the
continued support of its vendor partners through, among other things, the vendor
lien contemplated by the Plan and the $2 billion Exit Financing Facility, Kmart
anticipates being able to continue to improve its customer shopping experience
and ultimately returning to profitability.

                     VII. SUMMARY OF THE REORGANIZATION PLAN

         THIS SECTION PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF THE STRUCTURE, CLASSIFICATION,
TREATMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY
REFERENCE TO THE PLAN, WHICH ACCOMPANIES THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, AND TO THE
EXHIBITS ATTACHED THERETO.

         ALTHOUGH THE STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT INCLUDE
SUMMARIES OF THE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE PLAN AND IN DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO
THEREIN, THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A PRECISE OR COMPLETE
STATEMENT



                                       60
<PAGE>

OF ALL THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN OR DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO THEREIN,
AND REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE PLAN AND TO SUCH DOCUMENTS FOR THE FULL AND
COMPLETE STATEMENTS OF SUCH TERMS AND PROVISIONS.

         THE PLAN ITSELF AND THE DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO THEREIN WILL
CONTROL THE TREATMENT OF CREDITORS AND EQUITY SECURITY HOLDERS
UNDER THE PLAN AND WILL, UPON THE EFFECTIVE DATE, BE BINDING UPON HOLDERS OF
CLAIMS AGAINST, AND INTERESTS IN, THE DEBTORS, THE REORGANIZED DEBTORS, AND
OTHER PARTIES IN INTEREST.

A. OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE PLAN

         Shortly after filing for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code, the Debtors focused on the formulation of a plan of reorganization that
would allow them to quickly emerge from Chapter 11 and preserve their value as a
going concern. The Debtors recognize that in the competitive arena in which they
operate, a lengthy and uncertain Chapter 11 case would detrimentally affect the
confidence in the Debtors by their respective vendors and employees, further
impair their financial condition, and dim the prospects for a successful
reorganization. The terms of the Plan are based upon, among other things, the
Debtors' assessment of their ability to achieve the goals of the business plan,
make the distributions contemplated under the Plan, and pay their continuing
obligations in the ordinary course of the Reorganized Debtors' businesses.

         If the Plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and consummated, (1)
the Claims in certain Classes will be reinstated or modified and will receive
distributions equal to the full amount of such Claims and (2) the Claims and
Interests in other Classes will be modified or extinguished and will receive
distributions constituting, in most instances, a partial recovery. At certain
times after the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors will distribute Cash,
securities and other property in respect of certain Classes of Claims as
provided in the Plan. The Classes of Claims against the Debtors created under
the Plan, the treatment of those Classes under the Plan, and the securities and
other property to be distributed under the Plan are described below.

         1. Global Restructuring Settlement Proposal

                  (a) Background

         As explained above, Kmart is obligated to the Prepetition Lenders
pursuant to the terms of the Prepetition Credit Agreements. As of the
commencement of these Chapter 11 Cases, the total amount owed by Kmart under
these Agreements was approximately $1.08 billion. Certain subsidiaries of Kmart,
each of whom are Debtors in these Cases, guaranteed Kmart's obligations under
the Prepetition Credit Agreements pursuant to the terms of written guarantee
agreements (the "Subsidiary Guarantees"). The subsidiaries include Kmart of
Indiana, Kmart of Michigan, Inc., Kmart of North Carolina LLC, Kmart of
Pennsylvania LP, and Kmart of Texas L.P. (collectively, the "Kmart of []
Subsidiaries").

         From 1998 to 2000, Kmart transferred certain assets to the Kmart of []
Subsidiaries for various business planning reasons. Specifically, Kmart
transferred to each Kmart of [] Subsidiary the assets constituting the business
operations, including real estate and inventory



                                       61
<PAGE>

comprising the retail stores and certain distribution centers, located in the
respective states of each Kmart of [] Subsidiary. Thus, for instance, the real
estate and inventory located in the state of Michigan were transferred to Kmart
of Michigan, Inc. In exchange for the transfer of these assets, Kmart became
(either directly or indirectly) the owner of all of the equity of the Kmart of
[] Subsidiaries. At the time of the filing of these Chapter 11 Cases, the assets
held by the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries included 486 of Kmart's 2,114 stores. Thus,
approximately 20% of the Debtors' aggregate real estate and inventory were owned
by the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries at that time.

         In addition to the foregoing transfers by Kmart to the Kmart of []
Subsidiaries, by virtue of a series of transactions among Kmart and certain
subsidiaries, in October 2000, Kmart of Michigan, Inc. ("KMI") became the owner
of substantially all of the trademarks, service marks, and trade names used in
the Kmart business, including the name "Kmart," the big red K logo, "Super K"
and similar marks (collectively, the "Marks"). As with the other transfers to
the other Kmart of [] Subsidiaries, the transfers of the Marks were undertaken
for various business planning reasons. KMI licenses the Marks to Kmart and the
other Kmart of [] Subsidiaries in exchange for royalty fees at a contract rate
of approximately 1% of such entities' gross revenue. These royalty fees
presently average approximately $75 million per quarter. However, when Kmart
pays KMI the royalty fees, KMI immediately loans them back to Kmart (the
"Royalty Loan"). As of the commencement of these Chapter 11 Cases, KMI's total
Intercompany Claim against Kmart on account of the Royalty Loan was
approximately $316 million. For the period January 31, 2002 through October 30,
2002, KMI has loaned the sum of $229,757,777 to Kmart pursuant to the Royalty
Loan, which Loan may be subject to certain offsets and other defenses. The
Prepetition Lenders believe that the post-petition loans made by KMI to Kmart
under the Royalty Loan constitute Administrative Claims by KMI against Kmart's
Estate which must be paid in full from Kmart to KMI in accordance with the
Bankruptcy Code.

         The Kmart of [] Subsidiaries do not owe any material debt to any third
parties other than the Prepetition Lenders, by virtue of the Subsidiary
Guaranties, and to the PBGC, by virtue of their statutory joint and several
liability for certain pension-related obligations of Kmart. Thus, the Kmart of
[] Subsidiaries do not have any material trade debt obligations. This is because
all of the inventory for the stores owned by the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries is
purchased by Kmart, and then sold by Kmart to the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries under
the terms of certain Sales and Distribution Agreements between them. As
inventory is purchased and delivered (on an almost daily basis), Kmart
effectively charges the respective Kmart of [] Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Sales and Distribution Agreements. These charges effectively are paid for by
daily sweeps of the cash held in the Kmart of [] Subsidiary store deposit
accounts, which collectively comprise a centralized cash management system
utilized by all of the Debtors. Although the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries do not
have any material trade debt obligations, certain of them have various
obligations arising out of leases, mortgages, and other matters.

         The Prepetition Lenders hold substantially all of the pre-petition,
impaired, unsecured claims against the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries. The Prepetition
Lenders therefore have asserted that they believe they are entitled to
substantially all value in the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries, and that the
Prepetition Lender Claims thus must be paid in full, before any value
attributable to the assets of the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries may be upstreamed to
Kmart on account of its ownership interests in these Subsidiaries. As a result,
according to the Prepetition Lenders, creditors of Kmart, including trade
vendors and other unsecured creditors, may not be distributed any value



                                       62
<PAGE>

from the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries until the Prepetition Lenders are paid in full
on account of their claims against the Subsidiaries arising out of the
Subsidiary Guaranties.

         However, the Creditors' Committee has questioned the legal basis of the
Prepetition Lenders' Claims, including their asserted entitlement to the value
of the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries and the enforceability of the Subsidiary
Guaranties. As a result, the Creditors' Committee believes that the Prepetition
Lenders are entitled to significantly less on account of their claims, and that
general unsecured creditors therefore are entitled to significantly more on
account of their claims.

                  (b) Fraudulent Transfer Law

         The Creditors' Committee bases their theory on two, general types of
challenges. The first challenge is based upon the law of fraudulent transfers.
In this regard, the Creditors' Committee has asserted, among other things, that
(i) the transfers of Kmart's operating business assets to the Kmart of []
Subsidiaries were fraudulent transfers that should be avoided pursuant to ss.
544 and/or ss. 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, meaning that the value of such assets
would be available to all Kmart creditors, not just the Prepetition Lenders;
(ii) the transfer of the Marks to KMI was a fraudulent transfer that also should
be avoided pursuant to ss. 544 and/or ss. 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, meaning
that the value of the Marks also would be available to all Kmart creditors, not
just the Prepetition Lenders, and (iii) the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries' execution
of the Subsidiary Guarantees each constituted fraudulent transfers that should
be avoided pursuant to ss. 544 and/or ss. 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, meaning
that the Prepetition Lenders would have no prior claim to the value of the Kmart
of [] Subsidiaries by virtue of the Guarantees.

         In order to sustain an assertion that a particular transfer was a
fraudulent transfer under ss. 544 and/or ss. 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, the
Creditors' Committee generally would have to establish, among other things, that
the transfer was not made for "reasonably equivalent value" or for "less than
fair consideration," and that the transfer was made at a time when the
transferor was insolvent; that the transfer rendered the transferor insolvent;
that the transfer left the transferor with an unreasonably small capital; that
the assets remaining with the transferor after the transfer were unreasonably
small in relation to the business to be operated by the transferor; or that the
transfer was made at a time when the transferor knew or should have known that
it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they came due.

         In applying these legal principles to the assertions of the Creditors'
Committee, the transfers of Kmart's operating business assets to the Kmart of []
Subsidiaries would be fraudulent if, for instance, the Creditors' Committee
established that Kmart did not receive "reasonably equivalent value" or "fair
consideration" from the Subsidiaries in exchange for its transfer to them of the
operating assets. One aspect of this argument is that the transfers were not
publicly announced; that general trade creditors relied upon the
creditworthiness of Kmart in extending trade terms; that such creditors believed
Kmart retained all operating assets; and that as a result, Kmart's transfer of
the operating assets to the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries, while incurring trade debt
for their benefit, resulted in Kmart not receiving "reasonably equivalent value"
or "fair consideration" in return for the transfer. The Prepetition Lenders
could counter, however, that Kmart did receive "reasonably equivalent value" and
"fair consideration" by its receipt of the ownership interests in the Kmart of
[] Subsidiaries, and through its charge-back to the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries of
the costs of inventory that it acquired on their behalf. A similar



                                       63
<PAGE>

analysis can be made with respect to the transfer of the Marks to KMI; Kmart's
receipt of the stock of KMI; and the Intercompany Claims maintained between
Kmart and KMI on account of the Royalty Loan.

         In applying the foregoing legal principles to the suggestion that the
Kmart of [] Subsidiaries' execution of the Subsidiary Guarantees each
constituted fraudulent transfers, meaning that the Prepetition Lenders should
have no prior claim to the value of the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries by virtue of
the Guarantees, the Creditors' Committee would have to establish that the Kmart
of [] Subsidiaries did not receive "reasonably equivalent value" or "fair
consideration" for the debt obligations that they incurred when they executed
the Subsidiary Guarantees. One aspect of this argument is that a company does
not necessarily derive any material benefit by agreeing to pay the debts of
another, especially where, as in the case of KMI, the guarantee was executed
after the primary obligor became indebted on the debt. This argument could be
countered, however, by the observation that affiliated entities like the Kmart
of [] Subsidiaries obtain benefits from jointly guaranteeing one another's debts
through the greater purchasing power afforded by a larger line of credit that in
turn complements the synergies of their operations. As for the requirement that
the transferor was "insolvent" at the time of the transfer, the Creditors'
Committee would have to establish, for instance, that the amount of each Kmart
of [] Subsidiary's debts was greater than its assets as a consequence of
becoming obligated on the Subsidiary Guarantees. This would in turn require
estimated valuations of their assets at the time they executed the Subsidiary
Guarantees.

                  (c) The Law of Substantive Consolidation

         The second challenge of the Creditors' Committee to the legal basis of
the Prepetition Lenders' asserted entitlement to all the value of the Kmart of
[] Subsidiaries and the enforceability of the Subsidiary Guaranties is based
generally on notions of substantive consolidation. In particular, the Creditors'
Committee has suggested that (i) the separate corporate entities of Kmart and
the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries should be disregarded pursuant to "alter ego"
and/or "piercing of the corporate veil" theories, thereby resulting in a pooling
of their assets for the benefit of all creditors, not just the Prepetition
Lenders, and (ii) each of the bankruptcy estates of Kmart and the Kmart of []
Subsidiaries should be "substantively consolidated," again meaning that the
assets of the various Kmart entities are pooled for the benefit of all
creditors. Because the legal standards for invoking these doctrines are very
similar, they are discussed in this Disclosure Statement under the rubric of
"substantive consolidation."

         Generally, substantive consolidation of the estates of multiple debtors
in a bankruptcy case effectively combines the assets and liabilities of the
multiple debtors for certain purposes under a plan. The effect of consolidation
is the pooling of the assets of, and claims against, the consolidated debtors;
satisfying liabilities from a common fund; and combining the creditors of the
debtors for purposes of receiving distributions under reorganization plans. The
authority of a Bankruptcy Court to order substantive consolidation is found by
most courts to be derived from its general equitable powers under Section 105(a)
of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides that the court may issue orders necessary
to carry out the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. In addition, courts have
found that statutory authority exists for the approval of substantive
consolidation as a part of a plan of reorganization under the terms of Section
1123(a)(5)(C) of the Bankruptcy Code. However, there are no statutorily
prescribed standards setting forth the


                                       64
<PAGE>

parameters for when substantive consolidation is appropriate. Instead,
judicially developed standards control whether substantive consolidation should
be granted in any given case.

         Thus, the propriety of substantive consolidation must be evaluated on a
case-by-case basis based upon the particular facts and circumstances of the
estates in question. The extensive list of elements and factors frequently cited
and relied upon by courts in determining the propriety of substantive
consolidation may be viewed as variants on two critical factors, namely, (i)
whether creditors dealt with the entities as a single economic unit and did not
rely on their separate identity in extending credit or (ii) whether the affairs
of the debtors are so entangled that consolidation will benefit all creditors.
Some courts have viewed these elements and factors as examples of information
that may be useful to courts charged with deciding whether there is substantial
identity between the entities to be consolidated and whether consolidation is
necessary to avoid some harm or to realize some benefit.

         In applying the foregoing principles to Kmart and the Kmart of []
Subsidiaries, the Creditors' Committee could argue that most general unsecured
creditors dealt with the Kmart entities as a single economic unit, and did not
extend credit in reliance upon their separate corporate identities. Indeed, the
Kmart companies collectively operate retail store operations under the "Kmart"
brand name, and are essentially in the same line of business, or conduct
operations, or hold real estate or other assets that support such line of
business. The Committee also could argue that the affairs of the Kmart entities
are so entangled that they should be substantively consolidated and therefore
treated as a single entity for the benefit of all creditors. For instance, the
Debtors historically have issued consolidated financial statements and filed
consolidated federal tax returns through Kmart. Moreover, Kmart, through its
corporate department, provides services to all Kmart entities, including
accounting and bookkeeping, treasury, legal, tax, information systems,
administrative, real estate management, store planning, construction and design,
human resources administration, and similar "back office" corporate services.
Finally, the Kmart entities share a centralized cash management system. The
system allows Kmart to collect funds received by all Debtors through a series of
transactions and to disburse the funds through disbursement accounts to pay for
operating expenses related to all Debtors.

         The Prepetition Lenders could counter, however, that not all creditors
dealt with the Kmart entities as a single economic unit - indeed, the
Prepetition Lenders obtained separate Subsidiary Guarantees from each Kmart of
[] Subsidiary - and that the affairs of the entities are not hopelessly
entangled. In fact, Kmart and the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries are each parties to
their own separately identified real estate leases and executory contracts, and
each owns its own inventory and real estate. Perhaps most importantly, the
Prepetition Lenders could argue that substantive consolidation would harm them
in violation of one of the key requirements that substantive consolidation be in
the best interests of all creditors. This is so because if the Kmart entities
were substantively consolidated, the Subsidiary Guarantees would be eliminated,
and the Prepetition Lenders' asserted priority entitlement to the value of the
Kmart of [] Subsidiaries therefore would be lost. Instead, the Prepetition
Lenders would effectively have only one claim against the consolidated pool of
assets, and their anticipated recovery on that single claim would be diluted by
the claims of all other unsecured creditors.




                                       65
<PAGE>
                  (d) The Reasons for Settlement

         It is apparent from the foregoing discussion that the histories of
Kmart's transfer of certain operating assets to the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries;
the transfer of the Marks to KMI; and the execution of the Subsidiary Guaranties
are long and complex. There are thousands of pages of documents evidencing the
various transfers. The legal theories relating to these matters, including the
law of fraudulent transfers and the law of substantive consolidation, are
particularly complicated as applied to the detailed facts evidencing these
transactions. Representatives of Kmart, the Prepetition Lenders, and the
Creditors' Committee have devoted a significant amount of time researching the
facts and the law applicable to these matters, and have spent innumerable hours
analyzing, discussing, and negotiating with one another regarding possible
litigation and settlement of the issues.

         Indeed, consistent with their fiduciary duty to maximize the value of
these Estates for all constituencies, the Debtors have carefully analyzed and
evaluated the various claims of the Prepetition Lenders and the Creditors'
Committee. In the event litigation were to be commenced among the parties
concerning the Subsidiary Guaranties, the Debtors likely would take a position
in such litigation absent compromise by the parties upon terms such as those
proposed in this Plan.

         Clearly, any litigation concerning these matters would be exceptionally
complicated and protracted, and given the magnitude of the values involved and
the amount of claims at stake, would be hotly contested and expensive. Such
litigation would in turn substantially prolong these Chapter 11 Cases, which all
constituencies believe is not in the best interests of the estates or Kmart's
long-term prospects for rehabilitation. The outcome of any such litigation is
not free from doubt for any party in interest, including Kmart, the Prepetition
Lenders, and the Creditors' Committee, as there are strengths and weaknesses in
each of the parties' positions, and hence, risks to their anticipated recoveries
in litigating these matters to judgment. For instance, as pointed out above in
connection with the discussion of whether Kmart received "reasonably equivalent
value" in exchange for the transfer of certain operating assets to the Kmart of
[] Subsidiaries, each of the Prepetition Lenders and the Creditors' Committee
have legitimate legal and factual points in support of their respective
positions. The situation is complicated by the added uncertainty concerning each
party's ability to prove historical values and events that are long-since
passed.

         For these reasons, including, in particular, the need for Kmart to
emerge from Chapter 11 quickly so that going-concern value may be preserved for
the benefit of all constituencies, the Debtors propose a global settlement of
their claims, embodied by the Plan, that affords distributions to their
constituencies commensurate with the risks of their litigation positions. Under
Section 1123(b)(3)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code and Rule 9019 of the Bankruptcy
Rules, a settlement such as the settlement proposed in the Plan should be
approved if it represents a reasonable compromise that is in the collective best
interests of all constituencies in light of the risks of continued litigation.
The settlement need not afford the best possible recovery to any particular
constituency, but instead need only represent a recovery that falls within a
reasonable range of litigation possibilities. Kmart, believes that the
settlement contemplated by the Plan satisfies these standards.

         Under the settlement, the Kmart entities will be substantively
consolidated, but only for distribution purposes. This means that, in order to
assist implementation of the settlement, each creditor will have only one claim
against the pool of value reserved for the particular class of



                                       66
<PAGE>

which such creditor is a member. The actual assets of the Kmart entities,
however, will not be consolidated together, and the separate legal identity of
each Kmart Debtor will be maintained, subject to the various corporate
restructuring transactions contemplated by the Plan. Thus, for instance, the
Prepetition Lenders effectively have one claim for purposes of distributing the
value allocated to them under the Plan. This structure avoids complications that
arise in connection with calculating and making distributions on account of
their individual, separate claims against Kmart under the Prepetition Credit
Agreements and against the Kmart of [] Subsidiaries on account of the Subsidiary
Guarantees. In this fashion, there is a single, global settlement with respect
to each class of Claims under the Plan.

         2. The Plan Investor Transactions

                  (a) Description of the Plan Investors

         As briefly summarized above, two entities - ESL Investments, Inc.
("ESL") and Third Avenue Trust, on behalf of certain of its investment series
("Third Avenue," and together with ESL, the "Plan Investors") - have agreed to
make a substantial investment in the Reorganized Debtors in furtherance of the
Debtors' financial and operational restructuring plan. The investment will be
made pursuant to an Investment Agreement dated as of January 24, 2003 (the
"Investment Agreement"), summarized below. A copy of the Investment Agreement is
attached as Exhibit E to the Plan. ESL and Third Avenue are members of the
Financial Institutions' Committee. ESL holds approximately $384 million
principal amount of Prepetition Lender Claims, approximately $1.162 billion
principal amount of Prepetition Note Claims, and approximately $62 million in
Trade Vendor/Lease Rejection Claims, and Trust Preferred Obligations; and Third
Avenue holds approximately $99 million principal amount of Prepetition Note
Claims and approximately $79 million in Trade Vendor/Lease Rejection Claims.

                  (b) Summary of the Plan Investor Investment Agreement

         Under the Plan, shares of New Holding Company Common Stock will be
issued to the Prepetition Lenders in satisfaction of the Prepetition Lender
Claims, provided that Reorganized Kmart shall purchase such shares from the
Lenders for an amount equal to forty percent (40%) of the principal amount of
their Claims. Under the Investment Agreement, the Plan Investors have agreed to
purchase such shares of New Holding Company Common Stock with an aggregate value
of $140 million (the "Plan Investor Shares"), and ESL has agreed to purchase
additional shares of New Holding Company Common Stock with a value equal to
approximately $153.4 million (the "ESL Prepetition Obligation Shares" and,
together with the Plan Investor Shares, the "Total Investor Shares"), for a
total amount of approximately $293.4 million. Of this amount, approximately
$153.4 million will be comprised of cash to be received by ESL pursuant to the
Plan on account of its Prepetition Lender Claims (which amount may increase
should ESL acquire Additional Prepetition Lender Claims and elect to use the
cash to be received in a similar fashion) and the remaining $140 million
represents an additional investment to be made by the Plan Investors pursuant to
the terms of the Investment Agreement.

         ESL shall purchase 78.21% of the Plan Investor Shares, and Third Avenue
shall purchase 21.79% of the Plan Investor Shares. At the Effective Date, the
Reorganized Debtor shall have an unconditional and irrevocable right (the
"Initial Company Call"), exercisable in its sole discretion, to require ESL to
purchase from the Reorganized Debtor a note (the "Initial



                                       67
<PAGE>

Called Note") in an aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (i) $60
million (the "Maximum Company Call Amount"), and (ii) the excess, if any, of
$1,545 billion over the Company's Liquidity (as hereinafter defined) at the
Effective Date, reduced by the amount of all payments and distributions to be
made on the Effective Date of the Plan or required to be paid in respect of
prepetition and/or priority claims (other than priority claims in respect of
postpetition payables) pursuant to the Plan, at a purchase price equal to the
principal amount of the Initial Called Note. For purposes of the Investment
Agreement, (i) "Liquidity" shall mean, at any time, Excess Availability at such
time plus the Cash Balance at such time and (ii) "Cash Balance" shall mean, at
any time, the aggregate amount of the Kmart's and its Subsidiaries' unrestricted
cash, cash equivalents and short term investments at such time, calculated in
the manner consistent with the Business Plan (but exclusive of cash necessary
for store operations, which amount is agreed to be equal to three hundred
million dollars ($300,000,000)).

         Additionally, if the Reorganized Debtors discover, during the 90 day
period following the Effective Date, that the aggregate amount of payments
required to be made pursuant to the Plan [in respect of prepetition and/or
priority claims] are or will be in excess of those actually paid at the
Effective Date (such excess, the "Excess Distributions"), the Reorganized Debtor
shall have an unconditional and irrevocable right, in its sole discretion, to
require ESL to purchase from the Reorganized Debtor a subordinate, convertible
note (the "Subsequent Called Note," and, together with the Initial Called Note,
the "Called Notes") in an aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (i)
the amount of the Excess Distributions, and (ii) the excess, if any, of $60
million over the original principal amount of the Initial Called Note, at a
price equal to the principal amount of such Subsequent Called Note; provided
that if the difference of Liquidity at the Effective Date minus the amount of
the Excess Distributions is in excess (such excess, the "Excess Cash Balance")
of one billion five hundred forty five million ($1,545,000,000), then the amount
of the Subsequent Called Note required to be purchased by ESL shall be reduced
dollar for dollar by the amount of the Excess Cash Balance. The aggregate amount
of the Initial Called Note and the Subsequent Called Note will not exceed $60
million.

         In addition, ESL has agreed to purchase additional shares of New
Holding Company Common Stock with a value equal to (i) the aggregate amount of
cash that ESL is entitled to receive under the Plan based on its holdings of
Prepetition Lender Claims as of the date of the Investment Agreement, and (ii)
such portion as ESL may in its sole discretion designate of the aggregate amount
of cash that ESL is entitled to receive under the Plan based on its holdings of
Prepetition Lender Claims acquired after the date of the Investment Agreement.

         The purchase price that the Plan Investors will pay for the shares is
$10 per share, assuming a valuation for the New Holding Company Stock of
approximately $1 billion, less the amount of cash paid to Prepetition Lenders
pursuant to the Plan. The Investment Agreement provides ESL with a two-year
option to invest an additional $86 million through the purchase of shares of New
Holding Company Common Stock, at an option price of $13 per share. ESL has also
agreed, from the Effective Date until the earlier of (i) the first anniversary
of the Effective Date and (ii) the date on which all of the Non-Lender Unsecured
Claims are reconciled, it will not transfer or otherwise dispose of more than
twenty percent (20%) of the Plan Investors' Shares, other than to any other Plan
Investor or an Affiliate thereof or in connection with a sale of the Reorganized
Debtor in its entirety.



                                       68
<PAGE>

         The Investment Agreement provides that in the event that the
Reorganized Debtors determine during the 90 day period following the Effective
Date that the aggregate amount of payments required to be made pursuant to the
Plan in respect of prepetition and/or priority claims (other than priority
claims in respect of postpetition payables) are or will be in excess of those
actually paid at the Closing (such excess, the "Excess Distributions"), the
Reorganized Debtor shall have an unconditional and irrevocable right, in its
sole discretion, to require ESL to purchase from the Reorganized Debtor a note
(the "Subsequent Called Note," and, together with the Initial Called Note, the
"Called Notes"), which Subsequent Called Note shall be in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the lesser of (1) the excess, if any, of (A) $1,545 billion over
(B)(i) the Company's Liquidity at the Effective Date (after giving effect to all
payments and borrowings made at the Effective Date other than in respect of
postpetition payables), reduced by (ii) the amount of any Excess Distributions,
and (2) the excess, if any, of $60 million over the principal amount of the
Initial Called Note, at a purchase price equal to the principal amount of the
Subsequent Called Note. The Investment Agreement provides that the aggregate of
the principal amounts of the Initial Called Note and the Subsequent Called Note,
if either or both shall be issued, shall not exceed $60 million.

         The Investment Agreement restricts the Debtors' ability to enter into
alternative agreements with other plan sponsors or investors. Until the earlier
of the Effective Date and the termination of the Investment Agreement, unless
the board of directors of Kmart determines in good faith that it is necessary or
desirable to authorize such actions in connection with the administration of the
Bankruptcy Cases or that it is required to authorize such actions to comply with
its fiduciary duties under applicable law, Kmart and the Affiliate Debtors are
not permitted to (i) solicit, initiate or take any other action designed to
solicit a proposal or offer for a restructuring transaction or plan of
reorganization or similar transaction, (ii) participate in discussions or
negotiations related thereto, (iii) enter into a letter of intent or other
agreement related thereto, or (iv) furnish non-public information, except in
limited circumstances. The foregoing notwithstanding, if Kmart receives an
unsolicited writing from a party indicating that such party is considering
making, or has made a bona fide alternative proposal or has notified Kmart prior
to the date of the Investment Agreement that it is considering making or has
made a bona fide alternative proposal, Kmart is permitted to enter into
discussions or negotiations with, or provide information to, such party. In
addition, Kmart may enter into an agreement with such party for an alternate
transaction, so long as (i) the alternative proposal provides a higher
transaction value or is otherwise more favorable to Kmart and its creditors,
(ii) the board of directors reasonably believes in good faith (after
consultation with its outside advisors) that authorizing the transaction is
consistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (iii) the Plan
Investors fail to match any such offer.

         As further conditions to the Plan Investors' Investment obligations
under the Investment Agreement, the proposed Exit Financing Facility must have
been executed and be in full force and effect, and the Reorganized Debtors must
have Excess Availability of at least $1.25 billion and Adjusted Excess
Availability of at least $589,000,000. The Debtors presently estimate that their
Excess Availability as of the Effective Date of the Plan will be sufficient to
satisfy this condition. An additional condition to the Plan Investors'
Investment obligations under the Investment Agreement is that the Plan be
approved by the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to the Confirmation Order and have an
Effective Date no later than May 30, 2003.



                                       69
<PAGE>
         There are certain fees and expenses payable to the Plan Investors under
the Investment Agreement. In particular, unless the Plan Investors are in
material breach of their obligations under the Investment Agreement or the
Investment Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms (except for
termination by Kmart or by ESL as a result of or in connection with an alternate
transaction), Kmart is required to pay to ESL a commitment fee equal to $10
million upon the earlier of May 30, 2003, the Effective Date of the Plan and the
date of termination, if the Investment Agreement is terminated by Kmart or by
ESL as a result of or in connection with an alternate transaction. The Debtors
intend to seek to obtain an order from the Bankruptcy Court at the omnibus
hearing scheduled to be held on February 28, 2003, approving payment of the
commitment fee upon satisfaction of the conditions for payment thereof under the
Investment Agreement.

         The Investment Agreement also provides that Kmart will pay up to $5
million of ESL's expenses, which amounts will be required to be repaid if the
Investment Agreement is terminated due to a breach by the Plan Investors. Up to
$2 million of the expenses will be payable as of the date of the hearing
approving the commitment fee, with the remainder payable on the Effective Date
or the termination date of the Investment Agreement, other than as a result of
breach by the Plan Investors.

         The Investment Agreement may be terminated if, among other things: the
Debtors do not meet certain deadlines, including obtaining entry of an order
approving the Disclosure Statement by February 28, 2003, obtaining entry of an
order confirming the Plan by May 16, 2003, and closing on the Investment
Agreement by May 30, 2003; the Debtors withdraw their support of the Investment
Agreement, recommend an alternative investment proposal, or enter into a written
agreement for an alternative investment proposal; certain conditions to closing
are not satisfied or waived by the Plan Investors or the Company; or certain
other conditions outlined in more detail in the Investment Agreement are not
fulfilled.

                  (c) Plan Investor Ownership of New Holding Company Common
                      Stock

         As noted above, ESL holds approximately $1.62 billion in unsecured debt
claims. ESL has agreed that it will purchase shares of New Holding Company
Common Stock on account of the Prepetition Lender Claims that ESL holds as of
the date of the Investment Agreement. Thus, ESL will receive exclusively New
Holding Company Common Stock on account of such Claims. It will also receive
additional New Holding Company Common Stock based on its purchase of 78.21% of
the Plan Investors' Shares, New Holding Company Common Stock on account of its
Prepetition Note Claims pursuant to the terms of the Plan, and, in the
discretion of ESL, New Holding Company Common Stock on account of Prepetition
Lender Claims that it acquires after the date of the Investment Agreement. In
addition, ESL will have the right (i) to convert the Called Notes into New
Holding Company Stock at its discretion and (ii) to invest an additional $86
million through the purchase of shares of New Holding Company Common Stock.
Based on these assumption and the amount of Claims held by ESL as of the date of
the Investment Agreement, ESL could hold over 40% of all shares of New Holding
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Date. Based on
these assumptions and the amount of Claims held by Third Avenue, Third Avenue
could hold approximately 10% of all shares of New Holding Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Date.

B. CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF CLAIMS AND INTERESTS

         Section 1122 of the Bankruptcy Code requires that a plan of
reorganization classify the claims of a debtor's creditors and the interests of
its equity holders. The Bankruptcy Code also provides that, except for certain
claims classified for administrative convenience, a plan of reorganization may
place a claim of a creditor or an interest of an equity holder in a particular
class only if such claim or interest is substantially similar to the other
claims of such class. The Bankruptcy Code also requires that a plan of
reorganization provide the same treatment for each claim or interest of a
particular class unless the holder of a particular claim or interest agrees to a
less favorable treatment of its claim or interest.

         The Debtors believe that they have classified all Claims and Interests
in compliance with the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. If a Creditor or
Interest holder challenges such classification of Claims or Interests and the
Bankruptcy Court finds that a different classification is required for the Plan
to be confirmed, the Debtors, to the extent permitted by the Bankruptcy Court,
intend to make such reasonable modifications of the classifications of Claims or
Interests under the Plan to provide for whatever classification might be
required by the Bankruptcy Court for confirmation.

         EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH MODIFICATION OF CLASSIFICATION ADVERSELY
AFFECTS THE TREATMENT OF A HOLDER OF A CLAIM OR INTEREST AND REQUIRES
RESOLICITATION, ACCEPTANCE OF THE PLAN BY ANY HOLDER OF A CLAIM PURSUANT TO THIS
SOLICITATION WILL BE DEEMED TO BE A CONSENT TO THE PLAN'S TREATMENT OF SUCH
HOLDER OF A CLAIM REGARDLESS OF THE CLASS AS TO WHICH SUCH HOLDER ULTIMATELY IS
DEEMED TO BE A MEMBER.

         1. Treatment of Unclassified Claims

                  (a) Administrative Claims

         Administrative Claims consist of the costs and expenses of the
administration of the Chapter 11 Cases incurred by the Debtors. Such costs and
expenses may include with respect to a particular Debtor, but are not limited
to, Claims arising under the cost of operating the business since the Petition
Date, the outstanding unpaid fees and expenses of the professionals retained by
the Debtors, the Creditors' Committees and the Equity Committee as approved by
the Bankruptcy Court, and the payments necessary to cure prepetition defaults on
unexpired leases and executory contracts that are being assumed under the Plan.
All payments to professionals in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases for
compensation and reimbursement of expenses and all payments to reimburse
expenses of members of the Creditors' Committees and Equity Committee will be
made in accordance with the procedures established by the Bankruptcy Code and
the Bankruptcy Rules and are subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court as
being reasonable.

         Subject to the provisions of the Plan, on the first Periodic
Distribution Date occurring after the later of (a) the date an Administrative
Claim becomes an Allowed Administrative Claim or (b) the date an Administrative
Claim becomes payable pursuant to any agreement between a Debtor (or a
Reorganized Debtor) and the holder of such Administrative Claim, an



                                       71
<PAGE>

Allowed Administrative Claimholder in the Chapter 11 Cases shall receive, in
full satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge of, and in exchange for,
such Administrative Claim, (i) Cash equal to the unpaid portion of such Allowed
Administrative Claim or (ii) such other treatment as to which the Debtors (or
the Reorganized Debtors) and such Claimholder shall have agreed upon in writing;
provided, however, that (x) Claimholders of Claims arising under the DIP
Facility shall be deemed to have Allowed Claims as of the Effective Date in such
amount as to which the Debtors and such Claimholders shall have agreed upon in
writing or as determined by the Bankruptcy Court, which DIP Facility Claims
shall be paid in accordance with Article 10.1 of the Plan, (y) the Plan
Investors shall be deemed to have an Allowed Plan Investor Claim arising under
the Investment Agreement in such amount as to which the Debtors and the Plan
Investors shall have agreed upon in writing or as fixed by the Bankruptcy Court,
which Plan Investor Claim shall be paid in full in Cash on the Effective Date,
and (z) Allowed Administrative Claims with respect to liabilities incurred by
the Debtors in the ordinary course of business during the Chapter 11 Cases shall
be paid in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the terms and
conditions of any agreements relating thereto.

                  (b) Priority Tax Claims

         Commencing on the first Periodic Distribution Date occurring after the
later of (a) the date a Priority Tax Claim becomes an Allowed Priority Tax Claim
or (b) the date a Priority Tax Claim first becomes payable pursuant to any
agreement between a Debtor (or a Reorganized Debtor) and the holder of such
Priority Tax Claim, at the sole option of the Debtors (or the Reorganized
Debtors after the Effective Date), such Allowed Priority Tax Claimholder shall
be entitled to receive on account of such Priority Tax Claim, in full
satisfaction, settlement, release and discharge of, and in exchange for, such
Priority Tax Claim, (i) equal Cash payments on the last Business Day of each
three-month period following the Effective Date, during a period not to exceed
six years after the assessment of the tax on which such Claim is based, totaling
the principal amount of such Claim plus simple interest on any outstanding
balance from the Effective Date calculated at the interest rate available on
ninety (90) day United States Treasuries on the Effective Date, (ii) such other
treatment agreed to by the Allowed Priority Tax Claimholder and the Debtors (or
the Reorganized Debtors), provided such treatment is on more favorable terms to
the Debtors (or the Reorganized Debtors after the Effective Date) than the
treatment set forth in clause (i) hereof, or (iii) payment in full in Cash.

         2. Treatment of Classified Claims and Interests

         Pursuant to section 1122 of the Bankruptcy Code, set forth below is a
designation of classes of Claims against and Interests in the Debtors. A Claim
or Interest is placed in a particular Class for the purposes of voting on the
Plan and of receiving distributions pursuant to the Plan only to the extent that
such Claim or Interest is an Allowed Claim or an Allowed Interest in that Class
and such Claim or Interest has not been paid, released, or otherwise settled
prior to the Effective Date. In accordance with section 1123(a)(1) of the
Bankruptcy Code, Administrative Claims and Priority Tax Claims of the kinds
specified in sections 507(a)(1) and 507(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code have not
been classified and their treatment is set forth above. The Plan, though
proposed jointly, constitutes a separate plan proposed by each of the Debtors.
Therefore, except as expressly specified herein, the classifications set forth
below shall be deemed to apply separately with respect to each plan proposed by
each such Debtor.



                                       72
<PAGE>

                  (a) Classes of Claims that are Unimpaired

                           (i) Class 1 (Secured Claims).

         Class 1 consists of separate subclasses for all Secured Claims that may
exist against a particular Debtor. A "Secured Claim" means a Claim secured by a
security interest in or a lien on property in which a Debtor's Estate has an
interest or that is subject to setoff under section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code,
to the extent of the value, as of the Effective Date or such other date as is
established by the Bankruptcy Court, of such Claimholder's interest in the
applicable Estate's interest in such property or to the extent of the amount
subject to setoff, as applicable, as determined by a Final Order of the
Bankruptcy Court pursuant to section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or in the
case of setoff, pursuant to section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code, or as otherwise
agreed upon in writing by the Debtors and the Claimholder.

         Except as otherwise provided in and subject to Section 9.8 of the Plan,
at the sole option of the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors, (i) the legal,
equitable, and contractual rights of each Allowed Secured Claimholder shall be
Reinstated or (ii) each Allowed Secured Claimholder shall receive, in full
satisfaction, settlement and release of, and in exchange for, its Allowed
Secured Claim (A) Cash in an amount equal to the value of the Secured
Claimholder's interest in the property of the Estate which constitutes
collateral for such Allowed Secured Claim, or (B) the property of the Estate
which constitutes collateral for such Allowed Secured Claim, or (C) such other
treatment as to which the Debtors (or the Reorganized Debtors) and the holder of
such Allowed Secured Claim have agreed upon in writing, provided that such
treatment is not more favorable than the treatment in clause (A) or clause (B)
above. The Debtors' failure to object to such Secured Claims in their Chapter 11
Cases shall be without prejudice to the Reorganized Debtors' right to contest or
otherwise defend against such Claims in the Bankruptcy Court or other
appropriate non-bankruptcy forum (at the option of the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors) when and if such Claims are sought to be enforced by the
Secured Claimholder. Notwithstanding section 1141(c) or any other provision of
the Bankruptcy Code, all prepetition liens on property of the Debtors held by or
on behalf of the Secured Claimholders with respect to such Claims shall survive
the Effective Date and continue in accordance with the contractual terms of the
underlying agreements with such Claimholders until, as to each such Claimholder,
the Allowed Claims of such Secured Claimholder are paid in full.

         "Reinstated" or "Reinstatement" means (a) leaving unaltered the legal,
equitable and contractual rights to which a Claim entitles the Claimholder so as
to leave such Claim Unimpaired in accordance with section 1124 of the Bankruptcy
Code, or (b) notwithstanding any contractual provision or applicable law that
entitles the Claimholder to demand or receive accelerated payment of such Claim
after the occurrence of a default (i) curing any such default that occurred
before or after the Petition Date, other than a default of a kind specified in
section 365(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (ii) reinstating the maturity of such
Claim as such maturity existed before such default; (iii) compensating the
Claimholder for any damages incurred as a result of any reasonable reliance by
such Claimholder on such contractual provision or such applicable law; and (iv)
not otherwise altering the legal, equitable or contractual rights to which such
Claim entitles the Claimholder; provided, however, that any contractual right
that does not pertain to the payment when due of principal and interest on the
obligation on which such Claim is based, including, but not limited to,
financial covenant ratios, negative pledge covenants, covenants or restrictions
on merger or consolidation, "going dark" provisions, and affirmative



                                       73
<PAGE>

covenants regarding corporate existence prohibiting certain transactions or
actions contemplated by the Plan, or conditioning such transactions or actions
on certain factors, shall not be required to be cured or reinstated in order to
accomplish Reinstatement.

                      (ii) Class 2 (Other Priority Claims).

         Class 2 consists of all Other Priority Claims that may exist against a
particular Debtor. An "Other Priority Claim" means a Claim entitled to priority
pursuant to section 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code other than a Priority Tax
Claim or an Administrative Claim. Except as otherwise provided in and subject to
Section 9.8 of the Plan, on the first Periodic Distribution Date occurring after
the later of (i) the date an Other Priority Claim becomes an Allowed Other
Priority Claim or (ii) the date an Other Priority Claim becomes payable pursuant
to any agreement between the Debtors (or the Reorganized Debtors) and the holder
of such Other Priority Claim, each Allowed Other Priority Claimholder shall
receive, in full satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge of, and in
exchange for, such Other Priority Claim, (a) Cash in an amount equal to the
amount of such Allowed Other Priority Claim or (b) such other treatment as to
which the Debtors (or the Reorganized Debtors) and such Claimholder shall have
agreed upon in writing, provided that such treatment is not more favorable than
the treatment in clause (a) or clause (b) above. The Debtors' failure to object
to an Other Priority Claim in their Chapter 11 Cases shall be without prejudice
to the Reorganized Debtors' right to contest or otherwise defend against such
Claim in the Bankruptcy Court or other appropriate non- bankruptcy forum (at the
option of the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors) when and if such Claim is
sought to be enforced by the Other Priority Claimholder.

                      (iii) Class 3 (PBGC Claims).

         Class 3 consists of all PBGC Claims that may exist against a particular
Debtor. The term "PBGC Claims" means all Claims of the PBGC against any of the
Debtors and all claims of the PBGC against any non-Debtor Affiliate of any
Debtor. Except as otherwise provided in and subject to Section 9.8 of the Plan,
the PBGC shall receive, in full satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge
of, and in exchange for, all PBGC Claims, whether asserted against Kmart or any
Affiliate Debtor, the same legal, equitable, and contractual rights to which it
would be entitled with respect to the PBGC Claims under applicable
non-bankruptcy law. The legal, equitable, and contractual rights of the PBGC
with respect to all PBGC Claims, whether against Kmart or any Affiliate Debtor,
therefore shall be Reinstated. The Debtors' failure to object to the PBGC Claims
in their Chapter 11 Cases shall be without prejudice to the Reorganized Debtors'
right to contest or otherwise defend against such Claims in the Bankruptcy Court
or other appropriate non-bankruptcy forum (at the option of the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors) when and if such Claims are sought to be enforced by the
PBGC.

                  (b) Classes of Claims that are Impaired

                      (i) Class 4 (Prepetition Lender Claims).

         Class 4 consists of all Prepetition Lender Claims. The term

Prepetition Credit Agreements, which include, collectively, (a) that certain

J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. (f/k/a Chase Securities, Inc.), as Lead

Beaver Guaynabo, Bluelight, and SFPR. Kmart is a direct obligor under the
Prepetition Credit Agreements, whereas the other Debtors identified in the
preceding sentence are guarantors of Kmart's obligations under such Agreements.

         The Prepetition Lender Claims are Allowed Prepetition Lender Claims in
the aggregate amount of $1,080,459,000. On the Distribution Date, the
Prepetition Lenders shall receive, in full satisfaction, settlement, release,
and discharge of, and in exchange for, their Prepetition Lender Claims, Cash in
an amount equal to forty percent (40%) of the principal amount of such
Prepetition Lender Claims, with such consideration representing a compromise and
settlement, pursuant to section 1123(b)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy
Rule 9019, of the Prepetition Lender Claims, including such Claims relating to
guarantees by certain Affiliate Debtors of Kmart's obligations under the
Prepetition Credit Agreements and issues related to the substantive
consolidation of the Debtors as contemplated by this Plan, provided, however,
that the Plan Investors shall be deemed to utilize Cash that they are entitled
to receive pursuant to this Article 5.4, plus additional amounts to be paid by
the Plan Investors pursuant to the Investment Agreement, to purchase the Total
Investor Shares pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement. All
distributions to Prepetition Lenders other than the Plan Investors under this
Article 5.4 shall be made to the Prepetition Agent under the Prepetition Credit

with the terms of the Prepetition Credit Agreements.

                     (ii) Class 5 (Prepetition Note Claims).

         Class 5 consists of all Prepetition Note Claims. The phrase

C. MEANS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN

         1. Continued Corporate Existence

                  (a) The Debtors

         Subject to the Restructuring Transactions contemplated by the Plan,
each of the Debtors will continue to exist after the Effective Date as a
separate corporate entity, with all the powers of a corporation under applicable
law in the jurisdiction in which each applicable Debtor is incorporated or
otherwise formed and pursuant to its certificate of incorporation and bylaws or
other organizational documents in effect prior to the Effective Date, except to
the extent such certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other organizational
documents are amended by the Plan, without prejudice to any right to terminate
such existence (whether by merger or otherwise) under applicable law after the
Effective Date.

                  (b) New Holding Company and New Operating Company

         Subject to the Restructuring Transactions contemplated by the Plan, on,
or as soon as reasonably practicable after, the Effective Date, all appropriate
actions shall be taken consistent with the Plan to (i) form New Holding Company
and New Operating Company pursuant to their respective Certificates of
Incorporation and By-Laws, (ii) contribute or transfer all of the assets of the
Debtors, other than the Qualifying Real Estate and the Trust Assets, to New
Operating Company and/or such other Reorganized Debtors as contemplated by the
Restructuring Transactions, and (iii) issue all of the New Operating Company
Common Stock to New Holding Company. The Qualifying Real Estate shall be treated
as specified in Section 12.1 of the Plan, and the Trust Assets shall be
transferred to the Kmart Creditor Trust as specified in Section 11.2 of the
Plan.

                  (c) Non-Debtors

         There are certain Affiliates of the Debtors that are not Debtors in
these Chapter 11 Cases. The continued existence, operation and ownership of such
non-Debtor Affiliates is a material component of the Debtors' businesses, and,
as set forth in Section 12.1 of the Plan, all of the Debtors' equity interests
and other property interests in such non-Debtor Affiliates shall revest in the
applicable Reorganized Debtor or its successor on the Effective Date.

         2. Substantive Consolidation

         The Plan provides for the substantive consolidation of the Estates, but
only for purposes of effectuating the settlements contemplated by, and making
distributions to holders of Claims under, the Plan, and not for voting purposes.
For such limited purposes, on the Effective Date, (a) all guaranties of any
Debtor of the payment, performance, or collection of another Debtor with respect
to any Class of Claims or Interests shall be deemed eliminated and cancelled;
(b) any obligation of any Debtor and all guaranties with respect to any Class of
Claims or Interests


                                       82
<PAGE>

executed by one or more of the other Debtors and any joint or several liability
of any of the Debtors shall be treated as a single obligation, and any
obligation of two or more Debtors, and all multiple Impaired Claims against
Debtors on account of such joint obligations, shall be treated and Allowed only
as a single Claim against the consolidated Debtors; and (c) each Claim filed in
the Chapter 11 Cases of any Debtor shall be deemed filed against the
consolidated Debtors and shall be deemed a Claim against and an obligation of
the consolidated Debtors. Except as set forth in this Section, such substantive
consolidation will not (other than for purposes related to the Plan) (a) affect
the legal and corporate structures of the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors,
subject to the right of the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors to effect the
Restructuring Transactions contemplated by the Plan, (b) cause any Debtor to be
liable for any Claim or Interest under the Plan for which it otherwise is not
liable, and the liability of any Debtor for any such Claim or Interest will not
be affected by such substantive consolidation, (c) except as otherwise stated in
the Plan, affect Intercompany Claims of Debtors against Debtors, and (d) affect
Interests in the Affiliate Debtors except as otherwise may be required in
connection with the Restructuring Transactions contemplated by the Plan.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Debtors may elect in their
sole and absolute discretion, at any time through and until the Effective Date,
to substantively consolidate the Estates for additional purposes, including for
voting purposes, provided, however, that nothing herein shall impair the
Debtors' or the Plan Investors' rights under the Investment Agreement. Should
the Debtors make such election, the Debtors will not, nor will they be required
to, resolicit votes with respect to the Plan. Substantive consolidation shall
not alter the distributions set forth herein. In the event that the Debtors do
elect to substantively consolidate the Estates, the Disclosure Statement and the
Plan shall be deemed to be a motion requesting that the Bankruptcy Court approve
such substantive consolidation.

         3. Restructuring Transactions

         On or prior to the Effective Date, the Debtors and Reorganized Debtors
shall take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to effect the
relevant Restructuring Transactions. The term "Restructuring Transactions" means
a dissolution or winding up of the corporate existence of a Debtor or the
consolidation, merger, contribution of assets, or other transaction in which a
Reorganized Debtor merges with or transfers substantially all of its assets and
liabilities to a Reorganized Debtor or their Affiliates, on or after the
Effective Date, as set forth in the Restructuring Transaction Notice. The
Restructuring Transactions contemplated by the Plan include, but are not limited
to, all of the transactions described in the Plan. Such actions may also
include: (a) the execution and delivery of appropriate agreements or other
documents of merger, consolidation or reorganization containing terms that are
consistent with the terms of the Plan and that satisfy the requirements of
applicable law; (b) the execution and delivery of appropriate instruments of
transfer, assignment, assumption or delegation of any property, right,
liability, duty or obligation on terms consistent with the terms of the Plan;
(c) the filing of appropriate certificates of incorporation, merger or
consolidation with the appropriate governmental authorities under applicable
law; and (d) all other actions that such Debtors and Reorganized Debtors
determine are necessary or appropriate, including the making of filings or
recordings in connection with the relevant Restructuring Transaction. The form
of each Restructuring Transaction shall be determined by the Boards of Directors
of a Debtor or Reorganized Debtor party to any Restructuring Transaction. In the
event a Restructuring Transaction is a merger transaction, upon the consummation
of such Restructuring Transaction, each party to such merger shall cease to
exist as a separate corporate entity and thereafter the



                                       83
<PAGE>

surviving Reorganized Debtor shall assume and perform the obligations of each
Reorganized Debtor under the Plan. In the event a Reorganized Debtor is
liquidated, the Reorganized Debtors (or the Reorganized Debtor which owned the
stock of such liquidating Debtor prior to such liquidation) shall assume and
perform such obligations. Implementation of the Restructuring Transactions shall
not affect the distributions under the Plan.

         4. Certificates of Incorporation and by-Laws

         The Certificates of Incorporation and Bylaws of New Holding Company and
each of the other Reorganized Debtors shall be adopted and amended as may be
required in order that they are consistent with the provisions of the Plan and
the Bankruptcy Code. The certificate of incorporation of New Holding Company
shall, among other things: (a) authorize five-hundred million (500,000,000)
shares of New Holding Company Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share; (b)
authorize 20 million shares of New Holding Company Preferred Stock for future
issuance upon terms to be designated from time to time by the board of directors
of New Holding Company; and (c) provide, pursuant to section 1123(a)(6) of the

Action arising out of the Trust Claims, in which case the funds of such account
holder shall be held in escrow by the Kmart Creditor Trust pending resolution of
any Trust Claims against such account holder. After the Effective Date, the
Reorganized Debtors shall each have the authority, consistent with the
applicable agreements, to terminate, amend or enter into employment, retirement,

provided in the Investment Agreement. The Plan Investors' rights to transfer the
Total Investor Shares shall be restricted pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Investment Agreement.

         12. Post-Effective Date Financing

         An integral aspect of the Debtors' emergence plan is a new, exit
financing facility designed to fund certain payments under the Debtors'
restructuring plan and to provide working capital to the reorganized enterprise.
In order to obtain such a facility, the Debtors, with the assistance of their
investment banker and financial advisor, approached several major financial
institutions and solicited commitments for a $2 billion exit financing facility
upon terms acceptable to the Debtors and their creditor constituencies. The
Debtors obtained proposals from a number of such institutions and devoted
considerable time negotiating with the proponents about the various proposed
lending terms.

         This process spanned several weeks during which the Debtors narrowed
the field of acceptable proposals. The process also was exceptionally
time-consuming and entailed intense discussions, all of which were at arms'
length and in good faith. After considering the various alternatives, the
Debtors, with the assistance of their advisors, determined to proceed with the
an exit financing proposal submitted by General Electric Capital Corporation
("GE Capital"), GECC Capital Markets Group, Inc., Fleet Retail Finance, Inc.,
Fleet Securities, Inc., Bank of America, N.A., and Banc of America Securities,
LLC (collectively, the "Exit Lenders") as containing the highest and best exit
financing terms available, consistent with the Debtors' anticipated working
capital and other needs as they emerge from Chapter 11.

         To this end, on January 13, 2003, Kmart entered into a commitment
letter, a copy of which is attached to the Plan as Exhibit D-2 (the "Commitment
Letter") with the Exit Lenders for a senior secured revolving credit facility in
the amount of up to $2 billion (the "Exit Financing Facility") to be utilized by
the Reorganized Debtors to repay the DIP Facility Claims, make other payments
required to be made on the Effective Date, and conduct their post-reorganization
operations. On January 14, 2003, the Debtors filed a motion requesting authority
to accept the Commitment Letter and to pay certain fees, deposits, and other
expenses in connection therewith. On January __, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court
entered an order granting the requested relief. The material terms of the Exit
Financing Facility are as follows:

         Amount:                    $2,000,000,000 (including a letter of credit
                                    sub-facility of up to $800,000,000 and a
                                    swingline facility in an amount to be
                                    determined) or such lesser amount as the
                                    Debtors may elect prior to the closing date.
                                    A portion of the facility in an amount



                                       88
<PAGE>



                                    not to exceed $200,000,000 may take the form
                                    of a synthetic term loan facility using
                                    credit-linked deposits.

         Term:                      Thirty-six (36) months.

         Availability:              The lesser of (1) $2,000,000,000 and (2) the
                                    sum of (a) the lesser of (i) 65% of the
                                    Reorganized Debtors' eligible inventory
                                    valued at the lower of cost (FIFO) or market
                                    or (ii) 80% of the appraised net going out
                                    of business value of the Reorganized
                                    Debtors' eligible inventory and (b) the
                                    lesser of (i) 50% of the Reorganized
                                    Debtors' eligible in-transit inventory
                                    covered by letters of credit valued at the
                                    lower of cost (FIFO) or market or (ii) 60%
                                    of the appraised net going out of business
                                    value of the Reorganized Debtors' eligible
                                    in-transit inventory covered by letters of
                                    credit under the letter of credit
                                    subfacility.

         Use of Proceeds:           Loans made at closing (the "Closing Date")
                                    would be used to repay certain post-petition
                                    secured indebtedness on the effective date,
                                    to otherwise enable the Debtors to
                                    consummate the plan of reorganization on the
                                    effective date and to fund certain fees and
                                    expenses associated with the financing.
                                    Loans made after the Closing Date would be
                                    used for the Reorganized Debtors' working
                                    capital and other general corporate
                                    purposes, including permitted capital
                                    expenditures.

         Interest:                  For all loans, at the Reorganized Debtors'
                                    option, either (i) absent an event of

                                    applicable margin. The applicable margins

                                    of the Debtors in connection therewith, GE

         Syndication:               The co-arrangers of the Exit Financing
                                    Facility will initiate discussions with
                                    potential lenders relating to the
                                    syndication of the financing. It is
                                    expressly understood by the Debtors that the
                                    Exit Lenders, through the co-arrangers,
                                    intend to syndicate the financing to allow
                                    the Lenders to sell down the financing to
                                    their respective desired hold positions. The
                                    Debtors will agree to a syndication
                                    timetable that allows for the primary
                                    syndication of the financing prior to the
                                    Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything
                                    contained in this paragraph, but assuming
                                    the Debtors' compliance with the terms
                                    hereof, the success of the syndication will
                                    not be a condition precedent to the closing
                                    of the financing. Interest rates, certain
                                    fees and certain other terms of the
                                    financing are subject to increase or other
                                    change on the terms and conditions set forth
                                    in the Syndication Letter (defined below)
                                    relating to the Exit Lenders' efforts to
                                    syndicate the exit financing facility.

         As is customary of exit financing commitments, including those offered
by the institutions that the Debtors approached, GE Capital required payment of
an underwriting deposit in the amount of $500,000 so that it could begin due
diligence and a field audit (the "Underwriting Deposit"). The Debtors determined
that the amount of the Underwriting Deposit was fair, reasonable and typical for
financings of this nature. The Bankruptcy Court authorized the Debtors' payment
of the Underwriting Deposit on January __, 2003.

         Under the Commitment Letter, the Debtors further agreed to pay to each
Exit Lender and the co-lead arrangers of the facility, regardless of whether the
commitment is terminated or the financing closes, (i) a commitment fee as
required by a separate fee letter (the "Fee Letter"); (ii) all out-of-pocket
expenses which may be incurred by the Lenders in connection with the financing
(including all reasonable legal costs and fees incurred in the preparation of
the Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter, a separate letter regarding syndication
of the Exit Financing Facility (the "Syndication Letter"), and related matters)
and evaluation of and documentation of the financing; (ii) all out-of-pocket
appraisal costs and expenses; and (iv) a field examination fee of $750 per
person per day plus out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the conduct of GE
Capital's field audit. As with the Underwriting Deposit, the Debtors determined
that the commitment fee and other payment obligations are fair, reasonable, and
typical of financings of this nature. The Bankruptcy Court authorized the
Debtors' payment of these amounts in accordance with the Commitment Letter, Fee
Letter, and Syndication Letter on January __, 2003.

         Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Court's order authorizing the foregoing
transactions, GE Capital's right to receive reimbursement of all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the financing, including those contemplated
by the Fee Letter and the Syndication Letter, shall be secured by and payable
with the Underwriting Deposit, and each Exit Lender's rights to receive the
fees, deposits, and reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the financing, including those contemplated by the Fee Letter and the
Syndication Letter, shall be entitled to priority as an administrative claim
under Section 503(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code and shall be payable upon demand
by such Lender without any further order of the Bankruptcy Court, whether or not
the financing closes.





                                       91
<PAGE>
         The Plan will authorize the Reorganized Debtors to enter into all
documents necessary and appropriate in connection with the Exit Financing
Facility. The principal documents with respect to such Facility shall be filed
by the Debtors with the Bankruptcy Court no later than the Exhibit Filing Date
and will be deemed attached to the Plan as Exhibit D-1. In the Confirmation
Order, the Bankruptcy Court shall approve the terms of the Exit Financing
Facility in substantially the form filed with the Bankruptcy Court (and with
such changes as to which the applicable Debtors and respective agents and
lenders parties thereto may agree) and authorize the applicable Reorganized
Debtors to execute the same together with such other documents as the applicable
Reorganized Debtors and the applicable lenders may reasonably require in order
to effectuate the treatment afforded to such parties under the Exit Financing
Facility.

         13. Trade Vendors' Lien Program

         On the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors shall grant to certain
vendors who provide retail merchandise to the Reorganized Debtors on credit
after the Effective Date, or who have provided merchandise to the Debtors after
the Petition Date and before the Effective Date on credit which is not paid for
as of the Effective Date, a Post-Effective Date Trade Vendors' Lien pursuant to
the terms attached hereto as Exhibit K. Each person or entity issuing securities
under the Plan, any entity acquiring property under the Plan, and any creditor
and/or equity security holder of the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors, shall be
deemed to contractually subordinate any present or future claim, right, or other
interest it may have in and to any proceeds received from the disposition,
release, or liquidation of any real properties leased by the Debtors or
Reorganized Debtors, as lessees, to the Secured Obligations (as defined in
Exhibit K); provided, however, that in no case shall (i) the lenders under the
Exit Financing Facility or (ii) any obligations to the Plan Investors under any
notes issued pursuant to the Investment Agreement be deemed subordinated to the
Secured Obligations in this regard and provided, further, that such
subordination shall in no way affect any Debtor's or Reorganized Debtor's right
to sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any interest in such leases or
to provide its interests in such leases as collateral to one or more lenders (or
their representatives) after the Effective Date, and any such transferee, lessee
or lender shall take such leasehold interests free of any claim of the Trade
Vendors' Lien and the Trade Vendors Collateral Agent. Such contractual
subordination shall terminate upon termination or expiration of the Trade
Vendors' Lien.

         14. Preservation of Causes of Action

         In accordance with section 1123(b)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code and except
as otherwise provided in the Plan with respect to the Kmart Creditor Trust, the
Reorganized Debtors will retain and may (but are not required to) enforce all
Retained Actions, except that with respect to Causes of Action pending on the
Effective Date, and except as otherwise described on Exhibit J to the Plan, the
Debtors shall waive all Avoidance Actions as of the Effective Date. The term
"Avoidance Claims" means Causes of Action against Persons arising under any of
sections 502, 510, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 547, 548 through 551 and 553 of the
Bankruptcy Code, or under similar or related state or federal statutes and
common law, including fraudulent transfer laws, whether or not litigation has
been commenced as of the Confirmation Date to prosecute such Avoidance Claims.
The Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, in their sole and absolute discretion,
will determine whether to bring, settle, release, compromise, or enforce such
Retained Actions (or decline to do any of the foregoing), and will not be
required to seek further





                                       92
<PAGE>
approval of the Bankruptcy Court for such action. The Reorganized Debtors or any
successors may pursue such litigation claims in accordance with the best
interests of the Reorganized Debtors or any successors holding such rights of
action.

         15. Corporate Action

         Each of the matters provided for under the Plan involving the corporate
structure of any Debtor or Reorganized Debtor or corporate action to be taken by
or required of any Debtor or Reorganized Debtor shall, as of the Effective Date,
be deemed to have occurred and be effective as provided herein, and shall be
authorized, approved and, to the extent taken prior to the Effective Date,
ratified in all respects without any requirement of further action by
stockholders, creditors, or directors of any of the Debtors or the Reorganized
Debtors, provided, however, that nothing herein shall impair the Debtors' or
Plan Investors' rights under the Investment Agreement.

         16. Effectuating Documents; Further Transactions

         Each of the President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
Officer, Chief Restructuring Officer, and General Counsel of the Debtors, or
their respective designees, will be authorized to execute, deliver, file, or
record such contracts, instruments, releases, indentures, and other agreements
or documents, and take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to
effectuate and further evidence the terms and conditions of the Plan. The
secretary or assistant secretary of the Debtors will be authorized to certify or
attest to any of the foregoing actions.

         17. Exemption from Certain Transfer Taxes and Recording Fees

         Pursuant to section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, any transfers from
a Debtor to a Reorganized Debtor or to any other Person or entity pursuant to
the Plan, or any agreement regarding the transfer of title to or ownership of
any of the Debtors' real or personal property will not be subject to any
document recording tax, stamp tax, conveyance fee, intangibles or similar tax,
mortgage tax, stamp act, real estate transfer tax, mortgage recording tax,
Uniform Commercial Code filing or recording fee, or other similar tax or
governmental assessment, and the Confirmation Order will direct the appropriate
state or local governmental officials or agents to forego the collection of any
such tax or governmental assessment and to accept for filing and recordation any
of the foregoing instruments or other documents without the payment of any such
tax or governmental assessment.

D. UNEXPIRED LEASES AND EXECUTORY CONTRACTS

         1. Assumed Leases and Contracts

the applicable Reorganized Debtor in accordance with its terms, except as

collective bargaining agreements, as modified and/or amended from time to time,
shall be deemed automatically assumed in accordance with the provisions and
requirements of sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code as of the Effective
Date. The assumption of the collective bargaining agreements and the cure of all
amounts owed under such agreements in the ordinary course by the Reorganized
Debtors shall be in full satisfaction of all Claims and Interests arising under
all previous collective bargaining agreements between the parties thereto or
their predecessors-in-interest. Upon assumption, all proofs of claim filed by
the Debtors' unions will be deemed withdrawn, without prejudice to their pursuit
in the ordinary course by the unions and/or individuals and payment or
satisfaction in the ordinary course by the Reorganized Debtors of obligations
under the assumed collective bargaining agreements. Each Employee-Related
Agreement assumed pursuant to this section shall vest in and be fully
enforceable by the applicable Reorganized Debtor in accordance with its terms,
except as modified by the provisions of this Plan, or any order of the
Bankruptcy Court authorizing or providing for its assumption or applicable
federal law. The Debtors reserve the right to file a motion on or before the
Confirmation Date to assume or reject any Employee-Related Agreement.

                  (c) Other Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases

Unexpired Lease assumed pursuant to this section shall vest in and be fully
enforceable by the applicable Reorganized Debtor in accordance with its terms,
except as modified by the provisions of this Plan, or any order of the
Bankruptcy Court authorizing or providing for its assumption or applicable
federal law. The Debtors reserve the right to file a motion on or before the
Confirmation Date to assume or reject any Other Executory Contract or Unexpired
Lease, including any Other Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease on Exhibit M-3.

have previously been rejected or are the subject of a motion to reject filed, or
a notice of rejection served pursuant to order of the Bankruptcy Court, on or
before the Effective Date, all executory contracts and unexpired leases not
assumed pursuant to the Plan, including, but not limited to, any guaranties by
any of Debtors with respect to real estate leases of former subsidiaries and
businesses of any of such Debtors, shall be deemed automatically rejected as of
the Effective Date or such earlier date as the Debtors may have unequivocally
terminated their performance under such lease or contract; provided, however,
that neither the exclusion nor the inclusion by the Debtors of a contract or
lease on Exhibit M-1, Exhibit M-2, or Exhibit M-3, nor anything contained in the
Plan shall constitute an admission by the Debtors that such lease or contract is
an unexpired lease or executory contract or that any Debtor, or its respective
Affiliates, has any liability thereunder. The Confirmation Order shall
constitute an order of the Bankruptcy Court approving such rejections pursuant
to sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors reserve the right

Intercompany Unexpired Lease, Employee-Related Agreement, or Other Executory

(a) the nature or the amount of any Cure, (b) the ability of the Reorganized
Debtors or any assignee to provide "adequate assurance of future performance"
(within the meaning of section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code) under the contract or
lease to be assumed, or (c) any other matter pertaining to assumption, Cure

         3. Disbursing Agent

         The Disbursing Agent shall make all distributions required under the
Plan except with respect to a holder of a Claim whose distribution is governed
by an agreement and is administered by a Servicer, which distributions shall be
deposited with the appropriate Servicer, who shall deliver such distributions to
the holders of Claims in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and the
terms of the governing agreement; provided, however, that if any such Servicer
is unable to make such distributions, the Disbursing Agent, with the cooperation
of such Servicer, shall make such distributions.

         4. Surrender of Securities or Instruments

         On or before the Distribution Date, or as soon as practicable
thereafter, each holder of an instrument evidencing a Claim (a "Certificate")
shall surrender such Certificate to the Disbursing Agent, or, with respect to
indebtedness that is governed by an agreement and administered by a Servicer,
the respective Servicer, and such Certificate shall be cancelled solely with
respect to the Debtors and such cancellation shall not alter the obligations or
rights of any non-Debtor third parties vis-a-vis one another to such
instruments; provided, however, that this Section 9.4 shall not apply to any
Claims Reinstated pursuant to the terms of the Plan. No distribution of property
hereunder shall be made to or on behalf of any such holder unless and until such
Certificate is received by the Disbursing Agent or the respective Servicer or
the unavailability of such Certificate is reasonably established to the
satisfaction of the Disbursing Agent or the respective Servicer. Any holder who
fails to surrender or cause to be surrendered such Certificate, or fails to
execute and deliver an affidavit of loss and indemnity reasonably satisfactory
to the Disbursing Agent or the respective Servicer prior to the second
anniversary of the Effective Date, shall be deemed to have forfeited all rights
and Claims in respect of such Certificate and shall not participate in any
distribution hereunder, and all property in respect of such forfeited
distribution, including any dividends or interest attributable thereto, shall
revert to the Reorganized Debtors notwithstanding any federal or state escheat
laws to the contrary.

         5. Services of Indenture Trustees, Agents, and Servicers

         The services, with respect to consummation of the Plan, of Servicers
under the relevant agreements that govern the rights of Claimholders shall be as
set forth elsewhere in the Plan, and the Reorganized Debtors shall reimburse any
Servicer for reasonable and necessary services performed by it (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) as contemplated by, and in accordance with, the
Plan, without the need for the filing of an application with, or approval by,
the Bankruptcy Court.

         6. Claims Administration Responsibility

                  (a) Reorganized Debtors

         The Reorganized Debtors will retain responsibility for administering,
disputing, objecting to, compromising, or otherwise resolving and making
distributions (if any) with respect to all Claims against and Interests in the
Debtors.






                                       97
<PAGE>
                  (b) Filing of Objections

         Unless otherwise extended by the Bankruptcy Court, any objections to
Claims or Interests shall be served and filed on or before the Claims/Interests
Objection Deadline. Notwithstanding any authority to the contrary, an objection
to a Claim or Interest shall be deemed properly served on the Claimholder or
Interestholder if the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors effect service in any
of the following manners: (i) in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
4, as modified and made applicable by Bankruptcy Rule 7004; (ii) to the extent
counsel for a Claimholder or Interestholder is unknown, by first class mail,
postage prepaid, on the signatory on the proof of claim or interest or other
representative identified on the proof of claim or interest or any attachment
thereto; or (iii) by first class mail, postage prepaid, on any counsel that has
appeared on the Claimholder's or Interestholder's behalf in the Chapter 11
Cases.

                  (c) Determination of Claims

         Except as otherwise agreed to by the Debtors, any Claim or Interest as
to which a proof of claim or proof of interest was timely filed in the Chapter
11 Cases may be determined and liquidated in accordance with the ADR Procedures.
Any Claim or Interest determined and liquidated pursuant to (i) the ADR
Procedures, (ii) an order of the Bankruptcy Court, or (iii) applicable
non-bankruptcy law (which determination has not been stayed, reversed or amended
and as to which determination (or any revision, modification or amendment
thereof) the time to appeal or seek review or rehearing has expired and as to
which no appeal or petition for review or rehearing was filed or, if filed,
remains pending) shall be deemed, to the extent applicable and subject to any
provision in the ADR Procedures to the contrary, an Allowed Claim or an Allowed
Interest, as the case may be, in such liquidated amount and satisfied in
accordance with the Plan (provided that, to the extent a Claim is an Allowed
Insured Claim, such Allowed Claim shall be paid from the insurance proceeds
available to satisfy such liquidated amount). Nothing contained in this Section
9.6 shall constitute or be deemed a waiver of any claim, right, or Cause of
Action that the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors may have against any Person
in connection with or arising out of any Claim or Claims, including, without
limitation, any rights under section 157(b) of title 28 of the United States
Code.

         7. Delivery of Distributions

         Distributions to Allowed Claimholders or Interestholders shall be made
by the Disbursing Agent or the appropriate Servicer (a) at the addresses set
forth on the proofs of claim filed by such Claimholders or Interestholders (or
at the last known addresses of such Claimholders or Interestholders if no proof
of claim is filed or if the Debtors have been notified in writing of a change of
address), (b) at the addresses set forth in any written notices of address
changes delivered to the Disbursing Agent after the date of any related proof of
claim, (c) at the addresses reflected in the Schedules if no proof of claim has
been filed and the Disbursing Agent has not received a written notice of a
change of address, or (d) in the case of a Claimholder whose Claim is governed
by an agreement and administered by a Servicer, at the addresses contained in
the official records of such Servicer. If any Claimholder's or Interestholder's
distribution is returned as undeliverable, no further distributions to such
Claimholder or Interestholder shall be made unless and until the Disbursing
Agent or the appropriate Servicer is notified of such Claimholder's or
Interestholder's then-current address, at





                                       98
<PAGE>
which time all missed distributions shall be made to such Claimholder or
Interestholder without interest. Amounts in respect of undeliverable
distributions shall be returned to the Reorganized Debtors until such
distributions are claimed. All funds or other undeliverable distributions
returned to the Reorganized Debtors and not claimed within six months of return
shall be distributed to the other creditors of the Class of which the creditor
to whom the distribution was originally made is a member in accordance with the
provisions of the Plan applicable to distributions to that Class. If, at the
conclusion of distributions to a particular Class under the Plan and after
consultation with the Post-Confirmation Committee (solely with respect to Trade
Vendor/Lease Rejection Claims), the Reorganized Debtors reasonably determine
that any remaining New Holding Company Common Stock or Cash allocated for such
class is immaterial and would thus be too impractical to distribute or would be
of no benefit to its respective distributees, any such remaining New Holding
Company Common Stock or Cash will revert to the Reorganized Debtors. Upon such
reversion, the claim of any Claimholder or their successors with respect to such
property shall be discharged and forever barred notwithstanding any federal or
state escheat laws to the contrary.

         8. Procedures for Treating and Resolving Disputed and Contingent Claims

                  (a) No Distributions Pending Allowance

         No payments or distributions will be made with respect to all or any
portion of a Disputed Claim or Disputed Interest unless and until all objections
to such Disputed Claim or Disputed Interest have been settled or withdrawn or
have been determined by a Final Order, and the Disputed Claim or Disputed
Interest has become an Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest. All objections to
Claims or Interests must be filed on or before the Claims/Interests Objection
Deadline.

                  (b) Distribution Reserve

         The Disbursing Agent will create a separate Distribution Reserve from
the property to be distributed in the Chapter 11 Cases. The amount of New
Holding Company Common Stock withheld as a part of the Distribution Reserve
shall be equal to the number of shares the Reorganized Debtors reasonably
determine is necessary to satisfy the distributions required to be made to
Claimholders in the Chapter 11 Cases, when the allowance or disallowance of each
Disputed Claim is ultimately determined. The Disbursing Agent, the Debtors, or
the Reorganized Debtors may request estimation for any Disputed Claim that is
contingent or unliquidated (but is not required to do so). The Disbursing Agent
also shall place in the Distribution Reserve any dividends, payments, or other
distributions made on account of, as well as any obligations arising from, the
property initially withheld in the Distribution Reserve, to the extent that such
property continues to be withheld in the Distribution Reserve at the time such
distributions are made or such obligations arise. The Claimholder or
Interestholder shall not be entitled to receive or recover any amount in excess
of the amount provided in the Distribution Reserve to pay such Claim or
Interest. Nothing in the Plan or Disclosure Statement will be deemed to entitle
the Claimholder or Interestholder of a Disputed Claim or Disputed Interest to
postpetition interest on such Claim or Interest.





                                       99
<PAGE>
                  (c) Distributions After Allowance

         Payments and distributions from the Distribution Reserve to each
respective Claimholder or Interestholder on account of a Disputed Claim or
Disputed Interest, to the extent that it ultimately becomes an Allowed Claim or
Allowed Interest, will be made in accordance with provisions of the Plan that
govern distributions to such Claimholders or Interestholder. On the first
Periodic Distribution Date following the date when a Disputed Claim or Disputed
Interest becomes undisputed, noncontingent and liquidated, the Disbursing Agent
will distribute to the Claimholder or Interestholder any Cash, New Holding
Company Common Stock, or other property, from the Distribution Reserve that
would have been distributed on the dates distributions were previously made to
Claimholders and Interestholders had such Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest been
an Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest on such dates. After a Final Order has been
entered, or other final resolution has been reached with respect to all Disputed
Claims or Interests, any remaining Cash, New Holding Company Common Stock, or
other Property in the Distribution Reserve will be distributed Pro Rata to
Allowed General Unsecured Claimholders and Interestholders in accordance with
the other provisions of the Plan. Subject to Section 9.2 hereof, all
distributions made under this Section of the Plan on account of an Allowed Claim
or Allowed Interest will be made together with any dividends, payments, or other
distributions made on account of, as well as any obligations arising from, the
distributed property as if such Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest had been an
Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest on the dates distributions were previously
made to Allowed Claimholders and Allowed Interestholders included in the
applicable class. The Disbursing Agent shall be deemed to have voted any New
Holding Company Common Stock held in the Distribution Reserve in the same
proportion as shares previously disbursed by the Disbursing Agent. The Servicers
shall be deemed to have voted any New Holding Company Common Stock held by such
Servicer in the same proportion as shares previously disbursed by such Servicer.

                  (d) De Minimis Distributions

         Neither the Distribution Agent nor any Servicer shall have any
obligation to make a distribution on account of an Allowed Claim or Allowed
Interest from any Distribution Reserve or otherwise if (i) the aggregate amount
of all distributions authorized to be made from such Distribution Reserve or
otherwise on the Periodic Distribution Date in question is or has a value less
than $250,000, or (ii) if the amount to be distributed to the specific holder of
the Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest on the particular Periodic Distribution
Date does not constitute a final distribution to such holder and is or has a
value less than $50.00, provided that this Article 9.8(d) shall not apply to
distributions to be made pursuant to Article 5.11 and Article 5.12 of the Plan.

         9. Fractional Securities; Fractional Dollars

         Any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, payments of fractions
of shares of New Holding Company Common Stock will not be made and shall be
deemed to be zero. Any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, neither the
Reorganized Debtors nor the Disbursing Agent or Servicer shall be required to
make distributions or payments of fractions of dollars. Whenever any payment of
a fraction of a dollar under the Plan would otherwise be called for, the actual
payment shall reflect a rounding of such fraction to the nearest whole dollar
(up or down), with half dollars or less being rounded down.







                                      100

F. ALLOWANCE AND PAYMENT OF CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS

         1. DIP Facility Claims

         On the Effective Date, the DIP Facility Claim and the Plan Investor
Claim shall be allowed in an amount to be agreed upon by the Debtors and, as
applicable, the DIP Lenders and the Plan Investors, or as ordered by the
Bankruptcy Court with notice to the Creditors' Committees, not less than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Effective Date, and all obligations (other than
contingent indemnity obligations) of the Debtors under the DIP Facility and with
respect to the Plan Investor Claim shall be paid in full in Cash on the
Effective Date; provided, however, that with respect to letters of credit issued
under the DIP Facility, such claims may be satisfied in full by the cash
collateralization of such letters of credit or by procuring back-up letters of
credit. Upon compliance with the foregoing sentence, all liens and security
interests granted to secure such obligations shall be deemed cancelled and shall
be of no further force and effect. To the extent that the DIP Lenders or the DIP
Agent have filed or recorded publicly any liens and/or security interests to
secure the Debtors' obligations under the DIP Facility, the DIP Lenders or the
DIP Agent, as the case may be, shall take any commercially reasonable steps
requested by the Debtors that are necessary to cancel and/or extinguish such
publicly filed liens and/or security interests.

         2. Professional Claims

                  (a) Final Fee Applications

         All final requests for payment of Professional Claims and Key Ordinary
Course Professional Claims must be filed no later than sixty (60) days after the
Effective Date. After notice and a hearing in accordance with the procedures
established by the Bankruptcy Code and prior orders of the Bankruptcy Court, the
allowed amounts of such Professional Claims and Key Ordinary Course Professional
Claims shall be determined by the Bankruptcy Court.

                  (b) Payment of Interim Amounts

         Subject to the Holdback Amount, on the Effective Date, the Debtors or
Reorganized Debtors shall pay all amounts owing to Professionals and Key
Ordinary Course Professionals for all outstanding amounts payable relating to
prior periods through the Effective Date. In order to receive payment on the
Effective Date for unbilled fees and expenses incurred through such date, the
Professionals and Key Ordinary Course Professionals shall estimate fees and
expenses due for periods that have not been billed as of the Effective Date and
shall deliver such estimate to the Debtors, counsel for the Statutory
Committees. Within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date, a Professional
receiving payment for the estimated period shall submit a detailed invoice
covering such period in the manner and providing the detail as set forth in the
Professional Fee Order or the Ordinary Course Professional Order, as applicable.
Should the estimated payment received by any Professional exceed the actual fees
and expenses for such period, this excess amount will be credited against the
Holdback Amount for such Professional or, if the award of the Holdback Amount
for such matter is insufficient, disgorged by such Professional.





                                      101
<PAGE>
                  (c) Holdback Amount

         On the Effective Date, the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors shall pay
to the Disbursing Agent, in order to fund the Holdback Escrow Account, Cash
equal to the aggregate Holdback Amount for all Professionals. The Disbursing
Agent shall maintain the Holdback Escrow Account in trust for the Professionals
with respect to whom fees have been held back pursuant to the Professional Fee
Order. Such funds shall not be considered property of the Debtors, the
Reorganized Debtors or the Estates. The remaining amount of Professional Claims
owing to the Professionals shall be paid to such Professionals by the Disbursing
Agent from the Holdback Escrow Account when such claims are finally allowed by
the Bankruptcy Court. When all Professional Claims and Key Ordinary Course
Professional Claims have been paid in full, amounts remaining in the Holdback
Escrow Account, if any, shall be paid to the Reorganized Debtors.

                  (d) Post-Effective Date Retention

         Upon the Effective Date, any requirement that Professionals or Key
Ordinary Course Professionals comply with sections 327 through 331 of the
Bankruptcy Code in seeking retention or compensation for services rendered after
such date will terminate, and the Reorganized Debtors will employ and pay
Professionals and Key Ordinary Course Professionals in the ordinary course of
business.

         3. Substantial Contribution Compensation and Expenses Bar Date

         Any Person who requests compensation or expense reimbursement for
making a substantial contribution in the Chapter 11 Cases pursuant to sections
503(b)(3), (4), and (5) of the Bankruptcy Code must file an application with the
clerk of the Bankruptcy Court on or before the forty-fifth (45th) day after the
Effective Date (the "503 Deadline"), and serve such application on counsel for
the Debtors, the Plan Investors, and the Statutory Committees and as otherwise
required by the Bankruptcy Court and the Bankruptcy Code on or before the 503
Deadline, or be forever barred from seeking such compensation or expense
reimbursement.

         4. Other Administrative Claims

         All other requests for payment of an Administrative Claim (other than
as set forth in Sections 10.2 or 10.3 of the Plan) must be filed, in
substantially the form of the Administrative Claim Request Form attached to the
Plan as Exhibit J, with the Claims Agent and served on counsel for the Debtors
and the Plan Investors no later than forty-five (45) days after the Effective
Date. Any request for payment of an Administrative Claim pursuant to this
Section 10.3 that is not timely filed and served shall be disallowed
automatically without the need for any objection from the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors. The Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors may settle an
Administrative Claim without further Bankruptcy Court approval, subject to
review of the Post-Confirmation Committee. Unless the Debtors or the Reorganized
Debtors object to an Administrative Claim by the Claims/Interests Objection
Deadline, such Administrative Claim shall be deemed allowed in the amount
requested. In the event that the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors object to an
Administrative Claim, the Bankruptcy Court shall determine the allowed amount of
such Administrative Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no request for payment
of an Administrative Claim need be filed with respect to an Administrative Claim
which is paid or payable by the Debtors in the ordinary course of business.

G. KMART CREDITOR TRUST

         1. Appointment of Trustee

         The Trustee for the Kmart Creditor Trust shall be designated by the
Creditors' Committee, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and the
consent of the Debtors, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
Trustee shall be independent of the Debtors. The Creditors' Committee shall file
a notice on a date that is not less than ten (10) days prior to the Confirmation
Hearing designating the Person who it has selected as Trustee and seeking
approval of such designation. The Person designated as Trustee shall file an
affidavit demonstrating that such Person is disinterested as defined by section
101(14) of the Bankruptcy Code. If approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the Person
so designated shall become the Trustee on the Effective Date. The Trustee shall
have and perform all of the duties, responsibilities, rights and obligations set
forth in the Trust Agreement.

         2. Transfer of Trust Assets to the Kmart Creditor Trust

         On the Effective Date, the Debtors shall transfer and shall be deemed
to have irrevocably transferred to the Kmart Creditor Trust, for and on behalf
of the beneficiaries of the Trust, with no reversionary interest in the Debtors,
the Trust Assets (subject to the obligation of the Kmart Creditor Trust to repay
any amounts as set forth in this Section); provided, however, that nothing
herein is intended to transfer all or any portion of any Retained Action to the
Kmart Creditor Trust. The term "Trust Assets" means any and all Causes of Action
of the Debtors against any Person, including Avoidance Claims, arising out of
the subject matter of the Investigations. Upon such transfer, the Debtors, the
Disbursing Agent and the Reorganized Debtors shall have no other further rights
or obligations with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Reorganized Debtors shall make available to the Trustee reasonable access during
normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to personnel and books and
records of the Reorganized Debtors to representatives of the Kmart Creditor
Trust to enable the Trustee to perform the Trustee's tasks under the Trust
Agreement and the Plan, and the Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors shall
cooperate with the Trustee and the Trust Advisory Board with respect to access
to all work product developed during the stewardship investigation, as more
specifically set forth in the Trust Agreement; provided, however, that the
Reorganized Debtors will not be required to make expenditures in response to
such requests determined by them to be unreasonable. The Reorganized Debtors
shall not be entitled to compensation or reimbursement (including reimbursement
for professional fees) with respect to fulfilling their obligations as set forth
in this Section. The Bankruptcy Court retains jurisdiction to determine the
reasonableness of either a request for assistance and/or a related expenditure.
Any requests for assistance shall not interfere with the Reorganized Debtors'
business operations.

         3. The Kmart Creditor Trust

                  (a) The Kmart Trust Agreement

         Without any further action of the directors or shareholders of the
Debtors, on the Effective Date, the Trust Agreement, substantially in the form
of Exhibit E to the Plan, shall become effective. The Trustee shall accept the
Kmart Creditor Trust and sign the Trust





                                      103
<PAGE>
Agreement on the Effective Date and the Kmart Creditor Trust will then be deemed
created and effective.

                  (b) Interests in and Term of Kmart Creditor Trust

         Interests in the Kmart Creditor Trust shall be uncertificated and shall
be non-transferable except upon death of the interest holder or by operation of
law. Holders of interests in the Kmart Creditor Trust shall have no voting
rights with respect to such interests. The Kmart Creditor Trust shall have a
term of three (3) years from the Effective Date, without prejudice to the rights
of the Trust Advisory Board to extend such term conditioned upon the Kmart
Creditor Trust's not then becoming subject to the Exchange Act. The terms of the
Trust may be amended by the Trustee or the Debtors to the extent necessary to
ensure that the Trust will not become subject to the Exchange Act.

                  (c) Authority of Trustee

         The Trustee shall have full authority to take any steps necessary to
administer the Trust Agreement, including, without limitation, the duty and
obligation to liquidate Trust Assets, to administer the Other Unsecured Claim
Senior Note and Other Unsecured Claim Cash Payment Amount (including pursuant to
a services agreement with the Reorganized Debtors), to make distributions
therefrom in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and, if authorized by
majority vote of those members of the Trust Advisory Board authorized to vote,
to pursue and settle any Trust Claims. Upon such assignment, the Trustee, on
behalf of the Kmart Creditor Trust, will assume and be responsible for all of
the Debtors' responsibilities, duties, and obligations with respect to the
subject matter of the assignments, and the Debtors, the Disbursing Agent, and
the Reorganized Debtors will have no further rights or obligations with respect
thereto.

                  (d) Costs and Expenses

         All costs and expenses associated with the administration of the Kmart
Creditor Trust, including those rights, obligations and duties described in the
Plan, shall be the responsibility of and paid by the Kmart Creditor Trust.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, on the Effective Date, the Reorganized
Debtors shall contribute $5 million to the Kmart Creditor Trust to be utilized
to pay the costs and expenses associated with the administration of the Kmart
Creditor Trust.

                  (e) Retention of Professionals

         The Trustee may retain such law firms, accounting firms, experts,
advisors, consultants, investigators, appraisers, auctioneers or other
professionals as it may deem necessary (collectively, the "Trustee
Professionals"), in its sole discretion, to aid in the performance of its
responsibilities pursuant to the terms of the Plan including, without
limitation, the liquidation and distribution of Trust Assets.





                                      104
<PAGE>
                  (f) Classification of Kmart Creditor Trust

         For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Kmart Creditor
Trust be classified as a liquidating trust under section 301.7701-4 of the
Procedure and Administration Regulations and that such trust is owned by its
beneficiaries. Accordingly, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the beneficiaries be treated as if they had received a distribution of an
undivided interest in the Trust Assets and then contributed such interests to
the Kmart Creditor Trust.

                  (g) Tax Returns

         The Trustee shall be responsible for filing all federal, state and
local tax returns for the Kmart Creditor Trust. The Trustee shall provide
holders of interests in the Kmart Creditor Trust with copies of annual, audited
financial statements and tax information, with such copies to be made available
on an Internet website to be maintained by the Trustee and notice of which shall
be given by the Trustee to such interest holders.

         4. The Trust Advisory Board

                  (a) Membership and Selection

         The Trust Advisory Board shall be comprised of three (3) members, two
(2) of which shall be designated by the Creditors' Committee, and one (1) of
which shall be designated by the Financial Institutions' Committee. The
Creditors' Committee and the Financial Institutions' Committee shall give the
Debtors written notice of the identities of such members and file such notice
with the Bankruptcy Court on a date that is not less than ten (10) days prior to
the Confirmation Hearing; provided, however, that if said Committees fail to
file and give such notice, Kmart shall designate the members of the Trust
Advisory Board by announcing their identities at the Confirmation Hearing. The
Trustee shall consult regularly with the Trust Advisory Board when carrying out
the purpose and intent of the Kmart Creditor Trust. Members of the Trust
Advisory Board shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with the Trust
Agreement and to reimbursement of the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred
by them in carrying out the purpose of the Trust Advisory Board. Reimbursement
of the reasonable and necessary expenses of the members of the Trust Advisory
Board and their compensation to the extent provided for in the Trust Agreement
shall be payable by the Kmart Creditor Trust.

                  (b) Vacancies

         In the case of an inability or unwillingness of any member of the Trust
Advisory Board to serve, such member shall be replaced by designation of the
remaining members of the Trust Advisory Board. If any position on the Trust
Advisory Board remains vacant for more than thirty (30) days, such vacancy shall
be filled within fifteen (15) days thereafter by the designation of the Trustee
without the requirement of a vote by the other members of the Trust Advisory
Board.



                                      105
<PAGE>

                  (c) Discharge of Duties

         Upon the certification by the Trustee that all Trust Assets have been
distributed, abandoned or otherwise disposed of, the members of the Trust
Advisory Board shall resign their positions, whereupon they shall be discharged
from further duties and responsibilities.

                  (d) Settlement of Trust Claims

         The Trust Advisory Board shall, by majority vote, approve all
settlements of Trust Claims which the Trustee or any member of the Trust
Advisory Board may propose, provided, however, that (i) no member of the Trust
Advisory Board may cast a vote with respect to any Trust Claim to which it is a
party; and (ii) the Trustee may seek Bankruptcy Court approval of a settlement
of a Trust Claim if the Trust Advisory Board fails to act on a proposed
settlement of such Trust Claim within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of
such proposed settlement by the Trustee or as otherwise determined by the
Trustee.

                  (e) Investment of Trust Assets

         The Trust Advisory Board may, by majority vote, authorize the Trustee
to invest the corpus of the Trust in prudent investments other than those
described in section 345 of the Bankruptcy Code.

                  (f) Removal or Resignation of Trustee

         The Trust Advisory Board may remove the Trustee in its discretion. In
the event the requisite approval is not obtained, the Trustee may be removed by
the Bankruptcy Court for cause shown. In the event of the resignation or removal
of the Trustee, the Trust Advisory Board shall, by majority vote, designate a
person to serve as successor Trustee. The successor Trustee shall file an
affidavit demonstrating that such Person is disinterested as defined by section
101(14) of the Bankruptcy Code.

                  (g) Exculpation

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, neither the Trust
Advisory Board nor any of its members, designees, counsel, financial advisors or
any duly designated agent or representatives of any such party shall be liable
for the act, default or misconduct of any other member of the Trust Advisory
Board, nor shall any member be liable for anything other than such member's own
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Trust Advisory Board may, in
connection with the performance of its duties, and in its sole and absolute
discretion, consult with its counsel, accountants or other professionals, and
shall not be liable for anything done or omitted or suffered to be done in
accordance with such advice or opinions. If the Trust Advisory Board determines
not to consult with its counsel, accountants or other professionals, it shall
not be deemed to impose any liability on the Trust Advisory Board, or its
members and/or designees.

                  (h) Adoption of By-Laws

         The Trust Advisory Board shall govern its proceedings through the
adoption of by-laws, which the Trust Advisory Board may adopt by majority vote.
No provision of such by-laws shall supersede any express provision of the Plan.

         5. Distributions of Trust Assets

         Distributions of the Trust Recoveries to Claimholders and
Interestholders in accordance with their interests in the Kmart Creditor Trust
as set forth in the Plan shall be made at least semi-annually beginning with a
calendar quarter that is not later than the end of the second calendar quarter
after the Effective Date; provided, however, that the Trustee shall not be
required to make any such semiannual distribution in the event that the
aggregate proceeds and income available for distribution to such Claimholders is
not sufficient, in the Trustee's discretion (after consultation with the Trust
Advisory Board) to economically distribute monies. The Trustee will make
continuing efforts to prosecute or settle the Trust Claims, make timely
distributions, and not unduly prolong the duration of the Kmart Creditor Trust.

H. EFFECT OF THE PLAN ON CLAIMS AND INTERESTS

         1. Revesting of Assets

         Except as otherwise explicitly provided in the Plan, on the Effective
Date, all property comprising the Estates (including Retained Actions, but
excluding property that has been abandoned pursuant to an order of the
Bankruptcy Court) shall revest in each of the Debtors that owned such property
or interest in property as of the Effective Date, free and clear of all Claims,
liens, charges, encumbrances, rights and Interests of creditors and equity
security holders, provided, however, that (i) the Trust Claims shall be
transferred to the Kmart Creditor Trust pursuant to Section 11.2 of the Plan and
(ii) Qualifying Real Estate shall remain property of the Estate of the Debtor
that owns such Qualifying Real Estate. The term "Qualifying Real Estate" means
any (i) real estate lease, including a capital lease, under which a Debtor is a
lessee or (ii) real estate owned by a Debtor, in each case that is designated to
remain in such Debtor's Estate following the Effective Date and identified in a
writing by such Debtor filed and served on relevant parties in interest on or
before the Exhibit Filing Date.

         The Responsible Officer of the Estates of such Debtors shall have full
authority to dispose of the Qualifying Real Estate consistent with procedures
approved by the Bankruptcy Court and sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code. All liens and security interests, if any, in the Qualifying Real Estate
shall remain intact and attach to the net proceeds therefrom to the same extent,
validity, and relative priority as existed on the Effective Date, and all
proceeds remaining in the Estates of such Debtors after satisfaction of all
Allowed Secured Claims, if any, shall be transferred to the New Operating
Company. As of the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors may operate their
business and use, acquire, and dispose of property and settle and compromise
Claims or Interests without supervision of the Bankruptcy Court, free of any
restrictions of the Bankruptcy Code or Bankruptcy Rules, other than those
restrictions expressly imposed by the Plan and Confirmation Order.


                                      107
<PAGE>

         2. Discharge of Debtors

         Pursuant to section 1141(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, except as otherwise
specifically provided in the Plan or in the Confirmation Order, the
distributions and rights that are provided in the Plan shall be in complete
satisfaction, discharge, and release, effective as of the Confirmation Date (but
subject to the occurrence of the Effective Date), of Claims and Causes of
Action, whether known or unknown, against, liabilities of, liens on, obligations
of, rights against, and Interests in the Debtors or any of their assets or
properties, regardless of whether any property shall have been distributed or
retained pursuant to the Plan on account of such Claims, rights, and Interests,
including, but not limited to, Claims and Interests that arose before the
Confirmation Date, any liability (including withdrawal liability) to the extent
such Claims relate to services performed by employees of the Debtors prior to
the Petition Date and that arise from a termination of employment or a
termination of any employee or retiree benefit program, regardless of whether
such termination occurred prior to or after the Confirmation Date, and all debts
of the kind specified in sections 502(g), 502(h) or 502(i) of the Bankruptcy
Code, in each case whether or not (a) a proof of claim or interest based upon
such Claim, debt, right, or Interest is filed or deemed filed under section 501
of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) a Claim or Interest based upon such Claim, debt,
right, or Interest is allowed under section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, or (c)
the holder of such a Claim, right, or Interest accepted the Plan. The
Confirmation Order shall be a judicial determination of the discharge of all
Claims against and Interests in the Debtors, subject to the Effective Date
occurring.

         3. Compromises and Settlements

         In accordance with Article 9.6 of the Plan, pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule
9019(a), the Debtors may compromise and settle various (a) Claims against them
and (b) Causes of Action that they have against other Persons up to and
including the Effective Date. After the Effective Date, such right shall pass to
the Reorganized Debtors as contemplated in Article 11.1 of the Plan, without the
need for further approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

         4. Release by Debtors of Certain Parties

         Pursuant to section 1123(b)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code, and except as
otherwise provided for in the Plan, including Article 12.10, effective as of the
Effective Date, each Debtor, in its individual capacity and as a
debtor-in-possession for and on behalf of its Estate, shall release and
discharge and be deemed to have conclusively, absolutely, unconditionally,
irrevocably and forever released and discharged all Released Parties for and
from any and all claims or Causes of Action existing as of the Effective Date in
any manner arising from, based on or relating to, in whole or in part, the
Debtors, the subject matter of, or the transactions or events giving rise to,
any Claim or Interest that is treated in this Plan, the business or contractual
arrangements between any Debtor or any Released Party, the restructuring of
Claims and Interests prior to or in the Chapter 11 Cases, or any act, omission,
occurrence or event in any manner related to any such Claims, Interests,
restructuring or the Chapter 11 Cases. The Reorganized Debtors, the Kmart
Creditor Trust, and any newly-formed entities that will be continuing the
Debtors' businesses after the Effective Date shall be bound, to the same extent
the Debtors are bound, by all of the releases set forth above. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Plan shall be deemed to release any of the
Debtors or the Plan Investors or their



                                      108
<PAGE>

Affiliates from their obligations under the Investment Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby.

         The term "Released Parties" means, collectively, (i) all officers of
each of the Debtors, all members of the boards of directors of each of the
Debtors, and all employees of each of the Debtors, in each case, as of the date
of the commencement of the hearing on the Disclosure Statement, (ii) the
Statutory Committees and all members of the Statutory Committees in their
respective capacities as such, (iii) the DIP Agent in its capacity as such, (iv)
the DIP Lenders in their capacities as such, (v) the Plan Investors in their
capacities as such, (vi) the Prepetition Lenders in their capacities as such,
and (vii) with respect to each of the above-named Persons, such Person's
Affiliates, principals, employees, agents, officers, directors, financial
advisors, attorneys and other professionals, in their capacities as such. The
Reorganized Debtors, the Kmart Creditor Trust, and any newly-formed entities
that will be continuing the Debtors' businesses after the Effective Date shall
be bound, to the same extent the Debtors are bound, by all of the releases set
forth above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Plan releases or
shall be deemed to release any of the Debtors or the Plan Investors or their
Affiliates from their obligations under the Investment Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby.

         5. Release by Holders of Claims and Interests

         On the Effective Date, and except as otherwise provided for in the
Plan, including pursuant to Article 12.10 thereof, (a) each Person that votes to
accept the Plan; (b) to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, as
such law may be extended or interpreted subsequent to the Effective Date, each
entity (other than a Debtor) that has held, holds or may hold a Claim or
Interest, as applicable, in consideration for the obligations of the Debtors and
the Reorganized Debtors under the Plan and the Cash, New Holding Company Common
Stock, and other contracts, instruments, releases, agreements or documents to be
delivered in connection with the Plan (each, a "Release Obligor"), shall have
conclusively, absolutely, unconditionally, irrevocably and forever, released and
discharged each Released Party from any claim or Cause of Action existing as of
the Effective Date arising from, based on or relating to, in whole or in part,
the subject matter of, or the transaction or event giving rise to, the Claim or
Interest of such Release Obligor, and any act, omission, occurrence or event in
any manner related to such subject matter, transaction or obligation; provided,
however, that this provision shall not release any Released Party from any Cause
of Action existing as of the Effective Date, based on (i) the Internal Revenue
Code or other domestic state, city or municipal tax code, (ii) the environmental
laws of the United States or any domestic state, city or municipality, (iii) any
criminal laws of the United States or any domestic state, city or municipality,
or (iv) Sections 1104-1109 and 1342(d) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended.

         6. Setoffs

         The Debtors may, but shall not be required to, set off against any
Claim, and the payments or other distributions to be made pursuant to the Plan
in respect of such Claim, claims of any nature whatsoever that the Debtors may
have against such Claimholder; but neither the failure to do so nor the
allowance of any Claim hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release by the
Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors of any such claim that the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors may have against such Claimholder.



                                      109
<PAGE>

         7. Subordination Rights

         Except as otherwise specifically provided for in the Plan (including
with respect to the subordination provisions of all documents pertaining to the
Trust Preferred Securities, which such provisions shall be specifically
enforced), all Claims against the Debtors and all rights and claims between or
among Claimholders relating in any manner whatsoever to distributions on account
of Claims against or Interests in the Debtors, based upon any claimed
subordination rights, whether asserted or unasserted, legal or equitable, shall
be deemed satisfied by the distributions under the Plan to Claimholders or
Interestholders having such subordination rights, and such subordination rights
shall be deemed waived, released, discharged, and terminated as of the Effective
Date. Except as otherwise specifically provided for in the Plan, distributions
to the various Classes of Claims and Interests hereunder shall not be subject to
levy, garnishment, attachment, or like legal process by any Claimholder or
Interestholder by reason of any subordination rights or otherwise, so that each
Claimholder and Interestholder shall have and receive the benefit of the
distributions in the manner set forth in the Plan.

         8. Exculpation and Limitation of Liability

         Except as otherwise specifically provided for in the Plan, the Debtors,
the Reorganized Debtors, the Statutory Committees, the members of the Statutory
Committees in their capacities as such, the DIP Lenders in their capacities as
such, the DIP Agent in its capacity as such, the Plan Investors in their
capacities as such, the Prepetition Lenders in their capacities as such, and any
of such parties' respective present or former members, officers, directors,
employees, advisors, attorneys, representatives, financial advisors, investment
bankers, or agents and any of such parties' successors and assigns, shall not
have or incur, and are hereby released from, any claim, obligation, Cause of
Action, or liability to one another or to any Claimholder or Interestholder, or
any other party-in-interest, or any of their respective agents, employees,
representatives, financial advisors, attorneys or Affiliates, or any of their
successors or assigns, for any act or omission in connection with, relating to,
or arising out of the Debtors' Chapter 11 Cases, negotiation and filing of the
Plan, filing the Chapter 11 Cases, the pursuit of confirmation of the Plan, the
consummation of the Plan, or the administration of the Plan or the property to
be distributed under the Plan, except for their willful misconduct, and in all
respects shall be entitled to reasonably rely upon the advice of counsel with
respect to their duties and responsibilities under the Plan. Notwithstanding any
other provision of the Plan, no Claimholder or Interest holder, or other party
in interest, none of their respective agents, employees, representatives,
financial advisors, attorneys or affiliates, and no successors or assigns of the
foregoing, shall have any right of action against the parties listed in this
Section for any act or omission in connection with, relating to or arising out
of the Chapter 11 Cases, the pursuit of confirmation of the Plan, the
consummation of the Plan, or the administration of the Plan or the property to
be distributed under the Plan, except for their willful misconduct.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Plan releases or shall be deemed
to release any of the Debtors or the Plan Investors or their Affiliates from
their obligations under the Investment Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby.


                                      110
<PAGE>

         9. Indemnification Obligations

         The Plan contains provisions concerning the Indemnification Rights of
Indemnitees. The term "Indemnification Rights" means any obligations or rights
of the Debtors to indemnify, reimburse, advance, or contribute to the losses,
liabilities or expenses of an Indemnitee pursuant to the Debtor's certificate of
incorporation, bylaws, policy of providing employee indemnification, applicable
law, or specific agreement in respect of any claims, demands, suits, causes of
action or proceedings against an Indemnitee based upon any act or omission
related to an Indemnitee's service with, for, or on behalf of the Debtors. The
term "Indemnitee" means all present and former directors, officers, employees,
agents or representatives of the Debtors who are entitled to assert
Indemnification Rights.

         Except as specifically provided otherwise in the Plan, in satisfaction
and compromise of the Indemnitees' Indemnification Rights: (a) all
Indemnification Rights, except (i) those based upon any act or omission arising
out of or relating to any Indemnitee's service with, for, or on behalf of any of
the Debtors on or after the Petition Date who remain in the Debtors' service as
of the Effective Date, and (ii) those held by any Indemnitee who served in the
Chapter 11 Cases as of the commencement of the Disclosure Statement hearing as
the Debtors' respective officers, directors, or employees and/or serve in such
capacities (or similar capacities) after the Effective Date (the "Continuing
Indemnification Rights"), shall be released and discharged on and as of the
Effective Date, provided that the Indemnification Rights excepted in subparts
(i) and (ii) shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent allowed
by law or contract on and after the Effective Date and shall not be modified,
reduced, discharged, or otherwise affected in any way by the Chapter 11 Cases;
(b) the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be, covenant to
purchase and maintain director and officer insurance providing coverage for
those Indemnitees currently covered by such policies for a period of two years
after the Effective Date, and also agree to purchase tail coverage under
policies in existence as of the Effective Date, to the fullest extent permitted
by such provisions, in each case insuring such parties in respect of any claims,
demands, suits, Causes of Action, or proceedings against such Persons based upon
any act or omission related to such Person's service with, for, or on behalf of
the Debtors in at least the scope and amount as currently maintained by the
Debtors (the "Insurance Coverage"); (c) the insurers who issued the Insurance
Coverage are authorized to pay any professional fees and expenses incurred in
connection with any action relating to any Continuing Indemnification Rights;
and (d) the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be, hereby
indemnify Indemnitees with Continuing Indemnification Rights and agree to pay
for any deductible or retention amount that may be payable in connection with
any claim covered under either the foregoing Insurance Coverage or any prior
similar policy.

         10. Limitations on Releases/Exculpation

         Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, no provision of
this Plan or of the Confirmation Order, including, without limitation, any
release or exculpation provision, shall modify, release or otherwise limit the
liability of any Person not specifically released hereunder, including, without
limitation, any Person that is a co-obligor or joint tortfeasor of a Released
Party, that otherwise is liable under theories of vicarious or other derivative
liability, or that is or becomes the subject of a Trust Claim.


                                      111
<PAGE>

         Although the Plan provides for certain releases, exculpations, and
indemnification rights in favor of certain Persons and entities, as set forth in
Article 12.10 of the Plan, no release, exculpation, or indemnification rights
are granted under the Plan with respect to any Trust Claim, in favor of any
Person or entity that is or becomes the subject of any Trust Claim and as to all
such Persons and entities, all claims, all Causes of Action, and all rights of
the Debtors' Estates are fully reserved with respect to the Trust Claims.

         11. Injunction

         The satisfaction, release, and discharge provisions of the Plan shall
act as an injunction against any Person commencing or continuing any action,
employment of process, or act to collect, offset, or recover any Claim or Cause
of Action satisfied, released, or discharged under the Plan to the fullest
extent authorized or provided by the Bankruptcy Code, including, without
limitation, to the extent provided for or authorized by sections 524 and 1141
thereof.

                     VIII. CERTAIN FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED

         The holder of a Claim against a Debtor should read and carefully
consider the following factors, as well as the other information set forth in
this Disclosure Statement (and the documents delivered together herewith and/or
incorporated by reference herein) before deciding whether to vote to accept or
to reject the Plan.

A. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

         The formulation of a reorganization plan is the principal purpose of a
chapter 11 case. The Plan sets forth the means for satisfying the holders of
Claims against and Interests in the Debtors. Certain Claims may receive partial
distributions pursuant to the Plan, and in some instances, no distributions at
all. The recapitalization of the Debtors realizes the going concern value of the
Debtors for their Claimholders and Interestholders. Moreover, reorganization of
the Debtors' business and operations under the proposed Plan also avoids the
potentially adverse impact of a liquidation on the Debtors' employees and many
of its customers, trade vendors, suppliers of goods and services, and lessors.

B. CERTAIN BANKRUPTCY CONSIDERATIONS

         If the Plan is not confirmed and consummated, there can be no assurance
that the Chapter 11 Cases will continue rather than be converted to a
liquidation or that any alternative plan of reorganization would be on terms as
favorable to the holders of Claims and Interests as the terms of the Plan. If a
liquidation or protracted reorganization were to occur, there is a substantial
risk that the value of the Debtors' enterprise would be substantially eroded to
the detriment of all stakeholders. See Appendix B attached to this Disclosure
Statement for a liquidation analysis of the Debtors.





                                      112
<PAGE>


C. BUSINESS FACTORS AND COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

         1. General Economic Conditions

         Kmart's five-year business plan has assumed that the general economic
conditions of the United States economy and the retail industry will improve
over the next several years. An improvement of economic conditions is subject to
many factors outside the Debtors' control, including interest rates, inflation,
unemployment rates, consumer spending, war and other such factors. Any one of
these or other economic factors could have a significant impact on the operating
performance of the Reorganized Debtors. There is no guarantee that economic
conditions will improve in the near term.

         2. Business Factors

         The Debtors' operating performance is tied to the Debtors' ability to,
among other things (i) accurately anticipate changes in consumer spending and
buying patterns and implement appropriate inventory strategies to accommodate
those changes, (ii) accurately anticipate marketplace demand for the products of
key brand partners, as well as the ability of the Reorganized Debtors to engage
appropriate new brand partners to keep up with changing trends, (iii) acquire
desired goods in appropriate quantities and fulfill labor needs at planned
costs, (iv) properly monitor inventory needs and in-stock levels, (v)
successfully implement business strategies and otherwise execute planned changes
in various aspects of the business, (vi) attract, motivate and/or retain key
executives and employees and (vii) attract and retain customers.

         Any one of the above-referenced factors, many of which may be affected
by circumstances outside the Debtors' control, could have an impact on the
Reorganized Debtors' operating performance. In addition, should the Reorganized
Debtors experience a significant disruption of terms with vendors, margins fail
to improve, or the availability of capital is affected, compliance with
financial covenants and cash resources could be affected.

         3. Competitive Conditions

         In addition to uncertain economic and business conditions, the
Reorganized Debtors will likely face competitive pressures and other third party
actions, including pressures from pricing and other promotional activities of
competitors as well as new competitive store openings. The Reorganized Debtors'
anticipated operating performance will be impacted by these and other
unpredictable activities by competitors.

         4. Other Factors

         Other factors that holders of Claims and Interests should consider are
potential regulatory and legal developments that may impact the Debtors'
business. Although these and other such factors are beyond the Debtors' control
and cannot be determined in advance, they could have a significant impact on the
Reorganized Debtors' operating performance.


                                      113
<PAGE>

D. SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS

         Because of the seasonal nature of the Debtors' business and the retail
industry, merchandise sales and cash flows from operations are historically
higher in the fourth quarter than any other period. In addition, a
disproportionate amount of operating income and cash flows from operations is
earned in the fourth quarter. The Debtors' results of operations and cash flows
are primarily dependent upon the large sales volume generated during the fourth
quarter of the Debtors' fiscal year. In fiscal year 2001, for example, sales
during the fourth quarter represented over 30% of total net sales for the fiscal
year. Thus, operating performance for the interim periods is not necessarily
indicative of operating performance for the entire year.

         In addition, weather conditions, including those which affect buying
patterns of the Debtors' customers, can have a significant impact on operating
performance for a particular season or fiscal year. As a result, depending on
the weather conditions during a peak shopping season or operating quarter,
operating performance may be positively or negatively impacted.

E. INHERENT UNCERTAINTY OF FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS

         The Projections set forth in Appendix D annexed hereto cover the
operations of the Reorganized Debtors on a consolidated basis through fiscal
year 2007. These Projections are based on numerous assumptions including the
timing, confirmation, and consummation of the Plan in accordance with its terms,
the anticipated future performance of the Reorganized Debtors, general business
and economic conditions, and other matters, many of which are beyond the control
of the Reorganized Debtors and some or all of which may not materialize. In
addition, unanticipated events and circumstances occurring subsequent to the
date that this Disclosure Statement is approved by the Bankruptcy Court may
affect the actual financial results of the Debtors' operations.

         Critical assumptions underlying the Debtors' five-year business plan
that will have a significant impact on the Reorganized Debtors' ability to
achieve projections, and that correspondingly have a material impact on value,
include the ability of the company to (i) reverse significant comparable store
sales declines and achieve positive comparable store sales growth; (ii) improve
gross margins; (iii) reduce operating costs; and (iv) improve management of
working capital, including projected improvements in days payable outstanding.

         The foregoing variations and assumptions may be material and may
adversely affect the ability of the Reorganized Debtors to make payments with
respect to post-Effective Date indebtedness and to achieve the Projections.
Because the actual results achieved throughout the periods covered by the
Projections can be expected to vary from the projected results, the Projections
should not be relied upon as a guaranty, representation, or other assurance that
the actual results will occur.

         During the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors have not been able to
satisfactorily project their operating and financial performance, particularly
with respect to sales. Actual results achieved did not meet forecasts prepared
by the company and shared with their Statutory Committees. The Debtors' gross
margin was significantly below the projections contained in the original Chapter
11 operating plan, and although certain covenants in the DIP Facility were re-
set pursuant to a new plan in September 2002 to lower such projections, the
company missed



                                      114
<PAGE>

these projections as well. The Debtors are still in the process of developing
and implementing a reliable mechanism for forecasting sales and gross margin.

         Except with respect to the Projections and except as otherwise
specifically and expressly stated herein, this Disclosure Statement does not
reflect any events that may occur subsequent to the date hereof and that may
have a material impact on the information contained in this Disclosure
Statement. Neither the Debtors nor the Reorganized Debtors intend to update the
Projections for the purposes hereof; thus, the Projections will not reflect the
impact of any subsequent events not already accounted for in the assumptions
underlying the Projections.

F. ACCESS TO FINANCING AND TRADE TERMS

         The Debtors' operations are dependent on the availability and cost of
working capital financing and trade terms provided by vendors and may be
adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing and trade
vendor support. The Debtors' postpetition operations have been financed from
operating cash flow and borrowings pursuant to the DIP Facility. The Debtors
believe that substantially all of their needs for funds necessary to consummate
the Plan and for post-Effective Date working capital financing will be met by
projected operating cash flow, the Exit Facility, and trade terms supplied by
vendors. Moreover, if the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors require working
capital and trade financing greater than that provided by projected operating
cash flow, the Exit Facility, and trade financing, they may be required either
to (a) obtain other sources of financing or (b) curtail their operations. The
Debtors believe that the recapitalization to be accomplished through the Plan
will facilitate the ability to obtain additional or replacement working capital
financing.

         No assurance can be given, however, that any additional replacement
financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to the
Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors. Kmart believes that it is important to its
go-forward business plan that its performance meet projected results in order to
ensure continued support from vendors and factors. There are risks to Kmart in
the event such support erodes after emergence from Chapter 11 that could be
alleviated by remaining in Chapter 11. Chapter 11 affords a debtor such as Kmart
the opportunity to close stores and liquidate assets relatively expeditiously,
tools that will not be available to Kmart upon emergence. However, the Debtors
believe that the benefits of emergence from Chapter 11 at this time outweigh the
potential costs of remaining in Chapter 11, and that emergence at this time is
in the long-term operational best interests of the company.

G. CLAIMS ESTIMATIONS

         There can be no assurance that the estimated Claim amounts set forth
herein are correct. The actual Allowed amount of Claims likely will differ in
some respect from the estimates. The estimated amounts are subject to certain
risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or
uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the
actual Allowed amount of Claims may vary from those estimated herein.


                                      115

H. POTENTIAL DILUTION CAUSED BY OPTIONS OR WARRANTS

         As stated above, the Management Compensation Plan may reserve for
certain members of management, directors, and other employees of the Reorganized
Debtors a certain number of shares of New Holding Company Common Stock,
including options or warrants to acquire such Stock upon terms outlined in the
Management Compensation Plan. Indeed, as noted above, the proposed agreement
with Mr. Day provides for a 10-year stock option to purchase a number of shares
of common stock representing 1.5% of the Reorganized Debtors' fully diluted
equity at emergence. Moreover, ESL has certain options under the Investment
Agreement to purchase additional shares of New Holding Company Common Stock. If
holders of options or warrants to purchase the New Holding Company Common Stock
are exercised or other equity interests are distributed to management as
discussed above, such equity interests will dilute the ownership percentage
represented by the New Holding Company Common Stock distributed on the Effective
Date under the Plan.

I. MARKET FOR NEW SECURITIES

         There can be no assurance that an active market for any of the
securities to be distributed pursuant to the Plan, including the New Holding
Company Common Stock, will develop and no assurance can be given as to the
prices at which such securities might be traded. Moreover, there can be no
assurances that Reorganized Debtors will be successful in their attempt to have
the New Holding Company Common Stock listed on a national securities exchange, a
foreign securities exchange or a national quotation system such as the Nasdaq
National Market.

J. POTENTIAL OWNERSHIP CHANGE

         Because the Plan Investors will hold a significant equity position in
the Reorganized Debtors following the consummation of the plan, if the Plan
Investors dispose of all or a significant amount of this position after the
Effective Date, it could cause the Reorganized Debtors to undergo an ownership
change (within the meaning of IRC section 382). This would generally limit (or
possibly eliminate) the Reorganized Debtors' ability to use NOLs and other tax
attributes.

K. TAX PLANNING

         Due to time and resource constraints resulting from the commencement of
the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors have used and may continue to use certain
estimating techniques in connection with their tax planning efforts (for
example, in determining the existence and magnitude of built-in gains or
losses). The use of such estimating techniques, while cost-effective,
necessarily results in lower confidence levels with respect to certain of the
tax analyses.

L. DIVIDENDS

         The Debtors do not anticipate that cash dividends or other
distributions will be paid with respect to the New Holding Company Common Stock
in the foreseeable future.



                                      116
<PAGE>

M. IMPACT OF INTEREST RATES

         Changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates may affect the
fair market value of the Debtors' assets. Specifically, decreases in interest
rates will positively impact the value of the Debors' assets and the
strengthening of the dollar will negatively impact the value of their net
foreign assets, although the value of such foreign assets is very small in
relation to the value of the Debtors' operations as a whole.

               VIII. RESALE OF SECURITIES RECEIVED UNDER THE PLAN

A. ISSUANCE OF NEW COMMON STOCK

         Section 1145(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code exempts the offer and sale of
securities under a plan of reorganization from registration under section 5 of
the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and state laws if three
principal requirements are satisfied: (i) the securities must be offered and
sold under a plan of reorganization and must be securities of the debtor, of an
affiliate participating in a joint plan with the debtor, or of a successor to
the debtor under the plan; (ii) the recipients of the securities must hold
prepetition or administrative expense claims against the debtor or interests in
the debtor; and (iii) the securities must be issued entirely in exchange for the
recipient's claim against or interest in the debtor, or principally in exchange
for such claims or interests and partly for cash or property. The Debtors
believe that the offer and sale of the New Common Stock under the Plan to
Claimholders satisfy the requirements of section 1145(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy
Code and are, therefore, exempt from registration under the Securities Act and
state securities laws.

B. SUBSEQUENT TRANSFERS OF NEW COMMON STOCK

         The New Common Stock or other securities to be issued pursuant to the
Plan may be freely transferred by most recipients following initial issuance
under the Plan, and all resales and subsequent transactions in the New Common
Stock or other securities so issued are exempt from registration under federal
and state securities laws, unless the holder is an "underwriter" with respect to
such securities. Section 1145(b) of the Bankruptcy Code defines four types of
"underwriters":

                  (i) persons who purchase a claim against, an interest in, or a
claim for an administrative expense against the debtor with a view to
distributing any security received in exchange for such claim or interest;

                  (ii) persons who offer to sell securities offered under a plan
for the holders of such securities;

                  (iii) persons who offer to buy such securities from the
holders of such securities, if the offer to buy is:

                           (A) with a view to distributing such securities; and

                           (B) under an agreement made in connection with the
plan, the consummation of the plan, or with the offer or sale of securities
under the plan; or



                                      117
<PAGE>

                  (iv) a person who is an "issuer" with respect to the
securities as the term "issuer" is defined in section 2(11) of the Securities
Act.

         Under section 2(11) of the Securities Act, an "issuer" includes any
person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the issuer, or any
person under direct or indirect common control of the issuer.

         To the extent that Persons who receive New Common Stock pursuant to the
Plan are deemed to be "underwriters," resales by such persons would not be
exempted by section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code from registration under the
Securities Act or other applicable law. Persons deemed to be underwriters would,
however, be permitted to sell such New Common Stock or other securities without
registration pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
These rules permit the public sale of securities received by "underwriters" if
current information regarding the issuer is publicly available and if volume
limitations and certain other conditions are met.

         Whether or not any particular person would be deemed to be an
"underwriter" with respect to the New Common Stock or other security to be
issued pursuant to the Plan would depend upon various facts and circumstances
applicable to that person. Accordingly, the Debtors express no view as to
whether any particular Person receiving New Common Stock or other securities
under the Plan would be an "underwriter" with respect to such New Common Stock
or other securities.

         Given the complex and subjective nature of the question of whether a
particular holder may be an underwriter, the Debtors make no representation
concerning the right of any person to trade in the New Common Stock or other
securities. The Debtors recommend that potential recipients of the New Common
Stock or other securities consult their own counsel concerning whether they may
freely trade New Common Stock or other securities without compliance with the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

                           IX. CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME
                          TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PLAN

         A summary description of certain United States federal income tax
consequences of the Plan is provided below. This description is for
informational purposes only and, due to a lack of definitive judicial or
administrative authority or interpretation, substantial uncertainties exist with
respect to various tax consequences of the Plan as discussed herein. Only the
principal United States federal income tax consequences of the Plan to the
Debtors and to Claimholders who are entitled to vote to accept or reject the
Plan are described below. No opinion of counsel has been sought or obtained with
respect to any tax consequences of the Plan. No rulings or determinations of the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or any other tax authorities have been
sought or obtained with respect to any tax consequences of the Plan, and the
discussion below is not binding upon the IRS or such other authorities. No
representations are being made regarding the particular tax consequences of the
confirmation and consummation of the Plan to the Debtors or any Claimholder. No
assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not
sustain, a different position from any discussed herein.



                                      118
<PAGE>

         The discussion of United States federal income tax consequences below
is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "IRC"), Treasury
Regulations, judicial authorities, published positions of the IRS and other
applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this document and all of
which are subject to change or differing interpretations (possibly with
retroactive effect).

         The following discussion does not address foreign, state or local tax
consequences of the Plan, nor does it purport to address the United States
federal income tax consequences of the Plan to special classes of taxpayers
(e.g., banks and certain other financial institutions, insurance companies,
tax-exempt organizations, governmental entities, The Plan Investor, persons that
are, or hold their Claims through, pass-through entities, persons whose
functional currency is not the United States dollar, foreign persons, dealers in
securities or foreign currency, employees, persons who received their Claims
pursuant to the exercise of an employee stock option or otherwise as
compensation and persons holding Claims that are a hedge against, or that are
hedged against, currency risk or that are part of a straddle, constructive sale
or conversion transaction). Furthermore, the following discussion does not
address United States federal taxes other than income taxes.

         Each holder is strongly urged to consult its own tax advisor regarding
the United States federal, state, and local and any foreign tax consequences of
the transactions described herein and in the Plan.

A. UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THE DEBTORS

         1. Cancellation of Indebtedness Income.

         Upon implementation of the Plan, the amount of the Debtors' aggregate
outstanding indebtedness will be substantially reduced. In general, the
discharge of a debt obligation in exchange for an amount of cash and other
property having a fair market value (or, in the case of a new debt instrument,
an "issue price") less than the "adjusted issue price" of the debt gives rise to
cancellation of indebtedness ("COD") income to the debtor. However, COD income
is not taxable to the debtor if the debt discharge occurs in a Title 11
bankruptcy case. Rather, under the IRC, such COD income instead will reduce
certain of the Debtors' tax attributes, generally in the following order: (a)
net operating losses ("NOLs") and NOL carryforwards; (b) general business credit
carryforwards; (c) minimum tax credit carryforwards; (d) capital loss
carryforwards; (e) the tax basis of the Debtors' depreciable and nondepreciable
assets (but not below the amount of its liabilities immediately after the
discharge); and (f) foreign tax credit carryforwards. A debtor may elect to
alter the preceding order of attribute reduction and, instead, first reduce the
tax basis of its depreciable assets (and, possibly, the depreciable assets of
its subsidiaries). The reduction in tax attributes occurs only after the tax for
the year of the debt discharge has been determined (i.e., such attributes may be
available to offset taxable income that accrues between the date of discharge
and the end of the Debtors' tax year). Any excess COD income over the amount of
available tax attributes is not subject to United States federal income tax and
has no other United States federal income tax impact.

         Because some of the Debtors' outstanding indebtedness will be satisfied
in exchange for New Holding Company Common Stock, the amount of COD income, and
accordingly the amount of tax attributes required to be reduced, will depend in
part on the fair market value of



                                      119
<PAGE>

the New Holding Company Common Stock. This value cannot be known with certainty
until after the Effective Date. Thus, although it is expected that the Debtors
may be required to reduce their tax attributes, the exact amount of such
reduction cannot be predicted.

         2. Net Operating Losses--Section 382.

         The Debtors anticipate that they will experience an "ownership change"
(within the meaning of IRC section 382) on the Effective Date as a result of the
issuance of New Holding Company Common Stock to Claimholders and the Plan
Investor pursuant to the Plan. As a result, the Debtors' ability to use any
pre-Effective Date NOLs or other tax attributes to offset their income in any
post-Effective Date taxable year (and in the portion of the taxable year of the
ownership change following the Effective Date) to which such a carryforward is
made generally (subject to various exceptions and adjustments, some of which are
described below) will be limited to the sum of (a) a regular annual limitation
(prorated for the portion of the taxable year of the ownership change following
the Effective Date), (b) the amount of the "recognized built-in gain" for the
year which does not exceed the excess of their "net unrealized built-in gain,"
if any, over previously recognized built-in gains (as the quoted terms are
defined in IRC section 382(h)), and (c) any carryforward of unused amounts
described in (a) and (b) from prior years. IRC section 382 may also limit the
Debtors' ability to use "net unrealized built-in losses" to offset future
taxable income. Moreover, the Debtors' loss carryforwards will be subject to
further limitations if the Debtors experience additional future ownership
changes or if they do not continue their business enterprise for at least two
years following the Effective Date. The Debtors may not have any meaningful
pre-Effective Date NOLs following the Effective Date.

         The operation and effect of IRC section 382 will be materially
different from that just described if the Debtors are subject to the special
rules for corporations in bankruptcy provided in IRC section 382(l)(5). In that
case, the Debtors' ability to utilize their pre-Effective Date NOLs would not be
limited as described in the preceding paragraph. However, several other
limitations would apply to the Debtors under IRC section 382(l)(5), including
(a) the Debtors' NOLs would be calculated without taking into account deductions
for interest paid or accrued in the portion of the current tax year ending on
the Effective Date and all other tax years ending during the three-year period
prior to the current tax year with respect to the Claims that are exchanged for
New Holding Company Common Stock pursuant to the Plan, and (b) if the Debtors
undergo another ownership change within two years after the Effective Date, the
Debtors' IRC section 382 limitation with respect to that ownership change will
be zero. It is uncertain whether the provisions of IRC section 382(l)(5) would
apply in the case of the ownership change that is expected to occur as a result
of the confirmation of the Plan. However, under IRC section 382(1)(5)(H), the
Debtors may elect not to have the special rules of IRC section 382(l)(5) apply
(in which case the IRC section 382 rules, described above, generally will
apply). The Debtors have not yet determined whether they would elect to have the
IRC section 382(l)(5) rules apply to the ownership change arising from the
consummation of the Plan (assuming IRC section 382(l)(5) would otherwise apply).

         Because the Plan Investor will hold a significant equity position in
the Reorganized Debtors following the consummation of the plan, if the Plan
Investor disposes of all or a significant amount of this position after the
Effective Date, it could cause the Reorganized



                                      120
<PAGE>

Debtors to undergo an ownership change. This would generally limit (or possibly
eliminate) the Reorganized Debtors' ability to use NOLs and other tax
attributes.

B. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO CLAIMHOLDERS AND INTERESTHOLDERS OF THE
   DEBTORS

         The following discusses certain United States federal income tax
consequences of the transactions contemplated by the Plan to Claimholders that
are "United States holders," as defined below. The United States federal income
tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by the Plan to Claimholders
(including the character, timing and amount of income, gain or loss recognized)
will depend upon, among other things, (1) whether the Claim and the
consideration received in respect thereof are "securities" for federal income
tax purposes; (2) the manner in which a holder acquired a Claim; (3) the length
of time the Claim has been held; (4) whether the Claim was acquired at a
discount; (5) whether the holder has taken a bad debt deduction with respect to
the Claim (or any portion thereof) in the current or prior years; (6) whether
the holder has previously included in its taxable income accrued but unpaid
interest with respect to the Claim; (7) the holder's method of tax accounting;
and (8) whether the Claim is an installment obligation for federal income tax
purposes. Therefore, Claimholders should consult their own tax advisors for
information that may be relevant to their particular situations and
circumstances and the particular tax consequences to them of the transactions
contemplated by the Plan. This discussion assumes that the holder has not taken
a bad debt deduction with respect to a Claim (or any portion thereof) in the
current or any prior year and such Claim did not become completely or partially
worthless in a prior taxable year. Moreover, the Debtors intend to claim
deductions to the extent they are permitted to deduct any amounts they pay in
cash, stock or other property pursuant to the Plan.

         For purposes of the following discussion, a "United States holder" is a
Claimholder that is (1) a citizen or individual resident of the United States,
(2) a partnership or corporation created or organized in the United States or
under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof, (3) an
estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation
regardless of its source, or (4) a trust if (i) a court within the United States
is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and
one or more United States fiduciaries have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust was in existence on August
20, 1996 and properly elected to be treated as a United States person.



                                      121
<PAGE>
         1. Holders of Secured Claims.

         The holders of Secured Claims may recognize income, gain or loss for
United States federal income tax purposes with respect to the discharge of their
Claims, depending on whether their Claims are reinstated or, if not reinstated,
on the outcome of their negotiations with the Debtors. A holder whose Secured
Claim is reinstated pursuant to the Plan will not recognize gain or loss unless
either (i) such holder is treated as having received interest, damages or other
income in connection with the reinstatement or (ii) such reinstatement is
considered a "significant modification" of the Claim. A holder who receives cash
or other property in exchange for its Claim pursuant to the Plan will generally
recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes in
an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount of cash or fair market
value of other property, if any, received in exchange for its Claim and (ii) the
holder's adjusted tax basis in its Claim. The character of such gain or loss as
capital gain or loss or as ordinary income or loss will be determined by a
number of factors, including the tax status of the holder, the nature of the
Claim in such holder's hands, whether the Claim constitutes a capital asset in
the hands of the holder, whether the Claim was purchased at a discount, and
whether and to what extent the holder has previously claimed a bad debt
deduction with respect to its Claim.

                  (a) Accrued Interest

         Under the Plan, cash or other property may be distributed or deemed
distributed to certain Claimholders with respect to their Claims for accrued
interest. Holders of Claims for accrued interest which previously have not
included such accrued interest in taxable income will be required to recognize
ordinary income equal to the amount of cash or other property received with
respect to such Claims for accrued interest. Holders of Claims for accrued
interest which have included such accrued interest in taxable income generally
may take an ordinary deduction to the extent that such Claim is not fully
satisfied under the Plan (after allocating the distribution between principal
and accrued interest), even if the underlying Claim is held as a capital asset.
The adjusted tax basis of any property received in exchange for Claim for
accrued interest will equal the fair market value of such property on the
Effective Date, and the holding period for the property will begin on the day
after the Effective Date. The extent to which consideration distributable under
the Plan is allocable to interest is not clear. Claimholders are advised to
consult their own tax advisors to determine the amount, if any, of consideration
received under the Plan that is allocable to interest.

                  (b) Market Discount

         The market discount provisions of the IRC may apply to holders of
certain Claims. In general, a debt obligation other than a debt obligation with
a fixed maturity of one year or less that is acquired by a holder in the
secondary market (or, in certain circumstances, upon original issuance) is a
"market discount bond" as to that holder if its stated redemption price at
maturity (or, in the case of a debt obligation having original issue discount,
the revised issue price) exceeds the adjusted tax basis of the bond in the
holder's hands immediately after its acquisition. However, a debt obligation
will not be a "market discount bond" if such excess is less than a statutory de
minimis amount. Gain recognized by a creditor with respect to a "market discount
bond" will generally be treated as ordinary interest income to the extent of the
market discount accrued on such bond during the creditor's period of ownership,
unless the




                                      122
<PAGE>
creditor elected to include accrued market discount in taxable income currently.
A holder of a market discount bond that is required under the market discount
rules of the IRC to defer deduction of all or a portion of the interest on
indebtedness incurred or maintained to acquire or carry the bond may be allowed
to deduct such interest, in whole or in part, on disposition of such bond.

         2. Holders of Other Priority Claims and Prepetition Lender Claims.

         A holder whose Claim is paid in full or otherwise discharged on the
Effective Date will recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal
income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount
of cash received by such holder in respect of its Claim and (ii) the holder's
adjusted tax basis in the Claim. The character of such gain or loss as capital
gain or loss or as ordinary income or loss will be determined by a number of
factors, including the tax status of the holder, the nature of the Claim in such
holder's hands, whether the Claim constitutes a capital asset in the hands of
the holder, whether the Claim was purchased at a discount, and whether and to
what extent the holder has previously claimed a bad debt deduction with respect
to its Claim. A holder recognizing a loss as a result of the Plan may be
entitled to a bad debt deduction, either in the taxable year of the Effective
Date or a prior taxable year. In addition, the rules summarized above with
respect to accrued interest and market discount may also apply with respect to
the receipt of cash in discharge of a holder's Other Priority Claim or
Prepetition Lender Claim.


         3. Holders of Non-Lender Claims.

         A holder of Non-Lender Claims that receives New Holding Company Common
Stock and an interest in the Kmart Creditor Trust in exchange for its Claim
pursuant to the Plan will generally recognize income, gain or loss for United
States federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between
(1) the fair market value on the Effective Date of the New Holding Company
Common Stock received, plus the fair market value, if any, on the Effective Date
of its pro rata share of the Trust Assets deemed received, in exchange for its
Claim, and (2) the holder's adjusted tax basis in its Claim. The character of
such gain or loss as capital gain or loss or as ordinary income or loss will be
determined by a number of factors, including the tax status of the holder, the
nature of the Claim in such holder's hands, whether the Claim constitutes a
capital asset in the hands of the holder, whether the Claim was purchased at a
discount, and whether and to what extent the holder has previously claimed a bad
debt deduction with respect to its Claim. A holder recognizing a loss as a
result of the Plan may be entitled to a bad debt deduction, either in the
taxable year of the Effective Date or a prior taxable year. In addition, the
rules summarized above with respect to accrued interest and market discount may
also apply with respect to the receipt of New Holding Company Common Stock and
interest in the Kmart Creditor Trust in discharge of a holder's Non-Lender
Claim. A holder's aggregate tax basis in the New Holding Company Common Stock
and interest in the Kmart Creditor Trust it receives pursuant to the Plan would
generally be equal to the aggregate fair market value on the Effective Date of
such stock and its pro rata share of the Trust Assets. The holding period for
the New Holding Company Common Stock and the interest in the Kmart Creditor
Trust would begin on the day after the Effective Date.






                                      123
<PAGE>
         4. Holders of Other Unsecured Claims.

         Holders of Other Unsecured Claims who make the Other Unsecured Claim
Election will be treated as holders of Non-Lender Claims and will have the tax
consequences described above under the heading, "Holders of Non-Lender Claims."
Holders of Other Unsecured Claims who do not make the Other Unsecured Claim
Election will receive under the Plan a pro rata portion of the Other Unsecured
Claim Payment Amount, which will be paid in cash on the third anniversary of the
Effective Date. A holder will recognize income, gain or loss for United States
federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the
fair market value on the Effective Date of its pro rata portion of the Other
Unsecured Claim Payment Amount and (ii) the holder's adjusted tax basis in the
Claim. The character of such gain or loss as capital gain or loss or as ordinary
income or loss will be determined by a number of factors, including the tax
status of the holder, the nature of the Claim in such holder's hands, whether
the Claim constitutes a capital asset in the hands of the holder, whether the
Claim was purchased at a discount, and whether and to what extent the holder has
previously claimed a bad debt deduction with respect to its Claim. A holder
recognizing a loss as a result of the Plan may be entitled to a bad debt
deduction, either in the taxable year of the Effective Date or a prior taxable
year. In addition, the rules summarized above with respect to accrued interest
and market discount may also apply with respect to the receipt of a pro rata
portion of the Other Unsecured Claim Payment Amount in discharge of a holder's
Other Unsecured Claim. A holder will generally have a tax basis in its pro rata
portion of the Other Unsecured Claim Payment Amount received in exchange for its
Other Unsecured Claims equal to its fair market value on the Effective Date, and
the holding period for such pro rata portion of the Other Unsecured Claim
Payment Amount would begin on the day after the Effective Date. Interest on the
Other Unsecured Claim Payment Amount will be taxable to a holder as ordinary
income at the time it is received or accrued depending on the holder's method of
accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.

         5. Holders of General Unsecured Convenience Claims.

         A holder of General Unsecured Convenience Claims that receives cash in
discharge of its Claim pursuant to the Plan will generally recognize income,
gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to
the difference between (i) the amount of cash received in exchange for its Claim
and (ii) the holder's adjusted tax basis in its Claim. The character of such
gain or loss as capital gain or loss or as ordinary income or loss will be
determined by a number of factors, including the tax status of the holder, the
nature of the Claim in such holder's hands, whether the Claim constitutes a
capital asset in the hands of the holder, whether the Claim was purchased at a
discount, and whether and to what extent the holder has previously claimed a bad
debt deduction with respect to its Claim. A holder recognizing a loss as a
result of the Plan may be entitled to a bad debt deduction, either in the
taxable year of the Effective Date or a prior taxable year. In addition, the
rules summarized above with respect to accrued interest and market discount may
also apply with respect to the receipt of cash in discharge of a holder's
General Unsecured Convenience Claim.





                                      124
<PAGE>
         6. Holders of Subordinated Securities Claims.

         A holder of Subordinated Securities Claims will recognize income, gain
or loss for United States federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the
difference between (i) the fair market value, if any, on the Effective Date of
its pro rata share of the Trust Assets deemed received by such holder, if any,
under the Plan and (ii) the holder's adjusted tax basis in the Claim. The
character of such gain or loss as capital gain or loss or as ordinary income or
loss will be determined by a number of factors, including the tax status of the
holder, the nature of the Claim in such holder's hands, whether the Claim
constitutes a capital asset in the hands of the holder, whether the Claim was
purchased at a discount, and whether and to what extent the holder has
previously claimed a bad debt deduction with respect to its Claim. A holder
recognizing a loss as a result of the Plan may be entitled to a bad debt
deduction, either in the taxable year of the Effective Date or a prior taxable
year. In addition, the rules summarized above with respect to accrued interest
and market discount may also apply with respect to the receipt of an interest in
the Kmart Creditor Trust in discharge of a holder's Subordinated Securities
Claim. A holder that receives an interest in the Kmart Creditor Trust pursuant
to the Plan would have a tax basis in its interest that would generally be equal
to the fair market value on the Effective Date of its pro rata share of the
Trust Assets. The holding period for the interest in the Kmart Creditor Trust
would begin on the day after the Effective Date.

         7. Existing Interestholders.

         An existing Interestholder who holds existing common stock of Kmart
will generally recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax
purposes in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the fair market value,
if any, on the Effective Date of its pro rata share of the Trust Assets deemed
received by such Interestholder, if any, under the Plan and (ii) such
stockholder's adjusted tax basis in its existing common stock cancelled under
the Plan. The character of such loss as capital loss or as ordinary loss will be
determined by a number of factors, including the tax status of the holder and
whether the Interestholder holds its common stock of Kmart as a capital asset.
An Interestholder that receives an interest in the Kmart Creditor Trust pursuant
to the Plan would have a tax basis in its interest that would generally be equal
to the fair market value on the Effective Date of its pro rata share of the
Trust Assets. The holding period for the interest in the Kmart Creditor Trust
would begin on the day after the Effective Date.

         8. Other Claimholders.

         To the extent certain Claimholders reach an agreement with the Debtors
to have their Claims satisfied, settled, released, exchanged or otherwise
discharged in a manner other than as discussed above, such holders should
consult with their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of
such treatment.

         9. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.

         Certain payments, including payments in respect of accrued interest or
market discount, are generally subject to information reporting by the payor to
the IRS. Moreover, such reportable payments are subject to backup withholding
under certain circumstances. Under the IRC's backup withholding rules, a United
States holder may be subject to backup withholding at





                                      125
<PAGE>
the applicable rate with respect to certain distributions or payments pursuant
to the Plan, unless the holder (a) comes within certain exempt categories (which
generally include corporations) and, when required, demonstrates this fact or
(b) provides a correct United States taxpayer identification number and
certifies under penalty of perjury that the holder is a U.S. person, the
taxpayer identification number is correct and that the holder is not subject to
backup withholding because of a failure to report all dividend and interest
income.

         Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules may be credited against a holder's United States
federal income tax liability, and a holder may obtain a refund of any excess
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing an appropriate
claim for refund with the IRS.

C. IMPORTANCE OF OBTAINING PROFESSIONAL TAX ASSISTANCE

         THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN
INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PLAN AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR CAREFUL TAX
PLANNING WITH A TAX PROFESSIONAL. THE ABOVE DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL
PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. THE TAX CONSEQUENCES ARE IN MANY CASES
UNCERTAIN AND MAY VARY DEPENDING ON A CLAIM HOLDER'S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
ACCORDINGLY, CLAIM HOLDERS ARE STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS
ABOUT THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND APPLICABLE FOREIGN INCOME AND
OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PLAN, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO TAX REPORTING AND
RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS.

                X. FEASIBILITY OF THE PLAN AND THE BEST INTERESTS TEST

A. FEASIBILITY OF THE PLAN

         To confirm the Plan, the Bankruptcy Court must find that confirmation
of the Plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation or the need for
further financial reorganization of the Debtors. This requirement is imposed by
Section 1129(a)(11) of the Bankruptcy Code and is referred to as the
"feasibility" requirement. The Debtors believe that they will be able to timely
perform all obligations described in the Plan, and, therefore, that the Plan is
feasible.

         To demonstrate the feasibility of the Plan, the Debtors have prepared
financial Projections for Fiscal Years 2003 through 2007, as set forth in
Appendix D attached to this Disclosure Statement. The Projections indicate that
the Reorganized Debtors should have sufficient cash flow to pay and service
their debt obligations and to fund their operations. Accordingly, the Debtors
believe that the Plan satisfies the feasibility requirement of Section
1129(a)(11) of the Bankruptcy Code. As noted in the Projections, however, the
Debtors caution that no representations can be made as to the accuracy of the
Projections or as to the Reorganized Debtors' ability to achieve the projected
results. Many of the assumptions upon which the Projections are based are
subject to uncertainties outside the control of the Debtors. Some assumptions
inevitably will not materialize, and events and circumstances occurring after
the date on which the Projections were prepared may be different from those
assumed or may be unanticipated, and may adversely affect the Debtors' financial
results. Therefore, the actual



                                      126
<PAGE>
results can be expected to vary from the projected results and the variations
may be material and adverse. See Section VIII, "Certain Factors to Be
Considered," for a discussion of certain risk factors that may affect financial
feasibility of the Plan.

         THE PROJECTIONS WERE NOT PREPARED WITH A VIEW TOWARD COMPLIANCE WITH
THE GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS, THE PRACTICES RECOGNIZED TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY
ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, OR THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGARDING PROJECTIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE PROJECTIONS HAVE
NOT BEEN AUDITED BY THE DEBTORS' INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS. ALTHOUGH PRESENTED
WITH NUMERICAL SPECIFICITY, THE PROJECTIONS ARE BASED UPON A VARIETY OF
ASSUMPTIONS, SOME OF WHICH IN THE PAST HAVE NOT BEEN ACHIEVED AND WHICH MAY NOT
BE REALIZED IN THE FUTURE, AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS, ECONOMIC AND
COMPETITIVE UNCERTAINTIES AND CONTINGENCIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE
CONTROL OF THE DEBTORS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE PROJECTIONS SHOULD NOT BE REGARDED AS
A REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY BY THE DEBTORS, OR ANY OTHER PERSON, THAT THE
PROJECTIONS WILL BE REALIZED. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY FROM THOSE
PRESENTED IN THE PROJECTIONS.

B. ACCEPTANCE OF THE PLAN

         As a condition to confirmation, the Bankruptcy Code requires that each
Class of Impaired Claims and Interests vote to accept the Plan, except under
certain circumstances. Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code defines acceptance
of a plan by a class of Impaired Claims as acceptance by holders of at least
two-thirds in dollar amount and more than one-half in number of Claims in that
Class, but for that purpose counts only those who actually vote to accept or to
reject the Plan. Thus, a Class of Claims will have voted to accept the Plan only
if two-thirds in amount and a majority in number actually voting cast their
Ballots in favor of acceptance. Under Section 1126(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, a
Class of Interests has accepted the Plan if holders of such Interests holding at
least two-thirds in amount actually voting have voted to accept the Plan.
Holders of Claims or Interests who fail to vote are not counted as either
accepting or rejecting the Plan.

C. BEST INTERESTS TEST

         Even if a plan is accepted by each class of holders of claims and
interests, the Bankruptcy Code requires a bankruptcy court to determine that the
plan is in the "best interests" of all holders of claims and interests that are
impaired by the plan and that have not accepted the plan. The "best interests"
test, as set forth in Section 1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code, requires a
bankruptcy court to find either that (i) all members of an impaired class of
claims or interests have accepted the plan or (ii) the plan will provide a
member who has not accepted the plan with a recovery of property of a value, as
of the effective date of the plan, that is not less than the amount that such
holder would recover if the debtor were liquidated under Chapter 7 of the
Bankruptcy Code.





                                      127
<PAGE>
         To calculate the probable distribution to members of each impaired
class of holders of claims and interests if the debtor were liquidated under
Chapter 7, a bankruptcy court must first determine the aggregate dollar amount
that would be generated from the debtor's assets if its Chapter 11 case were
converted to a Chapter 7 case under the Bankruptcy Code. This "liquidation
value" would consist primarily of the proceeds from a forced sale of the
debtor's assets by a Chapter 7 trustee.

         The amount of liquidation value available to unsecured creditors would
be reduced by, first, the claims of secured creditors to the extent of the value
of their collateral, and, second, by the costs and expenses of liquidation, as
well as by other administrative expenses and costs of both the Chapter 7 case
and the Chapter 11 case. Costs of liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy
Code would include the compensation of a trustee, as well as of counsel and
other professionals retained by the trustee, asset disposition expenses, all
unpaid expenses incurred by the debtor in its bankruptcy case (such as
compensation of attorneys, financial advisors, and restructuring consultants)
that are allowed in the Chapter 7 case, litigation costs, and claims arising
from the operations of the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case.
The liquidation itself would trigger certain priority payments that otherwise
would be due in the ordinary course of business. Those priority claims would be
paid in full from the liquidation proceeds before the balance would be made
available to pay general unsecured claims or to make any distribution in respect
of equity interests. The liquidation also would prompt the rejection of a large
number of executory contracts and unexpired leases and thereby create a
significantly higher number of unsecured claims.

         Once the court ascertains the recoveries in liquidation of secured
creditors and priority claimants, it must determine the probable distribution to
general unsecured creditors and equity security holders from the remaining
available proceeds in liquidation. If such probable distribution has a value
greater than the distributions to be received by such creditors and equity
security holders under a debtor's plan, then such plan is not in the best
interests of creditors and equity security holders.

D. ESTIMATED VALUATION OF THE REORGANIZED DEBTORS

         A copy of the reorganization valuation analysis is attached to this
Disclosure Statement as Appendix D.

E. APPLICATION OF THE BEST INTERESTS TEST TO THE LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS AND
   THE VALUATION OF THE REORGANIZED DEBTORS

         1. Overview

         A liquidation analysis prepared with respect to the Debtors is attached
as Appendix B to this Disclosure Statement. The Debtors believe that any
liquidation analysis is speculative. For example, the liquidation analysis
necessarily contains an estimate of the amount of Claims which will ultimately
become Allowed Claims. In preparing the liquidation analysis, the Debtors have
projected the amount of Allowed Claims based upon a review of their scheduled
and filed proofs of claim. No order or finding has been entered by the
Bankruptcy Court estimating or otherwise fixing the amount of Claims at the
projected amounts of Allowed Claims set forth in the liquidation analysis. In
preparing the liquidation analysis, the Debtors





                                      128
<PAGE>
have projected a range for the amount of Allowed Claims with the low end of the
range the lowest reasonable amount of Claims and the high end of the range the
highest reasonable amount of the Claims, thus allowing assessment of the most
likely range of Chapter 7 liquidation dividends to the holder of the Allowed
Claims. The estimate of the amount of Allowed Claims set forth in the
liquidation analysis should not be relied on for any other purpose, including,
without limitation, any determination of the value of any distribution to be
made on account of Allowed Claims and Interests under the Plan. In addition, as
noted above, the valuation analysis of the Reorganized Debtors also contains
numerous estimates and assumptions. For example, the value of the New Holding
Company Common Stock cannot be determined with precision due to the absence of a
public market for the New Holding Company Common Stock.

         Notwithstanding the difficulties in quantifying recoveries to creditors
with precision, the Debtors believe that, taking into account the liquidation
analysis and the valuation analysis of the Reorganized Debtors, the Plan meets
the "best interests" test of Section 1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code. The
Debtors believe that the members of each Impaired Class will receive at least as
much under the Plan than they would in a liquidation in a hypothetical chapter 7
case. Creditors and Interestholders will receive a better recovery through the
distributions contemplated by the Plan because the continued operation of the
Debtors as going concerns rather than a forced liquidation will allow the
realization of more value for the Debtors' assets. Moreover, creditors such as
the Debtors' employees would retain their jobs and most likely make few if any
other claims against the estate. Lastly, in the event of liquidation, the
aggregate amount of unsecured claims will no doubt increase significantly (as
reflected in the high range estimate), and such claims will be subordinated to
priority claims that will be created. For example, employees will file claims
for wages, pensions and other benefits, some of which will be entitled to
priority. Landlords will no doubt file large claims for both unsecured and
priority amounts. The resulting increase in both general unsecured and priority
claims will no doubt decrease percentage recoveries to unsecured creditors of
the Debtors. All of these factors lead to the conclusion that recoveries under
the Plan would be at least as much, and in many cases significantly greater,
than the recoveries available in a Chapter 7 liquidation.

         2. Comparison of Liquidation Analysis and Valuation Analysis.

         The liquidation analysis attached hereto as Appendix B contains two
separate analyses: (i) a consolidated analysis and (ii) a de-consolidated
analysis. The consolidated analysis assumes that the Debtors are substantively
consolidated and that creditors share in the proceeds of all of the Debtors'
assets without regard to (a) the separate legal identity of each Debtor and (b)
which Debtors are obligated on particular claims. The de-consolidated analysis
assumes that the Debtors are liquidated through two entities. One of the
de-consolidated entities is the entity containing claims on account of the
Subsidiary GuarantIes (the "Guarantee Entity"). As discussed above, the
Prepetition Lenders and the PBGC are the primary creditors of each of the Kmart
of [] Subsidiaries. The Prepetition Lenders' claims arise out of the guarantees
of Kmart's indebtedness to the Prepetition Lenders executed by the Kmart of []
Subsidiaries, and the PBGC's claims arise out of joint and several liability of
each of the Debtors to the PBGC under applicable non-bankruptcy law. The Kmart
of [] Subsidiaries do not have any other material unsecured debt. The Guarantee
Entity contains the five Kmart of [] Subsidiaries as well as Bluelight.com LLC.
The second de-consolidated entity is the entity containing all Debtors that are
not obligated on the Guaranties.






                                      129
<PAGE>
         In a de-consolidated liquidation, the Prepetition Lenders and the PBGC
would be entitled to be paid in full from the proceeds of asset liquidations of
the Kmart of Subsidiaries before creditors of any of the other Debtors would be
entitled to any such proceeds. In a consolidated liquidation, however, the
Prepetition Lenders and the PBGC's separate claims against the Kmart of
Subsidiaries would be deemed a single claim against the consolidated Debtors'
assets and would share in distributions with all other unsecured creditors of
each of the other Debtors. As a consequence, the estimated recovery of the
Prepetition Lenders and the PBGC, based on the assumptions contained in the
attached liquidation analysis, is higher in the de-consolidated scenario - 13%
to 24% - and lower in the consolidated scenario - 3% to 6%. Correspondingly, the
recoveries of other unsecured creditors based on such assumptions is lower in
the de- consolidated scenario - 1% to 3% - and higher in the consolidated
scenario 3% to 5%.

         As explained above, any litigation concerning the substantive
consolidation of the Debtors would be exceptionally complicated and protracted,
and given the magnitude of the values involved and the amount of claims at
stake, would be hotly contested and expensive. Such litigation would in turn
substantially prolong these Chapter 11 Cases, which most constituencies believe
is not in the best interests of the estates or Kmart's long-term prospects for
rehabilitation. The outcome of any such litigation is not free from doubt. For
these reasons, the Debtors, the Prepetition Lenders, the Creditors' Committee,
and the Financial Institutions' Committee believe that the settlement
contemplated by the Plan is in the best interests of the estate and should be
approved.

           More importantly, regardless of the outcome of any substantive
consolidation litigation, the valuation analysis attached hereto as Appendix E
leads to the conclusion that recoveries under the Plan would be at least as
much, and in many cases significantly greater, than the recoveries available in
a Chapter 7 liquidation, whether such liquidation were conducted on a
consolidated or de-consolidated basis.

F. CONFIRMATION WITHOUT ACCEPTANCE OF ALL IMPAIRED CLASSES: THE 'CRAMDOWN'
   ALTERNATIVE

         Section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a plan can be
confirmed even if it has not been accepted by all impaired classes as long as at
least one impaired class of Claims has accepted it. The Court may confirm the
Plan at the request of the Debtors notwithstanding the Plan's rejection (or
deemed rejection) by impaired Classes as long as the Plan "does not discriminate
unfairly" and is "fair and equitable" as to each impaired Class that has not
accepted it. A plan does not discriminate unfairly within the meaning of the
Bankruptcy Code if a dissenting class is treated equally with respect to other
classes of equal rank.

         A plan is fair and equitable as to a class of secured claims that
rejects such plan if the plan provides (1)(a) that the holders of claims
included in the rejecting class retain the liens securing those claims, whether
the property subject to those liens is retained by the debtor or transferred to
another entity, to the extent of the allowed amount of such claims, and (b) that
each holder of a claim of such class receives on account of that claim deferred
cash payments totalling at least the allowed amount of that claim, of a value,
as of the effective date of the plan, of at least the value of the holder's
interest in the estate's interest in such property; (2) for the sale, subject to
Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code, of any property that is subject to the





                                      130
<PAGE>
liens securing the claims included in the rejecting class, free and clear of the
liens, with the liens to attach to the proceeds of the sale, and the treatment
of the liens on proceeds under clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph; or (3) for
the realization by such holders of the indubitable equivalent of such claims.

         A plan is fair and equitable as to a class of unsecured claims which
rejects a plan if the plan provides (1) for each holder of a claim included in
the rejecting class to receive or retain on account of that claim property that
has a value, as of the effective date of the plan, equal to the allowed amount
of such claim; or (2) that the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to
the claims of such rejecting class will not receive or retain on account of such
junior claim or interest any property at all.

         A plan is fair and equitable as to a class of equity interests that
rejects a plan if the plan provides (1) that each holder of an interest included
in the rejecting class receive or retain on account of that interest property
that has a value, as of the effective date of the plan, equal to the greatest of
the allowed amount of any fixed liquidation preference to which such holder is
entitled, any fixed redemption price to which such holder is entitled, or the
value of such interest; or (2) that the holder of any interest that is junior to
the interest of such rejecting class will not receive or retain under the plan
on account of such junior interest any property at all. The votes of holders of
Subordinated Securities Claims and Interests in Kmart are not being solicited.
They are therefore deemed to have rejected the Plan pursuant to Section 1126(g)
of the Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, the Debtors are seeking confirmation of the
Plan pursuant to Section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to such
Classes, and may seek confirmation pursuant thereto as to other Classes if such
Classes vote to reject the Plan.

G. CONDITIONS TO CONFIRMATION AND CONSUMMATION OF THE PLAN

part, by the Debtors, after consultation with the Plan Investors and the
Creditor's Committees, without any notice to any other parties in interest or
the Bankruptcy Court and without a hearing. The failure to satisfy or waive any
condition to the Confirmation Date or the Effective Date may be asserted by the
Debtors in their sole discretion regardless of the circumstances giving rise to
the failure of such condition to be satisfied (including any action or inaction
by the Debtors in their sole discretion). The failure of the Debtors in their
sole discretion to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any other rights, and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing
right, which may be asserted at any time.

I. RETENTION OF JURISDICTION

         Pursuant to Sections 105(a) and 1142 of the Bankruptcy Code, the
Bankruptcy Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all matters arising out
of, and related to, the Chapter 11 Cases and the Plan, including, among others,
the following matters:

                           (i) to hear and determine pending motions for the
assumption or rejection of executory contracts or unexpired leases or the
assumption and assignment, as the case may be, of executory contracts or
unexpired leases to which any of the Debtors are a party or with respect to
which any of the Debtors may be liable, and to hear and determine the allowance
of Claims resulting therefrom including the amount of Cure, if any, required to
be paid;





                                      132
<PAGE>



                           (ii) to adjudicate any and all adversary proceedings,

implementation, or consummation of the Plan;

                           (viii) to consider any modifications of the Plan, to

the Bankruptcy Court, including, without limitation, the Confirmation Order;

                           (ix) to hear and determine all applications for
allowance of compensation and reimbursement of Professional Claims under the
Plan or under Sections 330, 331, 503(b), 1103, and 1129(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy
Code;

the Bankruptcy Court.

         Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
Bankruptcy Court retains exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine disputes
concerning Retained Actions and Trust Claims and any motions to compromise or
settle such disputes. Despite the foregoing, if the Bankruptcy Court is
determined not to have jurisdiction with respect to the foregoing, or if
Reorganized Kmart or the Kmart Creditor Trust chooses to pursue any Retained
Action or Trust Claim (as applicable) in another court of competent
jurisdiction, Reorganized Kmart or the Kmart Creditor Trust (as applicable) will
have authority to bring such action in any other court of competent
jurisdiction.

                      XI. ALTERNATIVES TO CONFIRMATION AND
                            CONSUMMATION OF THE PLAN


         The Debtors believe that the Plan affords holders of Claims and
Interests the potential for the greatest realization on the Debtors' assets and,
therefore, is in the best interests of such holders. If the Plan is not
confirmed, however, the theoretical alternatives include: (a) continuation of
the pending Chapter 11 Cases; (b) an alternative plan or plans of
reorganization; or (c) liquidation of the Debtors under chapter 7 or chapter 11
of the Bankruptcy Code.

A. CONTINUATION OF THE BANKRUPTCY CASE

         If the Debtors remain in Chapter 11, they could continue to operate
their businesses and manage their properties as debtors-in-possession, but they
would remain subject to the restrictions imposed by the Bankruptcy Code. It is
not clear whether the Debtors could survive as a going concern in protracted
Chapter 11 Cases. In particular, the Debtors could have difficulty sustaining
the high costs and the erosion of market confidence which may be caused if the
Debtors remain Chapter 11 debtors-in-possession. And as further discussed in
Section VII.I., "Development and Summary of Business Plan," the Debtors believe
that they have accomplished the goals that Chapter 11 has allowed them to
achieve, and that Kmart's key remaining challenges are operational and therefore
do not require that the company remain in Chapter 11.

B. ALTERNATIVE PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

         If the Plan is not confirmed, the Debtors, or, after the expiration of
the Debtors' exclusive period in which to propose and solicit a reorganization
plan, any other party in interest in the Chapter 11 Cases, could propose a
different plan or plans. Such plans might involve either a reorganization and
continuation of the Debtors' businesses, or an orderly liquidation of their
assets, or a combination of both.

C. LIQUIDATION UNDER CHAPTER 7 OR CHAPTER 11


         If no plan is confirmed, the Debtors' Chapter 11 Cases may be converted
to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In a Chapter 7 case, a trustee
or trustees would be appointed to liquidate the assets of the Debtors. It is
impossible to predict precisely how the proceeds of the liquidation would be
distributed to the respective holders of Claims against or Interests in the
Debtors.

         However, the Debtors believe that creditors would lose substantially
higher going concern value if the Debtors were forced to liquidate. In addition,
the Debtors believe that in liquidation under Chapter 7, before creditors
received any distribution, additional administrative expenses involved in the
appointment of a trustee or trustees and attorneys, accountants and other
professionals to assist such trustees would cause a substantial diminution in
the value of the Estates. The assets available for distribution to creditors
would be reduced by such additional expenses and by Claims, some of which would
be entitled to priority, which would arise by reason of the liquidation and from
the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with the
cessation of operations and the failure to realize the greater going concern
value of the Debtors' assets.

         The Debtors may also be liquidated pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan. In a
liquidation under Chapter 11, the Debtors' assets could be sold in an orderly
fashion over a more extended period of time than in a liquidation under Chapter
7. Thus, a Chapter 11 liquidation might result in larger recoveries than a
Chapter 7 liquidation, but the delay in distributions could result in lower
present values received and higher administrative costs. Because a trustee is
not required in a Chapter 11 case, expenses for professional fees could be lower
than in a Chapter 7 case, in which a trustee must be appointed. However, any
distribution to the Claimholders and Interestholders under a Chapter 11
liquidation plan probably would be delayed substantially.

         The Debtors' liquidation analysis, prepared with their restructuring
advisors, is premised upon a hypothetical liquidation in a Chapter 7 case and is
attached as Appendix B to this Disclosure Statement. In the analysis, the
Debtors have taken into account the nature, status, and underlying value of
their assets, the ultimate realizable value of their assets, and the extent to
which such assets are subject to liens and security interests. The likely form
of any liquidation would be the sale of individual assets. Based on this
analysis, it is likely that a Chapter 7 liquidation of the Debtors' assets would
produce less value for distribution to creditors than that recoverable in each
instance under the Plan. In the opinion of the Debtors, the recoveries projected
to be available in a Chapter 7 liquidation are not likely to afford holders of
Claims and holders of Interests as great a realization potential as does the
Plan.

                            XII. VOTING REQUIREMENTS

         On January __, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court approved an order (the
"Solicitation Procedures Order"), among other things, approving this Disclosure
Statement, setting voting procedures, and scheduling the hearing on confirmation
of the Plan. A copy of the Confirmation Hearing Notice is enclosed with this
Disclosure Statement. The Confirmation Hearing Notice sets forth in detail,
among other things, the voting deadlines and objection deadlines with respect to
the Plan. The Confirmation Hearing Notice and the instructions attached to the
Ballot should be read in connection with this section of this Disclosure
Statement.

         If you have any questions about (i) the procedure for voting your Claim
with respect to the packet of materials that you have received, (ii) the amount
of your Claim or your Interest holdings, or (iii) if you wish to obtain, at your
own expense, unless otherwise specifically required by Federal Rule of
Bankruptcy Procedure 3017(d), an additional copy of the Plan, this Disclosure
Statement, or any exhibits to such documents, please contact:

                          Trumbull Bankruptcy Services
                                  P.O. Box 426
                           Windsor, Connecticut 06095
                          Attn: Kmart Balloting Center

         The Bankruptcy Court may confirm the Plan only if it determines that
the Plan complies with the technical requirements of Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code and that the disclosures by the Debtors concerning the Plan have
been adequate and have included information concerning all payments made or
promised by the Debtors in connection with the Plan and the Chapter 11 Cases. In
addition, the Bankruptcy Court must determine that the Plan has been proposed in
good faith and not by any means forbidden by law, and under Federal Rule of
Bankruptcy Procedure 3020(b)(2), it may do so without receiving evidence if no
objection is timely filed.

         In particular, and as described in more detail above, the Bankruptcy
Code requires the Bankruptcy Court to find, among other things, that (a) the
Plan has been accepted by the requisite votes of all Classes of impaired Claims
and Interests unless approval will be sought under Section 1129(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code in spite of the nonacceptance by one or more such Classes, (b)
the Plan is "feasible," which means that there is a reasonable probability that
the Debtors will be able to perform their obligations under the Plan and
continue to operate their businesses without further financial reorganization or
liquidation, and (c) the Plan is in the "best interests" of all Claimholders and
Interestholders, which means that such holders will receive at least as much
under the Plan as they would receive in a liquidation under chapter 7 of the
Bankruptcy Code.

         THE BANKRUPTCY COURT MUST FIND THAT ALL CONDITIONS MENTIONED ABOVE ARE
MET BEFORE IT CAN CONFIRM THE PLAN. THUS, EVEN IF ALL THE CLASSES OF IMPAIRED
CLAIMS AND INTERESTS AGAINST THE DEBTORS WERE TO ACCEPT THE PLAN BY THE
REQUISITE VOTES, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT MUST STILL MAKE AN INDEPENDENT FINDING
THAT THE PLAN SATISFIES THESE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE, THAT THE PLAN
IS FEASIBLE, AND THAT THE PLAN IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE HOLDERS OF CLAIMS
AGAINST AND INTERESTS IN THE DEBTORS.

         UNLESS THE BALLOT BEING FURNISHED IS TIMELY SUBMITTED TO THE VOTING
AGENT ON OR PRIOR TO APRIL __, 2003 AT __:__ P.M. (PREVAILING CENTRAL TIME)
TOGETHER WITH ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS REQUIRED BY SUCH BALLOT, THE DEBTORS MAY, IN
THEIR SOLE DISCRETION, REJECT SUCH BALLOT AS INVALID AND, THEREFORE, DECLINE TO
COUNT IT AS AN ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF THE PLAN. IN NO CASE SHOULD A BALLOT
OR ANY OF THE CERTIFICATES BE DELIVERED TO THE DEBTORS OR ANY OF THEIR ADVISORS.





                                      136
<PAGE>
A. PARTIES IN INTEREST ENTITLED TO VOTE

         Under Section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code, a class of claims or
interests is deemed to be "impaired" under a plan unless (a) the plan leaves
unaltered the legal, equitable, and contractual rights to which such claim or
interest entitles the holder thereof or (b) notwithstanding any legal right to
an accelerated payment of such claim or interest, the plan cures all existing
defaults (other than defaults resulting from the occurrence of events of
bankruptcy) and reinstates the maturity of such claim or interest as it existed
before the default.

         In general, a holder of a claim or interest may vote to accept or to
reject a plan if (1) the claim or interest is "allowed," which means generally
that no party in interest has objected to such claim or interest, and (2) the
claim or interest is impaired by the Plan. If the holder of an impaired claim or
impaired interest will not receive any distribution under the plan in respect of
such claim or interest, the Bankruptcy Code deems such holder to have rejected
the plan. If the claim or interest is not impaired, the Bankruptcy Code deems
that the holder of such claim or interest has accepted the plan and the plan
proponent need not solicit such holder's vote.

         The holder of a Claim that is Impaired under the Plan is entitled to
vote to accept or reject the Plan if (1) the Plan provides a distribution in
respect of such Claim and (2) (a) the Claim has been scheduled by the respective
Debtor (and such Claim is not scheduled as disputed, contingent, or
unliquidated), (b) such Claimholder has timely filed a Proof of Claim as to
which no objection has been filed, or (c) such Claimholder has timely filed a
motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 3018(a) seeking
temporary allowance of such Claim for voting purposes only and the Debtor has
not opposed the Motion or objected to the Claim, in which case the holder's vote
will be counted only upon order of the Court.

         A vote may be disregarded if the Court determines, pursuant to Section
1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, that it was not solicited or procured in good
faith or in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The
Solicitation Procedures Order also sets forth assumptions and procedures for
tabulating Ballots, including Ballots that are not completed fully or correctly.

B. CLASSES IMPAIRED UNDER THE PLAN

         1. Voting Impaired Classes of Claims and Interests.

         The following Classes are Impaired under, and are entitled to vote to
accept or reject, the Plan: Class 4 (Prepetition Lender Claims), Class 5
(Prepetition Note Claims), Class 6 (Trade Vendor/Lease Rejection Claims), Class
7 (Other Unsecured Claims), Class 8 (General Unsecured Convenience Claims),
Class 9 (Trust Preferred Obligations), Class 11 (Subordinated Securities
Claims), and Class 12 (Interests).

         2. Unimpaired Classes of Claims.

         All other Classes are either Unimpaired under the Plan and deemed under
Section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code to have accepted the Plan. Their votes to
accept or reject the Plan will not be solicited. Acceptances of the Plan are
being solicited only from those who hold Claims in an Impaired Class whose
members will receive a distribution under the Plan.





                                      137
<PAGE>
         3. Presumed Acceptance by Certain Classes of Interests.

         Holders of Interests in the Affiliated Debtors are conclusively
presumed to have accepted the Plan as such Interestholders are proponents of the
Plan and, as such, the votes of such Interestholders will not be solicited.

                                XIII. CONCLUSION

A. HEARING ON AND OBJECTIONS TO CONFIRMATION

         1. Confirmation Hearing.

         The hearing on confirmation of the Plan has been scheduled for April
__, 2003 at __ a.m. (prevailing Central time). Such hearing may be adjourned
from time to time by announcing such adjournment in open court, all without
further notice to parties in interest, and the Plan may be modified by the
Debtors pursuant to Section 1127 of the Bankruptcy Code prior to, during, or as
a result of that hearing, without further notice to parties in interest.

         2. Date Set for Filing Objections to Confirmation of the Plan.

         The time by which all objections to confirmation of the Plan must be
filed with the Court and received by the parties listed in the Confirmation
Hearing Notice has been set for __________________, 2003, at ______ p.m.
(prevailing Central time). A copy of the Confirmation Hearing Notice is enclosed
with this Disclosure Statement.

B. RECOMMENDATION

         The Plan provides for an equitable and early distribution to creditors
of the Debtors, preserves the value of the business as a going concern, and
preserves the jobs of employees. The Debtors believe that any alternative to
confirmation of the Plan, such as liquidation or attempts by another party in
interest to file a plan, could result in significant delays, litigation, and
costs, as well as the loss of jobs by the employees. Moreover, the Debtors
believe that their creditors will receive greater and earlier recoveries under
the Plan than those that would be achieved in liquidation or under an
alternative plan. FOR THESE REASONS, THE DEBTORS URGE YOU TO RETURN YOUR BALLOT
ACCEPTING THE PLAN.

                              LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS

A Chapter 11 plan cannot be confirmed unless it is in the 'best interests' of
all holders of claims and interests that are impaired by the plan and that have
not accepted the plan. The 'best interests' test is satisfied if a plan provides
to each member who has not accepted the plan with a recovery of property of a
value, as of the effective date of the plan, that is not less than the amount
that such holder would recover if the debtor were liquidated under Chapter 7 of
the Bankruptcy Code.

Conversion to Chapter 7 would likely result in additional costs to the Estates.
Costs of liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code would include the
compensation of a trustee, as well as of counsel and other professionals
retained by the trustee, asset dispositions expenses, all unpaid expenses
incurred by the debtor in its bankruptcy case (such as compensation of
attorneys, financial advisors, and restructuring consultants) that are allowed
in the Chapter 7 case, litigation costs, and claims arising from the operations
of the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case.

The bankruptcy cases would likely be treated as separate bankruptcy estates
under a Chapter 7 liquidation and this `deconsolidation' would affect
recoveries. For example, the PBGC has the joint and several obligation of each
of the 38 estates. The PBGC claim against subsidiaries comes before the
interests of the holding company in the subsidiary and therefore before claims
that exist only against the holding company. In order to estimate the effect of
deconsolidation on the `best interests' test, we have looked at the hypothetical
recovery of certain affiliates and assigned premiums or discounts to creditor
recoveries based on these joint and several claims or subsidiary guarantees
where they exist.

The following is a summary of the estimated recoveries for claimants in a
hypothetical liquidation commencing April 30, 2003 under Chapter 7 of the
Bankruptcy Code.

                              LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS

Attached is the Best Interests Analysis (the "Analysis") of Kmart Corporation
and its 37 subsidiaries in bankruptcy proceedings (collectively "Kmart", the
"Company" or the "Debtors"). The Analysis was prepared as if the Debtors were
substantively consolidated. Although the Analysis was prepared after the
deadline for filing claims against the estates of the Debtors, those claims have
not been fully evaluated by the Company or adjudicated by the court and,
accordingly, the amount of the final allowed claims against the estates may
differ from the claim amounts used in this Analysis. Finally, the Analysis is
based on the Company's projected balance sheet as of April 30, 2003, (except as
indicated) and the actual amount of assets available to the estates as of the
date of liquidation may differ from the amount of assets used in this Analysis.

Management of the Company, with the assistance of AlixPartners, LLC, prepared
the Analysis. The Analysis presents management's estimated net value of the
Company's assets if the Debtors were to be liquidated under the provisions of
Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Code") and the net proceeds
of the liquidation were to be applied in strict priority to satisfy claims
against the Debtors.

The purpose of the Analysis is to provide information in order that the
Bankruptcy Court may determine that the Plan of Reorganization ("POR") is in the
best interests of all classes of creditors and equity interest holders impaired
by the plan. The "best interests" test requires that the Bankruptcy Court find
that the Plan provides to each member of each impaired class of claims and
interests a recovery that has a value at least equal to the value of the
distribution each member would receive if the Debtors were liquidated under
Chapter 7 of the Code. The Analysis was prepared to assist the Bankruptcy Court
in making this determination, and it should not be used for any other purpose.
The presentation utilized in this Analysis is not designed for those who are not
informed about such matters.

The Analysis is limited to presenting information that was the representation of
management and does not include an evaluation of the support for the underlying
assumptions. The Analysis has not been examined or reviewed by independent
accountants in accordance with standards promulgated by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. The estimates and assumptions, although
considered reasonable by management, are inherently subject to significant
uncertainties and contingencies beyond the control of management. Accordingly,
there can be no assurance that the results shown would be realized if the
Company were liquidated and actual results in such case could vary materially
from those presented. If actual results were lower than those shown, or if the
assumptions used in formulating the Analysis were not realized, distribution to
each member of each class of claims could be adversely affected.

Note 7, contained herein, describes the assumptions management has made
regarding recoveries arising from the exercise of avoiding powers under the Code
in this Analysis.

NOTES:
--------------

(a) Of the projected $159 million in Stand-by Letters of Credit, approximately
    $121 million is estimated to insure against Workers Compensation claims.
    Post petition obligation of Workers Compensation is estimated at $20
    million. It is further assumed that the balance of the Stand-by Letters of
    Credit will be drawn in satisfaction of pre-petition Workers Compensation
    claims. See note on Workers Compensation Claims at IV. General Unsecured
    Claims.

(b) Analysis assumes Trade Letters of Credit are issued to foreign vendors
    and that all goods are shipped under Letters of Credit and paid in the
    ordinary course of business (See Note 3 - Inventory).

(c) Accounts Payable - Trade is projected accounts payable at 4/30/03 increased
    for estimated inventories secured by Trade Letters of Credit outstanding as
    of the projected filing date grossed-up for estimated freight and insurance
    costs. Additionally, Accounts Payable has been adjusted to reflect amounts
    paid under the Vendor 2nd Lien program.

(d) Accrued Expenses is projected accrued expense at 4/30/03 reduced for
    payment of estimated professional fees of approximately $37.3 million.

(e) Priority Claims are priority tax claims with the estimated recovery range
    being set as a range around the value of claims filed.

NOTES:
---------------

(a) An actuarial analysis performed by the Company indicates that ultimate
    value of the PBGC claim is likely to range from $785 million to $926
    million. However, a high end of $1,086 million is used to reflect the actual
    claim amount filed by the PBGC. In a liquidation, the final claim of the
    PBGC could be higher than the $1,086 million filed as a proof of claim.

(b) Prepetition Workers Compensation claims are estimated at $180 million to
    $316 million. It is assumed that once administrative claims for Workers
    Compensation are paid approximately $101 million of Stand-by Letters of
    Credit issued post-petition will be used to pay pre-petition claims and
    reduce the general unsecured liability to approximately $79 million and
    $215 million, respectively.

(c) PV of Potential Claims from Contingent Liabilities represents the present
    value of only those potential liabilities that can be calculated at this
    time. The Company has disclosed that there exist additional contingent
    liabilities under real estate leases assigned by the Company pre-petition.
    While the Company has not yet been able to calculate the present value of
    such additional liability, management believes that the additional amount of
    such contingent liability may be significant.

(d) Low case estimate based on one year's non-real estate executory contracts
    payments of approximately $960 million. High case estimate based on
    management's best estimate of the maximum potential allowable claims and
    potential damages awarded beyond statutory amounts.

V.  NOTES

NOTE 1  OVERVIEW AND LIQUIDATION PERIOD

This Best Interests Analysis was prepared as if the Debtors were substantively
consolidated. Although the Analysis was prepared after the deadline for filing
claims against the estates of the Debtors, those claims have not been fully
evaluated by the Company or adjudicated by the court and, accordingly, the
amount of the final allowed claims against the estates may differ from the claim
amounts used in this Analysis. Finally, the Analysis is based on the Company's
projected balance sheet as of April 30, 2003, (except as indicated) and the
actual amount of assets available to the estates as of the date of liquidation
may differ from the amount of assets used in this Analysis.

Management of the Company, with the assistance of AlixPartners, LLC, prepared
the Analysis. The Analysis presents management's estimated net value of the
Company's assets if the Debtors were to be liquidated under the provisions of
Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Code") and the net proceeds
of the liquidation were to be applied in strict priority to satisfy claims
against the debtors.

The Analysis is limited to presenting information that was the representation of
management and does not include an evaluation of the support for the underlying
assumptions. The Analysis has not been examined or reviewed by independent
accountants in accordance with standards promulgated by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. The estimates and assumptions, although
considered reasonable by management, are inherently subject to significant
uncertainties and contingencies beyond the control of management. Accordingly,
there can be no assurance that the results shown would be realized if the
Company were liquidated and actual results in such case could vary materially
from those presented. If actual results were lower than those shown, or if the
assumptions used in formulating the Analysis were not realized, distribution to
each member of each class of claims could be adversely affected.

For purposes of this Analysis, management assumes a liquidation would require
three phases and would take place over 18 months. Phase I would comprise a
three-month period during which inventories would be sold in a
going-out-of-business sale ("GOB Sale") conducted by a third-party. By the end
of the GOB Sale substantially all store, distribution center and field
associates would be terminated. During Phase I, certain headquarters associates
would be terminated including, for instance, staff of merchandising, merchandise
finance, advertising, stores organization, loss prevention, maintenance,
accounts payable, training, communications and purchasing.

Phase II would comprise the next six month period (and would actually have
started during Phase I). During Phase II, the Company's real estate and most of
the Company's non-real estate fixed assets would be marketed. In addition,
headquarters operations would continue to wind-down and most remaining
headquarters associates would be terminated. Certain headquarters personnel,
such as staff in legal, finance & accounting and information technology would be
retained as necessary to support Phase III. Phase III would comprise a nine
month period after completion of the real estate marketing efforts during which
any remaining litigation would be pursued, final tax returns filed, bankruptcy
court reports and schedules filed and remaining assets disposed.

While the Analysis assumes an 18 month liquidation time frame, final resolution
of all preference actions is expected to extend 12 months beyond the 18 month
liquidation time frame. All professional fees associated with resolution of such
matters are contemplated in the estimated net recoveries from preference
actions.

NOTE 2  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Accounts receivable comprises a variety of accounts, the most sizeable being
Pharmacy Receivables, Store Receivables and Merchandise Allowance Receivables.

Pharmacy Receivables are receivables from third-party insurance companies in
connection with the filling of prescriptions. All accounts aged past 60 days are
fully reserved. Historical experience indicates that the Company's reserve
policy has been sufficient in estimating losses incurred with this account.

Store Receivables are a combination of layaway receivables and credit extended
at the store level by store management to customers. For purposes of the
Analysis, the account is assumed to be primarily comprised of credit extended to
customers and would be, in all likelihood, uncollectable.

Merchandise Allowance Receivables are allowances generated in connection with
food products purchased through Fleming.

Other Receivables are comprised of a number of miscellaneous accounts such as
rent due from subtenants and former subsidiaries, amounts due from landlords for
repairs and maintenance and amounts due from bad checks, etc. and have varying
degrees of estimated collectability.

                                   ($ in 000s)


NOTE 3  INVENTORIES

Merchandise inventories are assumed to be disposed of through a lawful
"going-out-of-business sale" commencing May 1, 2003 with no restrictions on the
Company's ability to aggressively advertise the sale as a "going-out-of-business
sale" ("GOB Sale"). The GOB Sale assumptions reflect the Company's experience in
2002 when it closed 283 stores over a 10 week time period and are adjusted where
considered appropriate for the scale and timing of a mass liquidation, as well
as for the projected composition of Company inventory at the commencement of a
mass liquidation. The Low Recovery scenario assumes that the sale takes 13 weeks
and reflects a lowered net recovery resulting from deeper discounts and
increased direct expense. The High Recovery scenario assumes a 10 week sale
period and is more reflective of the results achieved in the 2002 store
closings. For purposes of the Analysis, GOB Sale Merchandise Inventory is the
sum of perpetual inventories, imports paid not received and merchandise letters
of credit outstanding under the Company's projections as of April 30, 2003.

NOTES:
---------------

(a) Projected Trade Letters of Credit at 4/30/03 ($216 million) are grossed-up
by 20% for insurance, freight and import fees and are assumed, for purposes
of this Analysis, to be issued to foreign vendors and that all goods secured by
Letters of Credit are shipped and paid in the normal course. Additionally, it is
assumed that all purchase orders for goods not secured by Trade Letters of
Credit would be cancelled as of the hypothetical filing date. While it may be
possible to cancel certain Trade Letters of Credit, it is assumed that any
potential cancellation would be offset by any goods on a non-secured purchase
order that are FOB. Accordingly, the estimated Trade Letter of Credit balance is
considered a reasonable estimate of the value of goods that would flow into a
GOB sale subsequent to the sale commencement date.

(b) Royalty Expense on Licensed Inventory is estimated using projected balances
of licensed inventories as of 4/30/03. Expense is calculated on those lines
where royalties are determined by sales. Royalty expense calculated on purchases
or receipts are assumed to have been booked prior to commencement of the GOB
Sale. Results of the 2002 GOB Sale were tracked only on a direct store expense
basis. Consequently, comparable information for royalty expense is not
available.

NOTE 4 PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS

Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets comprises a variety of accounts, the most
sizeable being Prepaid Advertising, Prepaid Sales Taxes and Debt Restructure
Costs.

Prepaid advertising is comprised of paper purchased in advance for advertising
circulars and passouts and electronic media purchases. For purposes of the
analysis, it is assumed that there is negligible recovery value in the paper and
that some portion of the purchased but unused media advertising may be
recovered.


Prepaid sales taxes are prepayments of estimated store related sales taxes that

NOTE 6 OTHER ASSETS & DEFERRED CHARGES

Other Assets & Deferred Charges comprises a variety of accounts, the most
sizeable being Investment - Meldisco, Bonuses Paid Upon Acquisition and Long
Term Property Held for Resale.

The Investment - Meldisco account holds the balance of the Company's investment

departments. In liquidation, this asset is assumed to have no value.

Bonuses Paid Upon Acquisition are brokerage fees related to store leases and not
recoverable.

Long-Term Property Held for Resale is non-Kmart retail properties and outlot
parcels that are for sale but not expected to be sold within the next twelve
months. Per discussions with the Company's real estate advisor, Rockwood Gemini
Advisors, appraised values have been reduced by 50% to reflect the liquidation
assumptions contemplated by this Analysis.


Other account balances are comprised of deposits and other deferred charges with
varying degrees of recovery values.

                                   ($ in 000s)


NOTE 7 RECOVERIES FROM AVOIDANCE ACTIONS

Debtors have identified certain pre-petition payments to third-parties and will
be seeking recovery of certain payments. It is likely in a Chapter 7 liquidation
that the trustee would seek to recover all such payments and they are listed in
the following table. The pre-petition payments listed below exclude vendor debit
balances, which are assumed to reside in Accounts Receivable. The schedule below
shows management's estimate of recoveries, net of recovery expenses, that would
be received after the beginning of Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings. It is
anticipated that such recoveries will take place over approximately 2.5 years.


The outcome of any particular preference action is subject to a number of
uncertainties. Moreover, the potential value of a preference action against a
particular preference defendant ultimately is dependent upon the specific
payment history and other facts and circumstances pertaining to that vendor and
its relationship with the Debtors. It is therefore difficult to extrapolate
generalized results for an entire class of preference claims from the individual
circumstances of each case. The Debtors have not undertaken an exhaustive
analysis of all potential preference claims in order to arrive at the estimates
contained herein. Rather, the analysis undertaken by the Debtors for purposes of
these estimates has been general in nature. The estimates contained herein
therefore may be materially different from actual results achieved.

NOTE 8 CORPORATE EXPENSES

It is assumed that the creditor recovery process occurs over an eighteen-month
period. For purposes of the Analysis, corporate expenses include both
headquarters and distribution center related expense. A nearly full complement
of corporate expenses is assumed to be required during the first three months,
with declining amounts of corporate expenses required in the following months.
It is assumed, further, that there will be an additional compensation program
designed to retain key employees during the liquidation period.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS

The financial projections included in this Disclosure Statement (the
"Projections") are dependent on successful implementation of the business plans
of Kmart Corporation and its subsidiaries ("Kmart" or the "Company") and the
validity of the assumptions contained therein. These Projections reflect
numerous assumptions, including confirmation and consummation of the plan of
reorganization for Kmart as filed with the Bankruptcy Court.

The independent Accountants for Kmart have neither examined nor compiled the
Projections and accordingly, assume no responsibility for them. Moreover, the
Projections have not been prepared to comply with the guidelines established
with respect to Projections by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

Fresh Start Accounting and Enterprise Value:

The Projections assume that Kmart will emerge from Chapter 11 on April 30, 2003,
and as required, adopt the provisions of Fresh Start Accounting prior thereto.
These principles are contained in the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position 90-7, "Financial Reporting by Entities in
Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code," ("SOP 90-7"). Adoption of Fresh Start
Accounting requires that assets and liabilities be stated at their
reorganization value, which approximates fair value at the date of emergence
from Chapter 11. The Fresh Start Accounting adjustments are based upon the
enterprise valuation analysis completed by DrKW/MBL (Refer to Exhibit E). In
applying Fresh Start Accounting, significant adjustments are expected to be
recorded to write-down our long-lived assets, including intangibles. Adjustments
to reflect the fair value of assets and liabilities, on a net basis, result in
an excess of fair value of net assets over reorganization value ("negative
goodwill") of approximately $4.4 billion. This negative goodwill will be
allocated on a pro rata basis and serve to reduce the basis of our non-current
assets. The remaining negative goodwill of $0.4 billion will be recorded in the
income statement as an extraordinary gain. The restructuring of Kmart's capital
structure and resulting discharge of pre-petition debt will result in an
extraordinary gain of $5.6 billion. The Fresh Start Accounting adjustments
included in the following projections are preliminary estimates.

New Accounting Pronouncements:

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 143, "Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations," which requires that the fair value of a liability for
an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated
asset retirement costs would be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of
the long-lived asset and depreciated over the life of the asset. The liability
is accreted at the end of each period through charges to interest expense. If
the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a
gain or loss on settlement will be recognized. The provisions of SFAS No. 143
will be adopted for our fiscal year beginning January 30, 2003. We are currently
quantifying the impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 143.

We are currently reviewing SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4,
44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," which
was issued in May 2002. The statement establishes that gains and losses from
extinguishment of debt will be classified as extraordinary items only if they
meet the criteria of unusual or infrequently occurring items. Kmart anticipates
that the gain from the extinguishments of our pre-petition debt will be
classified as an extraordinary item.

In November 2002, a consensus was reached on two issues included in Emerging
Issue Task Force ("EITF") 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (including a
Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor," which addresses the
accounting by a reseller for consideration received from a vendor. First, cash
consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the price
of the vendor's product or service and should be classified as a reduction to
cost of sales in the reseller's income statement, unless the consideration is
reimbursement for selling costs or payment for assets or services delivered to
the

<PAGE>
vendor. Second, performance-driven vendor rebates ("volume rebates") should be
recorded only if the payment is considered probable and should be measured on a
systematic and rational basis consistent with achieving the underlying
performance targets. The provisions related to volume rebates are already
effective for new arrangements and we have adopted the provisions, as required.
The provisions related to the first consensus will take effect the first day of
Kmart's fiscal 2003 year, or January 30, 2003, and as a result, Kmart
anticipates that a significant reclassification of amounts previously defined as
co-op advertising recoveries and included as a reduction of selling, general and
administrative expenses will now be classified as a reduction of cost of sales
expense.

The pro-forma financial statements do not take into consideration the potential
for changes in Kmart's accounting policies and procedures, as discussed in the
Amendment No. 1 to Kmart's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the period ended
January 30, 2002, in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations and Financial Condition, "Critical Accounting Policies" and Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Footnote 3, "Significant Accounting
Policies and Procedures." Kmart's adoption of policies and procedures that
differ from methods used historically could result in a significant difference
in actual valuation adjustments applied in Fresh Start Accounting.

Net Sales:

Net sales for 2003 vs. 2002 are projected to decrease by 17.5% due to the
closure of 283 stores in May 2002 and 319 stores in March 2003. Net sales are
expected to increase 0.7% in 2004, 5.3% in 2005, 5.5% in 2006 and 5.9% in 2007.
The increases in net sales for 2004 - 2007 are partially the result of 70 new
store openings, which are planned as follows: 10 each in 2004 and 2005, 20 in
2006 and 30 in 2007.

On a same-store basis, the Projections assume that same-store sales will
increase over prior years by 1.1%, 3.8%, 4.5%, 4.3% and 4.0% for 2003 - 2007,
respectively. The primary drivers of the same-store sales increases include the
continued improvement in operational execution, increased promotional
productivity and improved product flow.

As a result of improved product flow and allocation, SKU rationalization and
store closures, inventory turns are expected to improve from 4.0 in 2002 to 4.2
in 2003. Inventory turnover is expected to further improve to 5.0 by 2007 as a
result of right-size purchasing and flow path optimization.

Gross Margin:

Gross Margin as a percentage of net sales is projected to improve from 18.0% in
2002 to 21.5% in 2007. This improvement is driven by improved promotional
productivity, favorable product mix and markon improvement due to increased
import purchases. Additionally, as a result of recently implemented inventory
control and loss prevention programs, the Company has projected a return to
historical shrinkage rates. As discussed above, Kmart will reclassify credits
previously defined as co-op advertising recoveries to a reduction of cost of
sales resulting in an improvement in the gross margin rate. In addition, the
Projections assume lower depreciation of buildings and leasehold improvements as
a result of the write-down of assets for Fresh Start Accounting.

SG&A:

Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A"), as a percentage of net
sales, are projected to remain relatively flat at approximately 20.0% from 2002
to 2003 as lower depreciation expense generated by Fresh Start Accounting
adjustments is mostly offset by the effects of store closings and the resulting
lower sales base. Thereafter, SG&A is expected to improve to 17.9% of net sales
by 2007. This improvement is primarily due to improved operating procedures and
productivity at the stores and cost control initiatives at Kmart Headquarters.
As discussed above, Kmart will reclassify credits previously defined as co-op
advertising recoveries to a reduction of cost of sales resulting in an increase
in SG&A as a percentage of sales.

<PAGE>
Income Taxes:

The Projections assume that Kmart will substantially offset its unused net loss
carry forwards against the Company's cancellation of debt income at emergence.
The effective tax rate going forward is estimated at 38.0%. Tax benefits will be
fully reserved until utilization.

Reorganization and Non-Comparable Items:

Expenses and income directly incurred or realized as a result of the Chapter 11
Filings have been segregated from normal operations and are disclosed
separately. For 2003, the Projections assume $464 million of Chapter 11
Reorganization items primarily relating to the store closings, professional fees
and bonuses related to the Key Employee Retention Plan. Non-comparable items are
forecast to be $25 million, which relates to the sale of a Distribution Center
and the associated write-down of assets.

EBITDA:

EBITDA represents earnings from continuing operations before interest and
financing charges, income taxes, non-comparable charges, reorganization items,
depreciation and amortization and other charges. This presentation is not
intended to be a substitute for measures of profitability or cash flow required
by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America.
EBITDA, as measured by the Company, may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by
other companies.

Capital Expenditures:

In 2003, capital expenditures relate primarily to the general maintenance of
existing stores and distribution centers as well as a modest amount of new
investment in supply chain operations and information systems. The Projections
assume that annual capital expenditures build from $350 million in 2003 to $600
million in 2007. The increase is primarily related to new store openings (a
total of 70 from 2004 -- 2007) and updating the existing stores.

Working Capital & Liquidity:

The Projections assume the Company has sufficient liquidity with the peak
borrowing occurring in November of each year.

The Projections assume that the Company's level of vendor support represented by
average days accounts payable will increase over the projection period to
approximate historical levels.

Pension Plan:

Prior to 1996, Kmart maintained a defined benefit pension plan covering eligible
associates. Effective January 31, 1996, the pension plan was frozen, and
associates no longer earn additional benefits under the plan (except for
purposes of the subsidized early retirement program provided by the plan). The
plan's assets consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities. For the
past 8 years, Kmart has not been required to make a contribution to the plan. In
light of returns in the equity markets since the beginning of the 2002 fiscal
year and the effect of such returns, as well as returns over the past several
years, on the value of the plan's assets, we presently expect that we will be
required to commence making contributions to the plan in 2004 or 2005. The
Projections assume that $238 million is contributed to the plan in 2004 and
contributions of $202 million, $178 million and $160 million are made in 2005,
2006 and 2007, respectively. Given that the plan is frozen, the timing for the
commencement of our future funding requirements will depend, in large part, on
the future investment performance of the plan's assets.



<PAGE>
As a result of the returns on plan assets over recent years, expected decreases
in our annual discount rate and expected rate of return on assets for fiscal
year 2003, there will likely be an expense of $37 million recorded for 2003 as
opposed to income as has been recorded in recent years. As a result of the
funding described above and expected returns on plan assets going forward, the
Projections assume income of $4 million will be recorded beginning in 2005 and
reach income of $49 million in 2007.

Upon adoption of Fresh Start Accounting, we will recognize $938 million of
unamortized actuarial losses in our Statement of Operations; these losses were
previously included as a component of equity and classified as other
comprehensive income.

                       REORGANIZATION VALUATION ANALYSIS


         Miller Buckfire Lewis & Co., LLC and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein,
Inc. (collectively, the "Financial Advisor") have advised the Debtors with
respect to the value of the Reorganized Debtors.

         For purposes of the Plan, the reorganization value (the "Reorganization
Value") of the Reorganized Debtors is estimated to range from approximately
$2,250 million to $3,000 million. The Reorganization Value assumes an effective
date (the "Effective Date") of April 30,2003 and reflects the going concern
value of the Debtors after giving effect to the implementation of the Plan. The
Reorganization Value does not include excess cash, if any, remaining in the
Reorganized Debtors after taking into account cash distributions required under
the Plan. The Debtors are of the view that such excess cash, if any, is
necessary to run the business and, therefore, should not be viewed as excess
cash for valuation purposes.

         The equity value (the "Equity Value") of the Reorganized Debtors is
estimated to range from approximately $789 million to $1,539 million or
from approximately $7.89 per share to $15.39 per share assuming that a total of
100,000,000 shares of common stock are issued and outstanding on the Effective
Date. The Equity Value reflects the difference between the Reorganization Value
and the total amount of long-term net debt that is estimated to be outstanding
after giving effect to the Plan.

         The Financial Advisor has assisted the Debtors in arriving at the
Reorganization Value. In doing so, the Financial Advisor has assumed and relied
on the accuracy and completeness of certain unaudited projections prepared by
the Debtors of the Debtors' results of operations, cash flow and related balance
sheets (the "Projections"). The Projections reflect numerous assumptions,
including assumptions with respect to the future performance of the Reorganized
Debtors, the performance of the industry, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, most of which are beyond the Debtors' control.
Numerous factors may affect the future financial performance of the Reorganized
Debtors and the accuracy of the Projections. Therefore, the actual results
achieved during the projection period will vary from the projected results, and
may vary substantially. No representations can be or are being made with respect
to the accuracy of the Projections, or the ability of the Reorganized Debtors to
achieve the projected results.

         In arriving at the Reorganization Value, the Financial Advisor
performed certain quantitative analyses and made determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial and comparative analysis and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances of the Reorganized
Debtors. The Financial Advisor did not assign any specific relative weight to
any analysis or factor considered but rather made qualitative judgments as to
the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor based on the Debtors'
circumstances, including their operating performance.

<PAGE>
         SET FORTH BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL FINANCIAL ANALYSES
PERFORMED BY THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR IN ESTIMATING THE VALUE OF THE REORGANIZED
DEBTORS.

         1.    Comparable Public Company Analysis

         In a comparable public company analysis, a subject company is valued by
comparing it to publicly held companies in reasonably similar lines of business.
The comparable public companies are chosen based on, among other attributes,
their similarity to the subject company's business, presence in the market and
size. The price that an investor is willing to pay in the public markets for
each company's publicly traded securities represents that company's current and
future prospects as well as the rate of return required on the investment.

         The analytical work performed includes, among other things, a detailed
financial comparison of selected metrics from each company's financial
statements. Numerous financial multiples and ratios were developed to measure
each company's valuation and relative performance. Some of the specific analyses
entailed comparing the enterprise value (defined as market value of equity plus
debt minus excess cash) for each of the comparable public companies to their
sales, EBITDA and EBIT as well as comparing their equity values to net income
and book value. Where appropriate, the Financial Advisor applied these multiples
to the projected financials of the Reorganized Debtors to determine the implied
range of enterprise and equity value for the Reorganized Debtors.

         2.    Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

         The second valuation methodology used to value the Reorganized Debtors
was the discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method relates the
value of an asset or business to the present value of expected future cash flows
to be generated by that asset or business. The discounted cash flow method is a
forward-looking approach that discounts the expected future cash flows by a
theoretical or observed discount rate. The Reorganized Debtors' projected cash
flows after debt service (as set forth in the Business Plan) were discounted to
a present value as of the Effective Date using a discount rate equal to the
weighted average cost of capital for the Reorganized Debtors. For purposes of
the valuation analysis, the Financial Advisor used a range of discount rates
between 20% and 25%, which reflects a number of company and market specific
factors, including business execution risk and the nature and derivation of the
projections set forth in the Business Plan as well as the cost of equity for
companies that the Financial Advisor deemed comparable.

         3.    Comparable Acquisition Analysis

         The third valuation methodology used to estimate the value of the
Reorganized Debtors is the comparable acquisition analysis. The comparable
acquisition analysis entails calculating multiples of revenues, earnings and
book value based on prices paid (including any debt assumed and equity
purchased) in announced mergers and acquisitions involving companies viewed to
be similar to the Reorganized Debtors. These multiples were then applied, where
deemed relevant, to the projected financials of the Reorganized Debtors to
determine an implied range of enterprise and equity values.



                                       2
<PAGE>
         In connection with their analysis of the value of the Reorganized
Debtors, the Financial Advisor (i) reviewed certain historical financial
information of the Debtors for recent years and interim periods, (ii) reviewed
the Projections and the assumptions underlying them, (iii) reviewed certain
internal financial and operating data of the Debtors, (iv) met with certain
members of management to discuss the Debtors' operations and future prospects
(including the operational changes contemplated by the Business Plan), (v)
reviewed publicly available financial data and (vi) considered certain economic
and industry information relevant to the Debtors' operating business and
conducted such other analyses as the Financial Advisor deemed appropriate.

         As noted above, the Financial Advisor assumed and relied on the
accuracy and completeness of all financial and other information that was
provided to or discussed with it by the Debtors as well as publicly available
information, and did not assume any responsibility for independently verifying
this information. The Financial Advisor also assumed that all financial
information and analysis (including the financial projections and forecasts)
provided by the Debtors was prepared in good faith and on bases reflecting the
best currently available judgments and estimates of management of the Debtors.

         The Financial Advisor has not expressed or is not expressing any
opinion with respect to the financial information, analyses and forecasts
provided by the Debtors or the assumptions on which they are based.

         In addition, the Financial Advisor has not made or obtained an
independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the
Reorganized Debtors, and no such independent valuation or appraisal was provided
to the Financial Advisor in connection with the valuation analysis.

         The valuation analysis prepared by the Financial Advisor is based on
economic and market conditions as they existed and could be evaluated as of
January 13, 2003. The Reorganization Value represents a hypothetical
going-concern value for the Reorganized Debtors. It was calculated solely for
the purpose of determining value available for distribution to creditors under
the Plan and evaluating whether the Plan satisfied the "best interests test"
under 1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code as well as establishing a reasonable
estimate of the initial stockholders' equity for fresh-start accounting. The
Reorganization Value does not purport to reflect or constitute an appraisal, a
liquidation value or an estimate of the actual market value that may be realized
through the sale of any securities to be issued pursuant to the Plan. The value
of the Debtors' business is subject to uncertainties and contingencies that are
difficult to predict. Consequently, the Reorganization Value is not necessarily
indicative of any actual value, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than the value set forth herein.

         Additionally, the valuation of newly-issued securities is subject to
additional uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to
predict. Actual market prices of such securities at issuance will depend upon,
among other things, conditions in the financial markets, the anticipated initial
securities holdings of pre-petition creditors, some of which may prefer to
liquidate their investment rather than hold it on a long-term basis, and other
factors that generally influence the prices of securities. Actual market prices
of such securities also may be affected by the Debtors' history in



                                       3
<PAGE>

Chapter 11, conditions affecting the Debtors' competitors or the industry
generally in which the Debtors participate or by other factors not possible to
predict. Accordingly, the Reorganization Value does not necessarily reflect, and
should not be construed as reflecting, any value that will be attained in the
public or private markets. Finally, the Equity Value shown herein is based on
the Reorganized Debtors' assumption regarding their capitalization on the
Effective Date.

         The valuation set forth herein reflects the assumption that the
operating results anticipated by management and reflected in the Business Plan
can be achieved in all material respects, including comparable store sales
growth and gross margin improvement. To the extent that the valuation is
dependent on the Debtors' achievement of the projections contained in the
Disclosure Statement, the valuation should be considered speculative. The
valuation also assumes (i) a successful and timely reorganization of the
Debtors' capital structure, (ii) the Plan becoming effective in accordance with
its proposed terms and (iii) the continuity of the present operating management
of the Debtors following consummation of the Plan.

         Because of the uncertainties discussed herein, neither the Financial
Advisor nor the Debtors assumes any responsibility for the accuracy of the
valuation estimate.
