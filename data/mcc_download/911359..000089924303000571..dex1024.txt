        which shall be adjusted:

        (a)     at Closing, on an interim basis in the manner set forth in
                Sections 2.3(a), 2.3(b) and 2.3(d)(i); and

                amount by which the Adjusted Working Capital as of the Effective
                Date is greater or less than "nil". If the Adjusted Working
                Capital:

                (i)     exceeds "nil", the Purchase Price shall be increased by
                        the amount of such excess; or

                (ii)    is less than "nil", the Purchase Price shall be
                        decreased by the amount of such shortfall.

        (b)     Calculation of Tax Pool Adjustment at Closing: The Purchase
                Price shall, without duplicating any adjustments calculated
                pursuant to Section 2.3(a), be decreased by an amount equal to
                $0.10 for every $1.00 by which the aggregate Resource Pools of
                the Purchased Entities is exceeded by $42,645,000 as at the
                Effective Date (the "Resource Pool Adjustment Amount"). If the
                Resource Pool Adjustment Amount is negative, the Purchase Price
                shall be decreased by such amount.

        (c)     Calculation of Adjustment after Closing: The adjustments to the
                Purchase Price as provided in Sections 2.3(a) and 2.3(b) shall
                be calculated and paid on the Closing Date based on the
                Effective Date Working Capital Statement. Such adjustments to

        shall be adjusted to give credit for adjustments paid on the Closing
        Date pursuant to Sections 2.3(a) and 2.3(b).

        (d)     Effective Date Working Capital Statement:

                (i)     The Effective Date Working Capital Statement shall be
                        used by the Vendor and the Purchaser for the purposes of

                        accordance with the remaining provisions of this Section

                        prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a final Effective
                        Date Working Capital Statement. The Purchaser shall
                        provide, or cause to be provided, to the Vendor and its
                        agents full access to the relevant records of the
                        Purchased Entities to aid in the preparation of such
                        Statement. The Vendor shall provide to the Purchaser the
                        right to review the Effective Date Working Capital
                        Statement and full access to the working papers of the
                        Vendor to aid in such review.

                (iii)   Any receipts in respect of the items listed on the
                        Disclosure Schedule received after settlement pursuant
                        to the Effective Date Working Capital Statement and
                        which relate to matters which accrued to or for the
                        benefit of a Purchased Entity prior to the Effective
                        Date shall be received by the Purchaser and the
                        Purchased Entities, as applicable, in trust for the use
                        and benefit of the Vendor and shall be promptly paid
                        over to the Vendor.

        (e)     Purchaser's Objections: If the Purchaser, acting reasonably,
                believes that any change is required to be made to the final
                Effective Date Working Capital Statement as prepared by the
                Vendor, it shall, on or before that date (the "Objection Date")
                which is 10 Business Days after the delivery of the Effective
                Date Working Capital Statement by the Vendor pursuant to Section
                2.3(d)(ii), give written notice of any such proposed change,
                including the reason for such change, to the Vendor. In the
                event that the Purchaser does not notify the Vendor of any
                proposed change on or before the Objection Date, then the
                Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the final Effective
                Date Working Capital Statement.

        (f)     Settlement by Accounting Firm: If the Purchaser gives written
                notice of any such proposed change on or before the Objection
                Date, and if the proposed change is disputed by the Vendor and
                the Purchaser and the Vendor fail to resolve such matter within
                10 Business Days after the Objection Date, then the Accounting

                                     - 21 -

                Firm shall be engaged forthwith by the Purchaser and the Vendor
                to resolve the dispute that cannot be agreed upon and the
                Accounting Firm shall be required to render its decision without
                qualifications, other than the usual qualifications relating to
                engagements of this nature, within 14 days after the dispute is
                referred to it. If the Purchaser and the Vendor fail to so
                forthwith jointly engage the Accounting Firm, then either Party,
                on behalf of itself and the other Parties, is hereby authorized
                to so forthwith engage the Accounting Firm. The decision of the
                Accounting Firm shall be final and binding. The fees and
                expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be shared, one half to the
                Vendor and one half to the Purchaser.

        (g)     Settlement by Arbitrator: In the event that the Accounting Firm
                cannot or will not make a decision in the manner provided above,
                the Purchaser and the Vendor shall refer such matter to Ernst &
                Young, LLP (the "Arbitrator") to arbitrate the dispute as a
                single arbitrator in accordance with the Arbitration Act
                (Alberta) within 60 days after the Objection Date. If the
                Purchaser and the Vendor fail to refer such matter to the
                Arbitrator within such 60 day period, then any one Party, on
                behalf of itself and the other Parties, is hereby authorized to
                so engage the Arbitrator, or failing which, a judge of the Court
                of Queen's Bench (Calgary) shall direct the Purchaser and the
                Vendor to arbitrate this dispute in accordance herewith. The
                decision of the Arbitrator with respect to any matter in dispute
                (including as to all procedural matters) shall be final and
                binding on the Vendor and the Purchaser and shall not be subject
                to appeal by either Party. The fees and expenses of the
                Arbitrator shall be shared, one half to the Vendor and one half
                to the Purchaser.

        (h)     Amendments to Effective Date Working Capital Statement: Upon
                agreement with respect to all matters in dispute, or upon a
                decision of the Accounting Firm or the Arbitrator with respect
                to all matters in dispute, such amendments shall be made to the
                Effective Date Working Capital Statement as may be necessary to
                reflect such agreement or such decision, as the case may be. In
                such event, references in this Agreement to the Effective Date
                Working Capital Statement shall refer to the Effective Date
                Working Capital Statement, as so amended.

        (i)     Final Effective Date Working Capital Statement: Payment of any
                adjustment in the Purchase Price as a result of the final
                Effective Date Working Capital Statement shall be made by the
                Vendor to the Purchaser or by the Purchaser to the Vendor, as
                the case may be, together with interest at the rate specified in
                Section 2.5 calculated from the Closing Date to the date of
                payment, within 10 Business Days after the delivery of the
                Effective Date Working Capital Statement, pursuant to Section
                2.3(c) or 2.3(h), as applicable; provided that, in the event
                there is an objection to the Effective Date Working Capital
                Statement by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.3(e) which is
                resolved pursuant to Section 2.3(f) and/or Section 2.3(g), then,
                payment of the disputed portion or any part thereof, if any, of
                any adjustment in the Purchase Price shall be made by the Vendor
                to the

                                     - 22 -

                Purchaser or by the Purchaser to the Vendor, as the case may be,
                together with interest at the rate specified in Section 2.6
                calculated from the Closing Date to the date of payment or
                repayment, within 5 Business Days after the disputed portion has
                been agreed upon by the Purchaser and the Vendor or determined
                by the Accounting Firm or Arbitrator as provided herein.

2.4     DEPOSIT

        Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (i) the
        Purchaser shall pay the Deposit to the Escrow Agent, and (ii) the
        Purchaser, the Vendor and the Escrow Agent shall enter into the Escrow
        Agreement whereupon the Escrow Agent shall receive and hold the Deposit
        pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall
        invest the Deposit in an interest bearing trust account until Closing.
        In the event Closing does not occur, the Deposit and interest earned
        thereon shall be paid to the Party ultimately entitled to the Deposit
        pursuant to Section 7.3. If Closing occurs, the Deposit and interest
        earned thereon shall be paid to the Vendor as a partial payment of the
        Purchase Price.

2.5     ADJUSTMENT HOLDBACK AMOUNT

        (a)     The Purchaser shall retain from the Purchase Price otherwise
                payable on the Closing Date an amount equal to the Adjustment
                Holdback Amount. The Adjustment Holdback Amount shall, on the
                Closing Date, be paid by the Purchaser to the Escrow Agent
                whereupon the Escrow Agent shall receive and hold the Adjustment
                Holdback Amount pursuant to the terms of the Holdback Agreement.
                The Escrow Agent shall invest the Adjustment Holdback Amount in
                an interest bearing trust account. The Purchaser shall pay all
                costs of the Escrow Agent.

        (b)     The Adjustment Holdback Amount shall be released as follows:

                (i)     If the Purchaser does not give a written notice to the
                        Vendor on or before the Objection Date as contemplated
                        in Section 2.3(e), then the Vendor and the Purchaser
                        shall forthwith prepare, sign and deliver a joint notice
                        to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to
                        release the Adjustment Holdback Amount, plus accrued
                        interest thereon, to the Vendor on account of the
                        Purchase Price, whereupon the Escrow Agent shall,
                        subject to Section 2.7(d), so release such amount to the
                        Vendor;

                (ii)    If the Purchaser gives a written notice to the Vendor on
                        or before the Objection Date as contemplated in Section
                        2.3(e), then:

                        (A)     the amount which is the subject of the written
                                notice and which is not more than the Adjustment
                                Holdback Amount (the "Disputed Amount") shall
                                continue to be held in trust by the Escrow Agent
                                pending the resolution of the objection pursuant
                                to Sections 2.3(f)

                                or 2.3(g). Within 5 Business Days after the
                                portion of the Disputed Amount has been agreed
                                upon by the Purchaser and the Vendor or
                                determined by the Accounting Firm or Arbitrator
                                (the "Agreed Amount"):

                                (I)     the Vendor and the Purchaser shall
                                        forthwith prepare, sign and deliver a
                                        joint notice to the Escrow Agent
                                        directing the Escrow Agent to release
                                        the Agreed Amount, plus accrued interest
                                        thereon, to the Party determined to be
                                        entitled thereto pursuant to Sections
                                        2.3(f) or 2.3(g), whereupon such amount
                                        shall, subject to Section 2.7(d), be so
                                        released; and

                                (II)    the Vendor and the Purchaser shall, if
                                        applicable, forthwith prepare, sign and
                                        deliver a joint notice to the Escrow
                                        Agent directing the Escrow Agent to
                                        release to the Vendor the amount, if
                                        any, plus accrued interest thereon, by
                                        which the Disputed Amount exceeds the
                                        Agreed Amount, whereupon such amount
                                        shall, subject to Section 2.7(d), be
                                        released to the Vendor by the Escrow
                                        Agent on account of the Purchase Price;
                                        and

                        (B)     the Vendor and the Purchaser shall forthwith
                                prepare, sign and deliver a joint notice to the
                                Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to
                                release the amount, if any, plus accrued
                                interest thereon, by which the Adjustment
                                Holdback Amount exceeds the Disputed Amount,
                                whereupon such amount shall, subject to Section
                                2.7(d), be released to the Vendor by the Escrow
                                Agent on account of the Purchase Price.

                        For greater certainty, the Agreed Amount shall not
                        exceed the Disputed Amount.

2.6     INTEREST ACCRUES ON AMOUNTS OWING

        Any amount owing to a Party by the other Party pursuant to any provision
        of this Agreement after Closing and remaining unpaid shall bear interest
        calculated daily and compounded monthly, from the day such amount was
        due to be paid until the day such amount was paid, at the Prime Rate
        regardless of whether such Party has given the other Party prior notice
        of the accrual of interest hereunder.

2.7     WITHHOLDING TAX

        (a)     The Purchaser and the Vendor acknowledge that, pursuant to
                Section 116 of the Tax Act, the Purchaser must withhold and
                remit to the Receiver General the prescribed percentage of the
                amount, if any, by which:

                                     - 24 -

                (i)     the PAC Share Consideration exceeds the certificate
                        limit set out in a certificate of compliance (the "PAC
                        Compliance Certificate") obtained by PAC for the
                        purposes of Section 116 of the Tax Act in respect of the
                        sale of the PAC Shares by PAC; and

                (ii)    the PCI Share Consideration exceeds the certificate
                        limit set out in a certificate of compliance (the "PCI
                        Compliance Certificate") obtained by PCI for the
                        purposes of Section 116 of the Tax Act in respect of the
                        sale of the PCI Shares by PCI.

                The applications for the PAC Compliance Certificate and the PCI
                Compliance Certificate, along with any related correspondence,
                shall be provided to and approved by the Purchaser, acting
                reasonably.

        (b)     If a PAC Compliance Certificate, in respect of the sale of the
                PAC Shares, is not delivered to the Purchaser by PAC at or prior
                to Closing, the Purchaser will pay the prescribed percentage of
                the PAC Share Consideration (the "PAC Withheld Amount") to the
                Escrow Agent, whereupon the Escrow Agent shall receive and hold
                the PAC Withheld Amount pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
                Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall invest the PAC Withheld Amount
                in an interest bearing trust account, and the PAC Withheld
                Amount shall be released by the Escrow Agent as follows:

                (i)     If a PAC Compliance Certificate in respect of the sale
                        of the PAC Shares is delivered to the Escrow Agent
                        before 12:00 p.m. on the date which is 3 Business Days
                        prior to the end of the month following the month which
                        includes the Closing Date (the "Remittance Date") and
                        the certificate limit of such PAC Compliance Certificate
                        is not less than the PAC Share Consideration, then the
                        PAC Withheld Amount shall be released to PCI (on behalf
                        of PAC) on account of the PAC Share Consideration;

                (ii)    If the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (the "CCRA")
                        indicates that payment of an amount (the "PAC Tax
                        Amount") which is not more than the PAC Withheld Amount
                        would allow the CCRA to issue a PAC Compliance
                        Certificate meeting the criteria described in Section
                        2.7(b)(i), the Escrow Agent shall pay the PAC Tax Amount
                        to the CCRA from the PAC Withheld Amount held in trust
                        by it and, upon delivery of the relevant PAC Compliance
                        Certificate to the Escrow Agent, the amount by which the
                        PAC Withheld Amount exceeds the PAC Tax Amount shall be
                        released to PCI (on behalf of PAC) on account of the PAC
                        Share Consideration;

                (iii)   If a PAC Compliance Certificate in respect of the sale
                        of the PAC Shares is delivered to the Escrow Agent
                        before 12:00 p.m. on the Remittance Date and the
                        certificate limit of such PAC Compliance Certificate is
                        less than the PAC Share Consideration then that portion
                        of the PAC Withheld

                        Amount which is equal to 25% of the certificate limit
                        shall be released to PCI (on behalf of PAC) on account
                        of the PAC Share Consideration; and

                the PCI Share Consideration (the "PCI Withheld Amount") to the
                Escrow Agent, whereupon the Escrow Agent shall receive and hold
                the PCI Withheld Amount pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
                Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall invest the PCI Withheld Amount
                in an interest bearing trust account, and the PCI Withheld
                Amount shall be released by the Escrow Agent as follows:

                (i)     If a PCI Compliance Certificate in respect of the sale
                        of the PCI Shares is delivered to the Escrow Agent
                        before 12:00 p.m. on the Remittance Date and the
                        certificate limit of such PCI Compliance Certificate is
                        not less than the PCI Share Consideration, then the PCI
                        Withheld Amount shall be released to PCI on account of
                        the PCI Share Consideration;

                (ii)    If the CCRA indicates that payment of an amount (the
                        "PCI Tax Amount") which is not more than the PCI
                        Withheld Amount would allow the CCRA to issue a PCI
                        Compliance Certificate meeting the criteria described in
                        Section 2.7(c)(i), the Escrow Agent shall pay the PCI
                        Tax Amount to the CCRA from the PCI Withheld Amount held
                        in trust by it and, upon delivery of the relevant PCI
                        Compliance Certificate to the Escrow Agent, the amount
                        by which the PCI Withheld Amount exceeds the PCI Tax
                        Amount shall be released to PCI on account of the PCI
                        Share Consideration;

                (iii)   If a PCI Compliance Certificate in respect of the sale
                        of the PCI Shares is delivered to the Escrow Agent
                        before 12:00 p.m. on the Remittance Date and the
                        certificate limit of such PCI Compliance Certificate is
                        less than the PCI Share Consideration then that portion
                        of the PCI Withheld Amount which is equal to 25% of the
                        certificate limit shall be released to PCI on account of
                        the PCI Share Consideration; and

                PCI, net of all applicable withholdings, which shall be remitted
                by the Escrow Agent to the CCRA in accordance with Applicable

                hereof, payable by the Purchaser to the Vendor after Closing,

4.5     PROPOSALS FOR DEALINGS OR OPERATIONS RE PNG ASSETS

        Subject to Section 4.6, if a Purchased Entity, directly or indirectly
        (through the activities of the Manager pursuant to the Management
        Agreement), receives notice of proposed operations, or the exercise of
        any right or option, respecting the PNG Assets from a third party during
        the Interim Period in circumstances in which such operation or the
        exercise of such right or option would require the consent of the
        Purchaser pursuant to Sections

<PAGE>

                                     - 34 -

        4.3 or 4.4, the following paragraphs shall apply to such operation or
        the exercise of such right or option (the "Proposal"):

        (a)     The Vendor shall cause the applicable Purchased Entity to,
                directly or indirectly (through the activities of the Manager
                pursuant to the Management Agreement), give prompt notice of the
                Proposal to the Purchaser, including with such notice the
                particulars of such Proposal in reasonable detail, and whether
                the applicable Purchased Entity recommends the exercise of its
                rights with respect to the Proposal.

        (b)     The Purchaser shall, not later than (i) 4 Business Days prior to
                the time the applicable Purchased Entity is required to make its
                election with respect to the Proposal or (ii) one half of the
                time remaining for an election with respect to the Proposal,
                whichever is greater (the "Election Time"), advise the Vendor
                and the applicable Purchased Entity, by written notice, whether
                it wishes the applicable Purchased Entity to exercise its rights
                with respect to the Proposal, provided that failure of the
                Purchaser to provide such notice within such period shall be
                deemed to be an election by the Purchaser to have the applicable
                Purchased Entity proceed with its recommendation with respect to
                the Proposal as specified in the notice delivered pursuant to
                Section 4.5(a).

        (c)     The Vendor shall cause the applicable Purchased Entity to,
                directly or indirectly (through the activities of the Manager
                pursuant to the Management Agreement), make the election
                requested by the Purchaser with respect to the Proposal within
                the period during which the applicable Purchased Entity may
                respond to the Proposal.

        (d)     A request by the Purchaser not to consent to any Proposal
                required to preserve the existence of any of the PNG Assets
                shall not entitle the Purchaser to any reduction of the Purchase
                Price in the event that the Purchased Entity's interest therein
                is terminated or reduced as a result of thereof, and such
                termination or reduction shall be deemed to be a Permitted
                Encumbrance and shall not constitute a failure of the Vendor's
                representations and warranties pertaining to such PNG Assets.

4.6     EXISTING AUTHORIZATIONS FOR EXPENDITURE

        Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article 4, a Purchased
        Entity shall be entitled to conduct those activities and operations
        arising out of or incidental to the authorizations for expenditures
        ("AFE's") existing and effective as of the Signing Date, which AFE's
        have been listed on Schedule 4.6.

4.7     INSURANCE

        Date. Thereafter the Purchaser will or will cause the Purchased Entities
        to procure and maintain any and all policies of insurance as the
        Purchaser or the Purchased Entities, at its or their respective cost and
        expense, deem advisable. All risk of loss with respect to the Purchased
        Entities or the PNG Assets or other properties of the Purchased Entities
        shall pass to the Purchaser upon completion of Closing. After the
        Closing Date the Vendor shall have no further responsibility or duty to
        administer, in any fashion, claims under any insurance policies.

7.2     EFFECT OF TERMINATION

        If this Agreement is terminated by the Vendor or by the Purchaser as
        permitted under Section 7.1:

        (a)     except as contemplated by this Section 7.2, such termination
                shall be without liability of any Party to any other Party to
                this Agreement, or to any of their shareholders, directors,
                officers, employees, agents, consultants or representatives, and
                the Parties shall be released from all of their obligations
                under this Agreement;

        (b)     if such termination shall result from the Purchase Agreement
                Default of a Party, such Party shall not be released from such
                Purchase Agreement Default and shall be fully liable for any and
                all losses, costs, damages (excluding consequential damages),
                expenses, charges, fines, penalties, assessments or other
                liabilities sustained or incurred by the other Party or Parties
                directly or indirectly as a result thereof;

7.3     ENTITLEMENT TO DEPOSIT ON TERMINATION

        Default of the Purchaser, then the Deposit provided for in Section 2.4
        shall be returned to the Purchaser, together with interest earned
        thereon. However, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
        7.1 prior to Closing as a result of a Purchase Agreement Default by the
        Purchaser, then such Deposit, together with the interest earned thereon,
        may be retained by the Vendor and applied by the Vendor on account of
        its damages contemplated by Section 7.2(b) as a genuine pre-estimate of
        the Vendor's liquidated damages and not as a penalty. If the Vendor's
        actual damages exceed the Deposit and all interest earned thereon, the
        Vendor shall not be entitled to recover the full amount of its actual
        damages.

                Letter of Credit in effect, including by way of renewals for the
                entire LC Claim Period, from time to time prior to its expiry
                date. The Purchaser will be entitled to present such Letter of

                time after the Closing Date, the Vendor may, in lieu of the
                Letter of Credit, secure its obligations under Section 9.2(c),

                shall be satisfactory to the Purchaser, acting reasonably)

                Claim Period, PEC, the Purchaser and the Purchaser's Affiliates
                for any Non-PNG Related Environmental Liabilities on terms

                subsidiaries of predecessors; provided, however, that the Vendor
                shall be solely liable for all premiums and related costs
                associated with such insurance. The

                information to any such insurer.

        (b)     Section 9.8(a) shall not impair, effect or limit in any way
                whatsoever the rights and remedies of the Purchaser and its
