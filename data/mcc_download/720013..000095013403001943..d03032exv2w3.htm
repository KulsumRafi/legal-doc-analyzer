reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization or other change in corporate

statement and of the fact that the Valid Business Reason for such postponement
or withdrawal no longer exists, in each case, promptly after the occurrence
thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the

harmless the Company, and each officer and director of the Company or person,
if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, against any
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (which shall, for all purposes of this
Agreement, include, but not be limited to, all costs of defense and
investigation and all attorneys&#146; fees) to which the Company or any such
officer, director or controlling person may become subject under the Act or
otherwise, insofar as such losses claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of any material fact contained in the registration statement,
or any related preliminary prospectus, Prospectus or amendment or supplement
thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent
that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission was made in such registration statement, preliminary prospectus,
Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon, and in
conformity with, written information furnished to the Company by such
Distributing Holder specifically for use in the preparation thereof. The
indemnity obligation of the Distributing Holder set forth in this Section&nbsp;11(b)
(<I>Indemnification</I>) shall not exceed the proceeds received by the Distributing
Holder upon a sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration
statement. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which
the Distributing Holder may otherwise have.</FONT></TD>
