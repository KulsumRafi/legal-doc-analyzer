     For purposes of the foregoing, (i) if either Moody's or S&P shall not have
in effect a rating for the Index Debt (other than by reason of the circumstances
referred to in the last sentence of this definition), then such rating agency
shall be deemed to have established a rating in Category 6; (ii) if the ratings
established or deemed to have been established by Moody's and S&P for the Index
Debt shall fall within different Categories, then (A) if both such ratings are
at or above Category 4, the Applicable Percentage shall be based on the higher
of the two ratings unless one of the two ratings is two or more Categories lower
than the other, in which case the Applicable Percentage shall be determined by
reference to the Category next above that of the

                                       2

<PAGE>

lower of the two ratings and (B) if one or both of such ratings is below
Category 4, the Applicable Percentage shall be determined by reference to the
lower of the two ratings; and (iii) if the ratings established or deemed to have
been established by Moody's and S&P for the Index Debt shall be changed (other
than as a result of a change in the rating system of Moody's or S&P), such
change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the
applicable rating agency. Each change in the Applicable Percentage shall apply
during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on
the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If
the rating system of Moody's or S&P shall change, or if either such rating
agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations,
the Lessee and the Lenders and the Holders shall negotiate in good faith to
amend this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the
unavailability of ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness
of any such amendment, the Applicable Percentage shall be determined by
reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or
cessation.

     In the event of any replacement or amendment of the pricing grid setting
forth the "Eurodollar Spread" and the "Facility Fee Rate" in the definition of
"Applicable Rate" under the Lessee Credit Agreement, the Eurodollar Spread for
Tranche A Eurodollar Loans and Tranche B Eurodollar Loans and the Facility Fees
for Tranche A Lender Facility Fees and Tranche B Lender Facility Fees set forth
herein for each Index Debt Rating shall be amended to equal the Eurodollar
Spread or Facility Fee, as applicable, set forth for each corresponding Index
Debt Rating in the Lessee Credit Agreement, as replaced or amended, and the
Eurodollar Spread for Eurodollar Holder Advances and the Holder Facility shall,
in each case, be equal to the Eurodollar Spread or Facility Fee, as applicable,
set forth for each corresponding Index Debt Rating in the Lessee Credit
Agreement, as replaced or amended, plus .75%; provided, in the event that any
such replacement or amendment of the pricing grid setting forth the "Eurodollar
Spread" and the "Facility Fee Rate" in the definition of "Applicable Rate" under
the Lessee Credit Agreement includes both a 364-day tranche and a multi-year
tranche, the Eurodollar Spread for Tranche A Eurodollar Loans and Tranche B
Eurodollar Loans and the Facility Fees for Tranche A Lender Facility Fees and
Tranche B Lender Facility Fees set forth herein for each Index Debt Rating shall
be amended to equal the Eurodollar Spread or Facility Fee for the multi-year
tranche (rather than the 364-day tranche), as applicable, set forth for each
corresponding Index Debt Rating in the Lessee Credit Agreement, as replaced or
amended, and the Eurodollar Spread for Eurodollar Holder Advances and the Holder
Facility shall, in each case, be equal to the Eurodollar Spread or Facility Fee
for the multi-year tranche (rather than the 364-day tranche), as applicable, set
forth for each corresponding Index Debt Rating in the Lessee Credit Agreement,
as replaced or amended, plus .75%; provided, further, any such amendment to the
Eurodollar Spread for Tranche A Eurodollar Loans and Tranche B Eurodollar Loans
and the Facility Fees for Tranche A Lender Facility Fees and Tranche B Lender
Facility Fees described in this sentence shall only be effective upon the
unanimous written consent of the Lenders and the Holders, and if such unanimous
written consent is not received, the Eurodollar Spread for Tranche A Eurodollar
Loans, Tranche B Eurodollar Loans and Eurodollar Holder Advances and the
Facility Fees for Tranche A Lender Facility Fees, Tranche B Lender Facility Fees
and Holder Facility Fees shall continue to be as set forth above.

     Each Lender may participate, assign or transfer all or a portion of its
interest hereunder and under the other Operative Agreements in accordance with
Sections 9.7 and 9.8 of the Credit Agreement; provided, each participant,
assignee or transferee must obtain the same ratable interest in Tranche A Loans,
Tranche A Commitments, Tranche B Loans and Tranche B Commitments, and (and to

Estate); provided further, that each Lender that participates, assigns or
transfers all or a portion of its interest hereunder and under the other
Operative Agreements shall deliver to the Agent a copy of each Assignment and
Acceptance (as referenced in Section 9.8 of the Credit Agreement) for purposes
of maintaining the Register. The Holders may, directly or indirectly, assign,
convey or otherwise transfer any of their right, title or interest in or to the
Trust Estate or the Trust Agreement with the prior written consent of the Agent
and the Lessee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and
in accordance with the terms of Section 11.8(b) of the Trust Agreement;
provided,

                                       7

<PAGE>

each such assignee, receiver of a conveyance or other transferee must also
obtain the same ratable interest in and to the Tranche A Loans, Tranche A
Commitments, Tranche B Loans and Tranche B Commitments. The Owner Trustee may,
subject to the rights of the Lessee under the Lease and the other Operative
Agreements and to the Lien of the applicable Security Documents but only with
the prior written consent of the Agent (which consent may be withheld by the
Agent in its sole discretion) and (provided, no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing) with the consent of the Lessee, directly or
indirectly, assign, convey, appoint an agent with respect to enforcement of, or
otherwise transfer any of its right, title or interest in or to any Property,
the Lease, the Trust Agreement and the other Operative Agreements (including
without limitation any right to indemnification thereunder), or any other
document relating to a Property or any interest in a Property as provided in the
Trust Agreement and the Lease. The provisions of the immediately preceding
sentence shall not apply to the obligations of the Owner Trustee to transfer
Property to the Lessee or a third party purchaser pursuant to Article XXII of
the Lease upon payment for such Property in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Lease. Neither the Lessee nor the Construction Agent may
assign any of the Operative Agreements or any of their respective rights or
obligations thereunder or with respect to any Property in whole or in part to
any Person without the prior written consent of the Agent, the Lenders, the
Holders and the Lessor.

     10.2. Effect of Transfer.

     From and after any transfer effected in accordance with this Section 10,
the transferor shall be released, to the extent of such transfer, from its
liability hereunder and under the other documents to which it is a party in
respect of obligations to be performed on or after the date of such transfer;
provided, however, that any transferor shall remain liable hereunder and under
such other documents to the extent that the transferee shall not have assumed
the obligations of the transferor thereunder. Upon any transfer by the Owner
Trustee, a Holder or a Lender as above provided, any such transferee shall
assume the obligations of the Owner Trustee, the Holder or the Lender, as the
case may be, and shall be deemed an "Owner Trustee", "Holder", or "Lender", as
the case may be, for all purposes of such documents and each reference herein to
the transferor shall thereafter be deemed a reference to such transferee for all
purposes, except as provided in the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding any
transfer of all or a portion of the transferor's interest as provided in this
Section 10, the transferor shall be entitled to all benefits accrued and all
rights vested prior to such transfer including without limitation rights to
indemnification under any such document.

yield protection provisions contained in Sections 11.2(e), 11.3 and 11.4 of the
Participation Agreement and the right of set-off contained in Section 12.15 of

and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under the Operative Agreements, and such Lender shall retain the
sole right to enforce the obligations of the Borrower relating to its Loans and
its Notes and to approve any amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision

     Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under the
     Operative Agreements (including, without limitation, all or a portion of
     its Loans, its Notes, and its Commitment); provided, however, that

               (i) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee;

               (ii) except in the case of an assignment to another Lender or an
          assignment of all of a Lender's rights and obligations under the
          Operative Agreements, any such partial assignment shall be in an

          $1,000,000 in excess thereof;

                                       9

<PAGE>

               (iii) each such assignment by a Lender shall be of a constant,
          and not varying, percentage of all of its rights and obligations under
          the Operative Agreements and the Notes; and

               (iv) the parties to such assignment shall execute and deliver to
          the Agent for its acceptance an Assignment and Acceptance
          substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto, together with any Note
          subject to such assignment and a processing fee in an amount not to
          exceed $3,500.

     Upon execution, delivery, and acceptance of such Assignment and Acceptance,
     the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of such
     assignment, have the obligations, rights and benefits of a Lender under the
     Operative Agreements and the assigning Lender shall, to the extent of such
     assignment, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations
     under the Operative Agreements. Upon the consummation of any assignment
     pursuant to this Section, the assignor, the Agent and the Borrower shall
     make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, new Notes are issued to
     the assignor and the assignee. If the assignee is not incorporated under
     the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall
     deliver to the Borrower and the Agent certification as to exemption from
     deduction or withholding of Taxes in accordance with Section 11.2(e) of the
     Participation Agreement.

          (b) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by the
     parties thereto, together with any Note subject to such assignment and
     payment of the processing fee, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and
     Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit B
     hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the
     information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice
     thereof to the parties thereto.

          (c) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in any Operative
     Agreement, any Lender may at any time assign and pledge all or any portion
     of its Loans and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank as collateral
     security pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating Circular issued by such
     Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the assigning Lender
     from its obligations hereunder.

          (d) Any Lender may furnish any information concerning the Borrower,
     the Lessee or any Subsidiaries of the Lessee in the possession of such
     Lender from time to time to assignees (including prospective assignees),
     subject, however, to the provisions of Section 12.13 of the Participation
     Agreement.

     15. Section 9.9 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to read as
follows:

     9.9  The Register; Disclosure; Pledges to Federal Reserve Banks.

     The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 12.2 of the

register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the
Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time
to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and
the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a
Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

     16. Schedule 2.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby deemed amended and
restated in its entirety to read as Schedule 2.1 attached hereto as EXHIBIT 1.

                                 TRUST AGREEMENT

     18. Section 11.8(b) of the Trust Agreement is hereby amended to read as
follows:

          Any Holder may transfer or assign all or any portion of its right,
          title and interest in the Trust Estate, this Trust Agreement and the
          Certificate of such Holder in accordance with the requirements of
          Section 10.1 of the Participation Agreement and pursuant to an
          assignment agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit B, which
          assignment agreement shall provide, without limitation, that the
          assignee undertakes and assumes all obligations and covenants of a
          Holder under this Trust Agreement and the other Operative Agreements.
          The Holder proposing the transfer or assignment shall notify the Owner
          Trustee, the Agent and Lessee in writing of the effective date of the
          transfer or assignment, which effective date shall be at least three
          (3) Business Days after the date of such notification. The Owner
          Trustee shall maintain a register showing the Holders and their
          respective interests in the Trust Estate and, upon the occurrence of a
          permitted assignment pursuant to this Section 11.8(b), shall issue a
          Certificate to the assignee and, if the assigning Holder is
          maintaining an interest hereunder, a new Certificate to such assigning
          Holder representing its revised interest in the Trust Estate. The
          Owner Trustee shall not recognize any purported assignment or transfer
          by a Holder that does not comply with the terms of this Section
          11.8(b) and any such attempted transfer or assignment by a Holder in
          violation of the terms of this Section 11.8(b) shall be null and void
          and of no effect.

     19. Schedule I of the Trust Agreement is hereby deemed amended and restated
in its entirety to read as Schedule I attached hereto as EXHIBIT 2.

     20. The form of assignment agreement attached hereto as RIDER B is hereby
added as EXHIBIT B to the Trust Agreement.

     Lessor may request if any one of Lessor, the Agent, the Trust Company, any
     Lender or any Holder is required pursuant to any applicable Legal

     occurrence of any Event of Default and in connection with the exercise by
     the Lessee of the Purchase Option with respect to one or more, but less

     25. Section 17.1(d) of the Lease is hereby amended to read as follows:

          (d) (i) Lessee shall fail to observe or perform any term, covenant,
     obligation or condition of Lessee (including without limitation the
     Incorporated Covenants) under this Lease or any other Operative Agreement
     to which Lessee is a party other than those set forth in Sections 17.1(a),

     Lessee or such Credit Party diligently pursues such cure, then no Lease
     Event of Default shall be deemed to occur with respect to such failure
     until the passage of an additional sixty (60) days after the initial thirty
     (30) days referenced above or (ii) any representation or warranty made by
     Lessee or any other Credit Party (including without limitation the

     inaccurate in any material way when made and such matter giving rise to
     such misrepresentation or breach of warranty shall continue for thirty (30)
     days after notice thereof to Lessee or such Credit Party; provided, if such
     matter giving rise to such misrepresentation or breach of warranty cannot
     be cured within such thirty (30) days but can be cured with subsequent
     diligence and Lessee or such Credit Party diligently pursues such cure,
     then no Lease Event of Default shall be deemed to occur with respect to
     such failure until the passage of an additional sixty (60) days after the
     initial thirty (30) days referenced above;

     26. The following is hereby added as Section 17.1(r) of the Lease:

          (r) Any Lessee Credit Agreement Event of Default shall have occurred
     and be continuing and shall not have been waived;

     27. Section 20.1 is hereby amended to read as follows:

          20.1 Purchase Option or Sale Option-General Provisions.

          Not less than one hundred twenty (120) days and no more than one
hundred eighty (180) days prior to the Expiration Date or (respecting the
Purchase Option only) any Payment Date prior to the Expiration Date (so long as
the appraised value pursuant to an Appraisal delivered to the Agent not more
than sixty (60) days prior to the Payment Date specified in the Election Notice,
as defined below, respecting each Property remaining in the Trust and subject to
this Lease after such Payment Date is equal to or greater than ninety percent

                                       13

<PAGE>

(90%) of the Property Cost of such remaining Property), Lessee may give Lessor
irrevocable written notice (the "Election Notice") that Lessee is electing to
exercise either (a) the option to purchase all, but not less than all, the
Properties on the Expiration Date or each Property or any Property on the
Payment Date specified in the Election Notice (the "Purchase Option") or (b)
with respect to an Election Notice given in connection with the Expiration Date
only, the option to remarket all, but not less than all, the Properties to a
Person other than Lessee or any Affiliate of Lessee and cause a sale of such
Properties to occur on the Expiration Date pursuant to the terms of Section 22.1
(the "Sale Option"). Not more than two hundred (200) days prior to the final
Expiration Date, Lessor may give Lessee notice of Lessee's obligation to deliver
the Election Notice. If Lessee fails to give an Election Notice within the
specified time period prior to the Expiration Date and Lessor has not given
Lessee notice as specified in the preceding sentence, then Lessor shall give
Lessee notice of Lessee's obligation to deliver the Election Notice, and Lessee
shall have five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice within which to
make the Election Notice. If Lessee elects, or is deemed to have elected, either
the Purchase Option or the Sale Option and fails to satisfy all related
obligations of Lessee pursuant to the Operative Agreements, then such failure
shall be deemed to be a Lease Event of Default. If Lessee does not give an
Election Notice indicating the Purchase Option or the Sale Option at least one
hundred twenty (120) days and not more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior
to the Expiration Date, then, unless such Expiration Date is the final
Expiration Date to which the Term may be extended, the term of this Lease shall
be extended in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof; if such Expiration Date is
the final Expiration Date (and Lessor has given Lessee notice of Lessee's
obligation to deliver the Election Notice but Lessee has not made its Election
Notice within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice from Lessor),
then Lessee shall be deemed to have elected the Purchase Option. If Lessee shall
either (i) elect (or be deemed to have elected) to exercise the Purchase Option
or (ii) elect the Sale Option and fail to cause all, but not less than all, the
Properties to be sold in accordance with the terms of Section 22.1 on the
Expiration Date, then in either case Lessee shall pay to Lessor on the date on
which such purchase or sale is scheduled to occur an amount equal to the
Termination Value for all, but not less than all, the Properties (which the
parties do not intend to be a "bargain" purchase price) and, upon receipt of
such amounts and satisfaction of such obligations, Lessor shall transfer to
Lessee all of Lessor's right, title and interest in and to all, but not less
than all, the Properties in accordance with Section 20.2.

     28. Section 20.2 is hereby amended to read as follows:

     20.2 Lessee Purchase Option.

          Provided, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing (other than those that will be cured by the payment of the
Termination Value for all the Properties) and provided, that the Election Notice
has been appropriately given specifying the Purchase Option, Lessee shall
purchase all the Properties on the Expiration Date or each Property or any
Property as elected for any Payment Date prior to the Expiration Date at a price
equal to the Termination Value for such Properties (which the parties do not
intend to be a "bargain" purchase price).

                                       14

          Subject to Section 19.2, in connection with any termination of this
Lease with respect to any Property pursuant to the terms of Section 16.2, or in
connection with Lessee's exercise of its Purchase Option, upon the date on which
this Lease is to terminate with respect to a Property or all of the Properties,
and upon tender by Lessee of the amounts set forth in Section 16.2(b) or this
Section 20.2, as applicable, Lessor shall execute, acknowledge (where required)
and deliver to Lessee, at Lessee's cost and expense, each of the following: (a)
a termination or assignment (as requested by the Lessee) of each applicable
Ground Lease and special or limited warranty Deeds conveying each Property (to
the extent it is real property not subject to a Ground Lease) to Lessee free and
clear of the Lien of this Lease, the Lien of the Credit Documents and any Lessor
Liens; (b) a Bill of Sale conveying each Property (to the extent it is personal
property) to Lessee free and clear of the Lien of this Lease, the Lien of the
Credit Documents and any Lessor Liens and, to the extent the following are
agreed to by the Agent in its reasonable discretion, such title affidavits and
other documents as may be reasonably requested by any title insurance
underwriter issuing title insurance in connection with the acquisition of each
such Property by Lessee; (c) any real estate tax affidavit or other document
required by law to be executed and filed in order to record the applicable Deed
and/or the applicable Ground Lease termination; and (d) FIRPTA affidavits. All
of the foregoing documentation must be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Lessor. The applicable Property shall be conveyed to Lessee
"AS-IS, WHERE-IS" and in then present physical condition.

          If any Property is the subject of remediation efforts respecting
Hazardous Substances at the Expiration Date which could materially and adversely
impact the Fair Market Sales Value of such Property (with materiality determined
in Lessor's discretion), then Lessee shall be obligated to purchase each such
Property pursuant to Section 20.2.

          On the Expiration Date and/or any Payment Date on which Lessee has
elected to exercise its Purchase Option, Lessee shall pay (or cause to be paid)
to Lessor, the Agent and all other parties, as appropriate, the sum of all costs
and expenses incurred by any such party in connection with the election by
Lessee to exercise its Purchase Option and all Rent and all other amounts then
due and payable or accrued under this Lease and/or any other Operative
Agreement.

     29. The following is hereby added as Section 28.2 of the Lease:

     28.2 Incorporation of Covenants.

          Reference is made to the Lessee Credit Agreement and the
representations and warranties of Lessee contained in Article III of the Lessee
Credit Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the "Incorporated Representations
and Warranties") and the covenants contained in Articles V and VI of the Lessee
Credit Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the "Incorporated Covenants").
Lessee agrees with Lessor that the Incorporated Representations and Warranties
and the Incorporated Covenants (and all other relevant provisions of the Lessee
Credit Agreement related thereto, including without limitation the defined terms
contained in Section 1.01 thereof which are used in the Incorporated
Representations and Warranties and the Incorporated Covenants, hereinafter
referred to as the "Additional Incorporated Terms") are

                                       15

<PAGE>

hereby incorporated by reference into this Lease to the same extent and with the
same effect as if set forth fully herein and shall inure to the benefit of
Lessor, without giving effect to any waiver, amendment, modification or
replacement of the Lessee Credit Agreement or any term or provision of the
Incorporated Representations and Warranties or the Incorporated Covenants
occurring subsequent to the date of this Lease, except to the extent otherwise
specifically provided in the following provisions of this paragraph. In the
event a waiver is granted under the Lessee Credit Agreement or an amendment or
modification is executed with respect to the Lessee Credit Agreement, and such
waiver, amendment and/or modification affects the Incorporated Representations
and Warranties, the Incorporated Covenants or the Additional Incorporated Terms,
then such waiver, amendment or modification shall be effective with respect to
the Incorporated Representations and Warranties, the Incorporated Covenants and
the Additional Incorporated Terms as incorporated by reference into this Lease
only if consented to in writing by the Agent (acting upon the direction of the
Majority Secured Parties). In the event of any replacement of the Lessee Credit
Agreement with a similar credit facility (the "New Facility") the
representations and warranties, covenants and additional terms contained in the
New Facility which correspond to the representations and warranties, covenants
contained in Article III and Articles V and VI, respectively, and such
additional terms (each of the foregoing contained in the Lessee Credit
Agreement) shall become the Incorporated Representations and Warranties, the
Incorporated Covenants and the Additional Incorporated Terms only if consented
to in writing by the Agent (acting upon the direction of the Majority Secured
Parties) and, if such consent is not granted or if the Lessee Credit Agreement
is terminated and not replaced, then the representations and warranties and
covenants contained in Article III and Articles V and VI, respectively, and such
additional terms (each of the foregoing contained in the Lessee Credit Agreement
(together with any modifications or amendments approved in accordance with this
paragraph)) shall continue to be the Incorporated Representations and
Warranties, the Incorporated Covenants and the Additional Incorporated Terms
hereunder.
