Dear Jerry:

As you know, US Airways, Inc. (the "Company") is implementing a financial
restructuring designed to significantly reduce its operating costs (the "2002
Restructuring Program"). Part of the 2002 Restructuring Program involves changes
in the compensation and benefits programs of all employees, including officers.
Specifically, pursuant to this 2002 Restructuring Program:

1.   your salary will be reduced by 17%;

2.   your vacation time will be reduced by one week during the first year of the
     program and will be capped at a maximum of 5 weeks thereafter;

3.   annual sick leave accrual will be reduced from 12 to 11 days by eliminating
     the accrual for August;

4.   US Airways health plan coverage will be changed to one national medical PPO
     and dental plan and your contribution rate for such plans will be
     established by the Company and may be increased from time to time;

5.   you will not receive any future payments with respect to the Incentive
     Compensation Plan for fiscal years 2002 and 2003;

6.   you will not receive any payments pursuant to the Long Term Incentive Plan
     for performance periods ending with fiscal years 2002 and 2003; and

7.   your split dollar life insurance benefit, long term disability benefit and
     supplemental retirement arrangement will be based upon your salary of
     record immediately prior to the reduction of your salary.
