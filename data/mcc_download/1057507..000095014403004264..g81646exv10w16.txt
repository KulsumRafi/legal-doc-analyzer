Second Amendment and to amend the Credit Agreement in the manner provided
herein, each of the Credit Parties hereby represents to the Agent and the
Lenders that the following statements are true, correct and complete:

            A. CORPORATE POWER AND AUTHORITY. Each of the Credit Parties has all
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Second Amendment and
to carry out the transactions contemplated by, and perform its obligations
under, the Credit Agreement as amended by this Second Amendment (the "Amended
Agreement").

            B. AUTHORIZATION OF AGREEMENTS. The execution and delivery of this
Second Amendment and the performance of the Amended Agreement by the Credit
Parties have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part
of the Credit Parties, as applicable.

            C. NO CONFLICT. Neither the execution and delivery of this Second
Amendment, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, nor
performance of and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof by such
Credit Party will (a) violate or conflict with any provision of its articles or
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational or governing
documents of such

                                       5
<PAGE>
Credit Party, (b) violate, contravene or materially conflict with any
Requirement of Law or any other law, regulation (including, without limitation,
Regulation U or Regulation X), order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or
permit applicable to it, (c) violate, contravene or conflict with contractual
provisions of, or cause an event of default under, any Material Agreement to
which it is a party or by which it may be bound, or (d) result in or require the
creation of any Lien (other than those contemplated in or created in connection
with the Credit Documents) upon or with respect to its properties.

            D. GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS. The execution and delivery by the Credit
Parties of this Second Amendment and all other operative documents being
delivered in connection herewith and the performance by the Credit Parties of
the Credit Party Obligations under the Amended Agreement do not and will not
require any registration with, consent or approval of, or notice to, or other
action to, with or by, any Governmental Authority.

            E. BINDING OBLIGATION. This Second Amendment has been duly executed
and delivered by each of the Credit Parties, and the Second Amendment and the
Amended Agreement will be legally valid and binding obligations of the Credit
Parties, enforceable against the Credit Parties, in accordance with their
respective terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or limiting creditors'
rights generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability.

            F. GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION; SECURITIES ACTIVITIES. Neither the
making of the Loans pursuant to the Amended Agreement nor the granting of a
security interest in any Collateral pursuant to the Collateral Documents
violates Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System. It is not necessary in connection with the execution and delivery of the
Amended Agreement to register the Loans under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or to qualify any indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended.

            G. INCORPORATION OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES FROM CREDIT
AGREEMENT. The representations and warranties contained in this Second Amendment
and Section 6 of the Credit Agreement are and will be true, correct and complete
in all material respects on and as of the Second Amendment Effective Date to the
same extent as though made on and as of that date, except to the extent such
representations and warranties specifically relate to an earlier date, in which
case they were true, correct and complete in all material respects on and as of
such earlier date.

            H. ABSENCE OF DEFAULT. No event has occurred and is continuing or
will result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Second Amendment that would constitute an Event of Default or a default which,
with the giving of notice or passage of time, or both, would constitute an Event
of Default.

            I. THIRD MODIFICATION AGREEMENT. The Borrower has delivered to the
Agent a true and correct copy of the Third Modification Agreement dated as of
even date herewith (the "Third Modification Agreement") by and among the
Borrower, the Guarantors (as defined therein) and the Noteholders. The Third
Modification Agreement is in full force and effect and all conditions precedent
to its effectiveness have been satisfied in full or otherwise complied with by
the Borrower and the Guarantors. Other than as expressly set forth in the Third
Modification Agreement, (i) there are no other agreements or understandings
between the Borrower and any Guarantors and the Noteholders with respect to the
Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreement and (ii) no defaults or events of default
exist or will exist thereunder immediately after giving effect to the Third
Modification Agreement and this Agreement. The financial covenants set forth in
the Senior Note Documents, after giving effect to the Third Modification
Agreement, are not more restrictive than the financial covenants set forth in
Section 7.11 of the Credit Agreement.

AGREEMENT. The Borrower and the Guarantors shall have performed and complied
with all agreements and conditions contained in this Agreement and the Third

such parties on or prior to, and such performance and compliance shall remain in
effect on, the Second Amendment Effective Date.

"Guarantied Obligations" and "Secured Obligations," as the case may be (in each
case as such terms are defined in the applicable Credit Document), including
without limitation the payment and performance of all such "Credit Party
Obligations", "Guarantied Obligations" or "Secured Obligations," as the case may
be, now or hereafter existing under or in respect of the Amended Agreement.

            Each Credit Party acknowledges and agrees that any of the Credit
Documents to which it is a party or otherwise bound shall continue in full force
and effect and that all of its obligations thereunder shall be valid and
enforceable and shall not be impaired or limited by the execution or
effectiveness of this Second Amendment.

            Each Credit Party (other than the Borrower) acknowledges and agrees
that (i) notwithstanding the conditions to effectiveness set forth in this
Second Amendment, such Credit Party is not required by the terms of the Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document to consent to the amendments to the
Credit Agreement effected pursuant to this Second Amendment and (ii) nothing in
the Credit Agreement, this Second Amendment or any other Credit Document shall
be deemed to require the consent of such Credit Party to any future amendments
to the Credit Agreement.

            SECTION 5. MISCELLANEOUS

            A. REFERENCE TO AND EFFECT ON THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER
CREDIT DOCUMENTS.

            (i) On and after the Second Amendment Effective Date, each reference
            in the Credit Agreement to "this Agreement", "hereunder", "hereof",
            "herein" or words of like import referring to the Credit Agreement,
            and each reference in the other Credit Documents to the "Credit
            Agreement", "thereunder", "thereof" or words of like import
            referring to the Credit Agreement shall mean and be a reference to
            the Amended Agreement.

            (ii) Except as specifically amended by this Second Amendment, the
            Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall remain in full
            force and effect and are hereby ratified and confirmed.

            (iii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Second
            Amendment shall not, except as expressly provided herein, constitute
            a waiver of any provision of, or operate as a waiver of any right,
            power or remedy of the Agent or any Lender under, the Credit
            Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents.

            (iv) This Second Amendment shall constitute a Credit Document. Any
            failure to comply with the covenants contained herein within the
            time periods applicable thereto, including the payment obligations
            contained in Sections 2C and 2F, shall entitle the Agent to declare
            an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement.

            B. FEES AND EXPENSES. The Borrower acknowledges that all costs, fees
and expenses as described in Section 11.5 of the Credit Agreement incurred by
the Agent and its counsel with respect to this Second Amendment and the
documents and transactions contemplated hereby shall be for the account of the
Borrower. The foregoing shall not be construed to diminish or limit the
obligations of the Borrower set forth in Section 11.5 of the Credit Agreement.

            C. HEADINGS. Section and subsection headings in this Second
Amendment are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not
constitute a part of this Second Amendment for any other purpose or be given any
substantive effect.

            D. APPLICABLE LAW. THIS SECOND AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE
CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK).

            E. COUNTERPARTS; EFFECTIVENESS. This Second Amendment may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one
and the same instrument; signature pages may be detached from multiple separate
counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature pages
are physically attached to the same document. This Second Amendment shall become
effective (other than Section 1 hereof, which shall only become effective upon
the satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in Section 2 hereof) upon
(i) the execution of a counterpart hereof by the Borrower, each of the Lenders
comprising the percentage of Lenders specifically required pursuant to Section
11.6 of the Credit Agreement and each of the Credit Parties, and (ii) receipt by
the Borrower and the Agent of written or telephonic notification of such
execution and authorization of delivery thereof.

            F. RELEASE. Each of the Borrower and the Guarantors releases the
Agent, the Lenders, and the Agent's and the Lenders' respective officers,
employees, representatives, agents, managers, counsel, and directors from any
and all actions, causes of action, claims, demands, damages and liabilities of
whatever kind or nature, in law or equity, now known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected to the extent that any of the foregoing arises from any action or
failure to act on or prior to the date hereof.
