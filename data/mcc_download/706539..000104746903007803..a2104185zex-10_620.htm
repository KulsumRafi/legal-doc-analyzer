<P><FONT SIZE=2>Mr.&nbsp;Craig
Wheeler<BR>
79 Worcester Island Road<BR>
Wolfeboro, NH 03894 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>We
are pleased to confirm the revised terms of our offer to you to become the President of Biopharmaceuticals and Vice President Chiron Corporation, reporting to me. Your starting salary will be
$435,000 per annum to be reviewed annually beginning with the regular executive officer review occurring in February&nbsp;2003. You will be eligible to participate in Chiron's Annual Incentive Plan
(AIP) program. The results of the company, the BioPharmaceuticals division, and your personal performance during the calendar year determine awards under this program. You will be eligible for an AIP
award of between 0 and 120% of your base salary actually paid in the performance year, with a target of 60% of salary. Annual incentive plan payments and merit increases to base salary are effective
annually in March. We will guarantee a minimum AIP award of $135,000 for 2001, to be paid in March&nbsp;2002, and at least target (60% of base) for performance year 2002, payable in
March&nbsp;2003. You will receive a hiring award of $85,000 upon initiation of your employment with Chiron. This award will be in your first paycheck. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>You
will be eligible to participate in our stock option program. Subject to the approval of the Board of Directors, we will award a ten-year stock option to you to purchase 200,000 shares
of Chiron common stock. The option vests fully over a four-year period, with the first 25% of the shares vesting at the
one-year grant anniversary. The remaining shares vest on a pro-rated monthly basis over the remaining three years of the vesting period. The exercise price of the option will
be set at the fair market value (as defined in the Option Plan) of a share of Chiron stock on the date the option is approved. We expect the grant to be approved and effective by the end of the month
in which your employment begins. You will be also be awarded a stock option to purchase 23,000 shares under Chiron's Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for the performance year 2001. Details of the terms
of the plan are covered in the LTIP document. In addition you will be eligible to receive annual performance grants of stock options, with the current target award for your position being 50,000
shares, also vesting over four years. Also subject to the approval of the Board, we will award you a restricted share right grant for Chiron shares equivalent to $450,000 on the day the award is made.
The share rights vest fully over a four-year period with 25% of the grant vesting at each anniversary of the grant. The date of grant will be your first day of employment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>In
addition to normal relocation benefits, we will make available to you a loan of $750,000 for the purchase of a home in the Bay Area. The loan will be interest free and will be forgiven at the end
of 7&nbsp;years of service. The loan will be secured by a Second Deed of Trust on your new primary residence. In the event you leave Chiron Corporation voluntarily the loan is repayable within
90&nbsp;days of your last day of employment. Any taxes that arise from the loan will be your responsibility. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>You
will be covered by Chiron's Executive Change in Control and Severance Program, which provides a benefit of 2&nbsp;years salary and bonus in the case of a qualifying event. If you qualify for
benefits under that plan any outstanding loan amounts would be forgiven. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
information sheets following your offer letter contain some of the highlights of Chiron's benefits programs. You should note that, while this offer is being made under the terms of our current
benefits and compensation programs, changes do occur from time to time and any system-wide changes that occur will apply to you as well. Some of the benefit programs are effective
immediately upon your employment, while others are dependent upon established enrollment periods. Your group medical insurance benefits generally start on the first day of the month following your
date of hire. If, however, your date of hire is the first business day of the month, your coverage becomes effective on that date. Note also that, with few exceptions, Chiron extends benefits coverage
to qualified family members. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>As
a part of Chiron's routine medical surveillance program, employees with certain project assignments may be advised to provide a baseline blood sample for archival storage. The Chiron Occupational
Health Department will notify you if a baseline blood draw is recommended. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>This
offer is contingent upon your ability, as required by federal law, to establish your employment eligibility as a U.S. citizen, a U.S. lawful permanent resident, or an individual specifically
authorized for employment in the U.S. by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Under
California law, employment with Chiron is not for any specified term and can be terminated at any time for any reason by you or Chiron. Any contrary representations that have been made or may be
made to you are superseded by this offer. When you accept the offer, the terms described in this letter and the Chiron Employee Invention and Confidential Information Agreement shall constitute the
terms of your employment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>I
am looking forward to you joining Chiron on August&nbsp;31, 2001. I believe you will make an excellent contribution as President of BioPharmaceuticals and as a key member of the Executive
Committee. Please feel free to call Linda Short, Vice President Corporate Resources, if you have any questions. I look forward to talking to you. </FONT></P>
