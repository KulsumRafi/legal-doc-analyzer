effective without the written approval of the Company, which may be withheld to the extent that its exercise, either individually or in the aggregate together with the exercise of other previously exercised stock options and/or offers and sales
pursuant to any prior or contemplated offering of securities, would, in the sole and absolute judgment of the Company, require the filing of a registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or with the securities
commission of any state. The Company shall avail itself of any exemptions from registration contained in applicable TAX and securities laws which, in its sole and absolute discretion, it deems reasonable and not unduly burdensome or costly. The
Optionee shall deliver to the Company, prior to the exercise of the Option, such information, representations and warranties as the Company may request in order for the Company to be able to satisfy itself that the Common Stock to be acquired
pursuant to the exercise of the Option is being acquired in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the securities registration requirements of applicable securities laws.</font></p> <br><p
