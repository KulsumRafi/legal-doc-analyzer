<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Bank may enforce
this Guaranty independently as to Guarantor and independently of any other remedy or
security the Bank at any time may have or hold in connection with the Guarantied
Obligations. Guarantor expressly waives any right to require the Bank to marshal assets in
favor of Guarantor, and agrees that the Bank may proceed against Borrower, or upon or
against any security or remedy, before proceeding to enforce this Guaranty, in such order
as it shall determine in its sole and absolute discretion. The Bank may file a separate
action or actions against Borrower and/or Guarantor without respect to whether action is
brought or prosecuted with respect to any security or against any other Person, or whether
any other Person is joined in any such action or actions. Guarantor agrees that the Bank,
Borrower and any affiliates of Borrower or Borrower may deal with each other in connection
with the Guarantied Obligations or otherwise, or alter any contracts or agreements now or
hereafter existing between any of them, in any manner whatsoever, all without in any way
altering or affecting the security of this Guaranty. The Bank&#146;s rights hereunder
shall be reinstated and revived, and the enforceability of this Guaranty shall continue,
with respect to any amount at any time paid on account of the Guarantied Obligations which
thereafter shall be required to be restored or returned by the Bank upon the bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization of Borrower or any other Person, or otherwise, all as though
such amount had not been paid. The rights of the Bank created or granted herein and the
enforceability of this Guaranty with respect to Guarantor at all times shall remain
effective to guaranty the full amount of all the Guarantied Obligations even though the
Guarantied Obligations, or any part thereof, or any security or guaranty therefor, may be
or hereafter may become invalid or otherwise unenforceable as against Borrower or any
other guarantor or surety and whether or not Borrower shall have any personal liability
with respect thereto. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Guarantor expressly waives
any and all defenses now or hereafter arising or asserted by reason of (a)&nbsp;any
disability or other defense of Borrower with respect to the Guarantied Obligations,
(b)&nbsp;the unenforceability or invalidity of any security or guaranty for the Guarantied
Obligations or the lack of perfection or continuing perfection or failure of priority of
any security for the Guarantied Obligations, (c)&nbsp;the cessation for any cause
whatsoever of the liability of Borrower (other than by reason of the full payment and
performance of all Guarantied Obligations), (d)&nbsp;any failure of the Bank to marshal
assets in favor of Borrower or any other Person, (e)&nbsp;except as otherwise provided in
this Guaranty, any failure of the Bank to give notice of sale or other disposition of
collateral to Guarantor or any other Person or any defect in any notice that may be given
in connection with any sale or disposition of collateral, (f)&nbsp;any failure of the Bank
to comply with applicable laws in connection with the sale or other disposition of any
collateral or other security for any Guarantied Obligation, including without limitation,
any failure of the Bank to conduct a commercially reasonable sale or other disposition of
any collateral or other security for any Guarantied Obligation, (g)&nbsp;any act or
omission of the Bank or others that directly or indirectly results in or aids the
discharge or release of Borrower or the Guarantied Obligations or any security or guaranty
therefor by operation of law or otherwise, (h)&nbsp;any law which provides that the
obligation of a surety or guarantor must neither be larger in amount nor in other respects
more burdensome than that of the principal or which reduces a surety&#146;s or
guarantor&#146;s obligation in proportion to the principal obligation, (i)&nbsp;any
failure of the Bank to file or enforce a claim in any bankruptcy or other proceeding with
respect to any Person, (j)&nbsp;the election by the Bank, in any bankruptcy proceeding of
any Person, of the application or non-application of Section&nbsp;1111(b)(2) of the United
States Bankruptcy Code, (k)&nbsp;any extension of credit or the grant of any lien under
Section&nbsp;364 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, (l)&nbsp;any use of cash collateral
under Section&nbsp;363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, (m)&nbsp;any agreement or
stipulation with respect to the provision of adequate protection in any bankruptcy
proceeding of any Person, (n)&nbsp;the avoidance of any lien in favor of the Bank for any
reason, (o)&nbsp;any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment of
debt, liquidation or dissolution proceeding commenced by or against any Person,
<U>including</U> any discharge of, or bar or stay against collecting, all or any of the
Guarantied Obligations (or any interest thereon) in or as a result of any such proceeding,
(p)&nbsp;to the extent permitted, the benefits of any form of one-action rule, or
(q)&nbsp;any action taken by the Bank that is authorized by this Section&nbsp;or any other
provision of the Loan Agreement or any Loan Document. Guarantor expressly waives all
setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance,
notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor
and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the
Guarantied Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the

          the continuance of any Event of Default, at its sole option, without notice or
          demand and without affecting any Guarantied Obligations of Guarantor, the
          enforceability of this Guaranty, or the validity or enforceability of any liens
          of the Bank on any collateral, to foreclose any or all of such deeds of trust or
          mortgages or other instruments by judicial or nonjudicial sale. Guarantor
          expressly waives any defenses to the enforcement of this Guaranty or any rights
          of the Bank created or granted hereby or to the recovery by the Bank against
          Borrower or any other Person liable therefor of any deficiency after a judicial
          or nonjudicial foreclosure or sale because all or any part of the Guarantied
          Obligations is secured by real property. This means, among other things: (1) the
          Bank may collect from any Guarantor without first foreclosing on any real or
          personal property collateral pledged by Borrower. (2) If the Bank forecloses on
          any real property collateral pledged by Borrower: (A) the amount of the
          Guarantied Obligations may be reduced only by the price for which that
          collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more
          than the sale price. (B) the Bank may collect from any Guarantor even if the
          Bank, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, has destroyed any right
          any Guarantor may have to collect from Borrower. This is an unconditional and
          irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses any Guarantor may have because all
          or any part of the Guarantied Obligations is secured by real property. Guarantor
          expressly waives any defenses or benefits that may be derived from California
          Code of Civil Procedure &sect;&sect;&nbsp;580a, 580b, 580d or 726, or comparable
          provisions of the laws of any other jurisdiction, including, without limitation,
          NRS Section 40.430 and judicial decisions relating thereto, and NRS Sections
          40.451, 40.455, 40.457 and 40.459 and all other suretyship defenses it otherwise
          might or would have under California law or other applicable law. Guarantor
          expressly waives any right to receive notice of any judicial or nonjudicial
          foreclosure or sale of any real Property or interest therein subject to any such
          deeds of trust or mortgages or other instruments and any Guarantor&#146;s or any
          other Person&#146;s failure to receive any such notice shall not impair or
          affect Guarantor&#146;s Obligations or the enforceability of this Guaranty or
          any rights of the Bank created or granted. </FONT></P>

          <U>Waiver of Rights of Subrogation</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
          elsewhere contained herein or in any other Loan Document to which Guarantor is a
          party, unless and until all Obligations have been paid and performed in full,
          Guarantor hereby expressly waives with respect to Borrower and its successors
          and assigns <U>(including</U> any surety) and any other Person which is directly
          or indirectly a creditor of Borrower or any surety for Borrower, any and all
          rights at law or in equity to subrogation, to reimbursement, to exoneration, to
          contribution, to setoff or to any other rights that could accrue to a surety
          against a principal, to a guarantor against a maker or obligor, to an
          accommodation party against the party accommodated, or to a holder or transferee
          against a maker, and which Guarantor may have or hereafter acquire against
          Borrower or any other such Person in connection with or as a result of
          Guarantor&#146;s execution, delivery and/or performance of this Guaranty or any
          other Loan Document to which Guarantor is a party. Guarantor agrees that it
          shall not have or assert any such rights against Borrower or its successors and
          assigns or any other Person (<U>including</U> any surety) which is directly or
          indirectly a creditor of Borrower or any surety for Borrower, either directly or
          as an attempted setoff to any action commenced against Guarantor by Borrower (as
          borrower or in any other capacity), the Bank or any other such Person unless and
          until all Obligations have been paid and performed in full. Guarantor hereby
          acknowledges and agrees that this waiver is intended to benefit Borrower and the
          Bank and shall not limit or otherwise affect Guarantor&#146;s liability
          hereunder, under any other Loan Document to which Guarantor is a party, or the
          enforceability hereof or thereof. </FONT></P>

          and agrees that each of the waivers and consents set forth herein are made with
          full knowledge of their significance and consequences, with the understanding
          that events giving rise to any defense or right waived may diminish, destroy or
          otherwise adversely affect rights which Guarantor otherwise may have against
          Borrower, the Bank or others, or against any collateral, and that, under the
          circumstances, the waivers and consents herein given are reasonable and not
          contrary to public policy or law. Guarantor acknowledges that it has either
          consulted with legal counsel regarding the effect of this Guaranty and the
          waivers and consents set forth herein, or has made an informed decision not to
          do so. If this Guaranty or any of the waivers or consents herein are determined
          to be unenforceable under or in violation of applicable law, this Guaranty and
          such waivers and consents shall be effective to the maximum extent permitted by

          <U>Costs and Expenses</U>. Guarantor agrees to pay to the Bank all costs and
          expenses (<U>including</U>, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#146; fees
          and disbursements) incurred by the Bank in the enforcement or attempted
          enforcement of this Guaranty, whether or not an action is filed in connection
          therewith, and in connection with any waiver or amendment of any term or
          provision hereof. All advances, charges, costs and expenses, <U>including
          </U>reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and disbursements (including the reasonably
          allocated cost of legal counsel employed by the Bank), incurred or paid by the
          Bank in exercising any right, privilege, power or remedy conferred by this
          Guaranty, or in the enforcement or attempted enforcement thereof, shall be
          subject hereto and shall become a part of the Guarantied Obligations and shall
          be paid to the Bank by Guarantor, immediately upon demand, together with
          interest thereon at the rate(s) provided for under the Loan Agreement. </FONT></P>

          <U>Liability</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere contained
          herein or in any Loan Document to which Guarantor is a party, the aggregate
          liability of Guarantor hereunder for payment and performance of the Guarantied
          Obligations shall not exceed an amount which, in the aggregate, is $1.00 less
          than that amount which if so paid or performed would constitute or result in a
          &#147;fraudulent transfer&#148;, &#147;fraudulent conveyance&#148;, or terms of
          similar import, under applicable state or federal Law, including without
          limitation, Section&nbsp;548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The liability
          of Guarantor hereunder is independent of any other guaranties at any time in
          effect with respect to all or any part of the Guarantied Obligations, and
          Guarantor&#146;s liability hereunder may be enforced regardless of the existence
          of any such guaranties. Any termination by or release of any guarantor in whole
          or in part shall not affect the continuing liability of Guarantor hereunder, and
          no notice of any such termination or release shall be required. The execution
          hereof by Guarantor is not founded upon an expectation or understanding that
          there will be any other guarantor of the Guarantied Obligations. </FONT></P>
