                          DIRECTOR COMPENSATION POLICY

         The Human Resources Committee reviews and recommends the compensation
for directors. During 2002 each of the directors who was not employed by the
Company received an annual Board retainer of $30,000, an annual committee
retainer for each committee on which the director served of $5,000 ($6,000 for
chairpersons) and a fee of $1,500 for each special Board meeting attended and
$1,000 for each special committee meeting attended. The Human Resources
Committee changed the compensation for directors for 2003 so that during 2003
each of the directors who is not employed by the Company will receive an annual
Board retainer of $30,000, an annual retainer for service on the audit committee
of $10,000 ($15,000 for chairpersons) and an annual retainer for service on any
other committee of $7,500 ($12,500 for chairpersons). No additional fees will be
paid for special meetings. Subject to stockholder approval of the Company's
Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, non-employee directors
may defer these fees into this plan until their retirement or resignation from
the Board. Three of the directors have elected to participate in this deferred
compensation plan, subject to stockholder approval of this plan.

         In addition, non-employee directors receive a grant of a non-qualified
stock option to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock under the 1997 Omnibus
Stock Option and Incentive Plan upon their election to the Board, at an exercise
price equal to the closing price on the date prior to the date of the grant,
which becomes exercisable in four equal annual installments. During 2002 each of
the directors who was not employed by the Company received an annual grant of a
non-qualified stock option to purchase 7,000 shares of common stock under the
1997 Omnibus Stock Option and Incentive Plan, at an exercise price equal to the
closing price on the date prior to the date of the grant, which is immediately
exercisable. During 2003 each of the directors who is not employed by the
Company will receive an annual grant of a non-qualified stock option to purchase
5,000 shares of common stock under the 1997 Omnibus Stock Option and Incentive
Plan, at an exercise price equal to the closing price on the date prior to the
date of the grant, which becomes exercisable on the first anniversary of the
grant.

         Directors who are employed by the Company do not receive compensation
for their service as directors. All directors are reimbursed for expenses
incurred in attending meetings.
