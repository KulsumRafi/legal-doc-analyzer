Each of the Company and the Guarantors understands that the staff of the Commission has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own
account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a "Participating Broker-Dealer"), may be
deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities and, therefore, must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of
the Securities Act in connection with any resales of the Exchange Securities received by it in the Exchange Offer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
of the Company and the Guarantors understands that it is the staff's position that if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of
distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or
specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligations under the Securities Act
in connection
with resales of Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the Securities Act. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
In light of the above, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantors agree: to cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to remain
effective for a period of 120&nbsp;days after the Offer Termination Date (or such earlier date as each Participating Broker-Dealer shall have notified the Company and the Guarantors in writing that
such Participating Broker-Dealer has resold all such Exchange Securities received in the Exchange Offer) and shall amend or supplement the Prospectus or document incorporated by reference therein, as
the case may be, contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, as would otherwise be contemplated by Section&nbsp;3(h) for such a period, and Participating Broker-Dealers shall not be
authorized by the Company and the Guarantors to deliver and shall not deliver such Prospectus after such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section&nbsp;4. </FONT></P>

If any action, suit or proceeding shall be brought against the Holders or any Person controlling the Holders in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Company and the
Guarantors, such Holders or such controlling Person shall promptly notify the parties against whom indemnification is being sought (the "indemnifying parties"), and such indemnifying parties shall
assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel and payment of all fees and expenses. Such Holders or any such controlling Person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action, suit or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Holders or such controlling Person unless
(i)&nbsp;the indemnifying parties have agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses, (ii)&nbsp;the indemnifying parties have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel, or (iii)&nbsp;the
named parties to any such action, suit or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such Holders or such controlling Person and the indemnifying parties and such Holders or such
controlling Person shall have been advised by its counsel that representation of such indemnified party and any indemnifying party by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards
of professional conduct (whether or not such representation by the same counsel has been proposed) due to actual or potential differing interests between them (in which case the indemnifying party
shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action, suit or proceeding on behalf of such Holders or such controlling Person). It is understood, however, that the indemnifying parties shall,
in connection with any one such action, suit or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions, suits or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general
allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of only one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for such Holders and controlling
Persons not having actual or potential differing interests with such Holder or among themselves, which firm shall be designated in writing by Deutsche Bank Securities&nbsp;Inc., and that all such
fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. The indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action, suit or proceeding effected without their written
consent, but if settled with such written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, suit or proceeding, the indemnifying parties agree to indemnify and hold
harmless any Holders, to the extent provided in the preceding paragraph, and any such controlling Person from and against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or

Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Company, the Guarantors, each of their respective directors and officers, and any Person who
controls the Company or any of the Guarantors within the meaning of Section&nbsp;15 of the Securities Act or Section&nbsp;20(a) of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity
from the Company and the Guarantors to each Holder, but only with respect to the Holders' Information. If any action, suit or proceeding shall be brought against the Company, any of the Guarantors,
any of their respective directors or officers, or any such controlling Persons based on any Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
thereto), and in respect of
which indemnity may be sought against any Holder pursuant to this paragraph&nbsp;(c), such Holder shall have the rights and duties given to the Company and the Guarantors by paragraph&nbsp;(b)
above (except that if the Company and the Guarantors shall have assumed the defense thereof such Holder shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at such Holder's expense), and the Company, the Guarantors, their respective directors and officers, and any such controlling
Persons shall have the rights and duties given to the Holders by paragraph&nbsp;(b) above. The foregoing indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which any Holders may otherwise

If the indemnification provided for in this Section&nbsp;5 is unavailable or insufficient to hold an indemnified party under paragraphs (a)&nbsp;or (c)&nbsp;hereof harmless in
respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then an indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or

and the Guarantors on the one hand, the Holders on another hand, and the Initial Purchasers on another hand, from the offering of the Securities or (ii)&nbsp;if the allocation provided by
clause&nbsp;(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause&nbsp;(i) above but also the relative
fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand, the Holders on another hand, and the Initial Purchasers on another hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors from the offering of the
Securities included in any Registration Statement shall in each case be deemed to include the proceeds received by the Company in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement. The parties hereto agree that any underwriting discount or commission or reimbursement of fees paid to the Initial Purchasers pursuant to the Purchase Agreement shall not be deemed
to be a benefit received by the Initial Purchasers in connection with the offering of the Securities included in any Registration Statement. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the
one hand, the Holders on another hand, and the Initial Purchasers on another hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand, by the Holders on another hand, and the Initial
Purchasers on another hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. </FONT></P>

of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to in paragraph&nbsp;(d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section&nbsp;5, no Holder shall be
