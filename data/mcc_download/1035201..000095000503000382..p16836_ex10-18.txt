                             BUSINESS LOAN AGREEMENT


         This  Agreement  dated as of  February  28,  2003,  is between  Bank of
America,   N.A.  (the  "Bank")  and  California   Water  Service   Company  (the
"Borrower").

1.       FACILITY NO. 1: LINE OF CREDIT AMOUNT AND TERMS

1.1      Line of Credit Amount.

(a)      During the availability period described below, the Bank will provide a
         line of credit to the  Borrower.  The amount of the line of credit (the
         "Facility No. 1  Commitment")  is the amount  indicated for each period
         set forth below:

                Period                                      Commitment Amount
                ------                                      -----------------
                From the date of this Agreement
                through June 30, 2003                          $55,000,000

                On July 1, 2003 and
                thereafter                                     $45,000,000

(b)      This is a revolving line of credit. During the availability period, the
         Borrower may repay principal amounts and reborrow them.

(1)

(2)      (c) The Borrower agrees not to permit the principal balance outstanding
         to exceed the Facility No. 1 Commitment.  If the Borrower  exceeds this
         limit,  the Borrower will  immediately  pay the excess to the Bank upon
         the Bank's demand.


1.2      Availability  Period.  The line of credit is available between the date
of this  Agreement and April 30, 2005, or such earlier date as the  availability
may  terminate as provided in this  Agreement  (the  "Facility  No. 1 Expiration
Date").

1.3      Repayment Terms.

(a)      The  Borrower  will pay  interest  on March 31,  2003 and then  monthly
         thereafter  until  payment in full of any principal  outstanding  under
         this line of credit.  Any interest period for an optional interest rate
         (as  described  below)  shall  expire no later than the  Facility No. 1
         Expiration Date.

(b)      The Borrower will repay in full all  principal and any unpaid  interest
         or other  charges  outstanding  under this line of credit no later than
         the Facility No. 1 Expiration Date.

1.4      Interest Rate.

(a)      The  interest  rate is a rate per year equal to the  Bank's  Prime Rate
         minus the Applicable Margin (as defined below).

(b)      The Prime Rate is the rate of interest publicly  announced from time to
         time by the Bank as its Prime  Rate.  The Prime Rate is set by the Bank
         based on  various  factors,  including  the  Bank's  costs and  desired
         return, general economic conditions and other factors, and is used as a
         reference point for pricing some loans. The

                                      205
<PAGE>

         Bank may price loans to its  customers  at,  above,  or below the Prime
         Rate.  Any change in the Prime Rate shall take effect at the opening of
         business on the day specified in the public announcement of a change in
         the Bank's Prime Rate.

1.5      Optional Interest Rates. Instead of the interest rate based on the rate
         stated in the paragraph  entitled  "Interest Rate" above,  the Borrower
         may elect the optional  interest  rates listed below for this  Facility
         No. 1 during  interest  periods agreed to by the Bank and the Borrower.
         The  optional  interest  rates  shall  be  subject  to  the  terms  and
         conditions  described  later in this  Agreement.  Any principal  amount
         bearing  interest at an optional rate under this  Agreement is referred
         to as a "Portion." The following optional interest rates are available:

(a)      The LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin as defined below.

1.6      Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margin shall be the following amounts
per annum,  based upon the Debt to  Capitalization  Ratio (as defined  below) as
calculated on a consolidated  basis from  California  Water Service Group's most
recent  financial  statements  received by the Bank as required in the Covenants
section;  provided,  however,  that until the Bank receives the first  financial
statement,  such amounts shall be those  indicated for pricing level 2 set forth
below:


                                                   Applicable Margin
 Pricing                                  (in percentage points per annum)
  Level          Ratio                     Prime Rate -            LIBOR Rate +
---------- --------------------------- ------------------ ---------------------
   1       less than 0.50:1.00               0.75                     1.00
   2       equal to or greater than          0.50                     1.25
           0.50:1.00 and
           less than 0.60:1.00
   3       equal to or greater than          0.25                     1.50
           0.60:1.00


"Debt to Capitalization  Ratio" means the ratio of Funded Debt to the sum of Net
Worth plus Funded Debt.  "Funded  Debt" means all  outstanding  liabilities  for
borrowed  money and  other  interest-bearing  liabilities  of  California  Water
Service Group, including current and long-term debt. "Net Worth" means the value
of California  Water  Service  Group's total assets  (including  leaseholds  and
leasehold  improvements and reserves against assets) less its total liabilities,
including but not limited to accrued and deferred income taxes.

The Applicable Margin shall be in effect from the date the most recent financial
statement is received by the Bank until the date the next financial statement is
received;  provided,  however,  that if the Borrower fails to timely deliver the
next financial  statement,  the  Applicable  Margin from the date such financial
statement  was due until the date such  financial  statement  is received by the
Bank shall be the highest pricing level set forth above.

1.7      Letters of Credit.  This line of credit may be used for financing:

(a)      standby  letters of credit with a maximum  maturity of 365 days but not
         to extend more than 180 days beyond the Facility No. 1 Expiration Date.
         The standby  letters of credit may include a provision  providing  that
         the  maturity  date  will be  automatically  extended  each year for an
         additional year unless the Bank gives written notice to the contrary.

(l)      The  amount  of the  letters  of  credit  outstanding  at any one  time
         (including the drawn and unreimbursed amounts of the letters of credit)
         may not exceed Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000).

(c)      In calculating the principal amount  outstanding under the Facility No.
         1 Commitment,  the calculation  shall include the amount of any letters
         of credit outstanding, including amounts drawn on any letters of credit
         and not yet reimbursed.

(d)      The following  letters of credit are outstanding  from the Bank for the
         account of the Borrower:

                                      206
<PAGE>

                           Letter of Credit Number              Amount
                           -----------------------              ------

                           3049659                           $1,039,396
                           3052866                           $5,047,227

As of the date of this Agreement,  these letters of credit shall be deemed to be
outstanding  under  this  Agreement  and shall be  subject  to all the terms and
conditions stated in this Agreement.

(e)      The Borrower agrees:

         (i)      Any sum drawn  under a letter of credit  may, at the option of
                  the Bank, be added to the principal amount  outstanding  under
                  this  Agreement.  The amount will bear  interest and be due as
                  described elsewhere in this Agreement.

         (ii)     if there is a default  under this  Agreement,  to  immediately
                  prepay and make the Bank whole for any outstanding  letters of
                  credit.

         (iii)    the  issuance of any letter of credit and any  amendment  to a
                  letter of credit is subject to the Bank's written approval and
                  must be in form and  content  satisfactory  to the Bank and in
                  favor of a beneficiary acceptable to the Bank.

         (iv)     to  sign  the  Bank's  form   Application  and  Agreement  for
                  Commercial  Letter of Credit or Application  and Agreement for
                  Standby Letter of Credit, as applicable.

         (v)      to pay any issuance  and/or other fees that the Bank  notifies
                  the  Borrower  will be  charged  for  issuing  and  processing
                  letters of credit for the Borrower.

         (vi)     to allow the Bank to automatically charge its checking account
                  for applicable fees, discounts, and other charges.

2.       OPTIONAL INTEREST RATES

2.1      Optional  Rates.  Each  optional  interest  rate  is a rate  per  year.
Interest will be paid on the last day of each month during the interest  period.
At the end of any interest  period,  the  interest  rate will revert to the rate
stated in the paragraph(s)  entitled "Interest Rate" above,  unless the Borrower
has designated  another optional interest rate for the Portion.  No Portion will
be converted to a different interest rate during the applicable interest period.
Upon the  occurrence of an event of default under this  Agreement,  the Bank may
terminate  the  availability  of optional  interest  rates for interest  periods
commencing after the default occurs.

2.2      LIBOR  Rate.  The  election  of LIBOR  Rates  shall be  subject  to the
following terms and requirements:

(a)      The interest  period during which the LIBOR Rate will be in effect will
         be one or two weeks, or one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
         nine,  ten,  eleven,  or twelve  months.  The first day of the interest
         period  must be a day other  than a  Saturday  or a Sunday on which the
         Bank is open for  business  in New  York  and  London  and  dealing  in
         offshore  dollars (a "LIBOR Banking Day"). The last day of the interest
         period and the actual number of days during the interest period will be
         determined  by the Bank using the  practices  of the London  inter-bank
         market.

(b)      Each LIBOR Rate Portion will be for an amount not less than One Hundred
         Thousand Dollars ($100,000).

(c)      The "LIBOR Rate" means the interest  rate  determined  by the following
         formula,  rounded  upward to the  nearest  1/100 of one  percent.  (All
         amounts in the  calculation  will be  determined  by the Bank as of the
         first day of the interest period.)

                   LIBOR Rate =         London Inter-Bank Offered Rate
                                        ------------------------------
                                         (1.00 - Reserve Percentage)

                                      207
<PAGE>

         Where,

         (i)      "London  Inter-Bank  Offered Rate" means the average per annum
                  interest rate at which U.S.  dollar  deposits would be offered
                  for the  applicable  interest  period  by  major  banks in the
                  London  inter-bank  market, as shown on the Telerate Page 3750
                  (or any successor  page) at  approximately  11:00 a.m.  London
                  time two (2) London  Banking Days before the  commencement  of
                  the  interest  period.  If such  rate  does not  appear on the
                  Telerate Page 3750 (or any successor  page), the rate for that
                  interest period will be determined by such alternate method as
                  reasonably  selected by the Bank. A "London  Banking Day" is a
                  day on which  the  Bank's  London  Banking  Center is open for
                  business and dealing in offshore dollars.

         (ii)     "Reserve  Percentage"  means the total of the maximum  reserve
                  percentages  for  determining the reserves to be maintained by
                  member banks of the Federal  Reserve  System for  Eurocurrency
                  Liabilities, as defined in Federal Reserve Board Regulation D,
                  rounded  upward  to the  nearest  1/100  of one  percent.  The
                  percentage  will be expressed as a decimal,  and will include,
                  but not be  limited  to,  marginal,  emergency,  supplemental,
                  special, and other reserve percentages.

(d)      The Borrower  shall  irrevocably  request a LIBOR Rate Portion no later
         than 12:00 noon Pacific time on the LIBOR Banking Day preceding the day
         on which the London  Inter-Bank  Offered Rate will be set, as specified
         above.  For example,  if there are no  intervening  holidays or weekend
         days in any of the  relevant  locations,  the  request  must be made at
         least three days before the LIBOR Rate takes effect.

(e)      The Borrower  may not elect a LIBOR Rate with respect to any  principal
         amount  which is  scheduled  to be  repaid  before  the last day of the
         applicable interest period.

(f)      The Bank will have no obligation to accept an election for a LIBOR Rate
         Portion if any of the  following  described  events has occurred and is
         continuing:

         (i)      Dollar deposits in the principal amount, and for periods equal
                  to the  interest  period,  of a  LIBOR  Rate  Portion  are not
                  available in the London inter-bank market; or

         (ii)     the LIBOR Rate does not accurately reflect the cost of a LIBOR
                  Rate Portion.

(g)      Each prepayment of a LIBOR Rate Portion,  whether voluntary,  by reason
         of  acceleration  or otherwise,  will be  accompanied  by the amount of
         accrued  interest  on  the  amount  prepaid  and a  prepayment  fee  as
         described  below.  A  "prepayment"  is a payment of an amount on a date
         earlier than the scheduled  payment date for such amount as required by
         this Agreement.

(i)      The prepayment  fee shall be in an amount  sufficient to compensate the
         Bank for any loss,  cost or expense  incurred  by it as a result of the
         prepayment,  including any loss of anticipated  profits and any loss or
         expense  arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained
         by it to maintain  such Portion or from fees  payable to terminate  the
         deposits from which such funds were  obtained.  The Borrower shall also
         pay any customary administrative fees charged by the Bank in connection
         with the foregoing.  For purposes of this paragraph,  the Bank shall be
         deemed to have  funded  each  Portion  by a  matching  deposit or other
         borrowing  in the  applicable  interbank  market,  whether  or not such
         Portion was in fact so funded. 3. FEES AND EXPENSES

3.1      Fees.

(a)      Late Fee. To the extent  permitted by law, the Borrower agrees to pay a
         late fee in an amount not to exceed  four  percent  (4%) of any payment
         that is more than fifteen (15) days late. The imposition and payment of
         a late fee shall not  constitute  a waiver of the  Bank's  rights  with
         respect to the default.

                                      208
<PAGE>

(b)      Unused  Commitment  Fee.  The  Borrower  agrees  to  pay a fee  on  any
         difference  between the  Facility  No. 1  Commitment  and the amount of
         credit it actually uses,  determined by the average of the daily amount
         of credit  outstanding  during the  specified  period.  The fee will be
         calculated at the following percentage points per annum, based upon the
         Debt to Capitalization  Ratio (as defined in Paragraph 1.6 above).  The
         calculation of credit  outstanding  shall include the undrawn amount of
         letters of credit. The Debt to Capitalization  Ratio will be calculated
         in the manner described in Paragraph 1.6; provided, however, that until
         the  Bank  receives  the  first  financial  statement,  the fee will be
         calculated at the percentage points indicated for fee level 2 set forth
         below:



                                                        Applicable Fee
   Fee Level           Ratio                    (in percentage points per annum)
-------------- ------------------------------- ---------------------------------
       1           Less than 0.50:1.00                      .125
       2           Equal to or greater than                 .250
                   0.50:1.00 and
                   less than 0.60:1.00
       3           Equal to or greater than                 .375
                   0.60:1.00


         This  fee is due on  April  1,  2003,  and  on the  first  day of  each
         following quarter until the expiration of the availability period.

         The  Applicable  Fee shall be in effect  from the date the most  recent
         financial  statement  is  received  by the Bank until the date the next
         financial  statement  is  received;  provided,  however,  that  if  the
         Borrower  fails to timely  deliver the next  financial  statement,  the
         Applicable Fee from the date such financial statement was due until the
         date such  financial  statement  is  received  by the Bank shall be the
         highest fee level set forth above.

3.2      Expenses.  The  Borrower  agrees  to  immediately  repay  the  Bank for
expenses  that  include,  but are not limited to,  filing,  recording and search
fees, appraisal fees, title report fees, and documentation fees.

3.3      Reimbursement  Costs. The Borrower agrees to reimburse the Bank for any
expenses it incurs in the  preparation  of this  Agreement  and any agreement or
instrument required by this Agreement. Expenses include, but are not limited to,
reasonable attorneys' fees, including any allocated costs of the Bank's in-house
counsel to the extent permitted by applicable law.

4.       DISBURSEMENTS, PAYMENTS AND COSTS

4.1      Disbursements and Payments.

(a)      Each  payment by the  Borrower  will be made in  immediately  available

(b)      Each  disbursement by the Bank and each payment by the Borrower will be
         evidenced  by records kept by the Bank.  In addition,  the Bank may, at

         notes.

4.2      Telephone and Telefax Authorization.

(a)      The Bank may honor  telephone or telefax  instructions  for advances or
         repayments  or for the  designation  of  optional  interest  rates  and
         telefax  requests  for the  issuance  of  letters of credit  given,  or
         purported to be

                                      209
<PAGE>

         given, by any one of the individuals authorized to sign loan agreements
         on behalf of the Borrower,  or any other  individual  designated by any
         one of such authorized signers.

(b)      Advances  will be deposited in and  repayments  will be withdrawn  from
         account number 14872-00230 owned by the Borrower,  or such other of the
         Borrower's  accounts  with the Bank as  designated  in  writing  by the
         Borrower.

(c)      The  Borrower  will  indemnify  and  hold the  Bank  harmless  from all
         liability,  loss,  and costs in connection  with any act resulting from
         telephone or telefax instructions the Bank reasonably believes are made
         by any individual authorized by the Borrower to give such instructions.
         This  paragraph  will survive this  Agreement's  termination,  and will
         benefit the Bank and its officers, employees, and agents.

4.3      Direct Debit (Pre-Billing).

(a)      The Borrower  agrees that the Bank will debit  deposit  account  number

         accounts  with the Bank as  designated  in writing by the Borrower (the
         "Designated  Account")  on the  date  each  payment  of  principal  and
         interest and any fees from the Borrower becomes due (the "Due Date").

(b)      Prior to each Due Date,  the Bank will mail to the Borrower a statement
         of the amounts that will be due on that Due Date (the "Billed Amount").
         The bill will be mailed a specified  number of  calendar  days prior to
         the Due Date, which number of days will be mutually agreed from time to
         time by the Bank and the Borrower. The calculations in the bill will be
         made on the  assumption  that no new  extensions  of credit or payments
         will be made  between  the date of the  billing  statement  and the Due
         Date,  and that there will be no  changes  in the  applicable  interest
         rate.

(c)      The Bank will  debit the  Designated  Account  for the  Billed  Amount,
         regardless  of  the  actual  amount  due on  that  date  (the  "Accrued
         Amount").  If the  Billed  Amount  debited  to the  Designated  Account
         differs from the Accrued  Amount,  the  discrepancy  will be treated as
         follows:

         (i)      If the  Billed  Amount is less than the  Accrued  Amount,  the
                  Billed  Amount for the following Due Date will be increased by
                  the amount of the  discrepancy.  The  Borrower  will not be in
                  default by reason of any such discrepancy.

         (ii)     If the  Billed  Amount is more than the  Accrued  Amount,  the
                  Billed  Amount for the following Due Date will be decreased by
                  the amount of the discrepancy.

         Regardless  of any such  discrepancy,  interest will continue to accrue
         based  on  the  actual   amount  of   principal   outstanding   without
         compounding.  The  Bank  will  not pay  the  Borrower  interest  on any
         overpayment.

(d)      The Borrower will maintain  sufficient funds in the Designated  Account
         to cover each debit. If there are insufficient  funds in the Designated
         Account  on the date the  Bank  enters  any  debit  authorized  by this
         Agreement, the Bank may reverse the debit.

(e)      The Borrower may terminate this direct debit arrangement at any time by
         sending written notice to the Bank at the address  specified at the end
         of this Agreement.  If the Borrower  terminates this arrangement,  then
         the  principal  amount  outstanding  under this  Agreement  will at the
         option  of the Bank  bear  interest  at a rate per  annum  which is 0.5
         percentage  point higher than the rate of interest  otherwise  provided
         under this Agreement.

4.4      Banking Days.  Unless otherwise  provided in this Agreement,  a banking
day is a day other  than a  Saturday,  Sunday  or other day on which  commercial
banks are  authorized  to close,  or are in fact closed,  in the state where the
Bank's  lending office is located,  and, if such day relates to amounts  bearing
interest at an offshore rate (if any),  means any such day on which  dealings in
dollar  deposits  are  conducted  among banks in the offshore  dollar  interbank
market. All payments and disbursements  which would be due on a day which is not
a banking day will be due on

                                      210
<PAGE>

the next banking day. All payments  received on a day which is not a banking day
will be applied to the credit on the next banking day.

4.5      Interest Calculation. Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, all
interest and fees,  if any,  will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and
the actual number of days elapsed. This results in more interest or a higher fee
than if a 365-day year is used.  Installments  of  principal  which are not paid
when due under this Agreement shall continue to bear interest until paid.

4.6      Default Rate.  Upon the occurrence of any default under this Agreement,
all amounts outstanding under this Agreement,  including any interest,  fees, or
costs which are not paid when due,  will at the option of the Bank bear interest
at a rate  which is 2.0  percentage  points  higher  than  the rate of  interest
otherwise  provided  under this  Agreement.  This may result in  compounding  of
interest. This will not constitute a waiver of any default. 5. CONDITIONS

date of  determination,  the  rating  as  determined  by either  Moody's  or S&P
(collectively, the "Debt Ratings") of the Borrower's non-credit-enhanced, senior
unsecured long-term debt.

8.14     Restrictive  Covenant.  California  Water  Service  Group  directly  or
indirectly agrees to any arrangement  whereby the ability of the Borrower to pay
dividends to California Water Service Group is restricted.

8.15     Other Breach Under Agreement. The Borrower fails to meet the conditions
of, or fails to perform any  obligation  under,  any term of this  Agreement not
specifically  referred  to  in  this  Article.  This  includes  any  failure  or
anticipated  failure by the Borrower to comply with any financial  covenants set
forth  in this  Agreement,  whether  such  failure  is  evidenced  by  financial
statements  delivered to the Bank or is  otherwise  known to the Borrower or the
Bank.

9.       ENFORCING THIS AGREEMENT; MISCELLANEOUS

                                      216
<PAGE>

9.1      GAAP.  Except as  otherwise  stated in this  Agreement,  all  financial
information  provided to the Bank and all financial covenants will be made under
generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied.

9.2      California Law.  This Agreement is governed by California law.

9.3      Successors and Assigns. This Agreement is binding on the Borrower's and
the Bank's successors and assignees.  The Borrower agrees that it may not assign
this   Agreement   without  the  Bank's  prior   consent.   The  Bank  may  sell
participations  in or assign this loan, and may exchange  financial  information
about the Borrower  with actual or potential  participants  or  assignees.  If a
participation is sold or the loan is assigned, the purchaser will have the right
of set-off against the Borrower.

9.4      Arbitration and Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a)      This paragraph  concerns the resolution of any  controversies or claims
         between the parties,  whether arising in contract,  tort or by statute,
         including but not limited to  controversies or claims that arise out of
         or relate to: (i) this Agreement (including any renewals, extensions or
         modifications);   or  (ii)  any  document  related  to  this  Agreement
         (collectively  a  "Claim").   For  the  purposes  of  this  arbitration
         provision   only,   the  term   "parties"   shall  include  any  parent
         corporation,  subsidiary  or  affiliate  of the  Bank  involved  in the
         servicing,  management or administration of any obligation described or
         evidenced by this Agreement.

(b)      At the  request  of any party to this  Agreement,  any  Claim  shall be
         resolved  by  binding   arbitration  in  accordance  with  the  Federal
         Arbitration  Act (Title 9, U. S. Code) (the "Act").  The Act will apply
         even though this Agreement provides that it is governed by the law of a
         specified state.

(c)      Arbitration  proceedings will be determined in accordance with the Act,
         the applicable  rules and procedures for the arbitration of disputes of
         JAMS  or  any  successor  thereof  ("JAMS"),  and  the  terms  of  this
         paragraph.  In the  event  of any  inconsistency,  the  terms  of  this
         paragraph shall control.

(m)

(d)      The arbitration  shall be  administered  by JAMS and conducted,  unless
         otherwise  required  by law,  in any U. S. state where real or tangible
         personal property  collateral for this credit is located or if there is
         no such collateral, in the state specified in the governing law section
         of this  Agreement.  All Claims shall be determined by one  arbitrator;
         however, if Claims exceed Five Million Dollars  ($5,000,000),  upon the
         request of any party, the Claims shall be decided by three arbitrators.
         All arbitration  hearings shall commence within ninety (90) days of the
         demand  for   arbitration   and  close  within   ninety  (90)  days  of
         commencement and the award of the arbitrator(s)  shall be issued within
         thirty  (30)  days  of  the  close  of  the   hearing.   However,   the
         arbitrator(s),   upon  a  showing  of  good   cause,   may  extend  the
         commencement  of the hearing for up to an  additional  sixty (60) days.
         The arbitrator(s)  shall provide a concise written statement of reasons
         for the award.  The  arbitration  award may be  submitted  to any court
         having jurisdiction to be confirmed and enforced.

(e)      The  arbitrator(s)  will have the authority to decide whether any Claim
         is barred by the  statute of  limitations  and,  if so, to dismiss  the
         arbitration  on that  basis.  For  purposes of the  application  of the
         statute of limitations, the service on JAMS under applicable JAMS rules
         of a notice of Claim is the equivalent of the filing of a lawsuit.  Any
         dispute  concerning  this  arbitration  provision or whether a Claim is
         arbitrable shall be determined by the arbitrator(s).  The arbitrator(s)
         shall have the power to award legal fees  pursuant to the terms of this
         Agreement.

(f)      This  paragraph  does not limit the right of any party to: (i) exercise
         self-help  remedies,  such as but not limited to, setoff; (ii) initiate
         judicial  or  non-judicial  foreclosure  against  any real or  personal
         property  collateral;  (iii)  exercise  any  judicial  or power of sale
         rights, or (iv) act in a court of law to obtain an interim remedy, such
         as but  not  limited  to,  injunctive  relief,  writ of  possession  or
         appointment of a receiver, or additional or supplementary remedies.

(g)      The procedure  described above will not apply if the Claim, at the time
         of the proposed submission to arbitration, arises from or relates to an
         obligation to the Bank secured by real  property.  In this case, all of
         the parties to this  Agreement  must consent to submission of the Claim
         to  arbitration.  If both  parties do not

                                      217
<PAGE>

         consent to  arbitration,  the Claim will be resolved  as  follows:  The
         parties  will  designate  a referee (or a panel of  referees)  selected
         under  the  auspices  of JAMS in the same  manner  as  arbitrators  are
         selected in JAMS administered  proceedings.  The designated  referee(s)
         will be  appointed by a court as provided in  California  Code of Civil
         Procedure Section 638 and the following  related sections.  The referee
         (or  presiding  referee of the panel)  will be an active  attorney or a
         retired  judge.  The  award  that  results  from  the  decision  of the
         referee(s)  will be entered as a judgment  in the court that  appointed
         the referee,  in accordance  with the provisions of California  Code of
         Civil Procedure Sections 644 and 645.

(n)      The filing of a court action is not intended to  constitute a waiver of
         the right of any  party,  including  the  suing  party,  thereafter  to
         require submittal of the Claim to arbitration.

(i)      By  agreeing  to  binding  arbitration,  the  parties  irrevocably  and
         voluntarily waive any right they may have to a trial by jury in respect
         of any Claim.  Furthermore,  without intending in any way to limit this
         Agreement to arbitrate, to the extent any Claim is not arbitrated,  the
         parties  irrevocably and voluntarily waive any right they may have to a
         trial by jury in respect of such Claim.  This  provision  is a material
         inducement for the parties entering into this Agreement.

9.5      Severability;   Waivers.   If  any  part  of  this   Agreement  is  not
enforceable,  the rest of the  Agreement  may be enforced.  The Bank retains all
rights,  even if it makes a loan after default. If the Bank waives a default, it
may enforce a later default.  Any consent or waiver under this Agreement must be
in writing.

9.6      Attorneys'  Fees.  The  Borrower  shall  reimburse  the  Bank  for  any
reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred by the Bank in connection with the
enforcement or  preservation  of any rights or remedies under this Agreement and
any  other  documents  executed  in  connection  with  this  Agreement,  and  in
connection with any amendment,  waiver,  "workout" or  restructuring  under this
Agreement. In the event of a lawsuit or arbitration  proceeding,  the prevailing
party is entitled to recover costs and  reasonable  attorneys'  fees incurred in
connection  with the lawsuit or  arbitration  proceeding,  as  determined by the
court or  arbitrator.  In the event that any case is commenced by or against the
Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code) or any similar
or  successor  statute,  the Bank is  entitled to recover  costs and  reasonable
attorneys' fees incurred by the Bank related to the preservation, protection, or
enforcement of any rights of the Bank in such a case. As used in this paragraph,
"attorneys'  fees" includes the allocated costs of the Bank's in-house  counsel.

9.7      One  Agreement.  This  Agreement  and any  related  security  or  other
agreements required by this Agreement, collectively:

(a)      represent the sum of the understandings and agreements between the Bank
         and the Borrower concerning this credit;

(b)      replace any prior oral or written  agreements  between the Bank and the
         Borrower concerning this credit; and

(c)      are  intended by the Bank and the  Borrower as the final,  complete and
         exclusive statement of the terms agreed to by them.

In the event of any conflict  between this  Agreement  and any other  agreements
required by this  Agreement,  this Agreement will prevail.  Any reference in any
related document to a "promissory note" or a "note" executed by the Borrower and
dated  as of the  date of this  Agreement  shall  be  deemed  to  refer  to this
Agreement,  as now in effect or as hereafter amended,  renewed, or restated.

9.8 Indemnification. The Borrower will indemnify and hold the Bank harmless from
any loss, liability,  damages,  judgments,  and costs of any kind relating to or
arising  directly  or  indirectly  out of (a)  this  Agreement  or any  document
required  hereunder,  (b) any credit  extended or  committed  by the Bank to the
Borrower  hereunder,  and (c) any litigation or proceeding related to or arising
out of this  Agreement,  any such document,  or any such credit.  This indemnity
includes but is not limited to attorneys'  fees (including the allocated cost of
in-house counsel). This indemnity extends to the Bank, its parent,  subsidiaries
and all of their directors, officers, employees, agents, successors,  attorneys,
and assigns. This indemnity will survive repayment of the Borrower's obligations
to the Bank.  All sums due to the Bank  hereunder  shall be  obligations  of the
Borrower, due and payable immediately without demand.

9.9      Notices.  Unless  otherwise  provided in this  Agreement  or in another
agreement  between the Bank and the Borrower,  all notices  required  under this
Agreement  shall be  personally  delivered or sent by first class mail,  postage
prepaid, or by overnight courier, to the addresses on the signature page of this
Agreement, or sent by facsimile to the fax numbers listed on the signature page,
or to such other addresses as the Bank and the Borrower may specify from time to
time in writing.  Notices and other  communications  shall be  effective  (i) if
mailed,  upon the earlier of receipt or five (5) days after  deposit in the U.S.
mail, first class,  postage prepaid,  (ii) if telecopied,  when transmitted,  or
(iii) if hand-delivered, by courier or otherwise (including telegram, lettergram
or mailgram), when delivered.

9.10     Headings.  Article and paragraph  headings are for  reference  only and
shall not  affect  the  interpretation  or  meaning  of any  provisions  of this
Agreement.

9.11     Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in as many counterparts as
necessary or convenient,  and by the different parties on separate  counterparts
each of  which,  when so  executed,  shall be deemed  an  original  but all such
counterparts shall constitute but one and the same agreement.
