respective times that the filings are made contains or  will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omits  or
will  omit  to state a material fact required to  be  stated

      A.26  Information  concerning SuperiorClean  Complete.
SuperiorClean shall promptly provide to Fund and Aldo notice
concerning  any of the information concerning  SuperiorClean
furnished  hereunder if events occur prior  to  the  Closing
Date  that would have been required to be disclosed had they

The   information  provided  to  Fund  and  Aldo  concerning
SuperiorClean, as supplemented prior to the Closing Date, is
expressly  incorporated herein by reference. Notwithstanding
the  foregoing,  any such supplement to the  information  in
furnished  by SuperiorClean following the date hereof  shall
not  in  any  way  affect  Fund  and  Aldo's  right  not  to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as set forth
herein.

To  the  extent SuperiorClean or its officers, directors  or
principal shareholders suffer any claim, loss, liability  or
damage as a result of any of the foregoing not being true or

and  shall  inure to the benefit of the parties  hereto  and
their   respective   successors,  assigns,   executors   and

and  obligations  of  the  parties hereunder  shall  not  be
assignable  by  any party hereto without the  prior  written
consent of the other.  This Agreement represents the  entire
understanding and agreement between the parties hereto  with
respect  to the subject matter hereof; supersedes all  prior
negotiations,  letters and understandings  relating  to  the
subject  matter hereof; and cannot be amended,  supplemented
or modified except by an instrument in writing signed by the
party  against  whom  enforcement  of  any  such  amendment,
supplement or modification is sought.  In the event  of  any
litigation  between  the parties to this Agreement  relating
to,  or arising out of, this Agreement, the prevailing party
shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorney's  fees
and  costs,  trial  and appellate levels.   The  failure  or
finding  of  invalidity of any provision of  this  Agreement
shall  in  no manner affect the right to enforce  the  other
provisions  of  same, and the waiver by  any  party  of  any
breach  of  any  provision of this Agreement  shall  not  be
construed  to  be a waiver by such party of  any  subsequent
breach of any other provision.
