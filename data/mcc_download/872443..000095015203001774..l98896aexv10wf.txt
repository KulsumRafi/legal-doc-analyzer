Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the Amendment Effective Date or
would result from this Amendment becoming effective in accordance with its
terms, unless any such Event of Default has previously been waived in accordance

               executed by the Borrowers and the Agent; and

                             (ii)   such other agreements, instruments,
               approvals, opinions and other documents as the Agent may
               reasonably request.

               5.     Representations and Warranties. Each of the Borrowers

the Loan Agreement and in each other Loan Document and certificate or other
writing delivered to the Lenders on or prior to the Amendment Effective Date

representations and warranties expressly relate solely to an earlier date in
which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct on and
as of such date); and (ii) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing on the Amendment Effective Date or would result from this
Amendment becoming effective in accordance with its terms.

                      (b)    Each of the Borrowers (i) is a corporation, duly

Borrower of this Amendment, and the performance by each such Borrower of the
Loan Agreement, as amended hereby, (i) have been duly authorized by all
necessary action, (ii) do not and will not contravene such Borrower's charter or
by-laws, any applicable law or any contractual restriction binding on or
otherwise affecting it or any of its properties, (iii) do not and will not
result in or require the creation of any lien or other encumbrance (other than

forfeiture or nonrenewal of any permit, license, authorization or approval

                      (d)    No authorization or approval or other action by,
and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority or agency or other
regulatory body is required in connection with the due execution, delivery and
performance by such Borrower of this Amendment, or for the performance of the
Loan Agreement, as amended hereby.

                      (e)    This Amendment, the Loan Agreement, as amended
hereby, and each other Loan Document to which such Borrower is a party is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of such Borrower, enforceable against such
Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by equitable principles or by or subject to any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally.

               6.     Continued Effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. (a) Except
as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Loan Agreement and the other Loan
Documents are, and shall continue to be, in full force and effect and are hereby
ratified and confirmed in all respects, except that on and after the Amendment
Effective Date (i) all references in the Loan Agreement to "this Agreement",
"hereto", "hereof", "hereunder" or words of like import referring to the Loan
Agreement shall mean the Loan Agreement as amended by this Amendment and (ii)
all references in the other Loan Documents to the "Loan Agreement", "thereto",
"thereof", "thereunder" or words of like import referring to the Loan Agreement
shall mean the Loan Agreement as amended by this Amendment.

                      (b)    The Borrowers hereby acknowledge and agree that
this Amendment constitutes a "Loan Document" under the Loan Agreement.
Accordingly, it shall be an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement if any
representation or warranty made by the Borrowers under or in connection with
this Amendment shall have been untrue, false or misleading in any material
respect when made or if Borrowers fail to perform any covenant contained in this
Amendment.

               7.     Costs and Expenses. The Borrowers shall pay all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Lender Group (including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and charges of counsel to any member of the
Lender Group) in connection with this Amendment.

               8.     Miscellaneous. (a) This Amendment may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of this Amendment by telefacsimile shall be equally as effective as delivery of
an original executed counterpart of this Amendment. Any party delivering an
executed counterpart of this Amendment by telefacsimile also shall deliver an
original executed counterpart of this Amendment but the failure to deliver an
original executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and
binding effect of this Amendment.

                      (b)    Section and paragraph headings herein are included
for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this
Amendment for any other purpose.
