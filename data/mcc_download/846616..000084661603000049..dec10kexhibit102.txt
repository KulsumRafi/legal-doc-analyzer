Effective August 1, 2002, the Company adopted the Executive Stock Purchase Plan,
which is not required to be and was not approved by the Company's  shareholders.
Under the Executive Stock Purchase Plan, the Committee  administering  such Plan
may determine that the Company  assign to officers,  executives and directors of
the Company and its subsidiaries the Company's options to purchase shares of its
class A common stock. See "- Market  Information." These options arise only when
shareholders  of the  Company  notify the  Company  that they want to sell their
shares of class A common stock. The exercise price of the option is equal to the
value of the shares  determined  as described in "- Market  Information."  Thus,
there is not a fixed number of shares available for issuance under the Executive
Stock  Purchase  Plan,  and the number of shares  that may be  purchased  by the
participants  under that Plan in the future  and the  exercise  prices of future
options are not  determinable.  As of December 31,  2002,  there were no options
outstanding  under the Executive  Stock  Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2002,
the Company had no equity compensation plans approved by its shareholders.
