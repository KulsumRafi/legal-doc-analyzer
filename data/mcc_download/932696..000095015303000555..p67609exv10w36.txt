Joel Borovay
VIA HAND DELIVERY

Dear Joel:

Pursuant to Section 1(b) of your employment agreement dated November 17, 2000
with Insight Direct Worldwide, Inc., as amended and assigned (the "Agreement")
to Insight Services Corporation (the "Company"), you are hereby notified that
there shall be no further renewal of the Agreement after December 31, 2002, and
that, accordingly, such Agreement shall expire on December 31, 2004.

Please note that by giving this notice the Company does not intend to terminate
your employment. Instead, as we have previously discussed, the only result of
our action today is that the expiration date of the term of the Agreement will
become fixed and it will no longer renew for a full two-year term each day.

Additionally, please note that the following is the notice address the Company
has on file for you pursuant to the Agreement:

      5064 East Yucca Street
      Scottsdale, Arizona  85254

We believe this address may be out of date. To update this address, please
notify Deanna Carney or Bob Moya in writing (email acceptable) of your current
correct address.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thank you.

Sincerely,

Timothy A. Crown
Chief Executive Officer
Insight Services Corporation
