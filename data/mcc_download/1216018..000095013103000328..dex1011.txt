sell, assign or transfer this Note or any portion hereof prior to January
14, 2003, provided however, that the Holder of this Note may sell, transfer or

Company with a request to transfer all or any portion thereof and such transfer
is permitted by Section 6.1 hereof, or if a Holder wishes to exchange this Note
for an equal principal amount of Notes of other denominations, the Company shall
make the transfer or exchange as requested, and issue replacement Notes of the
same tenor as this Note to the appropriate parties; provided, however, that if
this Note is presented or surrendered for transfer or exchange it shall be duly
endorsed or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly executed by
the Holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

          7.    Covenants. The Company covenants and agrees that so long as any
portion of this Note is outstanding, and unless the Holder otherwise agrees in
writing:

                7.1   Payment of Note. The Company shall pay the principal and
interest on this Note and any other amounts due hereunder on the dates and in
the manner provided in this Note.

                7.2   Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries may effect any transaction with any of their
respective Affiliates (except for the Company and its Subsidiaries) on a basis
less favorable to the Company and its Subsidiaries than would be the case if
such transaction had been effected with a non-Affiliate; provided however, that
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be prohibited from making Permitted
Affiliate Payments.

                7.3   Limitation on Additional Indebtedness. The Company will
not, and will not permit any Subsidiary of the Company to, directly or
indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including any Indebtedness of a Person
existing at the time of the acquisition of such Person or assumed in connection
with the acquisition of assets from such Person) unless after giving effect to
the incurrence of such Indebtedness and the receipt and application of the
proceeds thereof, (a) the ratio of the total Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness owed to a Subsidiary by any other
Subsidiary or the Company and any Indebtedness owed to the Company by any
Subsidiary) to the sum of the Company's EBITDA plus Consolidated Pro Forma
Acquisition EBITDA (based on the last four fiscal quarters of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries for which financial statements are available at
the date of determination) is less than (i) 6.0 to 1 if the Indebtedness is
incurred after the date hereof but prior to January 14, 2000, (ii) 5.5 to 1 if
the Indebtedness is incurred on or after January 14, 2000 but prior to January
14, 2001, and (iii) 5.0 to 1 if the Indebtedness is

                                       -3-

<PAGE>

incurred on or after January 14, 2001 and (b) the ratio of Funded Debt of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries (excluding Indebtedness owed to a Subsidiary
by any other Subsidiary) to the sum of the Company's EBITDA plus Consolidated
Pro Forma Acquisition EBITDA (based on the last four fiscal quarters of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for which financial statements are
available at the date of determination) is less than (i) 5.0 to 1 if the Funded
Debt is incurred after the date hereof but prior to January 14, 2000, (ii) 4.5
to 1 if the Funded Debt is incurred on or after January 14,2000 but prior to
January 14, 2001, (iii) 4.0 to 1 if the Funded Debt is incurred on or after
January 14, 2001. For purposes of making a determination under this paragraph of
this Section 7.3, total Indebtedness and Funded Debt shall not include any
revolving credit Indebtedness (including revolving credit Indebtedness under the
Credit Agreement) to the extent that such Indebtedness (i) is required by the
terms of the instrument governing such revolving credit Indebtedness to be paid
down at least once annually or (ii) is available under a credit facility, but is
not outstanding as of the applicable date of determination. Any revolving credit
Indebtedness not subject to clause (i) shall be subject to the provisions of
this paragraph when incurred, but once incurred in accordance with this Section
7.3, such Indebtedness may continue to exist and be outstanding and may be
repaid and reborrowed up to such amount incurred as permitted under this
paragraph without being subject to any further test under this paragraph.

     Notwithstanding anything in this Note to the contrary, the Company and its
Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement up to
$132,000,000 (including revolving credit Indebtedness) (the "Credit Agreement
Cap") without regard to the limitations contained in the first paragraph of this
Section 7.3 or elsewhere in this Note. The amount of the Credit Agreement Cap
shall be reduced by any permanent reduction of Indebtedness under the Credit
Agreement.

                7.4   Limitation on Distributions. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly make any Distributions, except
that the following shall be permitted: (a) Subsidiaries of the Company may make
Distributions to the Company or to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company,
(b) repurchasing shares of the Company's Capital Stock from a former employee or
consultant of the Company (or Subsidiary of the Company) where such repurchase
arises from the Company's option or obligation to repurchase such shares upon
termination of such employee's employment (including the obligation of the
Company to repurchase the shares of Scott W. Brickman pursuant to the Employment
Agreement between Scott W. Brickman and the Company), (c) Permitted Tax
Distributions or (d) distributions of Capital Stock other than any Capital Stock
which, by its terms (or by the terms of any security into which it is
convertible or for which it is exchangeable) or at the option of the holder,
matures or is mandatorily redeemable in whole or in part prior to the maturity
date of the Note.

          8.    Subordination.

                8.1   Subordination. The Company, for itself and its successors,
and the Holder, by its acceptance thereof, agrees that this Note is and shall be
subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in
this Section 8, to the prior payment in full of all obligations pursuant to
Senior Debt. For the purposes of this Note, Senior Debt shall not be

                                       -4-

<PAGE>

deemed to have been paid in full until the holders or owners of the Senior Debt
shall have indefeasibly received payment of all obligations arising with respect
to such Senior Debt in cash. This Section 8 shall constitute a continuing offer
to all persons who, in reliance upon such provisions, become holders of, or
continue to hold, Senior Debt, and such provisions are made for the benefit of
the holders of Senior Debt, and such holders are made obligees hereunder and any
one or more of them may enforce such provisions.

                8.2   Dissolution; Liquidation; Bankruptcy. Upon any payment or
distribution of all or any of the assets or securities of the Company of any
kind or character upon any dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief or other similar case or proceeding
under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law (whether voluntary or
involuntary, in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, arrangement,
reorganization or relief proceedings or upon any assignment for the benefit of
creditors or any marshaling of the assets and liabilities of the Company or
otherwise) (the foregoing being a "Reorganization"):

                      (a)   all Senior Debt shall first be entitled to be paid
in full before the Holder is entitled to receive any payment on account of this
Note; and

                      (b)   any payment or distribution in respect of this Note
to which the Holder would be entitled except for the provisions of this Section
8, shall be paid by the Company, the liquidating trustee or agent or other
person making such payment or distribution directly to the holders of the Senior
Debt or their representative or to the trustee under any indenture or other
agreement (if any) pursuant to which Senior Debt may have been issued, as the
case may be, for application (in the case of cash, or as collateral in the case
of non-cash property or securities) for, the payment or prepayment in full of
all Senior Debt remaining unpaid, after giving effect to any concurrent payment
or distribution (in the case of cash) to the holders of such Senior Debt.

                8.3   Specific Powers in Reorganization. In any proceedings with
respect to any Reorganization, the Holder irrevocably authorizes the
Representative or if there is more than one Representative, the Representative
of the Senior Debt with the highest priority:

                      (a)   to prove and enforce any claims on this Note owed by
the Company to the Holder either in the name of the Representative or in the
name of the Holder as the attorney-in-fact of the Holder;

                      (b)   to vote claims arising from this Note and to accept
or reject on behalf of the Holder any plan proposed in connection with any such
Reorganization;

                      (c)   to accept and execute receipts for any payment or
distribution made with respect to this Note and to apply such payment or
distribution to the payment of this Note; and

                                       -5-

<PAGE>

                      (d)   to take any action and to execute any instruments
necessary to effectuate the foregoing, either in the name of the Representative
or in the name of the Holders as the attorney-in-fact of the Holder.

                8.4   Default.

                      (a)   In the event that any Senior Debt Payment Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, unless and until such Senior Debt Payment
Default shall have been cured or waived in writing, then no payment shall be
made by or on behalf of the Company for or on account of this Note, and the
Holder shall not take or receive from the Company, directly or indirectly, in
cash or other property, payment for all or any of this Note (except the Holder
may receive the PIK Notes and any other Indebtedness which is subordinated to at
least the same extent as this Note is to (x) Senior Debt and (y) any securities
issued in exchange for Senior Debt).

                      (b)   In addition, upon the occurrence of a Senior Debt
Non-Payment Default, no payment shall be made by or on behalf of the Company for
or on account of this Note, and the Holder shall not take or receive from the
Company, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property, payment of all or
any of this Note (except the Holder may receive the PIK Notes and any other
Indebtedness which is subordinated to at least the same extent as this Note is
to (x) Senior Debt and (y) any securities issued in exchange for Senior Debt)
during the period (the "Payment Blockage Period") commencing on the date of
receipt by the Company of a written notice from the Representative of Specified
Senior Debt of such Senior Debt Non-Payment Default and extending unless and
until the earliest of (a) such Payment Blockage Period shall have been
terminated by written notice to the Company or the Holder from the
Representative of the Specified Senior Debt, (b) such Senior Debt Non-Payment
Default shall have been cured or waived in writing or shall have ceased to exist
or such Specified Senior Debt shall have been paid in full or (c) more than 179
days shall have elapsed since the receipt of such written notice by the Company
from the Representative regarding such Senior Debt Non-Payment Default, after
which, in the case of clauses (a), (b) and (c), the Company shall resume
payments and distributions in respect of this Note, including any missed
payments. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Note, in no event shall a
Payment Blockage Period commenced in accordance with the provisions of this Note
described in this paragraph extend beyond 179 days from the date of receipt by
the Company of the notice referred to above (the "Initial Blockage Period"). Any
number of additional Payment Blockage Periods may be commenced during the
Initial Blockage Period, provided, however, that no such additional Payment
Blockage Period shall extend beyond the Initial Payment Blockage Period. After
the expiration of the Initial Payment Blockage Period, no Payment Blockage
Period may be commenced until at least 190 days have elapsed from the last day
of the Initial Blockage Period. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Note, no Senior Debt Non-Payment Default which existed or was continuing on the
date of commencement of any Payment Blockage Period initiated by the
Representative shall be, or be made, the basis for the commencement of a second
Payment Blockage Period initiated by the Representative, whether or not within
the Initial Blockage Period, unless such Senior Debt Non-Payment Default shall
have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 180 consecutive days.

                      (c)   Payments Held in Trust. If, notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 8.4, any payment or distribution of the
assets of the Company or any of its present or future Subsidiaries of any kind
or character shall be received, by way of set-off or otherwise, by the Holder at
a time when such payment or distribution is prohibited by this Section 8.4, and
before all Senior Debt is paid in full, such payment or distribution and the
amount of any such set-off shall be held in trust by the Holder and promptly
paid over to the Representative (who shall have the right to convert any such
assets into cash) for application to the payment of Senior Debt until all such
Senior Debt shall have been paid in full, after giving effect to any concurrent
payment or distribution to the holders of Senior Debt.

                      (d)   Notice of Senior Debt Defaults to Holder. The
Company shall advise the Holder in writing of the occurrence of any Senior Debt
Payment Default or Senior Debt Non-Payment Default within seven (7) Business
Days of the Company's actual knowledge of the occurrence thereof

                8.5   Restrictions on Acceleration. No Holder may without the
prior written consent of the Representative and the representative of the
holders of any Specified Senior Debt, (a) accelerate the maturity of, or
institute proceedings to enforce against the Company, this Note notwithstanding
any term or provision to the contrary contained herein or in any agreement or
instrument relating hereto (provided that the Holder shall not be prohibited
from instituting proceedings seeking equitable relief from a breach by the
Company of Sections 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 hereof) or (b) commence or join with any
other creditor or creditors of the Company in commencing any proceeding against
the Company seeking to effect a reorganization of the Company unless and until
(i) the expiration of 180 days from the date the Holder provides notice to each
such Representative that a default has occurred under this Note and that the
Holder desires to take action against the Company as a consequence thereof, (ii)
the earlier waiver or cure of the default giving rise thereto, (iii) the
acceleration by the Representative or any holder of any Specified Senior Debt,
(iv) the commencement of any foreclosure action available to the holders of
Specified Senior Debt, (v) the payment in full, in cash or cash equivalents, of
all Senior Debt and the termination of the Representative's commitment to extend
credit pursuant to the Credit Agreement or (vi) the occurrence of any event set
forth in Section 9.1(e) or (f).

                8.6   Holder to be Subrogated to Rights of Holders of Senior
Debt. Upon payment in full of all obligations arising with respect to Senior
Debt, the Holder shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Debt
to receive payments or distributions of assets of the Company applicable to the
Senior Debt until this Note shall be paid in full, and for the purpose of such
subrogation no such payments or distributions to the holders of Senior Debt by
or on behalf of the Company or by or on behalf of the Holder by virtue of this
Section 8 which otherwise would have been made to the Holder shall, as among the
Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Debt and the Holder, be
deemed to be payment by the Company to or on account of the Senior Debt, it
being understood that the provisions of this Section 8 are and are intended
solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holder, on the one
hand, and the holders of Senior Debt, on the other hand.

                                       -7-

<PAGE>

                If any payment or distribution to which the Holder would
otherwise have been entitled but for the provisions of this Section 8 shall have
been applied, pursuant to the provisions of this Section 8, to the payment of
all amounts payable under the Senior Debt, then and in such case, the Holder
shall be entitled to receive from the holders of such Senior Debt at the time
outstanding any payments or distributions received by such holders of Senior
Debt in excess of the amount sufficient to pay holders of Senior Debt all
amounts payable under or in respect of the Senior Debt in full in cash.

                8.7   Subordination Rights Not Impaired by Acts or Omissions of
the Company or Holders of Senior Debt. The Company agrees that it will not make
any payment under this Note, or take any other action, in contravention of the
provisions of this Section 8, and no right of any present or future holders of
any Senior Debt to enforce subordination as provided herein shall at any time in
any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of
the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder,
or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms of this Note, regardless
of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or be otherwise charged
with. The holders of Senior Debt may extend, renew, modify, amend or restructure
the terms of the Senior Debt or any instrument or agreement evidencing or
governing the same or any security therefor and release, sell or exchange any
security therefor and otherwise deal freely with the Company, all without
affecting the liabilities and obligations of the Holder. No provision in any
amendment, supplemental agreement or other agreement, documents, instrument
which adversely affects the superior position of the holders of the Senior Debt
shall be effective unless the consent of such holders for such action, shall
have been obtained.

                8.8   Obligations of Company Unconditional. Nothing contained in
this Section 8 is intended to or shall impair, as between the Company and the
Holder, the obligations of the Company, which are absolute and unconditional, to
pay to the Holder the principal of, premium, if any, on and interest on this
Note as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with its
terms or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holder and
creditors of the Company other than the holders of the Senior Debt, and, except
as provided in Section 8.5, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Holder
from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon an Event
of Default, subject to the rights, if any, under this Section 8 of the holders
of such Senior Debt in respect of cash, property, security or securities of the
Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy. The failure to make a
payment on account of principal of, premium, if any on or interest on this Note
by reason of any provision of this Section 8 shall not be construed as
preventing the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 9.

                Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company
referred to in this Section 8, the Holder shall be entitled to rely upon any
order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any
certificate of the Representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or
other person making any distribution to the Holder for the purpose of
ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the
holders of the Senior Debt and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount
thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon
and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Section 8.
