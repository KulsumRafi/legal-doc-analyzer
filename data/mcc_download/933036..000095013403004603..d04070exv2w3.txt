Dear Sir:

         This letter is provided pursuant to Section 4.11 of that certain Asset

Inc. (the "COMPANY"), Rent-Way of Michigan, Inc. ("RENT-WAY MICHIGAN") and

have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

         Following an evaluation of the status of Acquiror's due diligence

Investigation Period shall extend until and include January 20, 2003, provided,
however, that the Extended Investigation Period shall continue after January 20,
