FAX: 646 471 5933

Mr. Philip Bancroft
c/o PriceWaterhouseCoopers
New York, NY
U.S.A.

November 2, 2001

Dear Phil,

This letter confirms our recent telephone conversations and our offer of
employment to you for the position of Chief Financial Officer, ACE Limited,
subject to the formality of obtaining a Bermuda work permit.

The main terms of compensation related to the position are attached but you will
participate in all the benefit plans enjoyed by our senior executive group,
which includes an executive medical program as well as financial and tax
planning.

For the sake of clarity, I should also point out that ACE is required to deduct
Government Payroll Tax on compensation, which, in your case will amount to
approximately $10,000. All other local taxes are absorbed by the Company. As you
would expect, ACE withholds income tax from US citizens and complies with all US
reporting obligations.

Phil, I shall look forward to having you join our dynamic team and feel certain
you will contribute significantly to ACE's future success.

Please let me have your formal acceptance of our offer when you have finished
your discussions with your partners.

Yours sincerely,




Brian Duperreault
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
