<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Commitment of Lender</U>.
Subject to the conditions hereof, and provided that neither an Event of Default
nor an Incipient Default has occurred, Lender will make Advances for the benefit

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Limitation on Advances</U>.

amount of all of the Advances to be in excess of the amount set forth on the
Note (maximum loan amount), or (c) more than one (1) Advance in any thirty (30)

forth in this Agreement, Lender shall provide Advances from time to time to pay
approved costs to construct the Improvements (including payment of Interim Term
Interest). Advances will only be made, and may only be used, to pay those costs
comprising the Development Price; notwithstanding the foregoing, Title Company
shall not be responsible for verifying that the Advances are used in such
manner. All Advances, except for payment of Interim Term Interest (which shall
be retained by Lender and credited against the obligations of Borrower under the
Note in accordance with the terms of the Note), will be made by Lender to Title
Company. Upon Title Company&#146;s receipt of (i)&#160;the applicable Requests
for Advance which have been approved by Lender, together with a list certified
by Contractor of payees and amounts of checks to be issued by Title Company in
connection with such Disbursement, and (ii)&#160;the corresponding Disbursement,
Title Company shall be solely responsible for disbursing such funds to or on
behalf of Borrower on or before the requested Advance date. Title Company shall
be solely responsible for determining whether to disburse Advances received from
Lender jointly to Borrower and Contractor and/or subcontractors or suppliers or
directly to Contractor or subcontractors or suppliers, rather than directly to
Borrower, and the execution of this Agreement by Borrower shall, and hereby
does, constitute an irrevocable direction and authorization to Title Company to
so disburse the funds; provided, however, if Borrower elects, in a notice
delivered to Lender and Title Company prior to the Soft Costs Disbursement (the
&#147;Joint Checks Notice&#148;), to have Title Company issue joint checks for
all Advances to the Contractor and the applicable subcontractors or suppliers,
Title Company shall issue all checks for Advances jointly to the Contractor and
the applicable subcontractors or suppliers. No further direction or
authorization from Borrower shall be necessary for such Advances, and the
delivery to Title Company of all documents referred to in this section and the
corresponding Advances shall satisfy the obligations of Lender hereunder. Unless
Lender specifies otherwise in writing, Lender&#146;s delivery to Title Company
of each Advance shall be deemed to be Lender&#146;s approval of such
Disbursement. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
Borrower  shall  prepare  and submit for each  Advance a Request  for Advance to

 Lender shall withhold for its own benefit 10% of the Hard Costs of each
approved Advance (the  "Retainage") and shall hold such Retainage until the time
of the  Substantial  Completion  Disbursement.  At the  time of the  Substantial
Completion Disbursement,  Lender shall deposit the Retainage with Title Company,
unless  Lender  elects  otherwise  due to an Event of Default by  Borrower  or a
potential  or  actual  dispute  with  respect  to a  Advance  or  otherwise,  as
determined  by  Lender in its sole  discretion.  Title  Company  shall be solely
responsible for determining how long to hold all or any portion of the Retainage
deposited with it by Lender. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no event
shall Lender and/or Title Company hold such Retainage  beyond (i) the expiration
of all lien  periods  under  applicable  law or such time as Title  Company  has
received all necessary lien waivers from contractors, subcontractors, suppliers,
materialmen  and vendors  entitled to  protection  under  applicable  lien laws,
whichever  occurs  first,  (ii) the  settlement of all disputes as to the proper
completion of work with respect to the  Improvements or as to the amount due any
contractor  or supplier who has  performed  work or provided  materials,  unless
requested   otherwise  by  Borrower,   and  (iii)  the  resolution  to  Lender's
satisfaction  of the Event of Default.  Upon the passage of such periods  and/or
settlement of such disputes, if any, or such earlier time as Title Company shall
elect,   Title  Company  shall  disburse  such  Retainage  to  the  contractors,
subcontractors,  suppliers,  materialmen,  vendors and/or other entities  and/or
persons entitled thereto.  Borrower shall have no right, title or interest in or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Receipt of Requests for Advance;  Inspection by Lender. If Borrower
     is  requesting  an  Advance of Hard  Costs,  Lender  shall have  received a
     complete Request for Advance, together with supporting  documentation,  the
     adequacy and completeness of which shall be approved by Lender,  including,
     without limitation, lien waivers (except if the Joint Check Notice has been
     timely  delivered),   affidavits,   indemnity  agreements  and  such  other
     agreements,  instruments,  documents and certificates as may be required by
     Title  Company and Lender.  If  Borrower is  requesting  an Advance of Soft
     Costs (including the Soft Costs Disbursement), Lender shall have received a
     completed  Request for Advance,  together with lien waivers  (except if the
     Joint  Check  Notice  has been  timely  delivered),  invoices,  affidavits,
     indemnity agreements and such other agreements,  instruments, documents and
     certificates  as may be required by Lender.  If a Request for Advance shall
     include a request to make an advance for Hard Costs,  a properly  completed
     Application  for Advance shall also be executed by Contractor  and attached
     to the Request for Advance. Requests for Advance for Soft Costs do not need
     to include the more detailed form Application for Advance.  Notwithstanding
     the foregoing, if Borrower timely delivers the Joint Check Notice, Borrower
     shall not be required to deliver or cause the  Contractor and the suppliers
     and  subcontractors to deliver lien waivers to Lender or Title Company.  If
     Borrower  delivers the Joint Check  Notice,  Borrower may not  subsequently
     elect to  deliver  or cause to be  delivered  lien  waivers  in lieu of the
     issuance by Title Company of joint  checks.  Lender shall have the right to
     require an inspection of the Project by Lender or an independent contractor
     or architect prior to each Advance,  which inspection shall be satisfactory
     to Lender. If Lender determines in connection with any such inspection that
     extra services will be required of Lender as a result of noncompliance with
     the  Contract  Documents,   as  a  result  of  deviations  from  acceptable
     construction practices, or as a result of Borrower's failure to satisfy the
     requirements  of  any  Contract  Documents  and/or  Development  Documents,
     Borrower  shall  pay,  in  addition  to the fees for such  inspection,  the
     reasonable  cost  of all  such  extra  services  including  any  additional
     inspections determined to be necessary or advisable by Lender.<BR><BR>

prior approval of Lender. Lender shall have the right to impose a reasonable fee
for the review of a Change Order by Lender, which fee shall be based on the time
and expense incurred in connection with reviewing the proposed Change Order.
Borrower shall be responsible for the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket
fees and expenses incurred by Lender as a result of Change Orders. At the time
Borrower requests Lender&#146;s consent to a Change Order, Borrower must also
notify Lender whether Borrower intends to pay for all or a portion of the
additional costs resulting from such Change Order, if any, or desires that
Lender fund all or a portion of such additional costs through Advances. Lender
shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its sole discretion, to fund
all or a portion of amounts required to complete the Improvements in excess of
the Development Price due to Change Orders. Lender shall notify Borrower and
Title Company as to whether it will fund all or a portion of such excess amounts
at the time Lender approves a Change Order. If Lender elects to fund all or a
portion of such excess amounts, such amounts funded will be disbursed as
Advances in accordance with this Agreement and included in the Development Price
for purposes of calculating Interim Term Interest and the principal amount for
purposes of calculating the principal and interest payments due under the Note.
If Lender does not elect to fund all or a portion of such excess amounts,
Borrower shall immediately deposit funds with Title Company equal to the portion
of the excess amounts Lender will not fund, and Title Company shall disburse
such deposited funds toward payment of the Development Price prior to the
Advance of any funds Title Company receives from Lender, subject to the

amount of the  Development  Price,  Lender may, at its option,  deliver  written
notice to  Borrower  (with a copy of such  notice  delivered  to Title  Company)
requiring that Borrower  deposit with Title Company within five Business Days of
such notice  funds in such amount in excess of the  Development  Price as Lender
deems necessary to complete the Improvements  (including payment of Interim Term
Interest and Soft Costs).  Title Company shall immediately  notify Lender of its

disbursed  by Title  Company  prior to all  other  funds  held by Title  Company
hereunder  and  subject  to the  satisfaction  of the  requirements  for  making
Advances  set  forth  in this  Agreement.  If  Borrower  fails  to make any such
deposit, such failure shall be an Event of Default under this Agreement. Without
curing such Event of Default,  Lender  shall have the right to take such actions
as are set forth in Section  4,  including,  without  limitation,  funding  such
additional costs through  Advances,  and such amounts funded will be included in
the Development Price for purposes of calculating  Interim Term Interest and the
principal amount for purposes of calculating the principal and interest payments
due under the Note.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrower  agrees to execute such amendments to the Note as Lender shall

amount.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If Lender shall determine that the Schedule of Values and/or the Approved Budget
is not "in balance" as provided in this  subsection,  Lender may, at its option,
refuse to make or approve further  Advances and may require  Borrower to deposit
with  Title  Company  cash or other  security  acceptable  to Lender in its sole
discretion  in such  amount as Lender  deems  necessary  to put the  Schedule of
Values  and/or the  Approved  Budget "in  balance."  No funds of Lender shall be
disbursed  until all sums  deposited  by Borrower  with Title  Company have been
disbursed.  The  Schedule  of Values  and/or the  Approved  Budget  shall be "in
balance" only at such times that Lender determines,  in its sole judgment,  that
(i) the unadvanced  Development  Price is at least equal to the amount that must
be  expended  in order to  complete  the  Improvements  and to pay all costs and
Interim  Term  Interest  and other  expenses  contemplated  hereunder,  and (ii)
unexpended  amounts  within each category or line item in the Schedule of Values
and/or the Approved Budget are at least equal to the  anticipated  cost for each
line item, including,  without limitation,  Interim Term Interest,  that must be
expended to complete the Improvements.  Any costs listed as contingencies on the
Schedule of Values and/or the Approved Budget shall be deemed to be actual costs
for the purposes of balancing.  The  determination as to whether the Schedule of
Values  and/or the Approved  Budget is "in balance" may be made by Lender at any
time,  including in  connection  with any Request for  Advance.  Within five (5)
Business  Days  following  notice from Lender that the Schedule of Values and/or
the  Approved  Budget  is not "in  balance,"  Borrower  shall  make the  deposit
required to be made pursuant to this subsection. Any such amounts deposited with
Title Company shall be the next funds disbursed by Title Company, subject to the

liens as a result of furnishing material or labor to the Project or any portion
thereof or interest therein, together with evidence satisfactory to Lender and
Title Company showing that such parties have been paid (or will be paid from the

will provide or cause to be provided to Title Company all preliminary notices
which are filed by laborers, subcontractors, materialmen and suppliers under
requirements of Governmental Authority, and notify Lender and Title Company
immediately in writing, if Borrower receives any notice, written or oral, from

an Event of Default has not occurred and is continuing,  Borrower shall have ten

released from the applicable real property  records or to post a bond or provide
an indemnity  satisfactory  to Title  Company which will enable Title Company to

indemnity  delivered insuring over such lien. If Borrower fails to so cause such
lien to be released or to post such a bond or deliver  such an  indemnity,  such
failure  shall be an Event of Default  under this  Agreement  and shall  entitle
Lender to  exercise  the  remedies  set forth in Section  4. If, at the time the
lien is filed,  an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing  under
this Agreement,  the filing of the lien shall be an additional  Event of Default
under this Agreement and shall entitle Lender to exercise the remedies set forth
in Section 4,  and Title  Company  shall be  authorized  to take the  corrective
actions with respect to such lien;  provided,  however,  unless the existence of
such lien places the Project in immediate  jeopardy of being  foreclosed,  Title
Company  shall  obtain  the  consent of Lender  prior to taking  any  corrective

shall constitute a waiver of any condition precedent to the obligation of Lender
to make any further Advance or preclude Lender from thereafter declaring the
failure of Borrower to satisfy such condition precedent to be an Event of
Default. The making of an Advance shall not be deemed an approval or acceptance
by Lender of any work or material theretofore completed, installed or delivered.
In the event Borrower&#146;s interest in any of the Property is transferred,
Lender may continue to make Advances to Borrower&#146;s successor in interest
and all sums so advanced shall be deemed Advances hereunder which are evidenced
and secured by the Loan Documents. </P>

to make any Advance are imposed hereby solely for the benefit of Lender, and no
other party may require satisfaction of any such condition precedent or be
entitled to assume that Lender will refuse to make any Advance in the absence of
strict compliance with such conditions precedent. All requirements of this Loan
Agreement may be waived by Lender, in whole or in part, at any time. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U> No Obligation to Make
Advance</U>. Lender shall not be obligated to make any Advance if Lender determines
that such Advance will not be secured by the Mortgage. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Method of
Disbursements</U>. Lender shall have the right to disburse Advances in any manner
deemed acceptable to Lender including, without limitation, pursuant to two (2)
party checks naming Borrower and any third party entitled to receive payment of
any Advance. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Lender&#146;s Approval
of Contractor</U>. As a condition to Lender&#146;s approval of Contractor, which is
a condition of closing under this Loan Agreement, Contractor shall furnish
Lender with a completed Contractor&#146;s Qualification Statement (AIA Form
A305) and such other information required by Lender as a part of Lender&#146;s
due diligence review of Contractor. </P>

contingency, whether by reason of demand or acceleration of the maturity of the

agreed to be paid to Lender exceed the maximum amount permissible under
applicable law. If, from any circumstance whatsoever, interest would otherwise
be payable to Lender in excess of the maximum lawful amount, the interest
payable to Lender shall be reduced to the maximum amount permitted under
applicable law; and if, from any circumstance whatsoever, Lender shall ever
receive anything of value deemed interest by applicable law in excess of the

interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal
of the Loan, such excess shall be refunded to Borrower. All interest paid or
agreed to be paid to Lender shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be
