Mr. Paul Bartlett

Dear Mr. Bartlett:

On behalf of Critical Path, Inc. (the "Company"), I am pleased to offer you the
position of Senior Vice President, Business Development. Speaking for myself, as
well as other members of the Company's management team, we are all very
impressed with your credentials and we look forward to your future success in
this position.

The terms of your employment with the Company are set forth below:

POSITION          You will be a Senior Vice President for the Company, working

                  You agree to the best of your ability and experience that you
                  will at all times loyally and conscientiously perform all of
                  the duties and obligations required of and from you pursuant
                  to the express and implicit terms hereof, and to the
                  reasonable satisfaction of the Company. During the term of
                  your employment, you further agree that you will devote all of
                  your business time and attention to the business of the
                  Company.

START DATE        Subject to fulfillment of any conditions imposed by this

                  orientation.

LENGTH OF         This agreement will terminate in six months from the start
                  date above. However, nothing in this

AGREEMENT         provision changes the at-will nature of the employment
                  relationship.

COMPENSATION      Your base salary will be $250,000.00 on an annualized basis.
                  Your salary will be payable in two equal payments per month
                  pursuant to the Company's regular payroll practices.

                  receive Short-term Disability, Long-term Disability, and Life
                  Insurance. In addition, the Company offers employees the
                  opportunity to participate in its Flexible Spending Account,
                  Employee Assistance Program, 401(k) Plan, and Employee Stock

                  complete years of service. This Paid Time Off will accrue at
                  the rate of 6 hours per pay period, or 12 hours per month.

STOCK OPTIONS     In connection with the commencement of your employment, the
                  Company will recommend that the Employee Stock Compensation
                  Committee and/or Board Compensation Committee grant you an
                  option to purchase 250,000 shares of the Company's Common
                  Stock ("Shares") with an exercise price equal to the closing
                  price of Critical Path's stock on the last trading day prior
                  to your Start Date. These Shares will vest over six months.
                  Vesting will, of course, depend on your continued employment

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND INVENTIONS AGREEMENT

                  Your acceptance of this offer and commencement of employment
                  with the Company is contingent upon the execution and
                  submission of the Company's Proprietary Information and
                  Inventions Agreement ("Proprietary Agreement"), a copy of
                  which has been provided to you with this offer letter.

AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT

                  Notwithstanding the Company's obligation described herein,
                  your employment with the Company will be on an "at-will"
                  basis, meaning that either you or the Company may terminate
                  your employment at any time for any reason or no reason,
                  without further obligation or liability.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE

                  You and the Company ("the parties") agree that any dispute
                  arising out of or related to the employment relationship
                  between them, including the termination of that relationship
                  and any allegations of unfair or discriminatory treatment
                  arising under state or federal law or otherwise, that cannot
                  be resolved through the Company's informal grievance
                  procedure, shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration
                  in San Francisco, California, except where the law
                  specifically forbids the use of arbitration as a final and
                  binding remedy. The following dispute resolution shall apply:

                  (a)   The complainant shall provide the other party with a
                        written statement of the claim identifying any
                        supporting witnesses or documents and the requested
                        relief.

                  (b)   The respondent shall furnish a statement of the relief,
                        if any, that it is willing to provide, and identify
                        supporting witnesses or documents. If the matter is not
                        resolved, the parties shall submit the dispute to
                        nonbinding mediation, paid for by the Company, before a
                        mediator to be selected by the parties.

                  (c)   If the matter is not resolved through mediation, the
                        parties agree that the dispute shall be resolved by
                        binding arbitration. If the parties are unable to
                        jointly select an arbitrator, they will obtain a list of
                        arbitrators in San Francisco County, California, from
                        the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and
                        select an arbitrator by striking names from that list.

                  (d)   The arbitrator shall have the authority to determine
                        whether the conduct complained of in section (a) of this
                        section violates the complainant's rights and, if so, to
                        grant any relief authorized by law; subject to the
                        exclusions of section (g) below. The arbitrator shall
                        not have the authority to modify, change, or refuse to
                        enforce the terms of any employment agreement between
                        the parties, or change any lawful policy or benefit
                        plan.

                  (e)   The Company shall bear the costs of the arbitration if
                        you prevail. If the Company prevails, you will pay half
                        the cost of the arbitration or $500, whichever is less.
                        Each party shall pay its own attorney's fees, unless the
                        arbitrator orders otherwise pursuant to applicable law.

                  (f)   ARBITRATION SHALL BE THE EXCLUSIVE FINAL REMEDY FOR ANY
                        DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES, SUCH AS DISPUTES INVOLVING
                        CLAIMS FOR DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT (SUCH AS CLAIMS
                        UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT, TITLE VII OF
                        THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964, THE AMERICANS WITH
                        DISABILITIES ACT, OR THE AGE DISCRIMINATION IN
                        EMPLOYMENT ACT), WRONGFUL TERMINATION, BREACH OF
                        CONTRACT, BREACH OF PUBLIC POLICY, PHYSICAL OR MENTAL
                        HARM OR DISTRESS, OR ANY OTHER

<PAGE>

                        DISPUTES, AND THE PARTIES AGREE THAT NO DISPUTE SHALL BE
                        SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION WHERE THE COMPLAINANT HAS NOT
                        COMPLIED WITH THE PRELIMINARY STEPS PROVIDED FOR IN
                        SECTIONS (a) AND (b) ABOVE.

                  (g)   The parties agree that the arbitration award shall be
                        enforceable in any court having jurisdiction to enforce
                        this agreement, so long as the arbitrator's findings of
                        fact are supported by substantial evidence on the whole
                        and the arbitrator has not made errors of law; however,
                        either party may bring an action in a court of competent
                        jurisdiction regarding or related to inventions that you
                        may claim to have developed prior to joining the
                        Company, pursuant to California Labor Code Section 2870
                        ("Disputes Related to Inventions"). The parties further
                        agree that for Disputes Related to Inventions which the
                        parties have elected to submit to arbitration, each
                        party retains the right to seek preliminary injunctive
                        relief in court in order to preserve the status quo or
                        prevent irreparable injury before the matter can be
                        heard in arbitration.
