                                     TO THE
                           1999 CONTRACT FOR SERVICES
                                     BETWEEN
                THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES COMMISSION AND HMO


This Amendment No. 10 is entered into between the Health and Human Services
Commission (HHSC) and Superior Health Plan, Inc. (HMO) in Bexar Service Area, to
amend the 1999 Contract for Services between the Health and Human Services
Commission and HMO. The effective date of this Amendment is the date HHSC Signs

The Parties agree to amend the Contract as follows:

1.       ARTICLE XVIII IS AMENDED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:

15.2              AMENDMENT AND CHANGE REQUEST PROCESS

15.2.1            HHSC and HMO may amend this contract if reductions in funding
                  or appropriations make full performance by either party
                  impracticable or impossible, and amendment could provide a
                  reasonable alternative to termination. If HMO does not agree
                  to the amendment, the contract may be terminated under Article
                  XVIII.

15.2.2            This contract must be amended if either party discovers a
                  material omission of a negotiated or required term, which is
                  essential to the successful performance or maintaining
                  compliance with the terms of the contract. The party
                  discovering the omission must notify the other party of the
                  omission in writing as soon as possible after discovery. If
                  there is a disagreement regarding whether the omission was
                  intended to be a term of the contract, the parties must submit
                  the dispute to dispute resolution under Article 15.9.

15.2.3            This contract may be amended at any time by mutual agreement.

15.2.4            All amendments to this contract must be in writing and signed
                  by both parties.

15.2.5            Any change in either party's obligations under this contract
                  ("Change") requires a written amendment to the contract that
                  is negotiated using the process outlined in Article 15.2.6.

15.2.6.1          If federal or state laws, rules, regulations, policies or
                  guidelines are adopted, promulgated, judicially interpreted or
                  changed, or if contracts are entered into or changed, the
                  effect of which is to alter the ability of either party to
                  fulfill its obligations under this contract, the parties will

                  written notice describing the proposed Change which includes
                  the State's estimated fiscal impact on the HMO, if available
                  ("Change Order Request"). HMO must respond to such proposal
                  within 30 calendar days of receipt by preparing and delivering
                  to HHSC, at no additional cost to HHSC a written document (a

                  the HMO and the manner in which such impact was calculated;

15.2.6.2.2.2      The effect, if any, of the Change Order Request on HMO's
                  performance of its obligations under this contract, including
                  the effect on the services or deliverables;

                  for a Change Order Response. HHSC must respond to HMO within
                  30 calendar days of receipt of this information.

15.2.6.2.4        Upon HHSC's receipt of a Change Order Request or a Change
                  Order Response, the Parties shall negotiate a resolution of
                  the requested Change in good faith. The parties will exchange
                  information in good faith in an attempt to agree upon the
                  requested Change.

October 30, 2001                                                          2 of 3

15.2.6.3          No Change to the services or deliverables or any other aspect
                  of this contract will become effective without the written
                  approval and execution of a mutually agreeable written
                  amendment to this contract by HHSC and the HMO. Under no
                  circumstances will the HMO be entitled to payment for any work
                  or services rendered under a Change Order that has not been
                  approved by HHSC in accordance with the Change Order
                  Procedures.

15.2.7            The implementation of an amendment to this contract is subject
                  to the approval of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
                  Services (CMS, formerly called HCFA).

2.       APPENDIX C: Appendix C is deleted in its entirety and is replaced by a
         new Appendix C which is Attachment No. 1 to this amendment. This
         amendment provides for the removal of "Special Programs for Illness"

                                AMENDMENT NO. 11
                                     TO THE
                           1999 CONTRACT FOR SERVICES
                                     BETWEEN
                  HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES COMMISSION AND HMO

This Amendment No. 11 is entered into between the Health and Human Services
Commission (HHSC) and Superior Health Plan, Inc. (HMO), to amend the 1999
Contract for Services between the Health and Human Services Commission and HMO
in the Bexar Service Area. The effective date of this amendment is January 1,
2002. The Parties agree to amend the Contract as follows:

1. Article XIII is amended to read as follows:

ARTICLE XIII       PAYMENT PROVISIONS

13.1              CAPITATION AMOUNTS

13.1.2            HMO capitation rates listed below reflect program increases
                  appropriated by the 76th and 77th legislatures for physician
                  services (to include THSteps providers) and outpatient
                  facility services. Rates will be increased starting January 1,
                  2002, to reflect increases in traditional fee-for-service
                  payments for 1) Evaluation and Management Level 3 services
                  (procedure code 99213), and 2) high-volume providers. The
                  methodology for determining high-volume providers will be
                  distributed to HMO by HHSC ("High-volume Provider
                  Methodology"). The first rate increase will be effective
                  January 1, 2002, and will reflect increases for procedure code
                  99213. Rate increases for high volume providers will be
                  effective the first day of the month after the "High-volume
                  Provider Methodology" is released by HHSC. The Methodology
                  will state the amount of each increase (99213 and high-volume
                  provider). Final rates with all increases included are shown
                  in the table below.

13.1.2.           HMO must submit reports to HHSC indicating the methodology
                  used and must certify that the funds provided to the HMO for
                  the pass through have been passed through to providers. HMO
                  must use the reporting format specified by HHSC and follow the
                  reporting schedule indicated on the HHSC deliverables matrix.

                                                    PPAC Rate Increase Amendment
                                                                        12/12/01

                  only deliveries for which HMO has made a payment for the
                  delivery, to either a hospital or other provider. No DSP will

                  printed or distributed. These modifications can be made at the

                  that an unaltered copy of the original claim received can be
                  produced upon request; 3) the retention system is reliable and
                  supported by a retrieval system that allows reasonable

                  Public Law 104-191, regarding submitting and receiving claims
                  information through electronic data interchange (EDI) that
                  allows for automated processing and adjudication of claims
                  within two or three years, as applicable, from the date the

                  information, records, and data (Member Information) collected
                  or provided to HMO by HHSC or another state agency is

(HUBS)

     Sections 5.6.1 through 5.6.3 are replaced with the following language:

                           "5.6.1 In accordance with Texas Government Code
                  Chapter 2161 and 1 TAC ss.111.11 et seq. and ss.392.100 state
                  agencies are required to make a good faith effort to assist
                  Historically Underutilized Businesses (HUBs) in receiving
                  contract awards issued by the State. The goal of this program
                  is to promote full and equal business opportunity for all
                  businesses in contracting with the state. It is HHSC's intent
                  that all contractors make a good faith effort to subcontract
                  with HUBs during the performance of their contracts.

                           IMPORTANT NOTE: The Health and Human Services
                  Commission has concluded that HUB subcontracting opportunities
                  may exist in connection with this contract. See Appendix B to
                  the Agreement for the following instructions and form:
                  "Grant/Contract Applicants Client Services HUB Subcontracting
                  Plan Instructions" (C-IGA), and Determination of Good Faith
                  Effort for Grant Contracts (C-DGFE). If an approved HUB
                  subcontracting plan is not already on file with HHSC, THE HMO
                  SHALL SUBMIT A COMPLETED C-DGFE FORM ALONG WITH THE SIGNED
                  CONTRACT OR RENEWAL.

                           If HMO responds, 'yes' to question two on Form
                  C-DGFE, HMO shall document good faith efforts to develop a HUB
                  Subcontracting Plan by completing and documenting the steps on
                  form C-DGFE. Additionally, quarterly reports on HUB
                  subcontracting are required according to the schedule on Form
                  C-QSR. Quarterly Report forms are included in Appendix B of
                  this amendment.

                           If HMO decides after the award to subcontract any
                  part of the contract, the HMO shall notify the contract
                  manager prior to entering into any subcontract. The HMO shall
                  comply with the good faith effort requirements relating to
                  developing and submitting a subcontracting plan.

                           5.6.2 HMO is required to submit HUB quarterly reports
                  to HHSC as required in Article 12.11.

                           5.6.3 HHSC will assist HMO in meeting the contracting
                  and reporting requirements of this Article."

                           6.3.7 For purposes of this Section 6.3, a Member
                  "loses Medicaid eligibility" when:

                           6.3.7.1 Medicaid eligibility is terminated and never
                  regained under one Medicaid Type Program with no subsequent
                  transfer of eligibility to another Medicaid Type Program; or

                           6.3.7.2 Medicaid eligibility is terminated and there
                  is a lapse of at least one month in regular Medicaid coverage.
                  The term "regular Medicaid coverage" refers to either
                  traditional fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care
                  coverage; or

                           6.3.7.3 A client re-applies for Medicaid eligibility
                  and is certified for prior Medicaid coverage, as defined by
                  TDHS, for any month(s) prior to the month of application. The
                  term "prior Medicaid coverage" refers to Applicants who are
                  eligible for Medicaid coverage during the three-month period
                  before the month they apply for TANF or Medical Programs.
                  Prior Medicaid coverage may be continuous or there may be
                  interrupted periods of eligibility involving all or some of
                  the certified Members.

                           Administrative process limitations within the State's
                  application and recertification process do not constitute a
                  "loss of Medicaid eligibility".

SECTION 2.15 MODIFICATION OF SECTION 6.4. CONTINUITY OF CARE AND OUT-OF-NETWORK
PROVIDERS

         Section 6.4.3 is replaced with the following language:

                           "6.4.3 HMO must pay a Member's existing
                  out-of-network providers for covered services until the
                  Member's records, clinical information and care can be
                  transferred to a network provider. Payment must be made within
                  the time period required for network providers. This Article
                  does not extend the obligation of HMO to reimburse the
                  Member's existing out-of-network providers for on-going care
                  for more than 90 days after Member enrolls in HMO or for more
                  than nine months in the case of a Member who at the time of
                  enrollment in HMO has been diagnosed with and receiving
                  treatment for a terminal illness. The obligation of HMO to
                  reimburse the Member's existing out-of-network provider for
                  services provided to a pregnant Member with 12 weeks or less
                  remaining before the expected delivery date extends through
                  delivery of the child, immediate postpartum care, and the
                  follow-up checkup within the first six weeks of delivery.

                           6.4.3.1 HMO will pay reasonable and customary rates
                  for all out-of-network provider claims with dates of service
                  between September 1, 2002 and November 30, 2002. HMO must
                  forward any complaints submitted by out-of-network providers
                  during this time to HHSC. HHSC will review all complaints and
                  determine whether payments were reasonable and customary. HHSC
                  will direct the HMO to pay a reasonable and customary amount,
                  as determined by HHSC, if it concludes that the payments were
                  not reasonable and customary for the provider. Failure to
                  comply with this provision constitutes a default under Article
                  XVI, Default and Remedies.

                           6.4.3.2 For all out-of-network provider claims with
                  dates of service on or after December 1, 2002, HMO must pay
                  providers a reasonable and

                  customary amount consistent with a methodology approved by
                  HHSC. HMO must submit its methodology, along with any
                  supporting documentation, to HHSC by September 30, 2002. HHSC
                  will review and respond to the information by November 15,
                  2002. HMO must forward any complaints by out-of-network
                  providers submitted after December 1, 2002 to HHSC, which will
                  review all complaints. If HHSC determines that payment is not
                  consistent with the HMO's approved methodology, the HMO must
                  pay the provider a rate, using the approved reasonable and
                  customary methodology, as determined by HHSC. Failure to
                  comply with this provision constitutes a default under Article
                  XVI, Default and Remedies.

                  pay a reasonable and customary amount for emergency services.

                           HMO will pay a reasonable and customary amount for
                  services for all out-of-network emergency services provider
                  claims with dates of service between September 1, 2002 and
                  November 30, 2002. HMO must forward any complaints submitted
                  by out-of-network emergency services providers during this
                  time to HHSC. HHSC will review all complaints and determine
                  whether payments were reasonable and customary. HHSC will
                  direct the HMO to pay a reasonable and customary amount, as
                  determined by HHSC, if it concludes that the payments were not

                  provider claims with dates of service on or after December 1,
                  2002, HMO must pay providers a reasonable and customary amount
                  consistent with a methodology approved by HHSC. HMO must
                  submit its methodology, along with any supporting
                  documentation, to HHSC by September 30, 2002. HHSC will review
                  and respond to the information by November 15, 2002. HMO must
                  forward any complaints by out-of-network emergency services
                  providers submitted after December 1, 2002 to HHSC, which will
                  review all complaints. If HHSC determines that payment is not
                  consistent with the HMO's approved methodology, the HMO must
                  pay the emergency services provider a rate, using the approved
                  reasonable and customary methodology, as determined by HHSC.

                  all STAR Medicaid service areas contracted between the State
                  and HMO.

                  determination of Net Income Before Taxes reported in the Final
                  MCFS Report; however, HMO may subtract from Net Income Before
                  Taxes, expenses incurred for value added services for the
                  experience rebate calculations.

                           13.2.5   There will be two settlements for payment(s)

                  shall equal 100 percent of the experience rebate as derived
                  from Net Income Before Taxes less the value-added services
                  expenses in the first final MCFS Report and shall be paid on
                  the same day the first final MCFS Report is submitted to HHSC
                  for the specified time period. The second settlement shall be
                  an adjustment to the first settlement and shall be paid to
                  HHSC on the same day that the second final MCFS Report is
                  submitted to HHSC for that specified time period if the
                  adjustment is a payment from HMO to HHSC. If the adjustment is
                  a payment from HHSC to HMO, HHSC shall pay such adjustment to
                  HMO within thirty (30) days of receipt of the second final
                  MCFS Report. HHSC or its agent may audit the MCFS report. If
                  HHSC determines that corrections to the MCFS reports are
                  required, based on a audit of other documentation acceptable
                  to HHSC, to determine an adjustment to the amount of the
                  second settlement, then

                  final adjustment shall be made within three years from the
                  date that HMO submits the second final MCFS report. HMO must
                  pay the first and second settlements on the due dates for the
                  first and second final MCFS reports respectively as identified
                  in Article 12.1.4. HHSC may adjust the experience rebate if
                  HHSC determines HMO has paid affiliates amounts for goods or
                  services that are higher than the fair market value of the
                  goods and services in the service area. Fair market value may
                  be based on the amount HMO pays a non-affiliate(s) or the
                  amount another HMO pays for the same or similar service in the
                  service area. HHSC has final authority in auditing and
                  determining the amount of the experience rebate."

                  "13.2.1  HMO must pay to HHSC an experience rebate for each
         Experience Rebate Period. HMO will calculate the experience rebate in
         accordance with the tiered rebate formula listed below based on Net
         Income Before Taxes (excess of allowable revenues over allowable

                  13.2.2   Carry Forward of Prior Experience Rebate Period
         Losses: Losses incurred for one Experience Rebate Period can only be
         carried forward as an offset to Net Income Before Taxes in the next
         Experience Rebate Period.

                  13.2.2.1 HMO shall calculate the experience rebate by
         applying the experience rebate formula in Article 13.2.1 as follows:

                  For the 1st Experience Rebate Period, to the Net Income
         Before Taxes for each STAR Medicaid service area contracted between
         HHSC and HMO. The HMO will separately calculate the experience rebate
         for each service area, and losses in one service area cannot be used
         to offset Net Income Before Taxes in another service area. Losses from
         the 1st Experience Rebate Period can be carried forward to the 2nd
         Experience Rebate Period for the same service area.

                  For the 2nd Experience Rebate Period, to the sum of the Net
         Income Before Taxes for all STAR Medicaid service areas contracted
         between HHSC and HMO. Losses from the 2nd Experience Rebate Period can
         be carried forward to the 3rd Experience Rebate Period.

                  For the 3rd Experience Rebate Period, to the sum of the Net
         Income Before Taxes for all CHIP, STAR Medicaid, and STAR+PLUS
         Medicaid service areas contracted between HHSC or TDHS and HMO.

                  13.2.3   Experience rebate will be based on a pre-tax basis.
         Expenses for value-added services are excluded from the determination


HHSC Contract 529-03-042          Page 2 of 4

         of Net Income Before Taxes reported in the Final MCFS Report; however,
         HMO may subtract from Net Income Before Taxes, expenses incurred for
         value added services for the experience rebate calculations.

                  13.2.4   Population-Based Initiatives (PBIs) and Experience
         Rebates: HMO may subtract from an experience rebate owed to HHSC,
         expenses for population-based health initiatives that have been
         approved by HHSC. A PBI is a project or program designed to improve
         some aspect of quality of care, quality of life, or health care
         knowledge for the Medicaid population that may also benefit the
         community as a whole. Value-added service does not constitute a PBI.
         Contractually required services and activities do not constitute a
         PBI.

                  13.2.5   There will be two settlements for payment(s) of the
         experience rebate for the 1st Experience Rebate Period, two
         settlements for payment(s) of the experience rebate for the 2nd
         Experience Rebate Period, and two settlements for payment(s) of the
         experience rebate for the 3rd Experience Rebate Period. Settlement
         payments are payable to HHSC. The first settlement for the specified
         Experience Rebate Period shall equal 100 percent of the experience
         rebate as derived from Net Income Before Taxes reduced by any
         value-added services expenses in the first Final MCFS Report and shall
         be paid on the same day that the first Final MCFS Report is submitted
         to HHSC for the specified time period. The second settlement shall be
         an adjustment to the first settlement and shall be paid on the same
         day that the second Final MCFS Report is submitted to HHSC for that
         specified time period if the adjustment is a payment from HMO to HHSC.
         If the adjustment is a payment from HHSC to HMO, HHSC shall pay such
         adjustment to HMO within thirty (30) days of receipt of the second
         Final MCFS Report. HHSC or its agent may audit the MCFS Reports. If
         HHSC determines that corrections to the MCFS Reports are required,
         based on an audit of other documentation acceptable to HHSC, to
         determine an adjustment to the amount of the second settlement, then
         final adjustment shall be made within three (3) years from the date
         that HMO submits the second Final MCFS Report. HMO must pay the first
         and second settlements on the due dates for the first and second Final
         MCFS Reports, respectively, as identified in Article 12.1.4. HHSC may
         adjust the experience rebate if HHSC determines HMO has paid (an)
         affiliate(s) amounts for goods or services that are higher than the
         fair market value of the goods and services in the service area. Fair
         market value may be based on the amount HMO pays (a) non-affiliate(s)
         or the amount another HMO pays for the same or similar goods and
         services in the service area. HHSC has final authority in auditing and
         determining the amount of the experience rebate."

            ARTICLE 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES

         The Parties contract and agree that the terms of the Agreement will
remain in effect and continue to govern except to the extent modified in this
Amendment.
