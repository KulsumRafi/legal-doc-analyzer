The Members of Official Committee of
Unsecured Creditors of NTL Incorporated

NTL Incorporated
110 East 59th Street
New York, NY  10022


Ladies and Gentlemen:


This letter sets forth our proposal for Quest Turnaround Advisors, L.L.C.
("Quest"), to provide the consulting services of its personnel to the Official
Committee of Unsecured Creditors of NTL Incorporated (the "Creditors'
Committee") in order to maximize and realize the value of Euroco an entity that
will be formed upon consummation of NTL Incorporated's Plan of Reorganization
(the "Plan").



APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTATION

We are prepared to commence work immediately as consultants to assist the
Creditors' Committee on those matters pursuant to this engagement letter.

As consultants to the Creditors' Committee with respect to Euroco, we believe
careful consideration should be extended to confirmation of necessary resources
and the composition of the management team. Particular attention should also be
extended to ensuring that Euroco has all necessary transitional IT and back
office service agreements in place necessary to conduct its affairs. We would
review the proposed agreements and provide suggestions to enhance Euroco's
ability to operate its affairs.

Additionally, Quest will assist in the development and implementation of a
cohesive communication plan for managers and employees in operating
subsidiaries, and for partners/co-investors, to convey managerial control and
direction.



<PAGE>

STAFFING

Jeffrey Brodsky, Mina Gerowin and Robert Schmitz will provide their services on
behalf of Quest, drawing on other Quest personnel if required for additional
support. Collectively, our team brings deep experience in the Cable TV industry,
knowledge of doing business in Europe, particularly in Switzerland and Germany,
experience in the type of transactions required to sell and liquidate assets and
general management know-how. A copy of each individual's bio is attached to this
proposal in Exhibit A.


FEES AND EXPENSES

Quest's fees would be based on Quest's hourly billing rates plus reimbursement
of expenses. As Managing Directors, Mr. Brodsky, Ms. Gerowin and Mr. Schmitz
bill at $400 per hour for actual hours worked but will not charge for travel
time. In addition, Quest will be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses including airfare (Business Class to Europe), lodging, meals, local
transportation and other required miscellaneous expenses. In addition Quest will
be entitled to reimbursement of its reasonable counsel's fees in connection with
assisting and advising Quest on issues regarding Quest's retention by the
Committee.

Upon approval of our engagement and this agreement by the Bankruptcy Court, as
provided below, NTL Incorporated ("NTL") will pay Quest, on behalf of the
Creditors' Committee, its fees and expenses incurred and approved by the
Bankruptcy Court upon application(s) made by Quest pursuant to the Bankruptcy
Code, the Bankruptcy Rules and local rules of the Bankruptcy Court.


TERM

The term of this engagement shall commence upon the signing of this agreement
and shall continue until the Plan is consummated; provided that this agreement
may be terminated in writing at any time by either party on 10 days' notice.
This agreement may only be amended in writing.


INDEMNIFICATION

The Indemnification Provisions (including the choice of law and related
provisions contained therein) immediately following the signature page hereto
are incorporated herein by reference and shall be deemed also to be an
obligation of NTL and its estate upon the approval of this letter agreement by
the Bankruptcy Court. Termination of this engagement shall not effect these
indemnification provisions, which, so long as the letter agreement is approved
by the Bankruptcy Court, shall hereafter remain operative and in full force and
effect.

<PAGE>



BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVAL

This agreement and the obligations of the Creditors' Committee and NTL to
perform hereunder are expressly subject to prior approval of the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York and the fee application
process for professionals.

We understand the importance of accomplishing the Creditors' Committee's goals
with respect to managing Euroco's assets and look forward to assisting you.


Very truly yours,

Quest Turnaround Advisors, L.L.C.

                          Indemnification Provisions

A.       As a material part of the consideration for Quest to furnish its
         services under this Agreement, in the event that Quest becomes
         involved in any capacity in any claim, suit, action, proceeding,
         investigation or inquiry (including, without limitation, any
         shareholder or derivative action or arbitration proceeding)
         (collectively, a "Proceeding") in connection with any matter in any
         way relating to or referred to in this Agreement or arising out of
         the matters contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
         limitation, related services and activities prior to the date of this
         Agreement, NTL agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Quest harmless to
         the fullest extent permitted by law, from and against any losses,
         claims, damages, liabilities and expenses in connection with any
         matter in any way relating to or referred to in this Agreement or
         arising out of the matters contemplated by this Agreement, including,
         without limitation, related services and activities prior to the date
         of this Agreement, except to the extent that it shall be determined
         by a court of competent jurisdiction in a judgment that has become
         final in that it is no longer subject to appeal or other review that
         such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses resulted
         solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Quest. In
         addition, in the event that Quest becomes involved in any capacity in
         any Proceeding in connection with any matter in any way relating to
         or referred to in this Agreement or arising out of the matters
         contemplated by this Agreement, NTL will reimburse Quest for its
         legal and other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and
         preparation) as such expenses are incurred by Quest in connection
         therewith. If such indemnification were not to be available for any
         reason, NTL agrees to contribute to the losses, claims, damages,
         liabilities and expenses involved (i) in the proportion appropriate
         to reflect the relative benefits received or sought to be received by
         NTL and its securityholders (including any noteholders) and
         affiliates and other constituencies, on the one hand, and Quest, on
         the other hand, in connection with the matters contemplated by this
         Agreement or (ii) if (but only if and to the extent) the allocation
         provided for in clause (i) is for any reason held unenforceable, in
         such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative
         benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of NTL
         and its securityholders (including any noteholders) and affiliates
         and other constituencies, on the one hand, and the party entitled to
         contribution, on the other hand, as well as any other relevant
         equitable considerations. NTL agrees that for the purposes of this
         paragraph the relative benefits received, or sought to be received,
         by NTL and its securityholders (including any noteholders) and
         affiliates and other constituencies, on the one hand, and the party
         entitled to contribution, on the other hand, in connection with the
         matters contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the
         same proportion that the total value received or paid or contemplated
         to be received or paid by NTL or its securityholders (including any
         noteholders) or affiliates and other constituencies, as the case may
         be, as a result of or in connection with the matters for which Quest
         has been retained to perform consulting services bears to the fees
         paid to Quest under this Agreement; provided, that, in no event shall
         NTL contribute less than the amount necessary to assure that Quest is
         not liable for losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses in
         excess of the amount of fees actually received by Quest pursuant to
         this Agreement. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to,
         among other things, whether any alleged untrue statement or omission
         or any other alleged conduct relates to information provided by NTL
         or other conduct by NTL (or its employees or other agents), on the
         one hand, or by Quest (or its employees or other agents), on the
         other hand. NTL will not settle any Proceeding in respect of which
         indemnity may be sought hereunder, whether or not Quest is an actual
         or potential party to such Proceeding, without Quest's prior written
         consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed
         provided that the
<PAGE>

         settlement includes a release for Quest from all losses, claims,
         damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of such Proceeding).
         For purposes of this Agreement, Quest shall include Quest, any of its
         affiliates, each other person, if any, controlling Quest or any of
         its affiliates, their respective officers, current and former
         directors, employees and agents, and the successors and assigns of
         all of the foregoing persons. The foregoing indemnity and
         contribution agreement shall be in addition to any rights that any
         indemnified party may have at common law or otherwise.

B.       NTL and the Creditors' Committee (for itself and its members) agree
         that neither Quest nor any of its affiliates, directors, agents,
         employees or controlling persons shall have any liability to NTL, its
         securityholders (including any noteholders), the Creditors' Committee
         or any person asserting claims on behalf of or in right of NTL or the
         Creditors' Committee in connection with or as a result of either
         Quest's engagement under this Agreement or any matter referred to in
         this Agreement, including, without limitation, related services and
         activities prior to the date of this Agreement, except to the extent
         that it shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
         judgment that has become final in that it is no longer subject to
         appeal or other review, that any losses, claims, damages, liabilities
         or expenses incurred by the Creditors' Committee resulted solely from
         the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Quest in performing the
         services that are the subject of this Agreement.

C.       THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR DISPUTE OF ANY KIND OR
         NATURE WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS
         AGREEMENT ("CLAIM"), DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
         CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
         INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE NEW
         YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW, NO CLAIM MAY
         BE COMMENCED, PROSECUTED OR CONTINUED IN ANY COURT OTHER THAN IN
         COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK LOCATED IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF NEW
         YORK OR IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOURTHERN
         DISTRICT OF NEW YORK OR THE BANKRUPTCY COURT, WHICH COURTS SHALL HAVE
         EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER THE ADJUDICATION OF SUCH MATTERS, AND
         NTL, THE CREDITORS' COMMITTEE AND QUEST CONSENT TO THE JURISDICTION
         OF SUCH COURTS AND PERSONAL SERVICE WITH RESPECT THERETO. NTL HEREBY
         CONSENTS TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION, SERVICE AND VENUE IN ANY COURT IN
         WHICH ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS
         AGREEMENT IS BROUGHT BY ANY THIRD PARTY AGAINST QUEST OR ANY
         INDEMNIFIED PARTY. EACH OF QUEST, NTL AND CREDITORS' COMMITTEE WAIVE
         ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
         BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR
         RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. NTL AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY
         PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT SHALL BE
         CONCLUSIVE AND BINDING UPON NTL AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY OTHER
         COURTS TO THE JURISDICTION OF WHICH NTL IS OR MAY BE SUBJECT, BY SUIT
         UPON SUCH JUDGMENT.
