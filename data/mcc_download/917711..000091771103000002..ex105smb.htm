If a Participant is entitled to a Transaction Bonus as provided in Section 4.1, the Company shall pay such Participant (or in the event of the Participant's death, his or her Beneficiary), an amount which, when added to severance amounts received by the Participant under the Employment Agreement or, if the Participant has not received severance amounts under the Employment Agreement, then such severance amount (as determined by the Special Committee no later than the Transaction Date) that the Participant would have been entitled to receive in accordance with the Employment Agreement had the Participant's employment with the Company terminated, equals three times the Participant's Total Compensation for Dennis W. Alexander, Esq. and Thomas F. Schwartz and two times the Participant's Total Compensation for Bruno R. Dunn; provided, however, that such amount shall not be less than one times the Participant's Total Compensation.  Any payment under this Section 4.2 shall be independent of, and in addition to, any amounts due and payable to the Participant under the performance bonus plan, the Cogentrix Energy, Inc.

<BR>
To the extent that a Participant is not entitled to a Transaction Bonus under Section 4.1, an amount equal to the amount of a Transaction Bonus under this Section 4.2, which the Participant would have received had the Participant been entitled to such payment under Section 4.1, shall be added to the amount payable under the Cogentrix Energy, Inc. Variable Transaction Bonus Program and allocated according to the terms of such program.<BR>
<BR>
The Participant's Transaction Bonus shall be paid in a lump sum in cash no later than ten days after his or her Payment Date or, in the case of a termination of employment entitling the Participant to a Transaction Bonus under Section 4.1(b), the later of the Transaction Date or the date of the Participant's termination of employment.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Payment Obligations Absolute</U>.

</U><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Legal Fees and Expenses</U>.  If a Participant institutes any legal action in seeking to obtain or enforce, or is required to defend in any legal action the validity or enforceability of, any right or benefit provided by this Program, the Company shall reimburse the Participant for all reasonable costs and expenses relating to such legal action, including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses incurred by such Participant, provided that such legal action results in either (a) a settlement requiring the Company  to make a payment to the Participant or (b) a judgment or order in whole or in part in favor of the Participant, regardless of whether such judgment or order is subsequently reversed on appeal or in a collateral proceeding.  In no event shall the Participant be required to reimburse the Company for any of the costs and expenses relating to such legal action.  The Company's obligations under this Section 7.1 shall survive the termination of this Program.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Employment Status</U>.  This Program does not constitute a contract of employment or impose on the Company any obligation to retain the Participant as an Employee, to change the status of the Participant's employment, or to change the Company's policies or those of its subsidiaries' regarding termination of employment.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Validity and Severability</U>.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of the Program shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of the Program, which shall remain in full force and effect, and any prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Governing Law</U>.  The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of the Program shall in all respects be governed by the laws of North Carolina, without reference to principles of conflict of law.<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Claims Procedure</U>.  If an Employee or former Employee makes a written request alleging a right to receive benefits under the Program or alleging a right to receive an adjustment in benefits being paid under the Program, the Company shall treat it as a claim for benefits.  All claims for Transaction Bonuses under the Program shall be sent to the Human Resources Department of the Company and must be received within 30 days after the Payment Date or the date of termination of employment, as applicable.  If the Company determines that any individual who has claimed a right to receive a Transaction Bonus under the Program is not entitled to receive all or any part of the benefits claimed, it will inform the claimant in writing of its determination and the reasons therefor in terms calculated to be understood by the claimant.  The notice will be sent within 30 days of the written request, unless the Company determines additional time, not exceeding 45 days, is needed.  The notice shall make specific reference to the pertinent Program provisions on which the denial is based, and describe any additional material or information that is necessary.  Such notice shall, in addition, inform the claimant what procedure the claimant should follow to take advantage of the review procedures set forth below in the event the claimant desires to contest the denial of the claim.  The claimant may, within 90 days thereafter, submit in writing to the Company a notice that the claimant contests the denial of his or her claim by the Company and desires a further review.  The Company shall, within 30 days thereafter, review the claim and authorize the claimant to appear personally and review pertinent documents and submit issues and comments relating to the claim to the persons responsible for making the determination on behalf of the Company.  The Company will render its final decision with specific reasons therefor in writing and will transmit it to the claimant within 30 days of the written request for review, unless the Company determines additional time, not exceeding 30 days, is needed, and so notifies the Participant.  If the Company fails to respond to a claim filed in accordance with the foregoing within 30 days or any such extended period, the Company shall be deemed to have denied the claim.<BR>
<BR>

All payments pursuant to the Program shall be made from the general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be established or other segregation of assets made to assure payment.  No Participant or other person shall have under any circumstances any interest in any particular property or assets of the Company as a result of participating in the Program.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may (but shall not be obligated to) create one or more grantor trusts, the assets of which are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors, to assist it in accumulating funds to pay its obligations under the Program.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Tax Withholding</U>.  Any payment provided for hereunder shall be paid net of any applicable tax withholding required under federal, state, local or foreign law.<BR>
