                  (i)      After giving effect to (A) the issuance of any
         Indebtedness on any date, (B) the making of any Restricted Payment or

         together with its Subsidiaries is Solvent.

                  (ii)     To the best knowledge of the UK Borrower, on each
         date on which Receivables will be assigned by the Italian Receivables
         Seller to the UK Borrower under the terms of the Receivables Sale
         Agreement between the Italian Receivables Seller and the UK Borrower,

         14.14, this Section 6.01(t)(ii) will be construed in accordance with
         the laws of the Republic of Italy.

                  2.3      ADDITION OF SECTION 7.14. The following new Section
     7.14 of the Credit Agreement is hereby added to Article VII of the Credit
     Agreement:

                  7.14     Solvency of Italian Receivables Seller. Each Borrower
         shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in writing
         promptly upon such Borrower's learning that any representation and
         warranty given by the UK Borrower in Section 6.01(t)(ii) is false or
         misleading in any respect.

                  2.4      ADDITION OF SECTION 12.09(f). The following new
     Section 12.09(f) of the Credit Agreement is hereby added to Article XII of
     the Credit Agreement:

                  (f)      Italian Pledges. For the purpose of the Italian
         Pledges only, in connection with the Obligations of each Borrower
         towards any Obligee, each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that
         CNAI shall, to the extent CNAI is not a creditor itself in respect of
         such Obligations, be a "joint and several co-creditor" with such
         Obligee in respect of such Obligations. Accordingly, CNAI shall be
         entitled to demand as a creditor performance in full of such
         Obligations by the relevant Borrower owing the same, whereby
         satisfaction of such Obligations owed to one creditor (either CNAI or
         the relevant Obligee) shall release such Borrower from its obligations
         to the other creditor.

         3.       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The Borrowers hereby represent

Amendment Effective Date, no Event of Default or Default has occurred and is
