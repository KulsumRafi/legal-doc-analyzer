</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1 The Committee. The Plan will be administered by the Board or by a
committee of the Board. So long as the Company has a class of its equity
securities registered under Section&nbsp;12 of the Exchange Act, any committee
administering the Plan will consist solely of two or more members of the Board
who are &#147;non-employee directors&#148; within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;16b-3 under the
Exchange Act and, if the Board so determines in its sole discretion, who are
&#147;outside directors&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. Such a
committee, if established, will act by majority approval of the members (but
may also take action with the written consent of a majority of the members of
such committee), and a majority of the members of such a committee will
constitute a quorum. As used in the Plan, &#147;Committee&#148; will refer to the Board
or to such a committee, if established; provided, however, that with respect to
the grant of any Incentive Award to a Participant who is then a Committee
Member, and to any action that may be taken hereunder by the Committee
regarding any such Incentive Award for so long as such Participant is a
Committee Member, such action may be taken only by the Board. To the extent
consistent with corporate law, the Committee may delegate to any officers of
the Company the duties, power and authority of the Committee under the Plan
pursuant to such conditions or limitations as the Committee may establish;
provided, however, that only the Committee may exercise such duties, power and
authority with respect to Eligible Recipients who are subject to Section&nbsp;16 of
the Exchange Act. The Committee may exercise its duties, power and authority
under the Plan in its sole and absolute discretion without the consent of any
Participant or other party, unless the Plan specifically provides otherwise.
Each determination, interpretation or other action made or taken by the
Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan will be final, conclusive and
binding for all purposes and on all persons, including, without limitation, the
Company, the shareholders of the Company, the participants and their respective
successors-in-interest. No member of the Committee will be liable for any
action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any
Incentive Award granted under the Plan.

outstanding on such date less the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
then issuable (as if all vesting and other conditions to issuance were then
met) either (a)&nbsp;upon conversion of convertible securities of the Company
outstanding to Eligible Recipients on such date, or (b)&nbsp;upon exercise of
Options and other rights to purchase Common Stock outstanding to Eligible
Recipients on such date (exclusive of Options to be granted on such date);
provided, that without limiting the foregoing but subject to adjustment as
provided in Section&nbsp;4.3 of the Plan, the maximum number of shares of Common
Stock that will be available for issuance upon exercise of Incentive Stock
Options is 1,050,000, and no more than 250,000 shares of Common Stock may be
granted as Restricted Stock Awards or Stock Bonuses or pursuant to Performance Units under
the Plan. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan to the contrary, no
Participant in the Plan may be granted any Options or Stock Appreciation Rights
or any other Incentive Awards with a value based solely on an increase in the
value of the Common Stock after the date of grant relating to more than 200,000
shares of Common Stock in the aggregate in any fiscal year of the Company
(subject to adjustment as provided in Section&nbsp;4.3 of the Plan); provided,
however, that a Participant who is first appointed or elected as an officer,
hired as an employee or retained as a consultant by the Company or who receives
a promotion that results in an increase in responsibilities or duties may be
granted, during the fiscal year of such appointment, election, hiring,
retention or promotion, Options or Stock Appreciation Rights or other Incentive
Awards relating to up to 400,000 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment
as provided in Section&nbsp;4.3 of the Plan)..

issued under the Plan or that are subject to outstanding Incentive Awards will
be applied to reduce the maximum number of shares of Common Stock remaining
available for issuance under the Plan. Any shares of Common Stock that are
subject to an Incentive Award that lapses, expires, is forfeited or for any
reason is terminated unexercised or unvested and any shares of Common Stock
that are subject to an Incentive Award that is settled or paid in cash or any
form other than shares of Common Stock will automatically again become
available for issuance under the Plan. Any shares of Common Stock that
constitute the forfeited portion of a Restricted Stock Award, however, will not
become available for further issuance under the Plan.

judgment of the Committee, have contributed, are contributing or are expected
to contribute to the achievement of economic objectives of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Eligible Recipients may be granted from time to time one or more
Incentive Awards, singly or in combination or in tandem with other Incentive
Awards, as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
Incentive Awards will be deemed to be granted as of the date specified in the
grant resolution of the Committee, which date will be the date of any related
agreement with the Participant.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.1 Grant. An Eligible Recipient may be granted one or more Options under
the Plan, and such Options will be subject to such terms and conditions,
consistent with the other provisions of the Plan, as may be determined by the
Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee may designate whether an
Option is to be considered an Incentive Stock Option or a Non-Statutory Stock
Option. To the extent that any Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan
ceases for any reason to qualify as an &#147;incentive stock option&#148; for purposes of
Section&nbsp;422 of the Code, such Incentive Stock Option will continue to be
outstanding for purposes of the Plan but will thereafter be deemed to be a
Non-Statutory Stock Option.

exercise of an Option will be determined by the Committee in its discretion at
the time of the Option grant; provided, however, that (a)&nbsp;such price will not
be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the
day preceding the date of grant with respect to an Incentive Stock Option (110%
of the Fair Market Value if, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted,
the Participant owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10% of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any parent or
subsidiary corporation of the Company), and (b)&nbsp;such price will not be less
than 85% of the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the day
preceding the date of grant with respect to a Non-Statutory Stock Option.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.3 Exercisability and Duration. An Option will become exercisable at
such times and in such installments as may be determined by the Committee in
its sole discretion at the time of grant; provided, however, that no Option may
be exercisable after 10&nbsp;years from its date of grant (five years from its date
of grant of an Incentive Stock Option if, at the time the Incentive Stock
Option is granted, the Participant owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10%
of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or

combination of such methods; and (b)&nbsp;that if such payments are made by tender
of a Broker Exercise Notice or Previously Acquired Shares, or by a combination
of such methods, the Fair Market Value on the day preceding the date of
exercise will be used for the purpose of valuing the tendered shares of Common
Stock.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.5 Manner of Exercise. An Option may be exercised by a Participant in
whole or in part from time to time, subject to the conditions contained in the
Plan and in the agreement evidencing such Option, by delivery in person, by
facsimile or electronic transmission or through the mail of written notice of
exercise to the Company (Attention: Chief Financial Officer) at its principal
executive office in North St. Paul, Minnesota and by paying in full the total
exercise price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased in accordance
with Section&nbsp;6.4 of the Plan.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.6 Aggregate Limitation of Stock Subject to Incentive Stock Options. To
the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the day
preceding the date an Incentive Stock Option is granted) of the shares of
Common Stock with respect to which incentive stock options (within the meaning
of Section&nbsp;422 of the Code) are exercisable for the first time by a Participant
during any calendar year (under the Plan and any other incentive stock option
plans of the Company or any subsidiary or parent corporation of the Company
(within the meaning of the Code)) exceeds $100,000 (or such other amount as may
be prescribed by the Code from time to time), such excess Options will be
treated as Non-Statutory Stock Options. The determination will be made by
taking incentive stock options into account in the order in which they were
granted. If such excess only applies to a portion of an Incentive Stock
Option, the Committee, in its discretion, will designate which shares will be
treated as shares to be acquired upon exercise of an Incentive Stock Option.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock Appreciation Rights.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.1 Grant. An Eligible Recipient may be granted one or more Stock
Appreciation Rights under the Plan, and such Stock Appreciation Rights will be
subject to such terms and conditions, consistent with the other provisions of
the Plan, as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The
Committee will have the sole discretion to determine the form in which payment
of the economic value of Stock Appreciation Rights will be made to a
Participant (i.e., cash, Common Stock or any combination thereof) or to consent
to or disapprove the election by a Participant of the form of such payment.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.2 Exercise Price. The exercise price of a Stock Appreciation Right will
be determined by the Committee, in its discretion, at the date of grant but may
not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on
the day preceding the date of grant.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.3 Exercisability and Duration. A Stock Appreciation Right will become
exercisable at such time and in such installments as may be determined by the
Committee in its sole discretion at the time of grant; provided, however, that
