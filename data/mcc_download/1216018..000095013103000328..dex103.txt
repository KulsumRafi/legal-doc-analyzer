     Notwithstanding the foregoing, and with respect to the grant of Liens and
security interests hereunder only, the term "Collateral" shall not include (i)
Debtor's Equipment that is subject to a purchase money security interest or
equipment lease (the "Excluded Equipment") and (ii) any property of the type
specified in clauses (d), (g) and (l) above (such property, together with the
Excluded Equipment, the "Excluded Collateral"), to the extent the assignment,
granting, creation, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation or transfer of such Excluded
Collateral would violate the terms of, or would otherwise constitute a default
or termination or similar event under any document or instrument to which Debtor
is a party relating to the ownership of, or pertaining to any rights or interest
held in such Excluded Property, to the extent that no such term, document or
instrument is in contravention of Sections 9-406, 9-407 or 9-408 of the UCC.
Debtor hereby represents and warrants to the Secured Party that the failure of
the Secured Party to receive a security interest in any of the Excluded
Collateral, for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, shall not result in
the Secured Party failing to have a priority security interest in a material
portion of the Collateral and the Excluded Collateral, when taken as a whole, is
not material to the operations, business, properties or condition of the Debtor.

     Section 4. Covenants; Remedies. In furtherance of the grant of the pledge,
security interest and Lien pursuant to Section 3 hereof, the Debtor hereby
agrees with the Secured Party, for the benefit of the Secured Party and the
Lenders, as follows:

stock powers or assignments separate from certificate, as applicable, executed
in blank) duly indorsed and/or accompanied by such instruments of assignment and
transfer executed by the Debtor in such form and substance as the Secured Party
or its Representative may request; provided, that so long as no Event of Default

Debtor to act otherwise, the Debtor may retain for collection in the Ordinary
Course of Business any Instruments, negotiable Documents and Chattel Paper
received by the Debtor in the Ordinary Course of Business, and the Secured Party
or its Representative shall, promptly upon request of the Debtor, make
appropriate arrangements for making any other Instruments, negotiable Documents
and Chattel Paper pledged by the Debtor available to the Debtor for purposes of
presentation, collection or renewal (any such arrangement to be effected, to the
extent deemed appropriate by the Secured Party or its Representative, against
trust receipt or like document). If the Debtor retains possession of any Chattel
Paper, negotiable Documents or Instruments pursuant to the terms hereof, other
than checks received for deposit that have been in Debtor's

                                       7

deliver, file and/or record any financing statement, notice, instrument,
document, agreement or other papers that may be necessary or appropriate (in the
reasonable judgment of the Secured Party or its Representative) to create,
preserve, perfect or validate the security interest granted pursuant hereto or
to enable the Secured Party or its Representative to exercise and enforce the
rights of the Secured Party hereunder with respect to such pledge and security
interest, provided that notices to Account Debtors in respect of any Accounts or
Instruments shall be subject to the provisions of clause (e) below.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debtor hereby irrevocably authorizes the
Secured Party at any time and from time to time to file in any filing office in
any Uniform Commercial Code jurisdiction any initial financing statements and
amendments thereto that (a) indicate the Collateral (i) as all assets of the
Debtor or words of similar effect, regardless of whether any particular asset
comprised in the Collateral falls within the scope of Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code of the State of Illinois, as in effect from time to time, or
such jurisdiction, or (ii) as being of an equal or lesser scope or with greater
detail, and (b) contain any other information required by part 5 of Article 9 of

organization and any organization identification number issued to the Debtor,

Debtor agrees to furnish any such information to the Secured Party promptly upon
request. The Debtor also ratifies its authorization for the Secured Party to
have filed in any Uniform Commercial Code jurisdiction any like initial
financing statements or amendments thereto if filed prior to the date hereof.

expense and in all material respects complete and accurate books and records of

and all credits granted with respect to the Collateral and all other dealings
with the Collateral. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any
Event of Default, the Debtor shall deliver and turn over any such books and
Records (or true and correct copies thereof) to the Secured Party or its
Representative at any time on demand. The Debtor shall permit Secured Party,
representatives and independent contractors of the Secured Party (at the expense
of the Debtor, provided that Debtor shall be responsible for such expenses not
more than one (1) time per year unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing), or any Lender accompanying Secured Party (at such Lender's expense
unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing), to examine
the Debtor's books and Records, and make copies thereof or abstracts therefrom,
and to discuss the same with the Debtor's directors and officers at such
reasonable times during normal business hours and as often as may be reasonably
desired, upon reasonable advance notice to the Debtor; provided, however, when
an Event of Default exists the Secured Party or any Lender may do any of the
foregoing at the expense of the Debtor at any time during normal business hours
and without advance notice.

Debtor hereby authorizes the Secured Party and its Representative to so notify)
each Account Debtor in respect of any Accounts or Instruments or other Persons
obligated on the Collateral that such Collateral has been assigned to the
Secured Party hereunder, and that any payments due or to become due in respect
of such Collateral are to be made directly to the Secured Party and (ii) the
Secured Party and its Representative shall have the right at any time or times
to make direct verification with the Account Debtors or other Persons obligated
on the Collateral of any and all of the Accounts or other such Collateral

obtain rights to any registered Copyrights or any Patents or Trademarks or (ii)
become entitled to the benefit of any registered Copyrights or any Patents or
Trademarks or any improvement on any Patent, the provisions of this Agreement
shall automatically apply thereto and the Debtor shall give to the Secured Party
prompt written notice thereof. The Debtor hereby authorizes the Secured Party to
modify this Agreement by amending Schedules III, IV and V, as applicable, to
include any such U.S. federally registered Copyrights or any such Patents and
Trademarks. The Debtor shall have the duty to the extent it determines to do so
in its reasonable business judgment (i) to prosecute diligently any material

Debtor's obligations under this Section 4.1(f) shall be borne by the Debtor. The
Debtor shall not abandon any right to file a material patent, material trademark
or material service mark application, or abandon any pending patent, application
or any other Copyright, Patent or Trademark without the written consent of the
Secured Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

          (g) Further Identification of Collateral. The Debtor will, when and as
often as requested by the Secured Party or its Representative, furnish to the
Secured Party or its Representative, statements and schedules further
identifying and describing the Collateral and such other reports in connection

this Agreement, granting to the Secured Party a Lien on and security interest in

     4.2 Other Liens. The Debtor will not create, permit or suffer to exist, and
will defend the Collateral against and take such other action as is necessary to

and to all Proceeds thereof against the claims and demands of all Persons

     4.4 Good Standing; Name Change; Location; Bailees.

          (a) Without limiting the prohibition on mergers involving the Debtor

          (c) If any Collateral is at any time in the possession or control of

     4.5 Bank Accounts.

          (a) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Secured Party and the Debtor
shall enter into a bank agency agreement in a form specified by the Secured
Party ("Bank Agency Agreement"), with each financial institution set forth on
Part A of Schedule VI attached hereto. At any time after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, at the Secured Party's request,
the Secured Party and the Debtor shall enter into a Bank Agency Agreement with
any and all financial institutions with which the Debtor maintains from time to
time any Deposit Accounts (general or specific), and including without
limitation those financial institutions set forth on Part B of Schedule VI
attached hereto. Pursuant to the Bank Agency Agreements and pursuant hereto, the
Debtor grants and shall grant to the Secured Party a continuing Lien upon, and
security interest in, all such Deposit Accounts and all funds at any time paid,
deposited, credited or held in such accounts (whether for collection,
provisionally or otherwise) or otherwise in the possession of such financial
institutions, and each such financial institution shall act as the Secured
Party's agent in connection therewith. Following the Closing

                                       11

<PAGE>

Date, the Debtor shall not establish any Deposit Account with any financial
institution except as permitted under the Credit Agreement.

          (b) Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance of, an Event of
Default and upon the Secured Party's request, the Debtor shall establish
lock-box or blocked accounts (collectively, "Blocked Accounts") in the Debtor's
name with such banks as are acceptable to the Secured Party ("Collecting
Banks"), subject to irrevocable instructions in a form specified by the Secured
Party, to which the obligors of all Accounts shall directly remit all payments
on Accounts and in which the Debtor will immediately deposit all cash payments
for Inventory or other cash payments constituting Proceeds of Collateral in the
identical form in which such payment was made, whether by cash or check. In
addition, the Secured Party may establish one or more depository accounts at
each Collecting Bank or at a centrally located bank (collectively, the
"Depository Account"). From and after receipt by any Collecting Bank of written
notice from the Secured Party to such Collecting Bank that an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, all amounts held or deposited in the Blocked
Accounts held by such Collecting Bank shall be transferred to the Depository
Account. Subject to the foregoing, the Debtor hereby agrees that all payments
received by the Secured Party or any Lender whether by cash, check, wire
transfer or any other instrument, made to such Blocked Accounts or otherwise
received by the Secured Party or any Lender and whether in respect of the
Accounts or as proceeds of other Collateral or otherwise will be the sole and
exclusive property of the Secured Party for the benefit of the Agents and the
Lenders. The Debtor, and any of its Affiliates, employees, agents and other
Persons acting for or in concert with the Debtor shall, acting as trustee for
the Secured Party, receive, as the sole and exclusive property of the Secured
Party, any moneys, checks, notes, drafts or other payments relating to and/or
Proceeds of Accounts or other Collateral which come into the possession or under
the control of the Debtor or any Affiliates, employees, agent or other Persons
acting for or in concert with the Debtor, and immediately upon receipt thereof,
the Debtor or Persons shall deposit the same or cause the same to be deposited
in kind, in a Blocked Account.

     4.6 Events of Default, Etc. During the period during which an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing:

          (a) the Debtor shall, at the request of the Secured Party or its
Representative, assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Secured
Party or its Representative at a place or places designated by the Secured Party
or its Representative which are reasonably convenient to the Secured Party or
its Representative, as applicable, and the Debtor;

          (b) the Secured Party or its Representative may make any reasonable
compromise or settlement deemed desirable with respect to any of the Collateral
and may extend the time of payment, arrange for payment in installments, or
otherwise modify the terms of, any of the Collateral;

          (c) the Secured Party shall have all of the rights and remedies with
respect to the Collateral of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code
(whether or not said Uniform Commercial Code is in effect in the jurisdiction
where the rights and remedies are asserted) and such additional rights and
remedies to which a secured party is entitled under the laws in effect in any
jurisdiction where any rights and remedies hereunder may be asserted, including,
without

                                       12

<PAGE>

limitation, the right, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to exercise all
voting, consensual and other powers of ownership pertaining to the Collateral as
if the Secured Party were the sole and absolute owner thereof (and the Debtor
agrees to take all such action as may be appropriate to give effect to such
right);

          (d) the Secured Party or its Representative in their discretion, in
the name of the Secured Party or in the name of the Debtor or otherwise, may
demand, sue for, collect or receive any money or property at any time payable or
receivable on account of or in exchange for any of the Collateral, but shall be
under no obligation to do so;

          (e) the Secured Party or its Representative may take immediate
possession and occupancy of any premises owned, used or leased by the Debtor and
exercise all other rights and remedies of an assignee which may be available to
the Secured Party; and

          (f) the Secured Party may, upon ten (10) Business Days' prior written
notice to the Debtor of the time and place (which notice the Debtor hereby
agrees is commercially reasonable notification for purposes hereof), with
respect to the Collateral or any part thereof which shall then be or shall
thereafter come into the possession, custody or control of the Secured Party or
its Representative, sell, lease, license, assign or otherwise dispose of all or
any part of such Collateral, at such place or places as the Secured Party deems
best, and for cash or for credit or for future delivery (without thereby
assuming any credit risk), at public or private sale, without demand of
performance or notice of intention to effect any such disposition or of the time
or place thereof (except such notice as is required above or by applicable
statute and cannot be waived), and the Secured Party or anyone else may be the
purchaser, lessee, licensee, assignee or recipient of any or all of the
Collateral so disposed of at any public sale (or, to the extent permitted by
law, at any private sale) and thereafter hold the same absolutely, free from any
claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any right or equity of redemption
(statutory or otherwise), of the Debtor, any such demand, notice and right or
equity being hereby expressly waived and released. The Secured Party may,
without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the
same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place
fixed for the sale, and such sale may be made at any time or place to which the
sale may be so adjourned. The proceeds of each collection, sale or other
disposition under this Section 4.6 shall be applied in accordance with Section
4.9 hereof.

     4.7 Deficiency. If the proceeds of sale, collection or other realization of
or upon the Collateral are insufficient to cover the costs and expenses of such
realization and the payment in full of the Liabilities, the Debtor shall remain
liable for any deficiency.

     4.8 Private Sale. The Debtor recognizes that the Secured Party may be
unable to effect a public sale of any or all of the Collateral consisting of
securities by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Act"), and applicable state securities laws, but may be
compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group
of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such
Collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the
distribution or resale thereof. The Debtor acknowledges and agrees that any such
private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller
than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances,
agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a

                                       13

<PAGE>

commercially reasonable manner. The Secured Party shall be under no obligation
to delay a sale of any of the Collateral to permit the Debtor to register such
Collateral for public sale under the Act, or under applicable state securities
laws, even if the Debtor would agree to do so. The Secured Party shall not incur
any liability as a result of the sale of any such Collateral, or any part
thereof, at any private sale provided for in this Agreement conducted in a
commercially reasonable manner, and the Debtor hereby waives any claims against
the Secured Party arising by reason of the fact that the price at which the
Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price
which might have been obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate
amount of the Liabilities, even if the Secured Party accepts the first offer
received and does not offer the Collateral to more than one offeree.

     The Debtor further agrees to do or cause to be done all such other acts and
things as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of any portion or all of
any such Collateral valid and binding and in compliance with any and all
applicable laws, regulations, orders, writs, injunctions, decrees or awards of
any and all courts, arbitrators or governmental instrumentalities, domestic or
foreign, having jurisdiction over any such sale or sales, all at the Debtor's
expense, provided that the Debtor shall be under no obligation to take any
action to enable any or all of such Collateral to be registered under the
provisions of the Act. The Debtor further agrees that a breach of any of the
covenants contained in this Section 4.8 will cause irreparable injury to the
Secured Party, that the Secured Party has no adequate remedy at law in respect
of such breach and, as a consequence, agrees that each and every covenant
contained in this Section 4.8 shall be specifically enforceable against the
Debtor, and the Debtor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses
against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for a
defense that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

     4.9 Application of Proceeds. The proceeds of any collection, sale or other
realization of all or any part of the Collateral, and any other cash at the time
held by the Secured Party under this Agreement, shall be applied in accordance
with subsection 1.10(c) of the Credit Agreement.

     4.10 Attorney-in-Fact. The Debtor hereby irrevocably constitutes and
appoints the Secured Party, with full power of substitution, as its true and
lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place
and stead of the Debtor and in the name of the Debtor or in its own name, from
time to time in the discretion of the Secured Party, for the purpose of carrying
out the terms of this Agreement, to take, after the occurrence, and during the
continuance of, an Event of Default, any and all appropriate action and to
execute and deliver any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary
or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, hereby gives the Secured Party the power and
right, on behalf of the Debtor, without notice to or assent by the Debtor, to do
the following upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default:

          (a) to ask, demand, collect, receive and give acquittance and receipts
for any and all moneys due and to become due under any Collateral and, in the
name of the Debtor or its own name or otherwise, to take possession of and
indorse and collect any checks, drafts, notes, acceptances or other Instruments
for the payment of moneys due under any Collateral and to file any claim or to
take any other action or proceeding in any court of law or equity or otherwise
deemed appropriate by the Secured Party for the purpose of collecting any and
all such moneys

                                       14

<PAGE>

due under any Collateral whenever payable and to file any claim or to take any
other action or proceeding in any court of law or equity or otherwise deemed
appropriate by the Secured Party for the purpose of collecting any and all such
moneys due under any Collateral whenever payable;

          (b) to pay or discharge charges or Liens levied or placed on or
threatened against the Collateral (other than the Permitted Liens), to effect
any insurance called for by the terms of this Agreement and to pay all or any
part of the premiums therefor;

          (c) to direct any party liable for any payment under any of the
Collateral to make payment of any and all moneys due, and to become due
thereunder, directly to the Secured Party or as the Secured Party shall direct,
and to receive payment of and receipt for any and all moneys, claims and other
amounts due, and to become due at any time, in respect of or arising out of any
Collateral;

          (d) to sign and indorse any invoices, freight or express bills, bills
of lading, storage or warehouse receipts, drafts against debtors, assignments,
verifications and notices in connection with Accounts and other Documents
constituting or relating to the Collateral;

          (e) to commence and prosecute any suits, actions or proceedings at law
or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the Collateral or
any part thereof and to enforce any other right in respect of any Collateral;

          (f) to defend any suit, action or proceeding brought against the
Debtor with respect to any Collateral;

          (g) to settle, compromise or adjust any suit, action or proceeding
described above and, in connection therewith, to give such discharges or
releases as the Secured Party may deem appropriate;

          (h) to the extent that the Debtor's authorization given in Section
4.1(b) of this Agreement is not sufficient, to file such financing statements
with respect to this Agreement, with or without the Debtor's signature, or to
file a photocopy of this Agreement in substitution for a financing statement, as
the Secured Party may deem appropriate, and to execute in the Debtor's name such
financing statements and amendments thereto and continuation statements which
may require the Debtor's signature; and

          (i) generally to sell, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with
respect to or otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely
as though the Secured Party were the absolute owners thereof for all purposes,
and to do, at the Secured Party's option and at the Debtor's expense, at any
time, or from time to time, all acts and things which the Secured Party
reasonably deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral
and the Secured Party's Lien therein, in order to effect the intent of this
Agreement, all as fully and effectively as the Debtor might do.

     The Debtor hereby ratifies, to the extent permitted by law, all that such
attorneys lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. The power of
attorney granted hereunder is a power

                                       15

<PAGE>

coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable until the Liabilities (other
than contingent indemnification obligations) are paid in full in cash and the
Credit Agreement is terminated.

     The Debtor also authorizes the Secured Party, at any time from and after
the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, (x) to
communicate in its own name with any party to any Contract with regard to the
assignment of the right, title and interest of the Debtor in and under the
Contracts hereunder and other matters relating thereto and (y) to execute, in
connection with any sale of Collateral provided for in Section 4.5 hereof, any
indorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or transfer with
respect to the Collateral.

     4.11 Perfection. Prior to or concurrently with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the Debtor shall:

          (a) deliver to or authorize the Secured Party to file such financing
statements, assignments for security and other documents in such offices as may
be necessary or as the Secured Party or its Representative may request to
perfect the security interests granted by Section 3 of this Agreement;

          (b) at the Secured Party's request, deliver to the Secured Party or
its Representative the originals of all Instruments together with, in the case
of Instruments constituting promissory notes, allonges attached thereto showing
such promissory notes to be payable to the order of a blank payee;

          (c) at Secured Party's request, deliver to the Secured Party or its
Representative instruments representing or evidencing all certificated
Investment Property, in suitable form for transfer by delivery or accompanied by
applicable indorsements, where necessary, or duly executed instruments of
transfer or assignments in blank, all in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Secured Party; and

          (d) take any other action or do any other thing reasonably required by
Secured Party or its Representative so that Secured Party shall have a first
priority perfected security interest in the Collateral, other than delivery of
Motor Vehicle titles, subject only to Permitted Liens.

     4.12 Termination. This Agreement and the Liens and security interests
granted hereunder shall not terminate until the termination of the Credit
Agreement and the full and complete performance, satisfaction and payment in
full in cash of all the Liabilities (other than contingent indemnification
obligations and Rate Contract Obligations), whereupon the Secured Party shall
forthwith cause to be assigned, transferred and delivered, against receipt but
without any recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever, any remaining
Collateral to or on the order of the Debtor. To the extent that Collateral is
sold or otherwise disposed of as permitted by the Credit Agreement, Secured
Party hereby agrees to release the Liens and security interests granted
hereunder in any such Collateral. The Secured Party shall also execute and
deliver to the Debtor upon such termination such Uniform Commercial Code
termination statements or amendments, certificates for terminating the Liens on
the applicable Motor Vehicles (if any) and such other documentation as shall be
reasonably requested by the Debtor to effect the termination and

                                       16

<PAGE>

release of the Liens and security interests in favor of the Secured Party
affecting the Collateral.

     4.13 Further Assurances. At any time and from time to time, upon the
written request of the Secured Party or its Representative, and at the sole
expense of the Debtor, the Debtor will promptly and duly execute and deliver any
and all such further instruments, documents and agreements and take such further
actions as the Secured Party or its Representative may reasonably require in
order for the Secured Party to obtain the full benefits of this Agreement and of
the rights and powers herein granted in favor of the Secured Party, including,
without limitation, using the Debtor's commercially reasonable efforts to secure
all consents and approvals necessary or appropriate for the assignment to the
Secured Party of any Collateral held by the Debtor or in which the Debtor has
any rights not heretofore assigned, the filing of any financing or continuation
statements under the Uniform Commercial Code with respect to the Liens and
security interests granted hereby, transferring Collateral to the Secured
Party's possession (if a security interest in such Collateral can be perfected
by possession), placing the interest of the Secured Party as lienholder on the
certificate of title of any Motor Vehicle as required hereby and obtaining
waivers of Liens from landlords and mortgagees. The Debtor also hereby
authorizes the Secured Party and its Representative to file any such financing
or continuation statement without the signature of the Debtor to the extent
permitted by applicable law.

     4.14 Limitation on Duty of the Secured Party. The powers conferred on the
Secured Party under this Agreement are solely to protect the Secured Party's
interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any
such powers. The Secured Party shall be accountable only for amounts that it
actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers and neither the
Secured Party nor its Representative nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to the Debtor for any act or
failure to act, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Secured Party and any Representative shall be deemed
to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the
Collateral in their possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment
substantially equivalent to that which the relevant Secured Party or any
Representative, in its individual capacity, accords its own property consisting
of the type of Collateral involved, it being understood and agreed that neither
the Secured Party nor any Representative shall have any responsibility for
taking any necessary steps (other than steps taken in accordance with the
standard of care set forth above) to preserve rights against any Person with
respect to any Collateral.

     Also without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Secured
Party nor any Representative shall have any obligation or liability under any
Contract or license by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the
granting to the Secured Party of a security interest therein or assignment
thereof or the receipt by the Secured Party or any Representative of any payment
relating to any Contract or license pursuant hereto, nor shall the Secured Party
or any Representative be required or obligated in any manner to perform or
fulfill any of the obligations of the Debtor under or pursuant to any Contract
or license, or to make any payment, or to make any inquiry as to the nature or
the sufficiency of any payment received by it or the sufficiency of any
performance by any party under any Contract or license, or to present or file
any claim, or to take any action to collect or enforce any performance or the
payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be
entitled at any time or times.
