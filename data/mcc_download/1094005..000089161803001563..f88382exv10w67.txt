the payment of quid pro quo for transfer of shares' ownership:

      FOR TRANSFER OF SHARES' OWNERSHIP in the SHARES TRANSFER AGREEMENT is
      still fully binding on all the parties,

<PAGE>

      PARTY H shall pay Party A (considered as a performance of duties that
      Party H owes to the assigning parties) the equivalence in US dollars with
      14.725 million RMB before finishing the shares transfer, that is,
      obtaining the business license. The assigning parties shall not convert
      the said foreign exchange or use, dispose the above-mentioned payment
      before expiry of the payment term specified by the SHARES TRANSFER
      AGREEMENT. Party H shall have the right to ask Party A to provide
      assistance in freezing the payment from the bank. The assigning parties
      pledge, before the conditions for the release of the payment set in the
      APPENDIX 1 LETTER OF COMMITMENT are met, not to require Party A to release
      the said payment. Party A shall neither do that upon if required by any
      other parties or of its own accord.

2.    Party H agrees that, in accordance with the Article 4 PAYMENT OF QUID PRO
      QUO FOR TRANSFER OF SHARES' OWNERSHIP in the SHARES TRANSFER AGREEMENT,
      the assigning parties shall legally have the ownership of the aforesaid
      foreign exchanges in US dollars equivalent to 14.725 million RMB in ten
      days since the date when Party H finishes the transfer of shares of the
      targeted company, that is, since its obtaining the business license. Party
      H shall also assist Party A to release the payment from the bank. Refund
      for any overpayment or a supplemental payment for any deficiency shall be
      made if any balance resulted when settling the exchange of the said
      payment and the balance of exchange settlement for the previous paid
      775,000 RMB shall be assessed simultaneously.

3.    The assigning party approves that Party A's pledge made in the Appendix 1
      LETTER OF COMMITMENT shall be also binding to all the other assigning
      parties.

4.    The assigning parties shall be responsible for any breach of the
      agreement, and shall bear the joint responsibilities to pay compensation
      for any loss that Party H suffers therefor. Party H shall also be held
      liable for any breach of the agreement and any losses arising therefrom
      encountered by the assigning parties.

5.    All parties agree that, in case the shares' ownership transfer fails to be
      completed, the assigning parties shall refund all the payments for the
      transfer of the shares' ownership to Party H in ten days since then.

6.    This agreement, as a supplement to the SHARES TRANSFER AGREEMENT, shall be
      binding on all parties hereto. In case of any other issues that this
      agreement fails to cover, it is recommended to refer to the SHARES
      TRANSFER AGREEMENT. Should any conflicts be found between this agreement
      and the SHARES TRANSFER AGREEMENT, this agreement shall prevail.

7.    This complementary agreement is made in Chinese language in eight
      originals, one for each party and all copies being equally authentic. This
      complementary agreement shall enter into effect upon the date of being
      signed by the authorized representatives of all parties.
