hereunder more than 65% of the Voting Equity Interests of any Exempted Foreign
Entity (and such Voting Equity Interests in excess of 65% shall not constitute
"Collateral,"), (y) each Pledgor shall be required to pledge hereunder 100% of
any Non-Voting Equity Interests at any time and from time to time acquired by
such Pledgor of any Exempted Foreign Entity and (z) the Collateral shall not
include Equity Interests in Joint Ventures that are not Subsidiaries of the
Borrower to the extent that the respective Pledgor is contractually prohibited
(after giving effect to any consents or waivers in respect of such prohibition)
from pledging such Equity Interests owned by it pursuant to the respective joint
venture agreement or similar agreement governing such Joint Venture.

          3.2 PROCEDURES. (a) To the extent that any Pledgor at any time or from
time to time owns, acquires or obtains any right, title or interest in any
Collateral, such Collateral shall automatically (and without the taking of any
action by such Pledgor) be pledged pursuant to Section 3.1 of this Agreement
and, in addition thereto, such Pledgor shall (to the extent provided below) take
the following actions as set forth below (as promptly as practicable and, in any
event, within 10 days after it obtains such Collateral) for the benefit of the
Pledgee and the other Secured Creditors:

          (i)    with respect to a Certificated Security (other than a
     Certificated Security credited on the books of a Clearing Corporation or
     Securities Intermediary), such Pledgor shall physically deliver such
     Certificated Security to the Pledgee, endorsed to the Pledgee or endorsed
     in blank, provided that no such Pledgor shall be required to deliver any
     Certificated Securities held by it as a result of investment of such
     Pledgor in Cash Equivalents, Foreign Cash Equivalents and Margin Stock made
     in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with Section 8.06(a)
     and(r) of the Credit Agreement;

          (ii)   with respect to an Uncertificated Security (other than an
     Uncertificated Security credited on the books of a Clearing Corporation or
     Securities Intermediary), such Pledgor shall cause (or in the case of any
     such issuer that is not a Subsidiary of such Pledgor, use commercially
     reasonable efforts to cause) the issuer of such Uncertificated Security to
     duly authorize, execute, and deliver to the Pledgee, an agreement for the
     benefit of the Pledgee and the other Secured Creditors substantially in the
     form of Annex G hereto (appropriately completed to the reasonable
     satisfaction of the Pledgee and with such modifications, if any, as shall
     be reasonably satisfactory to the Pledgee) pursuant to which such issuer
     agrees to comply, after the Pledgee has notified such issuer that an Event
     of Default then exists, with any and all instructions originated by the
     Pledgee without further consent by the registered owner and not to comply
     with instructions regarding such Uncertificated Security (and any
     Partnership Interests and Limited Liability

<Page>

     Company Interests issued by such issuer) originated by any other Person
     other than a court of competent jurisdiction;

          (iii)  with respect to a Certificated Security, Uncertificated
     Security, Partnership Interest or Limited Liability Company Interest
     credited on the books of a Clearing Corporation or Securities Intermediary
     (including a Federal Reserve Bank, Participants Trust Company or The
     Depository Trust Company), such Pledgor shall promptly notify the Pledgee
     thereof and shall promptly take (x) (i) all actions required to comply with
     the applicable rules of such Clearing Corporation or Securities
     Intermediary and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to perfect the
     security interest of the Pledgee under applicable law (including, in any
     event, under Sections 9-314(a), (b) and (c), 9-106 and 8-106(d) of the UCC)
     and (y) such other actions as the Pledgee deems necessary or desirable to
     effect the foregoing;

          (iv)   with respect to a Partnership Interest or a Limited Liability
     Company Interest (other than a Partnership Interest or Limited Liability
     Company Interest credited on the books of a Clearing Corporation or
     Securities Intermediary), (1) if such Partnership Interest or Limited
     Liability Company Interest is represented by a certificate and is a
     Security for purposes of the UCC, the procedure set forth in Section
     3.2(a)(i) hereof, and (2) if such Partnership Interest or Limited Liability
     Company Interest is not represented by a certificate or is not a Security
     for purposes of the UCC, the procedure set forth in Section 3.2(a)(ii)
     hereof; and

          (v)    with respect to any Note evidencing Indebtedness in a principal
     amount equal to or greater than $2,000,000, physical delivery of such Note
     to the Pledgee, endorsed to the Pledgee or endorsed in blank.

          (b)    In addition to the actions required to be taken pursuant to
Section 3.2(a) hereof, each Pledgor shall take the following additional actions
with respect to the Collateral:

          (i)    with respect to all Collateral of such Pledgor whereby or with
     respect to which the Pledgee may obtain "control" thereof within the
     meaning of Section 8-106 of the UCC (or under any provision of the UCC as
     same may be amended or supplemented from time to time, or under the laws of
     any relevant State other than the State of New York), such Pledgor shall,
     subject to the qualifications set forth in preceding clauses (a)(i), (ii),
     (iii) and (v), take all actions as may be requested from time to time by
     the Pledgee so that "control" of such Collateral is obtained and at all
     times held by the Pledgee; and

          (ii)   each Pledgor shall from time to time cause appropriate
     financing statements (on appropriate forms) under the Uniform Commercial
     Code as in effect in the various relevant States, covering all Collateral
     hereunder (with the form of such financing statements to be satisfactory to
     the Pledgee), to be filed in the relevant filing offices so that at all
     times the Pledgee's security interest in all Investment Property and other
     Collateral which can be perfected by the filing of such financing
     statements (in each case to the maximum extent perfection by filing may be
     obtained under the laws of the relevant States, including, without
     limitation, Section 9-312(a) of the UCC) is so perfected.

          3.3 SUBSEQUENTLY ACQUIRED COLLATERAL. If any Pledgor shall acquire (by
purchase, stock dividend, distribution or otherwise) any additional Collateral
at any time or from time to time after the date hereof, (i) such Collateral
shall automatically (and without any further action being required to be taken)
be subject to the pledge and security interests created pursuant to Section 3.1
hereof and, furthermore, such Pledgor will thereafter take (or cause to be
taken) all action (as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within 10 days
after it obtains such Collateral) with respect to such Collateral in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section 3.2 hereof, and will promptly
thereafter deliver to the Pledgee a certificate executed by an authorized
officer of such Pledgor describing such Collateral and certifying that the same
has been duly pledged in favor of the Pledgee (for the benefit of the Secured
Creditors) hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, each Pledgor shall be
required to pledge hereunder the Equity Interests of any Exempted Foreign Entity
that are directly owned by such Pledgor at any time and from time to time after
the date hereof acquired by such Pledgor, PROVIDED that (x) except in the
circumstances and to the extent provided by the last paragraph of Section 3.1,
no Pledgor shall be required at any time to pledge hereunder more than 65% of
the total combined voting power of all classes of Voting Equity Interests of any
Exempted Foreign Entity and (y) each Pledgor shall be required to pledge
hereunder 100% of the Non-Voting Equity Interests of each Exempted Foreign
Entity at any time and from time to time acquired by such Pledgor.

          3.4 TRANSFER TAXES. Each pledge of Collateral under Section 3.1 or
Section 3.3 hereof shall be accompanied by any transfer tax stamps required in
connection with the pledge of such Collateral.

          3.5 CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE COLLATERAL.

<Page>

          4. APPOINTMENT OF SUB-AGENTS; ENDORSEMENTS, ETC. The Pledgee shall
have the right to appoint one or more sub-agents for the purpose of retaining
physical possession of the Collateral, which may be held (in the discretion of
the Pledgee) in the name of the relevant Pledgor, endorsed or assigned in blank
or, after a Noticed Event of Default, in favor of the Pledgee or any nominee or
nominees of the Pledgee or a sub-agent appointed by the Pledgee.

          5. VOTING, ETC., WHILE NO EVENT OF DEFAULT. Unless and until there
shall have occurred and be continuing a Noticed Event of Default, each Pledgor
shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and other consensual rights
pertaining to the Collateral owned by it, and to give consents, waivers or
ratifications in respect thereof; PROVIDED that, in each case, no vote shall be
cast or any consent, waiver or ratification given or any action taken or omitted
to be taken which would violate or result in a breach of any covenant contained
in any Secured Debt Agreement, or which could reasonably be expected to have the
effect of materially impairing the value of the Collateral or any part thereof
or the position or interests of the Pledgee or any other Secured Creditor in the
Collateral, unless expressly permitted by the terms of the Secured Debt
Agreements. All such rights of each Pledgor to vote and to give consents,
waivers and ratifications shall cease in case a Noticed Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, and Section 7 hereof shall become applicable.

          6. DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS. Unless and until there shall
have occurred and be continuing a Noticed Event of Default, all cash dividends,
cash distributions, cash Proceeds and other cash amounts payable in respect of
the Collateral shall be paid to the respective Pledgor, PROVIDED, that all cash
dividends payable in respect of the Pledged Stock which are determined by the
Pledgee to represent in whole or in part an extraordinary, liquidating or other
distribution in return of capital shall be paid, to the extent so determined to
represent an extraordinary, liquidating or other distribution in return of
capital, to the Pledgee and retained by it as part of the Collateral (although
the respective Pledgor shall be permitted to retain cash proceeds received by it
in connection with sales or other transfers of Pledged Stock permitted under
Section 8.02 of the Credit Agreement so long as such proceeds are not otherwise
required to be applied to repay Loans pursuant to Section 4.02(A)(c) of the
Credit Agreement). The Pledgee shall be entitled to receive directly, and to
retain as part of the Collateral:

          (i)    all other or additional stock, notes, certificates, limited
     liability company interests, partnership interests, instruments or other
     securities or property (including, but not limited to, cash dividends other
     than as set forth above);

          (ii)   all other or additional stock, notes, certificates, limited
     liability company interests, partnership interests, instruments or other
     securities or property (including, but not limited to, cash (although such
     cash may be paid directly to the respective Pledgor so long as no Event of
     Default then exists) paid or distributed in respect of the Collateral by
     way of stock-split, spin-off, split-up, reclassification, combination of
     shares or similar rearrangement; and

          (iii)  all other or additional stock, notes, certificates, limited
     liability company interests, partnership interests, instruments or other
     securities or property (including, but not limited to, cash) which may be
     paid in respect of the Collateral by reason of any

<Page>

     consolidation, merger, exchange of stock, conveyance of assets, liquidation
     or similar corporate or other reorganization.

Nothing contained in this Section 6 shall limit or restrict in any way the
Pledgee's right to receive the proceeds of the Collateral in any form in
accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement. Furthermore, the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6 shall not restrict the respective Pledgor's right
to receive dividends made pursuant to Sections 8.09(i), (ii), (iv), (v) and
(viii) (to the extent related to amounts that may be paid pursuant to Section
8.10(vi) of the Credit Agreement) of the Credit Agreement, provided that such
dividends are made in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions set
forth on the Credit Agreement. All dividends, distributions or other payments
which are received by any Pledgor contrary to the provisions of this Section 6
or Section 7 hereof shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Pledgee,
shall be segregated from other property or funds of such Pledgor and shall be
forthwith paid over to the Pledgee as Collateral in the same form as so received
(with any necessary endorsement).

          7. REMEDIES IN CASE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT. If there shall have
occurred and be continuing a Noticed Event of Default, then and in every such
case, the Pledgee shall be entitled to exercise all of the rights, powers and
remedies (whether vested in it by this Agreement, any other Secured Debt
Agreement or by law) for the protection and enforcement of its rights in respect
of the Collateral, and the Pledgee shall be entitled to exercise all the rights
and remedies of a secured party under the UCC as in effect in any relevant
jurisdiction and also shall be entitled, without limitation, to exercise the
following rights, which each Pledgor hereby agrees to be commercially
reasonable:

          (i)    to receive all amounts payable in respect of the Collateral
     otherwise payable under Section 6 hereof to the respective Pledgor;

          (ii)   to transfer all or any part of the Collateral into the
     Pledgee's name or the name of its nominee or nominees;

          (iii)  to accelerate any Pledged Note which may be accelerated in
     accordance with its terms, and take any other lawful action to collect upon
     any Pledged Note in accordance with its terms (including, without
     limitation, to make any demand for payment thereon in accordance with its
     terms);

          (iv)   to vote all or any part of the Collateral (whether or not
     transferred into the name of the Pledgee) and give all consents, waivers
     and ratifications in respect of the Collateral and otherwise act with
     respect thereto as though it were the outright owner thereof (each Pledgor
     hereby irrevocably constituting and appointing the Pledgee the proxy and
     attorney-in-fact of such Pledgor, with full power of substitution to do
     so);

          (v)    at any time and from time to time to sell, assign and deliver,
     or grant options to purchase, all or any part of the Collateral, or any
     interest therein, at any public or private sale, without demand of
     performance, advertisement or, notice of intention to sell or of the time
     or place of sale or adjournment thereof or to redeem or otherwise purchase
     or dispose (all of which are hereby waived by each Pledgor to the fullest
     extent

<Page>

     permitted by law), for cash, on credit or for other property, for immediate
     or future delivery without any assumption of credit risk, and for such
     price or prices and on such terms as the Pledgee in its absolute discretion
     may determine, PROVIDED at least 10 days' written notice of the time and
     place of any such sale shall be given to the respective Pledgor. The
     Pledgee shall not be obligated to make any such sale of Collateral
     regardless of whether any such notice of sale has theretofore been given.
     Each Pledgor hereby waives and releases to the fullest extent permitted by
     law any right or equity of redemption with respect to the Collateral,
     whether before or after sale hereunder, and all rights, if any, of
     marshalling the Collateral and any other security or the Obligations or
     otherwise. At any such sale, unless prohibited by applicable law, the
     Pledgee on behalf of the Secured Creditors may bid for and purchase all or
     any part of the Collateral so sold free from any such right or equity of
     redemption. Neither the Pledgee nor any other Secured Creditor shall be
     liable for failure to collect or realize upon any or all of the Collateral
     or for any delay in so doing nor shall any of them be under any obligation
     to take any action whatsoever with regard thereto; and

          (vi)   to set off any and all Collateral against any and all
     Obligations, and to withdraw any and all cash or other Collateral from any
     and all Collateral Accounts and to apply such cash and other Collateral to
     the payment of any and all Obligations.

          8. REMEDIES, CUMULATIVE, ETC. Each and every right, power and remedy
of the Pledgee provided for in this Agreement or in any other Secured Debt
Agreement, or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute shall
be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other such right,
power or remedy. The exercise or beginning of the exercise by the Pledgee or any
other Secured Creditor of any one or more of the rights, powers or remedies
provided for in this Agreement or any other Secured Debt Agreement or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall not
preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by the Pledgee or any other Secured
Creditor of all such other rights, powers or remedies, and no failure or delay
on the part of the Pledgee or any other Secured Creditor to exercise any such
right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof. No notice to or demand
on any Pledgor in any case shall entitle it to any other or further notice or
demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of any of the
rights of the Pledgee or any other Secured Creditor to any other or further
action in any circumstances without notice or demand. The Secured Creditors
agree that this Agreement may be enforced only by the action of the Pledgee, in
each case, acting upon the instructions of the Required Secured Creditors, and
that no other Secured Creditor shall have any right individually to seek to
enforce or to enforce this Agreement or to realize upon the security to be
granted hereby, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may
be exercised by the Pledgee for the benefit of the Secured Creditors upon the
terms of this Agreement.

          9. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. (a) All monies collected by the Pledgee
upon any sale or other disposition of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, together with all other monies received by the Pledgee
hereunder, shall be applied in the manner provided in the Security Agreement.

          (b)    It is understood and agreed that each Pledgor shall remain
jointly and severally liable with respect to its Obligations to the extent of
any deficiency between the

<Page>

amount of the proceeds of the Collateral pledged by it hereunder and the
aggregate amount of such Obligations.

          10. PURCHASERS OF COLLATERAL. Upon any sale of the Collateral by the
Pledgee hereunder (whether by virtue of the power of sale herein granted,
pursuant to judicial process or otherwise), the receipt of the Pledgee or the
officer making such sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or
purchasers of the Collateral so sold, and such purchaser or purchasers shall not
be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid
over to the Pledgee or such officer or be answerable in any way for the
misapplication or nonapplication thereof.

          11. INDEMNITY. Each Pledgor jointly and severally agrees (i) to
indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless the Pledgee and each other Secured
Creditor and their respective successors, assigns, employees, agents and
affiliates (individually an "INDEMNITEE", and collectively, the "INDEMNITEES")
from and against any and all obligations, damages, injuries, penalties, claims,
demands, losses, judgments and liabilities (including, without limitation,
liabilities for penalties) of whatsoever kind or nature incurred by any
Indemnitee as a result of, or in any way relating to, or arising out of, or by
reason of, any investigation, litigation or other proceeding (whether or not any
Indemnitee is party thereto and whether or not such investigation, litigation or
other proceeding is between or among any Indemnitee, any Pledgor or any third
Person or otherwise) related to the entering into and/or performance of this
Agreement or any other Secured Debt Agreement, and (ii) to reimburse each
Indemnitee for all reasonable, documented, costs, expenses and disbursements in
each case arising out of or resulting the exercise by any Indemnitee of any
right or remedy granted to it hereunder or under any other Secured Debt
Agreement (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses, PROVIDED THAT, except in the case of a bankruptcy of any Assignor, no
more than one counsel for the Indemnitees may be used in any one jurisdiction)
(but excluding any obligations, damages, injuries, penalties, claims, demands,
losses, judgments and liabilities (including, without limitation, liabilities
for penalties) or expenses of whatsoever kind or nature to the extent incurred
or arising by reason of gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Indemnitee or an affiliate thereof (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision)). In no event shall the
Pledgee hereunder be liable, in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct on its part (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
final and non-appealable decision), for any matter or thing in connection with
this Agreement other than to account for monies or other property actually
received by it in accordance with the terms hereof. If and to the extent that
the obligations of any Pledgor under this Section 11 are unenforceable for any
reason, such Pledgor hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the
payment and satisfaction of such obligations which is permissible under
applicable law. The indemnity obligations of each Pledgor contained in this
Section 11 shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the full
payment of all the Notes issued under the Credit Agreement, the termination of
all Covered Agreements and Letters of Credit, and the payment of all other
Obligations and notwithstanding the discharge thereof.

          12. PLEDGEE NOT A PARTNER OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY MEMBER. (a)
Nothing herein shall be construed to make the Pledgee or any other Secured
Creditor liable as a member of any limited liability company or as a partner of
any partnership and neither the Pledgee nor any other Secured Creditor by virtue
of this Agreement or otherwise

<Page>

(except as referred to in the following sentence) shall have any of the duties,
obligations or liabilities of a member of any limited liability company or as a
partner in any partnership. The parties hereto expressly agree that, unless the
Pledgee shall become the absolute owner of Collateral consisting of a Limited
Liability Company Interest or a Partnership Interest pursuant hereto, this
Agreement shall not be construed as creating a partnership or joint venture
among the Pledgee, any other Secured Creditor, any Pledgor and/or any other
Person.

          (b)    Except as provided in the last sentence of paragraph (a) of
this Section 12, the Pledgee, by accepting this Agreement, did not intend to
become a member of any limited liability company or a partner of any partnership
or otherwise be deemed to be a co-venturer with respect to any Pledgor, any
limited liability company, partnership and/or any other Person either before or
after an Event of Default shall have occurred. The Pledgee shall have only those
powers set forth herein and the Secured Creditors shall assume none of the
duties, obligations or liabilities of a member of any limited liability company
or as a partner of any partnership or any Pledgor except as provided in the last
sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 12.

          (c)    The Pledgee and the other Secured Creditors shall not be
obligated to perform or discharge any obligation of any Pledgor as a result of
the pledge hereby effected.

          (d)    The acceptance by the Pledgee of this Agreement, with all the
rights, powers, privileges and authority so created, shall not at any time or in
any event obligate the Pledgee or any other Secured Creditor to appear in or
defend any action or proceeding relating to the Collateral to which it is not a
party, or to take any action hereunder or thereunder, or to expend any money or
incur any expenses or perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability
under the Collateral.

          13. FURTHER ASSURANCES; POWER-OF-ATTORNEY. (a) Each Pledgor agrees
that it will join with the Pledgee in executing and, at such Pledgor's own
expense, file and refile under the UCC or other applicable law such financing
statements, continuation statements and other documents, in form reasonably
acceptable to the Pledgee, in such offices as the Pledgee (acting on its own or
on the instructions of the Required Secured Creditors) may reasonably deem
necessary or appropriate and wherever required or permitted by law in order to
perfect and preserve the Pledgee's security interest in the Collateral hereunder
and hereby authorizes the Pledgee to file financing statements and amendments
thereto relative to all or any part of the Collateral (including, without
limitation, (x) financing statements which list the Collateral specifically
and/or "all assets" as collateral and (y) "in lieu of" financing statements)
without the signature of such Pledgor where permitted by law, and agrees to do
such further acts and things and to execute and deliver to the Pledgee such
additional agreements and instruments as the Pledgee may reasonably require or
deem advisable to carry into effect the purposes of this Agreement or to further
assure and confirm unto the Pledgee its rights, powers and remedies hereunder or
thereunder.

          (b)    Each Pledgor hereby constitutes and appoints the Pledgee its
true and lawful attorney-in-fact, irrevocably, with full authority in the place
and stead of such Pledgor and in the name of such Pledgor or otherwise, from
time to time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, in the Pledgee's reasonable discretion, to act, require, demand,
receive and give acquittance for any and all monies and claims for monies due or
to

<Page>

become due to such Pledgor under or arising out of the Collateral, to endorse
any checks or other instruments or orders in connection therewith and to file
any claims or take any action or institute any proceedings and to execute any
instrument which the Pledgee may reasonably deem necessary or advisable to
accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, which appointment as attorney is
coupled with an interest.

          14. THE PLEDGEE AS COLLATERAL AGENT. The Pledgee will hold in
accordance with this Agreement all items of the Collateral at any time received
under this Agreement. It is expressly understood, acknowledged and agreed by
each Secured Creditor that by accepting the benefits of this Agreement each such
Secured Creditor acknowledges and agrees that the obligations of the Pledgee as
holder of the Collateral and interests therein and with respect to the
disposition thereof, and otherwise under this Agreement, are only those
expressly set forth in this Agreement and in Section 11 of the Credit Agreement.
The Pledgee shall act hereunder on the terms and conditions set forth herein and
in Section 11 of the Credit Agreement.

          15. TRANSFER BY THE PLEDGORS. Except as permitted (i) prior to the
date all Credit Document Obligations have been paid in full and all Commitments
under the Credit Agreement have been terminated, pursuant to the Credit
Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and (ii) thereafter, pursuant to the
other Secured Debt Agreements, no Pledgor will sell or otherwise dispose of,
grant any option with respect to, or mortgage, pledge or otherwise encumber any
of the Collateral or any interest therein.

          16. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE PLEDGORS. (a)
Each Pledgor represents, warrants and covenants that:

     Securities, Partnership Interests and Limited Liability Company Interests
     and that it has sufficient interest in all of its Collateral in which a
     security interest is purported to be created hereunder for such security
     interest to attach (subject, in each case, to no pledge, lien, mortgage,

     encumbrance whatsoever, except the liens and security interests created by

     applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
     similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general equitable
     principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at
     law);

          (iv)   except to the extent already obtained or made, no consent of
     any other party (including, without limitation, any stockholder, partner,

<Page>

     Pledgor or any of its Subsidiaries) is required to be obtained by such
     Pledgor in connection with (a) the execution, delivery or performance of
     this Agreement by such Pledgor, (b) the validity or enforceability of this
     Agreement against such Pledgor, (c) the perfection or enforceability of the

     duly and validly issued, is fully paid and non-assessable and is subject to
     no options to purchase or similar rights;

          (vi)   the pledge, collateral assignment and delivery to the Pledgee
     of such Pledgor's Collateral consisting of Certificated Securities and

     encumbrance or to any agreement purporting to grant to any third party a
     Lien or encumbrance on the property or assets of such Pledgor which would
     include the Securities (other than the liens and security interests
     permitted under the Secured Debt Agreements then in effect) and the Pledgee
     is entitled to all the rights, priorities and benefits afforded by the UCC
     or other relevant law as enacted in any relevant jurisdiction to perfect
     security interests in respect of such Collateral; and

          (vii)  "control" (as defined in Section 8-106 of the UCC) has been
     obtained by the Pledgee over all of such Pledgor's Collateral consisting of
     Securities (including, without limitation, Notes evidencing Indebtedness in
     a principal amount equal to or greater than $2,000,000 which are Securities
     but excluding (x) Securities in the form of Cash Equivalents, Foreign Cash
     Equivalents and Margin Stock held by such Pledgor as a result of
     investments by such Pledgor in Cash Equivalents, Foreign Cash Equivalents
     and Margin Stock made in the ordinary course of business and in accordance
     with Section 8.06(a) and (r) of the Credit Agreement any (y) each Note
     evidencing Indebtedness of less than $2,000,000) with respect to which such
     "control" may be obtained pursuant to Section 8-106 of the UCC, except to
     the extent that the obligation of the applicable Pledgor to provide the
     Pledgee with "control" of such Collateral has not yet arisen under this
     Agreement; PROVIDED that in the case of the Pledgee obtaining "control"
     over Collateral consisting of a Security Entitlement, such Pledgor shall
     have taken all steps in its control so that the Pledgee obtains "control"
     over such Security Entitlement.

          (b)    Each Pledgor covenants and agrees that it will defend the
Pledgee's right, title and security interest in and to such Pledgor's Collateral
and the proceeds thereof against the claims and demands of all persons
whomsoever; and each Pledgor covenants and agrees that it will have like title
to and right to pledge any other property at any time hereafter pledged to the
Pledgee by such Pledgor as Collateral hereunder (subject in the case of
Collateral consisting of Equity Interests in a Joint Venture that is not a
Subsidiary of such Pledgor, to restrictions on the transfer of such Equity
Interests that may appear in the organizational documents for such Joint
Venture), and will likewise defend the right thereto and security interest
therein of the Pledgee and the other Secured Creditors.

<Page>

          (c)    Each Pledgor covenants and agrees that it will take no action
which would violate any of the terms of any Secured Debt Agreement.

          17. PLEDGORS' OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE, ETC. The obligations of each
Pledgor under this Agreement shall be absolute and unconditional and shall
remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released,
suspended, discharged, terminated or otherwise affected by, any circumstance or
occurrence whatsoever (other than termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 19 hereof), including, without limitation:

          (i)    any renewal, extension, amendment or modification of, or
     addition or supplement to or deletion from any Secured Debt Agreement
     (other than this Agreement in accordance with its terms), or any other
     instrument or agreement referred to therein, or any assignment or transfer
     of any thereof;

          (ii)   any waiver, consent, extension, indulgence or other action or
     inaction under or in respect of any such agreement or instrument including,
     without limitation, this Agreement (other than a waiver, consent or
     extension with respect to this Agreement in accordance with its terms);

          (iii)  any furnishing of any additional security to the Pledgee or its
     assignee or any acceptance thereof or any release of any security by the
     Pledgee or its assignee;

          (iv)   any limitation on any party's liability or obligations under
     any such instrument or agreement or any invalidity or unenforceability, in
     whole or in part, of any such instrument or agreement or any term thereof;
     or

          (v)    any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, composition,
     adjustment, dissolution, liquidation or other like proceeding relating to
     any Pledgor or any Subsidiary of any Pledgor, or any action taken with
     respect to this Agreement by any trustee or receiver, or by any court, in
     any such proceeding, whether or not such Pledgor shall have notice or
     knowledge of any of the foregoing.

          18. SALE OF COLLATERAL WITHOUT REGISTRATION. If at any time when the
Pledgee shall determine to exercise its right to sell all or any part of the
Collateral consisting of Securities, Limited Liability Company Interests or
Partnership Interests pursuant to Section 7 hereof, and such Collateral or the
part thereof to be sold shall not, for any reason whatsoever, be effectively
registered under the Securities Act, as then in effect, the Pledgee may, in its
sole and absolute discretion, sell such Collateral or part thereof by private
sale in such manner and under such circumstances as the Pledgee may deem
necessary or advisable in order that such sale may legally be effected without
such registration. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in any such
event the Pledgee, in its sole and absolute discretion (i) may proceed to make
such private sale notwithstanding that a registration statement for the purpose
of registering such Collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under such
Securities Act, (ii) may approach and negotiate with a single possible purchaser
to effect such sale, and (iii) may restrict such sale to a purchaser who will
represent and agree that such purchaser is purchasing for its own account, for
investment, and not with a view to the distribution or sale of such Collateral
or part thereof. In the event of any such sale, the Pledgee shall incur no
responsibility

<Page>

or liability for selling all or any part of the Collateral at a price which the
Pledgee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable
under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially
higher price might be realized if the sale were deferred until the registration
as aforesaid.

          19. TERMINATION; RELEASE. (a) On the Termination Date (as defined
below), this Agreement shall terminate (provided that all indemnities set forth
herein including, without limitation, in Section 11 hereof shall survive any
such termination) and the Pledgee, at the request and expense of such Pledgor,
will execute and deliver to such Pledgor a proper instrument or instruments
(including UCC termination statements) acknowledging the satisfaction and
termination of this Agreement (including, without limitation, UCC termination
statements and instruments of satisfaction, discharge and/or reconveyance), and
will duly release from the security interest created hereby and assign, transfer
and deliver to such Pledgor (without recourse and without any representation or
warranty) such of the Collateral as may be in the possession of the Pledgee and
as has not theretofore been sold or otherwise applied or released pursuant to
this Agreement, together with any moneys at the time held by the Pledgee or any
of its sub-agents hereunder and, with respect to any Collateral consisting of an
Uncertificated Security, a Partnership Interest or a Limited Liability Company
Interest (other than an Uncertificated Security, Partnership Interest or Limited
Liability Company Interest credited on the books of a Clearing Corporation or
Securities Intermediary), a termination of the agreement relating thereto
executed and delivered by the issuer of such Uncertificated Security pursuant to
Section 3.2(a)(ii) or by the respective partnership or limited liability company
pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(iv)(2). As used in this Agreement, "TERMINATION DATE"
shall mean the date upon which the Commitments under the Credit Agreement have
been terminated and all Covered Agreements have been terminated, no Letter of
Credit or Note (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is outstanding (and all
Loans have been paid in full), all Letters of Credit have been terminated, and
all other Obligations (other than indemnities described herein and described in
Section 12.01 of the Credit Agreement, and any other indemnities set forth in
any other Credit Documents, in each case which are not then due and payable)
then due and payable have been paid in full.

          (b)    In the event that any part of the Collateral is sold or
otherwise disposed of (to a Person other than a Credit Party) (x) at any time
prior to the time at which all Credit Document Obligations have been paid in
full and all Commitments and Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement have
been terminated, in connection with a sale or disposition permitted by Section
8.02 of the Credit Agreement or is otherwise released at the direction of the
Required Lenders (or all the Lenders if required by Section 12.12 of the Credit
Agreement) or (y) at any time thereafter, to the extent permitted by the other
Secured Debt Agreements, and in the case of clauses (x) and (y), the proceeds of
such sale or disposition (or from such release) are applied in accordance with
the terms of the Credit Agreement or such other Secured Debt Agreement, as the
case may be, to the extent required to be so applied, the Pledgee, at the
request and expense of such Pledgor, will duly release from the security
interest created hereby (and will execute and deliver such documentation,
including termination or partial release statements and the like in connection
therewith) and assign, transfer and deliver to such Pledgor (without recourse
and without any representation or warranty) such of the Collateral as is then
being (or has been) so sold or released and as may be in the possession of the
Pledgee (or, in the case of Collateral held

<Page>

by any sub-agent designated pursuant to Section 4 hereto, such sub-agent) and
has not theretofore been released pursuant to this Agreement.

          (c)    At any time that any Pledgor desires that Collateral be
released as provided in the foregoing Section 19(a) or (b), it shall deliver to
the Pledgee (and the relevant sub-agent, if any, designated pursuant to Section
4 hereof) a certificate signed by an authorized officer of such Pledgor stating
that the release of the respective Collateral is permitted pursuant to Section
19(a) or (b) hereof.

          (d)    The Pledgee shall have no liability whatsoever to any other
Secured Creditor as the result of any release of Collateral by it in accordance
with (or which the Collateral Agent in the absence of gross negligence and
willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
final and non-appealable decision) believes to be in accordance with) this
Section 19.

          20. NOTICES, ETC. Except as otherwise specified herein, all notices,
requests, demands or other communications to or upon the respective parties
hereto shall be sent or delivered by mail, telegraph, telex, telecopy, cable or

security interest in the Collateral and shall (i) remain in full force and
effect, subject to release and/or termination as set forth in Section 19, (ii)
be binding upon each Pledgor, its successors and assigns; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,

remedies of the Pledgee hereunder, to the benefit of the Pledgee, the other

Pledgor herein or in any certificate or other instrument delivered by such
Pledgor or on its behalf under this Agreement shall be considered to have been
relied upon by the Secured Creditors and shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other Secured Debt Agreements regardless of
any investigation made by the Secured Creditors or on their behalf.

          23. HEADINGS DESCRIPTIVE. The headings of the several Sections of this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the

          24. GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY
TRIAL. (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF

DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PLEDGOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF
AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE NON-EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS. EACH PLEDGOR HEREBY FURTHER IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH COURTS LACK PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER SUCH
PLEDGOR, AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH
RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT BROUGHT IN ANY OF THE
AFORESAID COURTS THAT ANY SUCH COURT LACKS PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER SUCH

ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

          25. PLEDGOR'S DUTIES. It is expressly agreed, anything herein
contained to the contrary notwithstanding, that each Pledgor shall remain liable
to perform all of the obligations, if any, assumed by it with respect to the
Collateral and the Pledgee shall not have any obligations or liabilities with
respect to any Collateral by reason of or arising out of this Agreement, except
for the safekeeping of Collateral actually in Pledgor's possession, nor shall
the Pledgee be required or obligated in any manner to perform or fulfill any of
the obligations of any Pledgor under or with respect to any Collateral, in each
case unless the Pledgee shall become the absolute owner of such Collateral as a
result of the exercise of its remedies hereunder pursuant to Section 7 of this
Agreement.

          26. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each
of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which
shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A set of counterparts
executed by all the parties hereto shall be lodged with each Pledgor and the
Pledgee.

          27. SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any

<Page>

such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

          28. RECOURSE. This Agreement is made with full recourse to each
Pledgor and pursuant to and upon all the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements on the part of such Pledgor contained herein and in the other
Secured Debt Agreements and otherwise in writing in connection herewith or
therewith.

          29. ADDITIONAL PLEDGORS. It is understood and agreed that any
Subsidiary of Holdings that is required to become a party to this Agreement
after the date hereof pursuant to the requirements of the Credit Agreement or
any other Credit Document, shall become a Pledgor hereunder by (x) executing a
counterpart hereof, or of a Joinder Agreement in the form of Exhibit L to the
Credit Agreement, and delivering same to the Pledgee and (y) delivering
supplements to Annexes A through F, hereto as are necessary to cause such
annexes to be complete and accurate with respect to such additional Pledgor on
such date. In addition, such additional Pledgor shall take actions as specified
in this Agreement as would have been taken by such Pledgor had it been an
original party to this Agreement, in each case with all documents required above
to be delivered to the Pledgee and with all documents and actions required above
to be taken to the reasonable satisfaction of the Pledgee.

          30. LIMITED OBLIGATIONS. It is the desire and intent of each Pledgor
and the Secured Creditors that this Agreement shall be enforced against each
Pledgor to the fullest extent permissible under the laws applied in each
jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, in furtherance of the foregoing, it is noted that the
obligations of each Pledgor constituting a Subsidiary Guarantor have been
limited as provided in the Subsidiaries Guaranty.

          31. RELEASE OF PLEDGORS. If at any time all of the Equity Interests of
any Pledgor owned by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries are sold (to a
Person other than a Credit Party) in a transaction permitted pursuant to the
Credit Agreement (and which does not violate the terms of any other Secured Debt
Agreement then in effect), then, such Pledgor shall be released as a Pledgor
pursuant to this Agreement without any further action hereunder (it being
understood that the sale of all of the Equity Interests in any Person that owns,
directly or indirectly, all of the Equity Interests in any Pledgor shall be
deemed to be a sale of all of the Equity Interests in such Pledgor for purposes
of this Section), and the Pledgee is authorized and directed to execute and
deliver, at the expense of the Pledgors, such instruments of release as are
reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Pledgor and the Pledgee. At any time
that the Borrower desires that a Pledgor be released from this Agreement as
provided in this Section 31, the Borrower shall deliver to the Pledgee a
certificate signed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower stating that the
release of such Pledgor is permitted pursuant to this Section 31. The Pledgee
shall have no liability whatsoever to any other Secured Creditor as a result of
the release of any Pledgor by it in accordance with, or which it believes to be
in accordance with, this Section 31.

                                     * * * *

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each Pledgor and the Pledgee have caused this
