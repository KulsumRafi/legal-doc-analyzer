          in its operation,  provided that the Service  Provider shall determine
          on behalf of the Plan  Administrator,  in accordance with the Plan and
          generally accepted claims administration procedures and practices, the
          initial qualification of claims submitted for benefits hereunder,

     (c)  to  make  such  amendments  in  the  Plan  as it  deems  necessary  or

          other applicable legal requirements,

     (d)  to prepare, distribute and maintain all documents,  records or data as

          necessary or appropriate in order to fulfill its responsibilities with

          uniformly   and   consistently   applied   to   persons   in   similar
          circumstances,

          responsibilities  hereunder and to maintain an accurate written record

hereto, shall be paid out of the assets of the Company. No compensation shall be
paid by the Plan to the Plan Administrator if employed by the Company,  but said

their  duties,  responsibilities  and  authority  hereunder.  No bond  shall  be
required of the Plan Administrator, except as otherwise required by law.

time by the Plan Administrator,  sent by first class mail or delivered in person
to the Plan Administrator.  Any notice, statement, report or other communication
from the Company or the Plan  Administrator to any Executive or other interested
person  required  or  permitted  by the Plan  shall be  deemed to have been duly
delivered when given to such person or mailed by first class mail to such person
at his  address  last  appearing  on the  records of the  Company.  Each  person
entitled to receive  services  under the Plan shall file in accordance  herewith
his complete mailing address and each change therein.  If the Plan Administrator

entitled  thereto,  it may, by registered  mail  addressed to such person at his
address last known to the Plan Administrator, notify such person that all future
payments will be withheld  until such person  submits to the Plan  Administrator
his proper mailing address and such other information as the Plan  Administrator
may reasonably request.

     Section 8.1. In General. Any and all rights accruing to any Executive under
the Plan shall be subject to all terms and  conditions of the Plan. The adoption
and maintenance of the Plan shall not constitute a contract  between the Company
and an Executive or be a  consideration  for, or an  inducement or condition of,
employment of any Executive. Neither participation nor anything contained in the
Plan  shall give any  Executive  the right to be  retained  in the employ of the

Executive at any time.

Plan shall be deemed to have been waived, and there shall be no estoppel against
the  enforcement of any provision of the Plan,  except by written  instrument of
the party charged with such waiver or estoppel.  No such written waiver shall be
deemed a continuing  waiver unless  specifically  stated therein,  and each such
waiver shall operate only as to the specific term or condition  waived and shall
not  constitute a waiver of such term or  condition  for the future or as to any
act other than that specifically waived.

     Section 8.4.  Limitation on Actions. No action at law or in equity shall be
instituted to recover under the Plan prior to the expiration of ninety (90) days

inserted for  convenience  only and shall not affect the meaning of the language
contained herein.

     Section  8.8.  No  Guarantee   of  Tax   Consequences.   Neither  the  Plan
Administrator nor the Company makes any commitment or guarantee that any amounts
paid by the  Company  on behalf of an  Executive  shall be  excludable  from the
Executive's  gross income for federal or state income tax purposes,  or that any
other  federal or state tax  treatment  shall  apply to or be  available  to any
Executive.  It shall be the  obligation of each  Executive to determine  whether
such payment under the Plan is excludable from the Executive's  gross income for
federal or state income tax purposes, and to notify the Company if the Executive
has reason to believe that any such payment is not so excludable.

     Section 8.9.  Severability of Provisions.  If any provision of this Plan is
determined to be invalid or  unenforceable,  that  provision  shall be severable
from the other provisions of the Plan.
