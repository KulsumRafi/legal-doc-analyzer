                                  CONFIDENTIAL
                     PURCHASE AND SALE AND RELEASE AGREEMENT

     THIS PURCHASE AND SALE AND RELEASE  AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of the 27 day of February,  2003 (the "Effective  Date"), by and
among Color Imaging,  Inc., a Delaware  corporation  (the "Company") and Stephen
Chromik, a resident of United Kingdom ("Mr. Chromik").

                                   WITNESSETH

     WHEREAS,  Mr.  Chromik  acquired  150,000 shares of the Common Stock of the
Company  ("Chromik  Shares")  and a warrant to  purchase  300,000  shares of the
Common Stock of the Company ("Chromik Warrant") pursuant to that certain Private
Placement completed in 2001;

     WHEREAS,  Mr.  Chromik  is now  dissatisfied  with the  investment  related
thereto,  including  the timing  of, and the  divestiture  of,  Logical  Imaging
Solutions  by the  Company,  the  Chromik  Warrant  being  for two years per the
documentation when Mr. Chromik believed the Chromik Warrant was for three years,
the delay of the  Company's  registration  statement  being  effective,  and the
involvement of the Company with Wall Street Consulting Corp., which was a factor
in the delay of the Company's registration statement being effective,  and other
related broker dealer issues;

     WHEREAS,  Mr. Chromik  desires to sell, and the Company desires to purchase
the Chromik Shares and the Chromik Warrant (collectively, the "Securities").

     IT IS THEREFORE AGREED, in consideration of the mutual promises,  covenants
and  premises  herein,  for  good  and  valuable  consideration   simultaneously
exchanged  between the Company and the Mr. Chromik,  the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby expressly acknowledged, the parties hereto mutually covenant
and agree as follows:

     1. Sale of Securities. Mr. Chromik hereby sells and assigns to the Company,
and  the  Company  hereby  purchases,  the  Securities  free  and  clear  of all
encumbrances  or  restrictions  for an aggregate  purchase  price of U.S.  Three
Hundred  Thousand  Dollars  ($300,000),  payable in accordance  with the payment
schedule  attached hereto as Exhibit A. At any time prior to the payment for all
of the  Securities by the Company,  Mr. Chromik shall have the one-time right to
cancel his sale of the  Securities  not yet paid for by the Company upon written
notice to the Company.  Upon receipt of such  notice,  the Company  shall not be
obligated to purchase the  remaining  Securities.  For example,  if Mr.  Chromik
delivers  a  written  notice of his  intent  to cease the sale of the  remaining
Securities  to the Company on October 1, 2003,  Mr.  Chromik will retain  33,332
shares of Common Stock of the Company and a warrant to purchase 66,664 shares of
Common Stock.  The Company will have paid Mr. Chromik  $233,336 and will have no
further  obligation  to purchase the shares and warrant  shares  retained by Mr.
Chromik.

     2.  Representations of Mr. Chromik.  Mr. Chromik represents that he has the
legal right and power, and all consents,  approvals and authorizations  required
by law,  to enter into this  Agreement  and to sell,  transfer  and  deliver the
Securities in the manner provided in this Agreement. The Securities are free and
clear of any security interest, pledge, lien, charge, adverse claim of ownership

                               ESCROW INSTRUCTIONS

     These  Escrow  Instructions  are given by Color  Imaging,  Inc., a Delaware

     2. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ESCROW:

          (a) Escrow Holder will open an escrow account (the "Escrow"),  and the

     instructions  to  disbursement of such items to the Company have been fully
     satisfied.

     3.  INVESTMENT:  All funds will be held by Escrow Holder in a bank account.
No funds will earn  interest  until Escrow  Holder  receives an I.R.S.  Form W-9
completed and executed by Mr. Chromik and the Company's check has been collected
in good funds.

     4. CLOSING:  The Escrow will remain open until the earliest to occur of the
following (the "Closing Date"):

     shall be fully  released from any  obligation to perform any further duties
     imposed upon it  hereunder,  and the Company shall pay Escrow Holder actual
     costs,  expenses and  reasonable  attorney's  fees  expended or incurred by
     Escrow Holder,  the amount thereof to be fixed and a judgment thereof to be

honor and follow instructions, amendments or other orders ("orders") which shall
be provided by telephone  facsimile  transmission  ("faxed") to Escrow Holder in
connection  with this escrow and may act  thereon  without  further  inquiry and
regardless of by whom or by what means the actual or purported  signature of the
Company may have been affixed  thereto if such signature in Escrow Holder's sole
judgment  resembles the signature of the Company.  The Company  indemnifies  and
holds Escrow Holder free and harmless from any and all liability,  suits, claims
or causes of action  which may arise from loss or claim of loss  resulting  from
any forged,  improper,  wrongful or unauthorized faxed order. The Company agrees
to pay all actual  attorney fees and cost  reasonably  incurred by Escrow Holder
(or allocable to its in-house counsel), in connection with said claim(s).
