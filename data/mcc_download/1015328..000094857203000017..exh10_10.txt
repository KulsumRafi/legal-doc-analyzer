                                SUBORDINATED NOTE

THIS  OBLIGATION  IS NOT A DEPOSIT  AND IS NOT  INSURED BY THE  FEDERAL  DEPOSIT
INSURANCE  CORPORATION.  THIS  OBLIGATION  IS  SUBORDINATED  TO  THE  CLAIMS  OF
DEPOSITORS,  IS INELIGIBLE AS  COLLATERAL  FOR A LOAN BY THE LENDER,  AND IS NOT

$25,000,000

Date: October 29, 2002                           Maturity Date: October 29, 2012


         WINTRUST   FINANCIAL   CORPORATION,   an  Illinois   corporation   (the
"Borrower"),  promises to pay to the order of LASALLE BANK NATIONAL  ASSOCIATION
 --------
(the  "Lender"),  at the  Lender's  offices at 135 S. LaSalle  Street,  Chicago,
       ------
Illinois 60603,  in lawful money of the United States of America,  the principal
amount of TWENTY FIVE MILLION AND 00/THS  DOLLARS  ($25,000,000),  together with
interest on the part of the principal  amount from time to time remaining unpaid
from this date  until  such  principal  is paid at the rate and  payable  in the
manner set forth below.

         The entire unpaid  principal of this Note and any accrued interest then
unpaid shall be due and payable on or before  October 29, 2012.  The interest on
this Note shall be due and payable  quarterly  commencing  November 29, 2002 and
continuing on each  February 28, May 29,  August 29 and November 29  thereafter,
and on the date on which this Note is payable, or after maturity, on demand. The
Borrower shall have the right and privilege of prepaying all or any part of this
Note at any time without  notice or penalty,  subject to approval of the Federal
Reserve Bank (if required), and all payments on this Note shall be applied first
to accrued interest and the balance, if any, to principal.

         Borrower  shall  make a  principal  payment  of  Five  Million  Dollars
($5,000,000)  on November 29, 2008 and on the same day of each year  thereafter,
through and  including  November 29, 2011 and a final  payment of the  principal
balance due, if any, shall be paid on October 29, 2012.

         Interest  hereunder  shall be  calculated  at the LIBOR Rate plus 2.60%
(calculated  on the  actual  number  of days  elapsed  on the basis of a 360 day
year). "LIBOR" means the rate of interest equal to the offered rate for deposits
        -----
in United  States  dollars for an Interest  Period as published  in  Bloomberg's
LIBOR BBA US Dollar Fixing Report at approximately  11:30 a.m. (London,  England
time) one banking day prior to the first day of such Interest Period,  such rate
to remain fixed for the applicable Interest Period. "Interest Period" shall mean
                                                     ---------------
a three month period  (except that the first and last periods of the Loan may be
less than a 90 day  period);  by notice  given to the Lender not less than three
banking days prior to the first day of each respective Interest Period; provided
that the final Interest  Period shall be such that its  expiration  occurs on or
before the stated maturity date of this Note.

         Lender's  determination of LIBOR as provided above shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error.  Furthermore,  if Lender determines, in good faith (which
determination  shall  be  conclusive,


<PAGE>

absent manifest  error),  prior to the  commencement of any Interest Period that
(i) U.S. Dollar deposits of sufficient amount and maturity for funding the Loans
are not  available to Lender in the London  Interbank  Eurodollar  market in the
ordinary course of business,  or (ii) by reason of  circumstances  affecting the
London  Interbank  Eurodollar  market,  adequate and fair means do not exist for
ascertaining  the rate of interest to be  applicable  to the Loans  requested by
Borrower to be LIBOR Rate Loans or the Loans  bearing  interest at the rates set
forth in this paragraph shall not represent the effective  pricing to Lender for
U.S. Dollar deposits of a comparable amount for the relevant period (such as for
example,  but  not  limited  to,  official  reserve  requirements   required  by
Regulation D to the extent not given  effect in  determining  the rate),  Lender
shall promptly notify Borrower and no additional  LIBOR Rate Loans shall be made
until such circumstances are cured.

         If, after the date hereof,  the  introduction  of, or any change in any
applicable law, treaty,  rule,  regulation or guideline or in the interpretation
or administration thereof by any governmental authority or any central Lender or
other fiscal, monetary or other authority having jurisdiction over Lender or its
lending  offices (a "Regulatory  Change"),  shall,  in the opinion of counsel to
                     ------------------
Lender,  make it unlawful for Lender to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans,  then
Lender  shall  promptly  notify  Borrower  and (i) the LIBOR  Rate  Loans  shall
immediately  convert to Prime Rate  Loans on the last  Business  Day of the then
existing  Interest Period or on such earlier date as required by law and (ii) no
additional LIBOR Rate Loans shall be made until such circumstance is cured.

         If,  for any  reason,  a LIBOR  Rate  Loan is paid  prior  to the  last
Business Day of any Interest  Period or if a LIBOR Rate Loan does not occur on a
date  specified by Borrower in its request  (other than as a result of a default
by Lender),  Borrower agrees to indemnify Lender against any loss (including any
loss on  redeployment  of the deposits or other funds acquired by Lender to fund
or maintain such LIBOR Rate Loan) cost or expense incurred by Lender as a result
of such prepayment.

         If any Regulatory Change (whether or not having the force of law) shall
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any assessment,  reserve,  special deposit
or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account
of or loans by, or any other  acquisition of funds or disbursements  by, Lender;
(ii)  subject  Lender or the LIBOR Rate  Loans to any Tax  ("Tax"  shall mean in
                                                             ---
relation to any LIBOR Rate Loans and the  applicable  LIBOR Rate, any tax, levy,
impost, duty, deduction,  withholding or charges of whatever nature required (i)
to be paid by Lender  and/or (ii) to be  withheld  or deducted  from any payment
otherwise required hereby to be made by Borrower to Lender;  provided,  that the
term "Tax" shall not include any taxes imposed upon the net income of Lender) or
change the basis of taxation of payments to Lender of  principal or interest due
from  Borrower to Lender  hereunder  (other than a change in the taxation of the
overall  net income of  Lender);  or (c)  impose on Lender  any other  condition
regarding  the LIBOR Rate Loans or Lender's  funding  thereof,  and Lender shall
determine (which  determination shall be conclusive,  absent any manifest error)
that the result of the  foregoing is to increase the cost to Lender of making or
maintaining  the LIBOR  Rate  Loans or to reduce  the  amount  of  principal  or
interest  received by Lender  hereunder,  then Borrower shall pay to Lender,  on
demand,  such additional  amounts as Lender shall, from time to time,  determine
are  sufficient to compensate  and indemnify  Lender from such increased cost or
reduced amount.

         Lender shall  receive  payments of amounts of principal of and interest
with  respect to the LIBOR Rate Loans free and clear of, and  without  deduction
for,  any Tax. If (1) Lender shall be

                                     - 2 -
<PAGE>

subject to any Tax in respect  of any LIBOR Rate Loans or any part  thereof  or,
(2)  Borrower  shall be  required  to  withhold  or deduct any Tax from any such
amount,  the LIBOR Rate applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loans shall be adjusted by
Lender to reflect all additional costs incurred by Lender in connection with the
payment by Lender or the  withholding by Borrower of such Tax and Borrower shall
provide  Lender with a statement  detailing  the amount of any such Tax actually
paid by Borrower.  Determination  by Lender of the amount of such costs shall be
conclusive,  absent manifest error. If after any such adjustment any part of any
Tax paid by Lender is subsequently  recovered by Lender,  Lender shall reimburse
Borrower to the extent of the amount so recovered.  A certificate  of an officer
of Lender setting forth the amount of such recovery and the basis therefor shall
be conclusive, absent manifest error.

         Borrower  hereby  further  promises  to pay to the order of Lender,  on
demand,  interest on the unpaid principal amount hereof after maturity  (whether
by  acceleration or otherwise) at the Lender's Prime Rate plus two percent (2%).
"Prime  Rate"  shall mean the rate of interest  which  Lender  announces  as its
 -----------
"prime  rate" and is not intended to be the lowest or best rate which it charges
to its customers.  The Prime Rate  hereunder  shall change if and when the Prime
Rate of Lender  changes.  In the event the Lender is unable to make LIBOR Loans,
the interest rate hereunder shall change to the per annum rate of the Prime Rate
plus one percent (1%).

         The indebtedness of the Borrower evidenced by this Note,  including the
principal and premium,  if any, and interest shall be subordinate  and junior in
right of payment to its  obligations to its depositors,  its  obligations  under
bankers'  acceptances  and letters of credit,  and its  obligations to its other
creditors,  including  its  obligations  to the Federal  Reserve  Bank,  Federal
Deposit Insurance  Corporation  (FDIC), and any rights acquired by the FDIC as a
result of loans made by the FDIC to the Borrower or the purchase or guarantee of
any of its assets by the FDIC pursuant to the provisions of 12 USC 1823(c),  (d)
or (e),  whether now  outstanding  or  hereafter  incurred.  In the event of any
insolvency, receivership, conservatorship, reorganization, readjustment of debt,
marshaling of assets and  liabilities or similar  proceedings or any liquidation
or winding up of or relating to the Borrower,  whether voluntary or involuntary,
all such  obligations  shall be  entitled  to be paid in full before any payment
shall be made on account of the principal  of, or premium,  if any, or interest,
on the Note. In the event of any such proceedings,  after payment in full of all
sums owing on such prior obligations, the holder, of the Note, together with any
obligations of the Borrower ranking on a parity with the Note, shall be entitled
to be paid  from the  remaining  assets of the  Borrower  the  unpaid  principal
thereof and any unpaid premium, if any, and interest before any payment or other
distribution,  whether in cash, property, or otherwise, shall be made on account
of any capital stock or any  obligations  of the Borrower  ranking junior to the
Note.  Nothing  herein shall impair the  obligation  of the  Borrower,  which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest
on the Note according to its terms.

         This Note shall become  immediately  due and payable,  at the option of
the holder,  without  presentment or demand or any notice to the Borrower or any
other person obligated,  (i) upon default in the payment of any of the principal
or  interest,  for a period of 15 days after such  payment is due;  or (ii) upon
default (a) in the payment of any of the  principal  of or interest on any other
indebtedness  of the Borrower for borrowed  money owing from the Borrower to the
Lender,  or (b) in the payment of any other material  indebtedness  for borrowed
money and, in either event, the continuance of such default beyond any period of
grace   provided  for  in  the  instrument  or   instruments   evidencing   such
indebtedness.

         The  Borrower  waives  demand,   presentment  for  payment,  notice  of
nonpayment, notice of protest, and all other notices.

         Notwithstanding   any  other   provisions   of  this  Note,   including
specifically  those set forth in the sections relating to subordination,  events
of default and covenants of the Borrower,  it is expressly understood and agreed
that the  Federal  Reserve  Bank (FRB) or any  receiver  or  conservator  of the
Borrower  appointed  by the FRB shall have the right in the  performance  of his
legal  duties,  and as part of  liquidation  designed  to protect or further the
continued  existence  of the  Borrower  or the rights of any parties or agencies
with an interest in, or claim against,  the Borrower or its assets,  to transfer
or  direct  the  transfer  of the  obligations  of this Note to any bank or bank
holding  company  selected by such  official  which shall  expressly  assume the
obligation of the due and punctual payment of the unpaid principal, and interest
and premium,  if any, on this Note and the due and punctual  performance  of all
covenants and  conditions;  and the  completion of such transfer and  assumption
shall serve to supersede  and void any default,  acceleration  or  subordination
which may have occurred,  or which may occur due or related to such transaction,
plan, transfer or assumption, pursuant to the provisions of this Note, and shall
serve to return the holder to the same position,  other than for substitution of
the  obligor,   it  would  have  occupied  had  no  default,   acceleration   or
subordination  occurred;  except that any interest and principal previously due,
other than by reason of  acceleration,  and not paid shall,  in the absence of a
contrary  agreement by the holder of this Note, be deemed to be immediately  due
and payable as of the date of such  transfer and  assumption,  together with the
interest from its original due date at the rate provided for herein.

         Borrower  hereby  authorizes  the Lender to charge  any  account of the
Borrower  for sums due  hereunder.  Principal  payments  submitted  in funds not
available until collected  shall continue to bear interest until  collected.  If
payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday
under  the laws of the  United  States or the  State of  Illinois,  the due date
thereof  shall be extended to the next  succeeding  business  day,  and interest
shall be payable thereon at the rate specified during such extension.

         Borrower  shall be in default  hereunder if: (1) any amount  payable on
this Note (the  "Obligations"),  is not paid when  due;  or (2)  Borrower  shall
                 -----------
otherwise  fail to perform any of the  material  promises to be  performed by it
hereunder  or under any other  agreement  with Lender and all  applicable  grace
periods have  expired;  or (3) the Borrower or any person who is or shall become
primarily or  secondarily  liable for any of the  Obligations,  who is a natural
person, dies; or (4) the Borrower, or any other party liable with respect to the
Obligations,  or any guarantor or accommodation endorser or third party pledgor,
shall make any  assignment  for the  benefit  of  creditors,  or there  shall be
commenced any bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency, reorganization,  dissolution
or liquidation  proceedings by or against,  or the entry of any judgment,  levy,
attachment,  garnishment or other process against the Borrower or any guarantor,
or any other party  liable with  respect to the  Obligations,  or  accommodation
endorser or third party pledgor for any of the Obligations or against any of the
Collateral or any of the collateral under a separate  security  agreement signed
by any one of them,  unless released,  satisfied or dismissed within thirty (30)
days; or (5) there is a  discontinuance  or  termination by any guarantor of any
guaranty  of the  Obligations  hereunder,  or any  guarantor  of this Note shall
contest the validity of such  guaranty;  or (6) failure of the  Borrower,  after
request by the Lender, to furnish financial information  concerning the Borrower
or to permit  inspection by the Lender of the Borrower's books and records;  (7)
the  determination  by the Lender that a material adverse change has occurred in
the financial condition

                                     - 4 -
<PAGE>

of the  Borrower  from the  condition  set  forth in the most  recent  financial
statement  of the  Borrower  furnished  to the  Lender,  or from  the  financial
condition of the Borrower  most recently  disclosed to Lender in any manner;  or
(8) any oral or written  warranty,  representation,  certificate or statement of
the Borrower to the Lender is untrue.

         Whenever the Borrower shall be in default as aforesaid,  without demand
or notice of any kind, the entire unpaid amount of all Obligations  shall become
immediately due and payable and Lender may exercise,  from time to time, any and
all rights and remedies available to it.

         The  Borrower  waives  the  benefit  of any law  that  would  otherwise
restrict  or  limit  Lender  in the  exercise  of its  right,  which  is  hereby
acknowledged,  to  appropriate  without  notice,  at  any  time  hereafter,  any
indebtedness matured or unmatured, owing from Lender to the Borrower. The Lender
may, from time to time,  without demand or notice of any kind,  appropriate  and
apply  toward  the  payment  of such of the  obligations,  and in such  order of
application,  as the  Lender  may,  from  time to time,  elect  any and all such
balances,  credits,  deposits,  accounts,  moneys,  cash  equivalents  and other
assets, of or in the name of the Borrower, then or thereafter with the Lender.

         The Borrower and any and all endorsers and accommodation  parties,  and
each of  them,  waive  any and all  presentment,  demand,  notice  of  dishonor,
protest, and all other notices and demands in connection with the enforcement of
Lender's  rights  hereunder.  No obligation of the Borrower  hereunder  shall be
waived by the Lender  except in  writing.  No delay on the part of the Lender in
the exercise of any right or remedy shall  operate as a waiver  thereof,  and no
single or partial  exercise by the Lender of any right or remedy shall  preclude
other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right or remedy.
This  Note  (i) is  valid,  binding  and  enforceable  in  accordance  with  its
provisions,  and no conditions exist to its legal  effectiveness;  (ii) contains
the  entire  agreement  between  the  Borrower  and  Lender;  (iii) is the final
expression  of  their   intentions;   and  (iv)  supersedes  all   negotiations,
representations,  warranties,  commitments,  offers,  contracts  (of any kind or
nature,  whether oral or written) prior to or contemporaneous with the execution
hereof. No prior or contemporaneous representations, warranties, understandings,
offers or  agreements  of any kind or nature,  whether oral or written have been
made by Lender or relied upon by the Borrower in  connection  with the execution
hereof.  No  modification,  discharge,  termination  or  waiver  or  any  of the
provisions  hereof  shall be binding upon the Lender,  except as  expressly  set
forth in writing duly signed and delivered on behalf of the Lender.

         The Borrower agrees to pay all costs,  legal expenses,  attorneys' fees
and paralegals'  fees of every kind, paid or incurred by Lender in enforcing its
rights  hereunder,  including,  but not limited to,  litigation  or  proceedings
initiated under the United States  Bankruptcy Code, or in defending  against any
defense, cause of action, counterclaim, setoff or crossclaim based on any act of
commission  or  omission by the Lender  with  respect to this Note,  promptly on
demand of Lender or other person paying or incurring the same.

         To induce  the  Lender to make the loan  evidenced  by this  Note,  the
Borrower irrevocably agrees that all actions arising directly or indirectly as a
result or in consequence of this Note or any other agreement with the Lender may
be  instituted  and  litigated  in courts  having  situs in the City of Chicago,
Illinois,  and the Borrower  hereby consents to the exclusive  jurisdiction  and
venue of any State or Federal  Court  located and having its situs in said city,
and waives any objection based on

                                     - 5 -

forum nonconveniens. Furthermore, the Borrower waives all notices and demands in
connection with the enforcement of the Lender's rights hereunder.

         The  loan  evidenced  hereby  has  been  made  and  this  Note has been
delivered at the Lender's main office. This Note shall be governed and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, in which state it shall be
performed,  and shall be binding upon the Borrower and their  respective  heirs,
legal representatives, successors and assigns. Wherever possible, each provision
of this Note shall be  interpreted  in such manner as to be effective  and valid
under  applicable  law, but if any provision of this Note shall be prohibited by
or be  invalid  under  such  law,  such  provision  shall be  severable,  and be
ineffective  to  the  extent  of  such   prohibition   or  invalidity,   without
invalidating the remaining provisions of this Note.

         The  Borrower  acknowledges  and agrees that the  lending  relationship
hereby  created  with the Lender is and has been  conducted on an open and arm's
length basis in which no fiduciary relationship exists and that the Borrower has
not relied and is not relying on any such fiduciary relationship in consummating
the loan(s) evidenced by this Note.

         THE LENDER AND THE BORROWER  KNOWINGLY,  VOLUNTARILY AND  INTENTIONALLY
WAIVE  IRREVOCABLY,  THE  RIGHT TO  TRIAL  BY JURY  WITH  RESPECT  TO ANY  LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS  BASED HEREON,  OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION  WITH THIS
NOTE, OR ANY AGREEMENT  EXECUTED OR  CONTEMPLATED  TO BE EXECUTED IN CONJUNCTION
HEREWITH OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT OR COURSE OF DEALING,  IN WHICH THE LENDER AND
THE BORROWER ARE ADVERSE  PARTIES.  THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL  INDUCEMENT FOR
THE LENDER GRANTING ANY FINANCIAL ACCOMMODATION TO THE BORROWER.
