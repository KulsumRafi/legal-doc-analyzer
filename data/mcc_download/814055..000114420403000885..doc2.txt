                                   LITIGATION



         On June 4, 1999, a complaint was filed against the Company in the Court
of  Chancery  of the State of  Delaware  in and for New Castle  County  entitled
George Von Opel v. Youbet Inc. (C.A. No. 17200 NC). In the complain Mr. Von Opel
alleges  that the Company  breached  its  contractual  obligation  pursuant to a
Private  Placement  Memorandum by failing to register the shares of common stock
underlying  400,000  warrants  issued by the Company to an  affiliate of Mr. Von
Opel.  The complain  seeks  specific  performance  of the alleged  obligation to
register such shares and damages for alleged breach of contract in the amount of
$8.7  million.  The Company has  answered  the  complaint  and intends to defend
itself  vigorously  in the action.  On August 19,  1999,  Mr. Von Opel moved for
summary  judgment on the issue of  liability,  which on June 2, 2000,  the court
denied.  The Company is proceeding with discovery and has noticed the deposition
of Mr. Von Opel. As the litigation is at an initial stage,  an outcome cannot be
predicted at this time.
