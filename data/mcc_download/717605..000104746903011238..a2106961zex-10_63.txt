         2. REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.

     (a) Except as set forth in Section 2(b) below, the Company and the
   Guarantors agree to file with the Commission under the Securities Act on or
   prior to 120 days after the Closing Date, a registration statement relating
   to an offer to exchange (such registration statement, the "Exchange
   Registration Statement", and such offer, the "Exchange Offer") any and all of
   the Securities for a like aggregate principal amount of debt securities
   issued by the Company and guaranteed by each of the Guarantors, which debt
   securities and guarantees are substantially identical to the Securities and
   the related Guarantees, respectively (and are entitled to the benefits of a
   trust indenture which is substantially identical to the Indenture or is the
   Indenture and which has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act), except
   that they have been registered pursuant to an effective registration
   statement under the

                                       4
<Page>

   Securities Act and do not contain provisions for the additional interest
   contemplated in Section 2(d) below (such new debt securities hereinafter
   called "Exchange Securities"). The Company and the Guarantors will use their
   best efforts to have the Exchange Registration Statement declared effective
   by the Commission on or prior to 210 days after the Closing Date. The
   Exchange Offer will be registered under the Securities Act on the appropriate
   form and will comply with all applicable tender offer rules and regulations
   under the Exchange Act. Unless the Exchange Offer would not be permitted by
   applicable law or Commission policy, the Company and the Guarantors will
   commence the Exchange Offer and use their best efforts to issue on or prior
   to 60 business days, or longer, if required by the federal securities laws,
   after the date on which the Exchange Registration Statement was declared
   effective by the Commission, Exchange Securities in exchange for all notes
   tendered prior thereto in the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer will be
   deemed to have been "completed" only if the debt securities and related
   guarantees received by holders other than Restricted Holders in the Exchange
   Offer for Registrable Securities are, upon receipt, transferable by each such
   holder without restriction under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
   without material restrictions under the blue sky or securities laws of a
   substantial majority of the States of the United States of America. The
   Exchange Offer shall be deemed to have been completed upon the earlier to
   occur of (i) the Company having exchanged the Exchange Securities for all
   Outstanding Registrable Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer and (ii)
   the Company having exchanged, pursuant to the Exchange Offer, Exchange
   Securities for all Registrable Securities that have been properly tendered
   and not withdrawn before the expiration of the Exchange Offer, which shall be
   on a date that is at least 30 days following the commencement of the Exchange
   Offer. The Company agrees (x) to include in the Exchange Registration
   Statement a prospectus for use in any resales by any holder of Exchange
   Securities that is a broker-dealer and (y) use its best efforts to keep such
   Exchange Registration Statement effective for a period (the "Resale Period")
   beginning when Exchange Securities are first issued in the Exchange Offer and
   ending upon the earlier of the expiration of the 180th day after the Exchange
   Offer has been completed or such time as such broker-dealers no longer own
   any Registrable Securities. With respect to such Exchange Registration
   Statement, such holders shall have the benefit of the rights of
   indemnification and contribution set forth in Sections 6(a), (c), (d) and (e)
   hereof.

     (b) (i) If the Company and the Guarantors are not required to file the
   Exchange Registration Statement or are not permitted to consummate the
   Exchange Offer because the Exchange Offer is not permitted by applicable law
   or Commission policy, (ii) the Exchange Offer has not been completed within
   270 days following the Closing Date or (iii) any holder of Transfer
   Restricted Securities notifies the Company prior to the 20th day following
   consummation of the Exchange Offer that (a) it is prohibited by law or
   Commission policy from participating in the Exchange Offer, (b) that it may
   not resell the Exchange Securities acquired by it in the Exchange Offer to
   the public without delivering a prospectus and the prospectus contained in
   the Exchange Registration Statement is not appropriate or available for such
   resales, or (c) that it is a broker-dealer and owns notes acquired directly
   from the Company or an Affiliate of the Company, the Company and the
   Guarantors shall, in lieu of (or, in the case of clause (iii), in addition
   to) conducting the Exchange Offer contemplated by Section 2(a), be obligated
   to file with the Commission on or prior to 90 days after such filing
   obligation arises, a "shelf" registration statement providing for the
   registration of, and the sale on a continuous or delayed basis by the holders
   of, all of the Registrable Securities, pursuant to Rule 415 or any similar
   rule that may be adopted by the Commission (such filing, the "Shelf
   Registration" and such registration statement, the "Shelf Registration
   Statement"). The Company and the Guarantors agree to use their best efforts
   (x) to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective by the
   Commission on or prior to

                                       F-1
<Page>

   180 days after such obligation arises and to keep such Shelf Registration
   Statement continuously effective for a period ending on the earlier of the
   second anniversary of the Effective Time or such time as there are no longer
   any Registrable Securities Outstanding, PROVIDED, however, that no holder
   shall be entitled to be named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf
   Registration Statement or to use the prospectus forming a part thereof for
   resales of Registrable Securities unless such holder is an Electing Holder,
   and (y) after the Effective Time of the Shelf Registration Statement,
   promptly upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities that is not
   then an Electing Holder, to take any action reasonably necessary to enable
   such holder to use the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of
   Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, any action necessary
   to identify such holder as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration
   Statement, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing in this Clause (y) shall relieve
   any such holder of the obligation to return a completed and signed Notice and
   Questionnaire to the Company in accordance with Section 3(d)(iii) hereof. The
   Company and the Guarantors further agree to supplement or make amendments to
   the Shelf Registration Statement, as and when required by the rules,
   regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the
   Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or
   rules and regulations thereunder for shelf registration, and the Company
   agrees to furnish to each Electing Holder copies of any such supplement or
   amendment prior to its being used or promptly following its filing with the
   Commission.

     (c) The Company and the Guarantors shall file under the Securities Act, on
   the date that the Exchange Registration Statement (or in lieu thereof, the
   Shelf Registration Statement) becomes or is declared effective, a "shelf"
   registration statement (which may be the Exchange Registration Statement or
   the Shelf Registration Statement if permitted by the rules and regulations of
   the Commission) in a form approved by the Market Maker, pursuant to Rule 415
   under the Securities Act or any similar rule that may be adopted by the
   Commission providing for the registration of, and the sale on a continuous or
   delayed basis in secondary transactions by the Market Maker of, the
   Securities (in the event of a Shelf Registration) or Exchange Securities (in
   the event of an Exchange Offer) (such filing, the "Market Making Shelf", and
   such registration statement, the "Market Making Shelf Registration
   Statement"). The Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
   cause the Market Making Shelf Registration Statement to become or be declared
   effective on or prior to (i) the date the Exchange Offer is completed
   pursuant to clause 2(a) above or (ii) the date the Shelf Registration becomes
   or is declared effective pursuant to clause 2(b) above, and to keep such
   Market Making Shelf continuously effective for so long as the Market Maker
   may be required to deliver a prospectus in connection with secondary
   transactions in the Securities or the Exchange Securities. In the event that
   the Market Maker holds Securities at the time of the Exchange Offer, the
   Company agrees that the Market Making Shelf shall provide for the resale by
   the Market Maker of such Securities and the Company shall use its
   commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Market Making Shelf continuously
   effective until the Market Maker determines in its reasonable judgment that
   they are no longer required to deliver a prospectus in connection with the
   sale of such Securities. The Company further agrees to supplement or make
   amendments to the Market Making Shelf, as and when required by the rules,
   regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the
   Company for such Market Making Shelf or by the Securities Act or rules and
   regulations thereunder for shelf registration, and the Company agrees to
   furnish to the Market Maker copies of any such supplement or amendment prior
   to its being used or promptly following its filing with the Commission.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may suspend the offering and
   sale under the Market Making Shelf Registration Statement for a period or
   periods the Board of

                                       F-2
<Page>

   Directors and the Company reasonably determines to be necessary, but in any
   event not to exceed 120 days in aggregate each year during which the Market
   Making Shelf Registration Statement is required to be effective and usable
   hereunder (measured from the Effective Time of the Market Making Shelf
   Registration Statement to successive anniversaries thereof), if (A) (i) the
   Company or its subsidiaries shall be engaged in a material financing,
   acquisition, disposition, corporate reorganization, merger or other
   transaction or corporate development and (ii) the Board of Directors of the
   Company determines in good faith that disclosure of such transaction would
   not be in the interest of the Company or would have a material adverse effect
   on the consummation of such transaction, and (B) the Company notifies the
   Market Maker within five days after such Board of Directors makes the
   relevant determination set forth in sub-clause (A) of this clause 2(c).

     (d) In the event that (i) the Company and the Guarantors fail to file the
   Exchange Registration Statement, or the Shelf Registration Statement, if
   applicable, on or before the date specified for such filing pursuant to
   Section 2(a) or 2(b), respectively, or (ii) such Exchange Registration
   Statement or Shelf Registration Statement is not declared effective by the
   Commission on or prior to the date specified for such effectiveness (the
   "Effectiveness Target Date") pursuant to Section 2(a), 2(b) or 2(c),
   respectively, or (iii) the Company and the Guarantors fail to consummate the
   Exchange Offer within 30 business days of the Effectiveness Target Date with
   respect to the Exchange Registration Statement (if the Exchange Offer is then
   required to be made) or (iv) any Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf
   Registration Statement required by Section 2(a) or 2(b) hereof is declared
   effective but thereafter ceases to be effective or usable in connection with
   the resales of Transfer Restricted Securities during the periods specified
   herein (except as specifically permitted herein) without being succeeded
   immediately by an additional registration statement filed and declared
   effective (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (iv), a
   "Registration Default" and each period during which a Registration Default
   has occurred and is continuing, a "Registration Default Period"), then the
   Company and the Guarantors will pay as liquidated damages for such
   Registration Default ("Special Interest") to each holder of notes, with
   respect to the first 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of
   the first Registration Default in an amount equal to $.05 per week per $1,000
   principal amount of notes held by such holder. The amount of the Special
   Interest will increase by an additional $.05 per week per $1,000 principal
   amount of notes with respect to each subsequent 90-day period until all
   Registration Defaults have been cured, up to a maximum amount of Special
   Interest for all Registration Defaults of $.20 per week per $1,000 principal
   amount of notes. All accrued Special Interest will be paid by the Company and
   the Guarantors on each Interest Payment Date to the Global Note Holder by
   wire transfer of immediately available funds or by federal funds check and to
   Holders of Certificated Notes by wire transfer to the accounts specified by
   them or by mailing checks to their registered addresses if no such accounts
   have been specified. On or immediately prior to the date of the cure of all
   Registration Defaults, the accrual of Special Interest will cease.

     (e) The Company shall also furnish or cause to be furnished to the Market
   Maker without charge at least one conformed copy of the Market Making
   Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto and as many
   copies of the related prospectus and any amendment or supplement as the
   Market Maker may reasonably request.

     (f) The Company shall take, and shall cause the Guarantors to take, all
   actions necessary or advisable to be taken by it to ensure that the
   transactions contemplated herein are effected as so contemplated, including
   all actions necessary or desirable to register the Guarantee under the
   registration statement contemplated in Section 2(a) or 2(b) hereof, as
   applicable.

   Registration or the Market Making Shelf, as the case may be, the Company

         Exchange Offer and resales of Exchange Securities by broker-dealers
         during the Resale Period to be effected as contemplated by Section
         2(a), and use its best efforts to cause such Exchange Registration
         Statement to become effective on or prior to 210 days after the Closing
         Date;

             (ii) as soon as practicable prepare and file with the Commission

         statement, and confirm such advice in writing, (A) when such Exchange
         Registration Statement or the prospectus included therein or any
         prospectus amendment or supplement or post-effective amendment has been
         filed, and, with respect to such Exchange Registration Statement or any

         any portion of the offering contemplated by such Shelf Registration
         Statement is an underwritten offering or is made through a placement or

         indemnifying any such qualified independent underwriter to the extent
         of the indemnification of underwriters provided in Section 6 hereof (or

         Trustee or to holders as required by Section 4.03 of the Indenture;

             (xxii) if the Market Making Shelf Registration Statement is a Form
         S-1 Registration Statement, promptly upon its satisfying the
         eligibility criteria for use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, the
         Company shall file a post-effective amendment to the Market Making
         Shelf Registration Statement to convert it from a Form S-1 to a Form
         S-3 registration statement; and

             (xxiii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to take all other
         steps necessary to effect or cause the Shelf Registration, if

         methods of distribution thereof described in the Shelf Registration
         Statement, if applicable, and the Market Making Shelf Registration
         Statement.

     (e) In the event that the Company would be required, pursuant to Section
   3(d)(viii)(F) above, to notify the Market Maker and Electing Holders, the
   placement or sales agent, if any, therefor and the managing underwriters, if

   the Electing Holders, to each placement or sales agent, if any, and to each
   such underwriter, if any, a reasonable number of copies of a prospectus
   supplemented or amended so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of
   Registrable Securities, such prospectus shall conform in all material
   respects to the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust
   Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and
   shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
   material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
   statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then
   existing. The Market Maker and each Electing Holder agrees that upon receipt
   of any notice from the Company pursuant to Section 3(d)(viii)(F) hereof, such
   Electing Holder shall forthwith discontinue the disposition of Registrable
   Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, if applicable, and
   the Market Making Shelf Registration Statement applicable to such

                                      F-12

   received copies of such amended or supplemented prospectus, and if so
   directed by the Company, such Market Maker or Electing Holder shall deliver
   to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent
   file copies, then in such Market Maker's or Electing Holder's possession of
   the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of
   such notice.

     (f) With respect to the Market Making Shelf and in the event of a Shelf
   Registration, in addition to the information required to be provided by each
   Electing Holder in its Notice Questionnaire, the Company may require the
   Market Maker or such Electing Holder, as the case may be, to furnish to the
   Company such additional information regarding such Market Maker or Electing
   Holder and such Market Maker's or Electing Holder's intended method of
   distribution of Registrable Securities as may be required in order to comply
   with the Securities Act. The Market Maker and each such Electing Holder
   agrees to notify the Company without delay of any inaccuracy or change in
   information previously furnished by the Market Maker or such Electing Holder
   to the Company or of the occurrence of any event in either case as a result
   of which any prospectus relating to such Shelf Registration or Market Making
   Shelf contains or would contain an untrue statement of a material fact
   regarding such Electing Holder or such Electing Holder's intended method of
   disposition of such Registrable Securities or omits to state any material
   fact regarding the Market Maker or such Electing Holder or the Market Maker's
   or such Electing Holder's intended method of disposition of such Registrable
   Securities required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
   therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing, and
   promptly to furnish to the Company any additional information required to
   correct and update any previously furnished information or required so that
   such prospectus shall not contain, with respect to the Market Maker or such
   Electing Holder or the disposition of such Registrable Securities, an untrue
   statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
   stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
   light of the circumstances then existing.

     (g) Until the expiration of two years after the Closing Date, the Company
   will not, and will not permit any of its "affiliates" (as defined in Rule
   144) to, resell any of the Securities that have been reacquired by any of
   them except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
   Securities Act.

     6. INDEMNIFICATION.

                                      F-15
<Page>

     (a) INDEMNIFICATION BY THE COMPANY AND EACH OF THE GUARANTORS. The Company
   and each of the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold
   harmless each of the holders of Registrable Securities included in an
   Exchange Registration Statement, each of the Electing Holders of Registrable
   Securities included in a Shelf Registration Statement and the Market Maker,
   as holder of Securities or Exchange Securities included in a Market Making
   Shelf Registration Statement and each person who participates as a placement
   or sales agent or as an underwriter in any offering or sale of such
   Registrable Securities against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities,
   joint or several, to which such holder, agent or underwriter may become
   subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
   claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of
   or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
   material fact contained in any Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf
   Registration Statement or Market Making Shelf Registration Statement, as the
   case may be, under which such Registrable Securities were registered under
   the Securities Act, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained
   therein or furnished by the Company to any such holder, Electing Holder,
   agent or underwriter, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of
   or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
   material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
   statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Market Maker, such
   holder, such Electing Holder, such agent and such underwriter for any legal
   or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with
   investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are
   incurred; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither the Company nor any of the
   Guarantors shall be liable to any such person in any such case to the extent
   that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon
   an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
   omission made in such registration statement, or preliminary, final or
   summary prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and
   in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such
   person expressly for use therein.

     (b) INDEMNIFICATION BY THE MARKET MAKERS, HOLDERS AND ANY AGENTS AND
   UNDERWRITERS. The Company may require, as a condition to including any
   Registrable Securities in any registration statement filed pursuant to
   Section 2(b) or Section 2(c) hereof and to entering into any underwriting
   agreement with respect thereto, that the Company shall have received an
   undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from the Market Maker or the
   Electing Holder of such Registrable Securities and from each underwriter
   named in any such underwriting agreement, severally and not jointly, to (i)
   indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of the Guarantors, and all
   other holders of Registrable Securities, against any losses, claims, damages
   or liabilities to which the Company, the Guarantors or such other holders of
   Registrable Securities may become subject, under the Securities Act or
   otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions
   in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or
   alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration
   statement, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein
   or furnished by the Company to the Market Maker or any such Electing Holder,
   agent or underwriter, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of
   or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
   material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
   statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to
   the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
   omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with
   written information furnished to the Company by such Market Maker, if
   applicable, Electing Holder or underwriter expressly for use therein, and
   (ii) reimburse the Company and the Guarantors for any legal or other expenses
   reasonably incurred by the Company and the Guarantors in connection with
   investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are
   incurred; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such Electing Holder shall be required
   to undertake

                                      F-16
<Page>

   liability to any person under this Section 6(b) for any amounts in excess of
   the dollar amount of the proceeds to be received by such Electing Holder from
   the sale of such Electing Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to such
   registration.

     (c) NOTICES OF CLAIMS, ETC. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party
   under subsection (a) or (b) above of written notice of the commencement of
   any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to
   be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to the indemnification
   provisions of or contemplated by this Section 6, notify such indemnifying
   party in writing of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to
   notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which
   it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under the indemnification
   provisions of or contemplated by Section 6(a) or 6(b) hereof. In case any
   such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall
   notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying
   party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it
   shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to
   assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
   indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified
   party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the
   indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the
   defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such
   indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
   expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in
   connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
   investigation. In no event shall an indemnifying party be liable for fees and
   expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate
   from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one
   action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction
   arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying
   party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the
   settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with
   respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which
   indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the
   indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim)
   unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional
   release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such
   action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission
   of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified
   party.

     (d) CONTRIBUTION. If for any reason the indemnification provisions
   contemplated by Section 6(a) or Section 6(b) are unavailable to or
   insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses,
   claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to
   therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or
   payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages
   or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is
   appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the
   indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which
   resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
   respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
   relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be
   determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
   untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state
   a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or
   by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge,
   access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
   omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
   contributions pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by pro rata
   allocation (even if the holders or any agents or underwriters or all of them
   were treated as one entity

                                      F-17

   for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take
   account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(d). The
   amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,
   claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to
   above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses
   reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
   investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
   provisions of this Section 6(d), (i) no holder shall be required to
   contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the dollar amount of
   the proceeds received by such holder from the sale of any Registrable
   Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable
   thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages which such holder has otherwise
   been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or
   omission or alleged omission, (ii) in the case of a Market Making Shelf
   Registration Statement relating to the sale by the Market Maker of
   Securities, Market Maker shall not be required to contribute any amount in
   excess of the amount by which the amount of the proceeds received by the
   Market Maker from the sale of any Registrable Securities (after deducting any
   fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any
   damages which it has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue
   or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (iii) no
   underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the
   amount by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities
   underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public
   exceeds the amount of any damages which such underwriter has otherwise been
   required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or
   omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent
   misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
   shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
   fraudulent misrepresentation. The holders' and any underwriters' obligations
   in this Section 6(d) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the
   principal amount of Registrable Securities registered or underwritten, as the
   case may be, by them and not joint.

     (e) The obligations of the Company and each of the Guarantors under this
   Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the
   Guarantors may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and
   conditions, to each officer, director and partner of the Market Maker, each
   holder, agent and underwriter and each person, if any, who controls the
   Market Maker, any holder, agent or underwriter within the meaning of the
   Securities Act; and the obligations of the Market Maker, the holders and any
   agents or underwriters contemplated by this Section 6 shall be in addition to
   any liability which the respective holder, agent or underwriter may otherwise
   have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer
   and director of the Company or the Guarantors (including any person who, with
   his consent, is named in any registration statement as about to become a
   director of the Company or the Guarantors) and to each person, if any, who
   controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.

     7. UNDERWRITTEN OFFERINGS.

     (a) SELECTION OF UNDERWRITERS. If any of the Registrable Securities covered
   by the Shelf Registration are to be sold pursuant to an underwritten
   offering, the managing underwriter or underwriters thereof shall be
   designated by Electing Holders holding at least a majority in aggregate
   principal amount of the Registrable Securities to be included in such
   offering, provided that such designated managing underwriter or underwriters
   is or are reasonably acceptable to the Company.

     (b) PARTICIPATION BY HOLDERS. Each holder of Registrable Securities hereby
   agrees with each other such holder that no such holder may participate in any
   underwritten offering

                                      F-18
<Page>

   hereunder unless such holder (i) agrees to sell such holder's Registrable
   Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by
   the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii)
   completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities,
   underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the
   terms of such underwriting arrangements.

     8. RULE 144.

        The Company covenants to the holders of Registrable Securities that to
the extent it shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, the Company
shall timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act
or the Securities Act (including the reports under Section 13 and 15(d) of the
Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144 adopted by the
Commission under the Securities Act) and the rules and regulations adopted by
the Commission thereunder, and shall take such further action as any holder of
Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from
time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable Securities without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitations of the exemption
provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from
time to time, or any similar or successor rule or regulation hereafter adopted
by the Commission. Upon the reasonable request of any holder of Registrable
Securities in connection with that holder's sale pursuant to Rule 144, the
Company shall deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has
complied with such requirements.

     9. MISCELLANEOUS.

     (a) NO INCONSISTENT AGREEMENTS. The Company represents, warrants, covenants
   and agrees that it has not granted, and shall not grant, registration rights
   with respect to Registrable Securities or any other securities which would be
   inconsistent with the terms contained in this Exchange and Registration
   Rights Agreement.

     (b) SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties hereto acknowledge that there would
   be no adequate remedy at law if the Company fails to perform any of its
   obligations hereunder and that the Purchasers and the holders from time to
   time of the Registrable Securities may be irreparably harmed by any such
   failure, and accordingly agree that the Purchasers and such holders, in
   addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in
   equity, shall be entitled to compel specific performance of the obligations
   of the Company under this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement in
   accordance with the terms and conditions of this Exchange and Registration
   Rights Agreement, in any court of the United States or any State thereof
   having jurisdiction.

   postage prepaid, return receipt requested) as follows: If to the Company, to
   it at Two Stamford Plaza, 281 Tresser Boulevard, Stamford, Connecticut 06901,
   and if to a holder, to the address of such holder set forth in the security

   Registration Rights Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the
   benefit of and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and the holders

   and assigns of the parties hereto and such

                                      F-19
<Page>

   holders. In the event that any transferee of any holder of Registrable
   Securities shall acquire Registrable Securities, in any manner, whether by
   gift, bequest, purchase, operation of law or otherwise, such transferee
   shall, without any further writing or action of any kind, be deemed a
   beneficiary hereof for all purposes and such Registrable Securities shall be
   held subject to all of the terms of this Exchange and Registration Rights
   Agreement, and by taking and holding such Registrable Securities such
   transferee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of, and be conclusively
   deemed to have agreed to be bound by all of the applicable terms and
   provisions of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement. If the Company
   shall so request, any such successor, assign or transferee shall agree in
   writing to acquire and hold the Registrable Securities subject to all of the
   applicable terms hereof.

     (e) SURVIVAL. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations,
   warranties and each other provision set forth in this Exchange and
   Registration Rights Agreement or made pursuant hereto shall remain in full
   force and effect regardless of any investigation (or statement as to the
   results thereof) made by or on behalf of any holder of Registrable
   Securities, any director, officer or partner of such holder, any agent or
   underwriter or any director, officer or partner thereof, or any controlling
   person of any of the foregoing, and shall survive delivery of and payment for

   thereafter Outstanding shall be bound by any amendment or waiver effected
   pursuant to this Section 9(h), whether or not any notice, writing or marking
   indicating such amendment or waiver appears on such Registrable Securities or
   is delivered to such holder.
