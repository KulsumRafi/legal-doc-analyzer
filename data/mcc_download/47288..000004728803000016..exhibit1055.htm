<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>THIS
AGREEMENT</B> (the &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;) is entered into by and among J. Herbert

&#147;<U>Hibernia</U>&#148;). </FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=4>1. EMPLOYMENT AND TERM </FONT></H1>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>1.1</B>
<B>Position</B>. Each of the Company and the Bank shall employ and retain Executive as its

the terms and conditions set forth herein. Executive&#146;s duties and responsibilities
shall be those assigned to him hereunder, from time to time, by the Boards of Directors of
the Company and the Bank (collectively, the &#147;<U>Boards</U>&#148; and individually,
the &#147;<U>Company Board</U>&#148; or the &#147;<U>Bank Board,</U>&#148; as applicable),
or either of them, and shall include such responsibilities and duties as are consistent in
type and nature with those normally assigned to chief executive officers of companies of

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>1.2</B>
<B>Limitations</B>. During the Employment Term (as defined below), Executive shall devote
his business time, attention and energies to the business of Hibernia and will not,
without the prior written consent of the Boards, be engaged in any other business
activities. Executive agrees that he will, to the best of his ability, experience and
talents, perform the duties of his position, which is a full-time position. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive
shall not be prevented from (a) engaging in any civic or charitable activity for which
Executive receives no compensation or other pecuniary advantage or (b) purchasing
securities in any corporation whose securities are regularly traded, provided that such
purchases will not result in Executive owning beneficially at any time 5% or more of the
equity securities of any corporation engaged in a business competitive with that of the
Company, the Bank or any Affiliate. For purposes of this Agreement,
<U>&#147;Affiliate</U>&#148; shall mean any entity of which the Company or the Bank owns

classes of stock or other equity interests and &#147;<U>Affiliates</U>&#148; shall mean
such entities collectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the Employment Term, whether or not a notice of non-renewal has been given as provided for
in Section 1.3, Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Boards,
seek, solicit or negotiate offers of employment from any person or entity other than
Hibernia; provided that, if a notice of non-renewal has been given by the Company or the
Bank as provided for in Section 1.3, during the last six months of the Employment Term,
Executive may seek, solicit or negotiate other offers of employment so long as such
activities do not interfere with the performance of Executive&#146;s duties hereunder. </FONT></P>

<B>Term</B>. Executive&#146;s employment under this Agreement shall commence December 1,
2002 (the &#147;<U>Effective Date</U>&#148;), and shall terminate, unless earlier
terminated in accordance with the terms hereof, on December 31, 2005; <U>however,</U> on
December 31, 2003 (and on December 31 of each succeeding year), the term of such
employment will be automatically extended for one additional year unless either the
Company or the Bank has given to Executive, or Executive has given to the Company and the
Bank, written notice of non-renewal, which notice must be delivered to such party at least
90 days prior to the date of such automatic extension, or unless Executive&#146;s
employment under this Agreement has otherwise been terminated in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. The period commencing as of the Effective Date and ending as of
December 31, 2005, or December 31 of any succeeding year through which this Agreement has

refrain from changing, amending or discontinuing any benefit plan or program (including,
without limitation, the CEO Bonus Plan, the management incentive plan, other bonus or

               Continue to provide medical benefits (for the period described below) to
               Executive and/or his dependents if such person(s) elect to continue group
               medical coverage, within the meaning of Code Section 4980B(f)(2), with respect
               to a group health plan sponsored by Hibernia (other than a health flexible
               spending account under Code Sections 125 and 105(h)), at the same type and level
               of group health plan coverage received by Executive and his electing dependents
               immediately prior to the Date of Termination. Such benefits shall be provided at
               the same premium cost to Executive as in effect immediately prior to the Date of
               Termination (provided, however, that in the event the premium cost and/or level
               of coverage shall change for employees of Hibernia generally, the cost and/or
               coverage level, likewise, shall change for Executive in a corresponding manner).

               following the Date of Termination) or (ii) the date Executive or his dependents
               obtain coverage under a reasonably comparable group health plan with no
               applicable pre-existing condition limitation. An election to continue group
               medical coverage hereunder shall offset any period of such coverage available to
               Executive and/or his dependents under Code Section 4980B. </FONT></P></TD>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Except as expressly provided in
Section 3.4 hereof, Executive shall also be entitled to receive such compensation or
benefits as may be provided under the terms of a separate plan or agreement maintained by
Hibernia to the extent such compensation or benefits are not duplicative of the
compensation or benefits described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive&#146;s
rights under this Section 3 shall be in lieu of any benefits that may otherwise be payable
to or on behalf of Executive pursuant to the terms of any severance pay arrangement of
Hibernia or any other similar arrangement of Hibernia providing benefits upon involuntary
termination of employment. Executive shall be entitled to receive the payments and
benefits provided in this section only once, regardless of the position from which he is
removed. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the forfeiture or reduction of any
compensation or benefit in accordance with the terms of any separate plan, policy or
program maintained by Hibernia. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to modify the
rights of Executive under the terms of any separate benefit plans maintained by Hibernia
in which Executive participates; provided, however, that none of the payments provided for
herein shall be considered in calculating any awards or accruals under any such benefit
plans. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.2</B>
<B>Termination for Death</B>. If Executive dies during the Employment Term, this Agreement
and Executive&#146;s employment hereunder shall immediately terminate and Hibernia&#146;s
obligations hereunder (other than the obligation to make payments and provide benefits as
specified in this Section 3.2) shall automatically cease. In such event, Hibernia shall
pay and provide to Executive (or his estate) the amounts described in Sections 3.1a and
3.1c hereof and the benefit provided in Section 3.1d hereof. The Date of Termination for
purposes of this Section 3.2 shall be the date of Executive&#146;s death. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.3
</B> <B>Termination for Disability</B>. If Executive becomes disabled (as defined in this
section below) during the Employment Term, this Agreement and Executive&#146;s employment
hereunder shall immediately terminate and Hibernia&#146;s obligations hereunder (other
than the obligation to make payments and provide benefits as specified in this Section
3.3) shall automatically cease. In such event, Hibernia shall pay and provide to Executive
the amounts described in Sections 3.1a and 3.1c hereof and the benefit provided in Section
3.1d hereof. Further, Hibernia shall purchase additional disability pay benefits insurance
to supplement Executive&#146;s disability pay by $10,000 per month if and only to the
extent that Executive is eligible and approved for such insurance and such insurance can
be obtained and maintained at a cost of not more than $15,000 per year; however, to the
extent the premium exceeds $15,000 per year, Executive shall have the option of continuing
this supplemental disability benefit by paying the premium amount in excess of $15,000 per
year. This Section 3.3 is not intended to reduce any other benefit that may be payable to
Executive on account of his disability. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of this Section 3.3, Executive shall be deemed &#147;disabled&#148; if he is
actually receiving benefits or is eligible to receive benefits under Hibernia&#146;s
separate long-term disability plan, and the Date of Termination shall be the later of the
date upon which Executive is determined to be disabled under that plan or the date upon
which Executive receives written notice from the Company Board of the termination of his
employment hereunder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.4</B>
<B>Company&#146;s Termination for Cause</B>. Executive&#146;s employment under this
Agreement may be terminated by Hibernia during the Employment Term on account of Cause. In
such event, this Agreement shall automatically terminate and the obligations of Hibernia
hereunder (other than the obligation to make the payment specified in this Section 3.4)
shall automatically cease. In such event, Hibernia shall pay to Executive the Accrued
Obligations. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any other plan, policy or
agreement evidencing any other compensation arrangement or benefit payable to Executive,
no additional amount shall be paid to Executive, except as may be required by law. </FONT></P>

(excluding any instance where the Company, the Bank or any Affiliate and Executive are on
opposite sides of the litigation or are in any other opposing position or are in possible
adverse positions), Executive shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of reasonable

<B>Assignment</B>. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon
Hibernia, its Affiliates, successors and assigns, including, without limitation, any
person, partnership, company, corporation or other entity that may acquire substantially
all of Hibernia&#146;s assets or business or with or into which Hibernia may be
liquidated, consolidated, merged or otherwise combined. Hibernia will require any
successor to assume and agree to perform this Agreement. As used in this Agreement,
<U>&#147;Hibernia</U>,&#148; &#147;<U>Company</U>&#148; and &#147;<U>Bank</U>&#148; shall
mean Hibernia, the Company and the Bank as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its

prior written consent of Hibernia, shall not be assignable by Executive, other than
Executive&#146;s rights to compensation and benefits, which may only be assigned by will
or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and
be binding upon Executive, his heirs, estate, legatees and legal representatives. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>6.9</B>
<B>Severability</B>. Each provision of this Agreement is intended to be severable. In the
event that any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any
reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the same shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, but this Agreement
shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions was not
contained herein. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>6.10</B>

<B>Waiver</B>. The failure of either party to insist in any one or more instances upon
performance of any terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement will not be construed
as a waiver of future performance of any such term, covenant, or condition and the
obligations of either party with respect to such term, covenant or condition will continue
in full force and effect. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>6.12
</B> <B>Regulatory Matters</B>. Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, in the event the FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the
Federal Reserve Board or other regulatory authority commences an appropriate proceeding,
action or order challenging the payment to Executive of any benefit hereunder, or in the
event any such payment hereunder is otherwise prohibited by law, such payment shall be
suspended until such time as the challenge is fully and finally resolved and the
applicable regulatory authority does not object to the payments or until such payments are
otherwise permitted by law. In the event that any challenge to the payments required by
this Agreement is initiated by a regulatory authority or other person, Hibernia shall
notify Executive of such challenge and shall promptly proceed in good faith to attempt to
resolve such challenge in a manner that enables Hibernia to make to Executive all payments
required hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in the event that any payment
provided for herein is prohibited by a regulatory authority or by law, Hibernia shall have
no obligation to make such payment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>6.13</B>
<B>Dispute Resolution</B>. Except as otherwise provided by Section 5.8, any controversy or
claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (or the breach thereof) shall be
settled by final and binding arbitration in New Orleans, Louisiana by one mutually
agreed-upon arbitrator selected in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration
Association (the &#147;<U>Association</U>&#148;) then in effect. Subject to the following
provisions, the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the
Association then in effect. Any award entered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding
and judgment may be entered thereon by any party hereto in accordance with applicable law
in any court of competent jurisdiction. This arbitration provision shall be specifically
enforceable. Hibernia shall be responsible for all administrative fees of the Association,
the compensation of the arbitrator and Executive&#146;s reasonable attorney&#146;s fees
and expenses should Executive substantially prevail; otherwise, each party shall be
responsible for its own attorney&#146;s fees and expenses relating to the conduct of the
arbitration. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>6.14
Source of Payments</B>. Hibernia shall not be required to establish a special or separate
fund or other segregation of assets to assure any payments hereunder. Nothing contained in
this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be
construed to create a trust of any kind. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>6.15</B>
<B>No Duplication of Payment</B>. The obligation of the Company or the Bank to make any
payment or provide any benefit to the Executive hereunder shall be deemed satisfied to the
extent that such payment is made or such benefit is provided by any Affiliate, and no
payment or benefit shall be required to be paid or provided more than once. </FONT></P>
