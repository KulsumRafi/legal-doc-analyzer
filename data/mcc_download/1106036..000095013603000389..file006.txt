concurrently, and are not exclusive of any other right or remedy provided at law
or in equity. No failure to exercise or delay by Agent in exercising any right
or remedy hereunder or under the Loan Documents shall impair or prohibit the
exercise of any such rights or remedies in the future or be deemed to constitute
a waiver or limitation of any such right or remedy or acquiescence therein.
Every right and remedy granted to Agent hereunder or by law may be exercised by
such party at any time and from time to time, and as often as such party may
deem it expedient. Any and all of Agent's rights with respect to the lien and

release or substitution of Collateral at any time, or of any rights or interests
therein or (c) any delay, extension of time, renewal, compromise or other
indulgence granted by such party in the event of any default, with respect to
the Collateral or otherwise hereunder. No delay or extension of time by such
party in exercising any power of sale, option or other right or remedy
hereunder, and no notice or demand which may be given to or made upon any
Account Party by such party, shall constitute a waiver thereof, or limit, impair
or prejudice such party's right, without notice or demand, to take any action
against any Account Party or to exercise any other power of sale, option or any
other right or remedy.

     6.4 Expenses. Each Account Party shall pay to Agent and/or such party's
counsel on demand, from time to time, all costs and expenses (including, but not
limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, and transfer,
