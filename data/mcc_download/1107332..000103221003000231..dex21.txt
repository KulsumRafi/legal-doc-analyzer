                                 THE COMBINATION

         1.01. Effective Time of the Merger. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, a certificate of merger giving effect to the agreement of the parties
described in this Article I (the "Certificate of Merger"), shall be duly
executed and acknowledged by the Continuing Corporation (as defined in Section
1.03), and thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, for filing, as provided in the Delaware Law, as soon as practicable on
or after the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.02). The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such time thereafter as is provided in the
Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

         1.02. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 9:00 a.m., Pacific time, on a date to be specified by Dendreon and
Corvas (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second business

benefit of such conditions, of all the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), at the
offices of Stoel Rives LLP, Seattle, Washington, unless another date or place is
agreed to in writing by Dendreon and Corvas. All actions taken at the Closing
shall be deemed to have been taken simultaneously at the time the last of any
such actions is taken or completed.

         1.03. Effects of the Merger.

         (a) At the Effective Time (i) the separate existence of Sub shall cease
and Sub shall be merged with and into Corvas, with Corvas as the surviving
corporation in the Merger (Sub and Corvas are sometimes referred to below as the
"Constituent Corporations" and Corvas is sometimes referred to below as the
"Continuing Corporation"), (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation of Corvas shall
be amended so that Section IV of such Certificate of Incorporation reads in its
entirety as follows: "The total number of shares of all classes of stock which
the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,000, all of which shall
consist of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share," and as so amended, such
Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Continuing Corporation, and (iii) the Bylaws of Corvas as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Continuing Corporation.

                                        2

<PAGE>

         (b) At and after the Effective Time, the Continuing Corporation shall
possess all the rights, privileges, powers, and franchises of a public as well
as of a private nature, and be subject to all the restrictions, disabilities,
and duties of each of the Constituent Corporations; and all and singular rights,
privileges, powers, and franchises of each of the Constituent Corporations, and
all property, real, personal, and mixed, and all debts due to either of the
Constituent Corporations on whatever account, as well as for stock subscriptions
and all other things in action or belonging to each of the Constituent
Corporations, shall be vested in the Continuing Corporation, and all property,
rights, privileges, powers, and franchises, and all and every other interest
shall be thereafter as effectually the property of the Continuing Corporation as
they were of the Constituent Corporations, and the title to any real estate
vested by deed or otherwise, in either of the Constituent Corporations, shall
not revert or be in any way impaired; but all rights of creditors and all liens
upon any property of either of the Constituent Corporations shall be preserved
unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities, and duties of the Constituent
Corporations shall thereafter attach to the Continuing Corporation, and may be
enforced against it to the same extent as if such debts and liabilities had been
incurred by it.

         1.04. The LLC Merger. Immediately following the Effective Time of the
Merger, Dendreon shall cause LLC to file with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware a properly executed certificate of merger for the LLC Merger
(the "LLC Certificate of Merger") conforming to the requirements of the Delaware
Law. The LLC Merger shall become effective at the time the LLC Certificate of
Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

         1.05. Effects of the LLC Merger.

         (a) At the time at which the LLC Merger is filed with the Secretary of
State of Delaware, as described in Section 1.04 (the "LLC Effective Time"), (i)
the separate existence of Corvas shall cease and Corvas shall be merged with and
into LLC, with LLC as the surviving entity in the LLC Merger (LLC and Corvas are
sometimes referred to below as the "LLC Constituent Entities" and LLC is
sometimes referred to below as the "Continuing LLC"), and (ii) the Certificate
of Formation and the Operating Agreement of LLC as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be unchanged by the LLC Merger.

         (b) At and after the LLC Effective Time, the Continuing LLC shall
possess all the rights, privileges, powers, and franchises of a public as well
as of a private nature, and be subject to all the restrictions, disabilities,
and duties of each of the LLC Constituent Entities; and all and singular rights,
privileges, powers, and franchises of each of the LLC Constituent Entities, and
all property, real, personal, and mixed, and all debts due to either of the LLC
Constituent Entities on whatever account, and all other things in action or
belonging to each of the LLC Constituent Entities, shall be vested in the
Continuing LLC, and all property, rights, privileges, powers, and franchises,
and all and every other interest shall be thereafter as effectually the property
of the Continuing LLC as they were of the LLC Constituent Entities, and the
title to any real estate vested by deed or otherwise, in either of the LLC
Constituent Entities, shall not revert or be in any way impaired; but all rights
of creditors and all liens upon any property of either of the LLC Constituent
Entities shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities, and duties
of the LLC Constituent Entities shall thereafter attach to the Continuing LLC,
and

                                        3

<PAGE>

may be enforced against it to the same extent as if such debts and liabilities
had been incurred by it.

                                   ARTICLE II

                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

         2.01. Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Corvas Common Stock or capital stock of Sub:

         (a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of the
capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Continuing Corporation.

         (b) Cancellation of Corvas Common Stock. All shares of Corvas Common
Stock (i) that are held by Corvas as treasury stock or otherwise or (ii) that
are held by Dendreon or Sub ((i) and (ii), collectively, "Excluded Shares")
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no stock of Dendreon
or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

         (c) Exchange Ratio for Corvas Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.02,
each issued and outstanding share of Corvas Common Stock, other than Excluded
Shares, together with all Rights under the Corvas Rights Agreement (as such
terms are defined in Section 3.02(a)) attached to such share shall be converted
into the right to receive 0.45 shares (the "Conversion Number") of Dendreon
Common Stock, together with the associated Rights under the Dendreon Rights
Agreement. The Conversion Number shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, exchange, subdivision,
combination of, or other similar change (including the exercise of any Rights
under the Corvas Rights Agreement or the Dendreon Rights Agreement (as defined
in Section 4.02(a)) in Dendreon Common Stock or Corvas Common Stock following
the date of this Agreement. All shares of Dendreon Common Stock into which the
shares of Corvas Common Stock and attached Rights are converted shall be fully
paid and nonassessable and will have Rights attached thereto in accordance with
the Dendreon Rights Agreement. All shares of Corvas Common Stock, when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and holders of certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Corvas Common
Stock (the "Certificates") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the shares of Dendreon Common Stock and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Dendreon Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon the surrender of the Certificates in accordance with
Section 2.02, without interest.

         (d) Fractional Shares. No scrip or fractional shares of Dendreon Common
Stock shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Dendreon Common
Stock to which a holder of Corvas Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time would otherwise be entitled at the Effective Time shall be
aggregated. If a fractional share results from such aggregation, such
shareholder shall be entitled after the later of (i) the Effective Time or (ii)
the surrender of such shareholder's Certificate or Certificates, to receive from
Dendreon an amount in cash in lieu of such fractional share, based on the
closing sale prices of Dendreon Common Stock on the

                                        4

<PAGE>

Nasdaq National Market on the Closing Date. Dendreon will make available to the
"Exchange Agent" (as defined in Section 2.02) the cash necessary for the purpose
of paying for fractional shares.

         (e) Corvas Stock Options. At the Effective Time, all then outstanding
options to purchase Corvas Common Stock under Corvas' employee stock incentive
plans listed in Schedule 3.02 of the Corvas Disclosure Schedule (collectively,
the "Corvas Option Plans") and all outstanding other options to purchase Corvas
Common Stock listed in Schedule 3.02 of the Corvas Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the "Corvas Non-Plan Options") will be assumed by Dendreon in
accordance with Section 6.13.

         2.02. Conversion of Securities in LLC Merger. By virtue of the LLC
Merger and without any further action on the part of the Continuing Corporation,
LLC or Continuing LLC, (i) each limited liability company interest of LLC then
outstanding shall remain outstanding and each certificate therefor shall
continue to evidence one limited liability company interest of the Surviving LLC
and (ii) each share of common stock of the Continuing Corporation then
outstanding shall be converted into limited liability company interest of the
Surviving LLC.

         2.03. Exchange of Certificates.

         (a) Dendreon shall authorize Mellon Investor Services LLC, or such
other firm as is reasonably acceptable to Corvas, to serve as exchange agent
hereunder (the "Exchange Agent"). Promptly after the Effective Time, Dendreon
shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited in trust with the Exchange Agent
certificates representing the number of whole shares of Dendreon Common Stock to
which the holders of Corvas Common Stock are entitled pursuant to this Article
II, together with cash sufficient to pay for fractional shares then known to
Dendreon (such cash amounts and certificates being hereinafter referred to as
the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions received from Dendreon, deliver the number of shares of Dendreon
Common Stock and pay the amounts of cash provided for in Section 2.01 out of the
Exchange Fund. Additional amounts of cash, if any, needed from time to time by
the Exchange Agent to make payments for fractional shares shall be provided by
Dendreon and shall become part of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement, or as
otherwise agreed to by Dendreon, Sub, and Corvas prior to the Effective Time.

         (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent
shall mail and otherwise make available to each record holder who, as of the
Effective Time, was a holder of a Certificate a form of letter of transmittal
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificate for
payment therefor and conversion thereof. Delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificate to the Exchange Agent and the form of letter of transmittal shall so
reflect. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with
such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) one or more certificates as
requested by the holder (properly issued, executed, and countersigned, as
appropriate) representing that number of whole shares of Dendreon Common Stock
to which such holder of Corvas Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant
to the provisions of Section 2.01, and (ii) as to any fractional share, a check
representing the cash consideration to

                                        5

<PAGE>

which such holder shall have become entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(d) and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid
or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the Certificate. Dendreon shall
pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Dendreon Common Stock provided that such
certificate is issued in the name of the person in whose name the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered; provided, however, that Dendreon
shall not pay any transfer or other tax if the obligation to pay such tax under
applicable law is solely that of the stockholder or if payment of any such tax
by Dendreon otherwise would cause the Combination to fail to qualify as a
reorganization under the Code. If any portion of the consideration to be
received pursuant to this Article II upon exchange of a Certificate (whether the
consideration to be received is a certificate representing shares of Dendreon
Common Stock or a check representing cash for a fractional share) is to be
issued or paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such
issuance and payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting
such exchange shall pay in advance any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Dendreon Common
Stock or a check representing cash for a fractional share to such other person,
or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or that no such tax is applicable. From the Effective Time until surrender
in accordance with this Section 2.03, each Certificate (other than Certificates
representing treasury shares of Corvas) shall be deemed, for all corporate
purposes other than the payment of dividends or other distributions, to evidence
the ownership of the number of whole shares of Dendreon Common Stock into which
such shares of Corvas Common Stock shall have been so converted. No dividends
that are otherwise payable on Dendreon Common Stock will be paid to persons
entitled to receive Dendreon Common Stock until such persons surrender their
Certificates. After such surrender, there shall be paid to the person in whose
name the Dendreon Common Stock shall be issued any dividends on such Dendreon
Common Stock that shall have a record date on or after the Effective Time and
prior to such surrender. If the payment date for any such dividend is after the
date of such surrender, such payment shall be made on such payment date. In no
event shall the persons entitled to receive such dividends be entitled to
receive interest on such dividends. All payments in respect of shares of Corvas
Common Stock that are made in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed
to have been made in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
securities.

         (c) In case of any lost, mislaid, stolen, or destroyed Certificate, the
holder thereof may be required, as a condition precedent to the delivery to such
holder of the consideration described in Section 2.01 and in accordance with
Section 167 of the Delaware Law, to deliver to Dendreon a bond in such
reasonable sum as Dendreon may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Exchange Agent, Dendreon, or the Continuing Corporation with
respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, mislaid, stolen, or
destroyed.

         (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Continuing Corporation of the shares of Corvas Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Continuing Corporation for
transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration described
in Section 2.01. After the Effective Time, the shares of Corvas Common Stock
shall be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market.

                                        6

<PAGE>

         (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Corvas for six months after the Effective Time shall be returned
to Dendreon, upon demand, and any holder of Corvas Common Stock who has not
theretofore complied with Section 2.03(b) shall thereafter look only to Dendreon
for issuance of the number of shares of Dendreon Common Stock and other
consideration to which such holder has become entitled pursuant to Section 2.01,
provided, however, that neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be
liable to a holder of shares of Corvas Common Stock for any amount required to
be paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat, or similar law.

conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Corvas, (ii) result in any violation
or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a
default (or give rise to right of termination, cancellation, or acceleration of
any obligation or loss of any benefit) under any of the terms, conditions, or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, or lease or any material
contract, or other material agreement, instrument, or obligation to which Corvas

the Merger and consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

         3.04. SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

         (a) Corvas has filed all forms, reports, and documents required to be
filed by Corvas with the SEC since January 1, 1999 (including all exhibits,
notes, and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein)
(collectively, the "Corvas SEC Reports"). The Corvas SEC Reports (i) at the time
filed, with respect to all of the Corvas SEC Reports other than registration
statements filed under the Securities Act, or at the time of their respective
effective dates, with respect to registration statements filed under the
Securities Act, complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
(ii) did not at the time filed or at the time of their respective effective
dates, as the case may be (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated in such Corvas SEC Reports or necessary in order to make the statements
in such Corvas SEC Reports, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

                                        9

<PAGE>

         (b) Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any
related notes) contained in the Corvas SEC Reports at the time filed or at the
time of their respective effective dates, as the case may be, complied as to
form in all material respects with the applicable published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to such
financial statements or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly presented the financial position of Corvas at
the respective dates and the results of its operations and cash flows for the
periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements were
or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments. The balance sheet
of Corvas as of September 30, 2002 included in Corvas' Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q filed with the SEC with respect to the quarter then ended is referred to
herein as the "Corvas Balance Sheet."

         (c) Corvas has in place the "disclosure controls and procedures" (as

for the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer
of Corvas to engage in the review and evaluation process mandated by the
Exchange Act. Corvas' "disclosure controls and procedures" are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by Corvas in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to Corvas' management as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and
Accounting Officer of Corvas required under the Exchange Act with respect to
such reports.

         3.05. No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.05
of the Corvas Disclosure Schedule or as otherwise disclosed in the Corvas SEC
Reports, Corvas does not have any liabilities, either accrued or contingent
(whether or not required to be reflected in financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles), and whether due or to become
due, which individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Corvas, other than (i) liabilities reflected
in the Corvas Balance Sheet, (ii) obligations to perform under contracts either
disclosed in the Corvas SEC Reports or in the Corvas Disclosure Schedule, and
(iii) normal or recurring liabilities incurred since the date of the Corvas
Balance Sheet, in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices.

         3.06. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since the date of the
Corvas Balance Sheet, Corvas has conducted its business only in the ordinary
course and in a manner consistent with past practice and, since such date, there
has not been (i) any Material Adverse Effect on Corvas, (ii) any damage,
destruction, or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) with respect to any
property of Corvas having a Material Adverse Effect on Corvas, (iii) any
material change by Corvas in its accounting methods, principles, or practices to
which Dendreon has not previously consented in writing, (iv) any revaluation by
Corvas or any of its assets having a Material Adverse Effect on Corvas, or (v)
except as disclosed in Schedule 3.06 of the Corvas Disclosure Schedule, any
other action or event that would have required the consent of Dendreon pursuant
to Section 5.01 of this Agreement had such action or event occurred after the
date of this Agreement.

and withholding returns and reports (collectively, "Tax Returns"), of or
relating to any foreign, Federal, state, local or other income, premium,
property, sales, excise and other taxes of any nature whatsoever, including any
interest, penalties and additions to tax in respect thereof ("Tax" or "Taxes")
heretofore required to be filed by Corvas have been duly filed on a timely
basis. All such Tax Returns were complete and accurate in all material respects.

asserted or, to the knowledge of Corvas, proposed with respect to any Tax Return
of or with respect to Corvas and there are no liens for Taxes upon the assets or
properties of Corvas, except liens for Taxes not yet delinquent.

         (c) There are not in force any waivers of agreements, arrangements, or
understandings by or with respect to Corvas of or for an extension of time for
the assessment or payment of any Taxes. Corvas has not received a written ruling
of a taxing authority relating to Taxes or entered into a written and legally
binding agreement with a taxing authority relating to Taxes that would have a
continuing effect after the Closing Date. Corvas is not required to include in
income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a
voluntary change in accounting method initiated by Corvas, and to the knowledge
of Corvas the IRS has not proposed any such adjustment or change in accounting
method.

         (d) To the knowledge of Corvas, Corvas has withheld and paid all Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing

true and complete list of all real property owned by Corvas and real property
leased pursuant to leases ("Leases") by Corvas as of the date hereof, and the
name of the lessor, the date of the Lease and each amendment to the Lease, and
the aggregate annual rental or other fees payable under any such Lease. All such
Leases are valid and binding obligations of Corvas and, to Corvas' knowledge, of
each other party thereto, in accordance with their respective terms, as those
terms are reflected in documents provided to Dendreon, subject to (i) applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally and (ii) rules of law governing
specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies, and Corvas
is not in material default under any such Lease.

         (b) Tangible Personal Property. All material items of tangible personal
property of Corvas are in good operating condition and repair (ordinary wear and
tear excepted), are performing satisfactorily, and are available for use in the
conduct of Corvas' business. Corvas

                                       11

has and will have good and marketable title to all of material personal property
owned by it, free and clear of all security interests, mortgages, liens,
pledges, charges, valid claims or encumbrances of any kind or character other
than liens (i) for taxes not yet due and payable; or (ii) incurred in the
ordinary course of Corvas' business that do not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Corvas.

         3.09. Intellectual Property.

         (a) Ownership of Intellectual Property Assets. Corvas owns or has valid
rights or licenses to use all of the Corvas Intellectual Property Assets. All
Corvas Intellectual Property Assets are free and clear of all mortgages,
pledges, charges, liens, equities, security interests or other encumbrances, and
Corvas has the right to use without payment to a third party all of such Corvas
Intellectual Property Assets. No claim is pending against Corvas or, to Corvas'
knowledge, threatened against Corvas or its officers, employees or consultants
to the effect that Corvas' right, title and interest in and to any of the Corvas
Intellectual Property Assets is invalid or unenforceable by Corvas. Corvas is
not aware of any material information that would adversely affect the validity
or enforceability of any of the Patents, Marks, Trade Secrets or Copyrights
which constitute Corvas Intellectual Property Assets. All former and current
employees, consultants and contractors of Corvas who were involved in, or who
contributed to, the creation or development of any of the Corvas Intellectual
Property Assets have executed written instruments with Corvas that assign to
Corvas all of such Person's rights to any inventions, improvements, discoveries,
writings or information constituting Corvas Intellectual Property Assets. To the
knowledge of Corvas, no employee of Corvas has entered into any agreement that
restricts or limits in any way the scope or type of work in which the employee
may be engaged or requires the employee to transfer, assign or disclose
information concerning his work to anyone other than Corvas. A complete list of
Corvas Products is provided in Section 3.09(a) of the Corvas Disclosure
Schedule.

         (b) Patents. Schedule 3.09(b) of the Corvas Disclosure Schedule sets

use.) All of such issued Patents are valid and enforceable. In each case where
such an issued Patent is held by Corvas by assignment, the assignment has been
duly recorded with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and all other
jurisdictions of registration. No such issued Patent or patent application has
been or is now involved in any interference, reissue, reexamination or
opposition proceeding. To Corvas' knowledge, there is no potentially interfering
patent or patent application of any third party that has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Corvas. All Corvas Products
made, used or sold under the Patents have been marked with the proper patent
notice.

         (c) Trademarks. Schedule 3.09(c) of the Corvas Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete and accurate list of all Marks constituting Corvas Intellectual
Property Assets. All such Marks that have been registered with the U. S. Patent
and Trademark Office or any other jurisdiction are currently in compliance with
formal governmental legal requirements (including, without limitation, the
timely post-registration filing of affidavits of use and incontestability and
renewal applications), and are, to Corvas' knowledge, valid and enforceable in
the jurisdictions

                                       12

<PAGE>

in which they are registered. In each case where such a Mark is held by Corvas
by assignment, the assignment has been duly recorded with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office and all other jurisdictions of registration. No such Mark has
been or is now involved in any opposition, invalidation or cancellation
proceeding and, to Corvas' knowledge, no such action is threatened against
Corvas with respect to any of such Marks. All Corvas Products and materials
containing a Mark bear the proper notice where required by law.

         (d) Copyrights. Corvas does not have any Copyrights registered with the
U. S. Copyright Office.

         (e) Trade Secrets. Corvas has taken all reasonable security measures
(including, without limitation, entering into appropriate confidentiality and
nondisclosure agreements with all officers, directors, employees and consultants
of Corvas and any other Persons with access to the Trade Secrets constituting
Corvas Intellectual Property Assets) to protect the secrecy, confidentiality and
value of the Trade Secrets constituting Corvas Intellectual Property Assets. To
the knowledge of Corvas, there has not been any breach by any party to any such
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement. The Trade Secrets constituting
Corvas Intellectual Property Assets have not been disclosed by Corvas to any
Person other than employees or contractors of Corvas who had a need to know and
use such Trade Secrets in the course of their employment or contract
performance, or to other persons under confidentiality and non-disclosure
agreements. To the knowledge of Corvas, Corvas has the right to use, free and
clear of claims of third parties, all Trade Secrets constituting Corvas
Intellectual Property Assets. To the knowledge of Corvas, no third party has
asserted that the use by Corvas of any Trade Secret constituting Corvas
Intellectual Property Assets violates the rights of such third party.

         (f) Exclusivity of Rights. Corvas has the exclusive right to use,
license, distribute, transfer and bring infringement actions with respect to the
Corvas Intellectual Property Assets owned or exclusively licensed by Corvas.
Corvas (i) has not licensed or granted to anyone rights of any nature to use any
of the Corvas Intellectual Property Assets and (ii) is not obligated to and does
not pay royalties or other fees to anyone for Corvas' ownership, use, license or
transfer of any of the Corvas Intellectual Property Assets.

         (g) Licenses Received. All material licenses or other material
agreements under which Corvas is granted rights by others in Corvas Intellectual
Property Assets are listed in Schedule 3.09(g) of the Corvas Disclosure
Schedule. For the purpose of the foregoing sentence, licenses and agreements for
commercial off-the-shelf computer software having a cost of less than $5,000 per

3.09(g) of the Corvas Disclosure Schedule: (i) all licenses or other agreements
under which Corvas is granted rights by others in Corvas Intellectual Property
Assets are in full force and effect, (ii) to the knowledge of Corvas, there is
no material default under any such license or other agreement by any party
thereto, and (iii) all of the rights of Corvas under such licenses and other
agreements are assignable without the consent of the licensor except, with
respect to this clause (iii), as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Corvas. True and complete copies of all such licenses
or other agreements, and any amendments thereto, have been provided to Dendreon,
and to the knowledge of Corvas, the licensors under the

                                       13

licenses and other agreements under which Corvas is granted rights have all
requisite power and authority to grant the rights purported to be conferred
thereby.

         (h) Licenses Granted. All licenses or other agreements under which
Corvas has granted rights to others in Corvas Intellectual Property Assets are
listed in Schedule 3.09(h) of the Corvas Disclosure Schedule. Except as set
forth thereon, all such licenses or other agreements are in full force and

by any party thereto. True and complete copies of all such licenses or other
agreements, and any amendments thereto, have been provided to Dendreon.

         (i) Sufficiency. The Corvas Intellectual Property Assets constitute all
of the Intellectual Property Assets used in designing, creating and developing
the Corvas Products and are all of the Intellectual Property Assets necessary
for the operation of Corvas' business as currently conducted.

         (j) Infringement. None of the Corvas Products developed or under
development, manufactured or sold by Corvas, nor any process or know-how used by
Corvas in connection therewith, infringes, conflicts with or misappropriates any
Copyright or Trade Secret of any Person, or to Corvas' knowledge, infringes any
Patent, Mark, or other proprietary right of any Person.

         (k) Corvas Nondisclosure Contracts. To the knowledge of Corvas, each of
the Corvas Nondisclosure Contracts is a valid and binding obligation of the
other party thereto enforceable in accordance with its terms, and, to Corvas'
knowledge, no such third party is in material breach of any such Corvas
Nondisclosure Contract. A complete list of all Corvas Nondisclosure Contracts is
provided in Section 3.09(k) of the Corvas Disclosure Schedule

         3.10. Agreements, Contracts, and Commitments. Schedule 3.10 of the
Corvas Disclosure Schedule lists (i) all material contracts of Corvas (within
the meaning of Item 601(10) of Regulation S-K) that have not been filed as
exhibits to the Corvas SEC Reports; and (ii) all amendments to Corvas Material
Contracts, whether or not such contracts were filed as exhibits to the Corvas
SEC Reports, unless such amendments were also filed as exhibits to the Corvas
SEC Reports. The contracts listed on Schedule 3.10 of the Corvas Disclosure
Schedule together with the contracts filed as exhibits to the Corvas SEC Reports
are referred to collectively as the "Corvas Material Contracts". All Corvas
Material Contracts, as amended pursuant to amendments filed as exhibits to the
Corvas SEC Reports or listed on Schedule 3.10 of the Corvas Disclosure Schedule,
have either expired or remain in full force and effect, in each case in
accordance with their terms as stated in such documents. Corvas has not
breached, or received in writing any claim or threat that it has breached, any
of the terms and conditions of any Corvas Material Contracts in such a manner as
would permit any other party to cancel or terminate the same or would permit any
other party to seek material damages from Corvas under any Corvas Material
Contract and Corvas is not aware of the existence of a material breach of a
Corvas Material Contract by any other party thereto. Corvas is not engaged, and
has not agreed to engage, in any discussions related to the material amendment
of any Corvas Material contract.

         3.11. Litigation. Except as described in the Corvas SEC Reports, there

properties, at law or in equity, before or by any Federal, state, municipal or
other governmental agency or authority, foreign or domestic, or before any

present, in, on, or under any premises or other property that Corvas has at any
time owned, operated, occupied or leased, except for immaterial quantities
stored or used by Corvas in the ordinary course of its business and in
accordance with all applicable Environmental Laws. "Hazardous Substance" means
any pollutant, contaminant, flammable or explosive material, hazardous substance

standards on conduct concerning any emissions, discharges, releases or
threatened releases of pollutants, contaminants, hazardous or toxic materials,
hazardous substances or wastes into ambient air, surface water, groundwater or
land, or otherwise relating to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use,
treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of pollutants, contaminants
or hazardous or toxic materials or wastes; (ii) to the knowledge of Corvas,
Corvas is now and at all times has been in material compliance with all terms
and conditions of those required permits, licenses and authorizations and is
also in material compliance with all other conditions, standards, requirements
and obligations contained in all applicable Environmental Laws; (iii) Corvas is
not aware of, nor to the knowledge of Corvas, has Corvas received notice of, any
event, condition, circumstance, activity, practice, incident, action or plan
that may materially interfere with or prevent Corvas' continued compliance with
or that may give rise to any liability of Corvas under any Environmental Law, or
any release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance, pollutant or
contaminant from or onto any property owned, operated or leased by Corvas.

         (c) Hazardous Waste Activities. To the knowledge of Corvas, no property
that Corvas has ever owned, operated, occupied or leased has ever been used in
connection with the business of manufacturing, storing or transporting Hazardous
Wastes, and no RCRA Hazardous Wastes

                                       15

have been treated, stored or disposed of there, except for immaterial quantities
stored or used by Corvas in the ordinary course of its business. "RCRA Hazardous
Wastes" means a hazardous waste as that term is defined in and pursuant to the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. Section (S) 6901 et seq.

         (d) UST's and AST's. To the knowledge of Corvas, there are not now and

containment facilities of any kind on any premises or other property that Corvas
has ever owned, occupied, operated or leased which contain or ever did contain
any Hazardous Substances.

         (e) Listing. To the knowledge of Corvas, no premises that Corvas has
ever owned, operated, occupied or leased has ever been listed on the National

Liability Information System or any similar federal, state or local list,

inspection true and complete copies of all environmental site assessments,
reports, authorizations, permits, licenses, disclosures and other documents in
its possession, custody or control describing or relating in any way to Corvas,
or any property that Corvas has ever owned, operated, occupied or leased, which
suggest that any Hazardous Substances may be present in, on, or under any such
property in material quantities or that Corvas may have breached any
Environmental Law.

         (g) Environmental Claims, etc. To the knowledge of Corvas, there are
not and there never have been any requests, notices, investigations, claims,
demands, regulatory orders, notices of violation, notices of penalties,
administrative proceedings, hearings, litigation or other legal proceedings
relating in any way to Corvas, or any property that Corvas has ever owned,
operated, occupied or leased, alleging liability under, violation of or
noncompliance with any Environmental Law or any license, permit or other
authorization issued pursuant thereto. To the knowledge of Corvas, no such
matter is threatened or impending, nor does there exist any substantial basis
therefor.

         (h) Compliance with Environmental Laws. Corvas operates, and at all
times has operated, its business in accordance with all applicable Environmental
Laws, and all licenses, permits and other authorizations required pursuant to
any Environmental Law and necessary for the lawful operation of the business of
Corvas are in Corvas' possession and are in full force and effect. To Corvas'

jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") are being manufactured,
labeled, stored, tested, distributed, and marketed in compliance with all
applicable requirements under the Food and Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), the
Public Health Service Act, their applicable implementing regulations, and all

                                       16

<PAGE>

individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Corvas.

         (b) All preclinical trials and clinical trials conducted by or on
behalf of Corvas have been, and are being conducted in material compliance with
the applicable requirements of Good Clinical Practice, Informed Consent, and all
applicable requirements relating to protection of human subjects contained in 21

the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Corvas.

         (c) All manufacturing operations conducted by or for the benefit of
Corvas have been and are being conducted in compliance with the FDA's applicable
current Good Clinical Practices regulations for drug and biological products,

Corvas is in compliance with all applicable registration and listing
requirements set forth in 21 U.S.C. Section 360 and 21 CFR Part 207 and all
similar applicable laws and regulations, except for noncompliances which,

Material Adverse Effect on Corvas.

         (d) Neither Corvas nor any Representative of Corvas, nor to the
knowledge of Corvas, any of its licensees or assignees of Corvas Intellectual
Property has received any notice that the FDA or any other governmental entity
has initiated, or threatened to initiate, any action to suspend any clinical
trial, withdraw approval of any Investigational New Drug sponsored by Corvas or
otherwise restrict the preclinical research on or clinical study of any Corvas
Pharmaceutical Product or any biological or drug product being developed by any
licensee or assignee of Corvas Intellectual Property based on such intellectual
property, or to recall, suspend or otherwise restrict the manufacture of any
Corvas Pharmaceutical Product.

         (e) Neither Corvas nor, to the knowledge of Corvas, any of its
officers, key employees, agents or clinical investigators acting for Corvas, has
committed any act, made any statement or failed to make any statement that would
reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the FDA to invoke its policy with
respect to "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal
Gratuities" set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991) and any
amendments thereto. Additionally, neither Corvas, nor to the knowledge of
Corvas, any officer, key employee or agent of Corvas has been convicted of any
crime or engaged in any conduct that would reasonably be expected to result in
(i) debarment under 21 U.S.C. Section 3351 or any similar state law or (ii)
exclusion under 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a-7 or any similar state law or
regulation.

required for the Corvas Pharmaceutical Products have been conducted in
accordance with experimental protocols, informed consents, procedures and
controls generally used by qualified experts in the animal, preclinical or

governmental entities, that indicate or suggest lack of compliance with the
regulatory requirements of such governmental entities. Corvas has made available
to Dendreon for review all correspondence to or from all governmental entities,
minutes of meetings, written reports of phone conversations, visits or other
contact with governmental entities, notices of inspectional observations,
establishment inspection reports, and all other documents concerning
communications to or from governmental entities, or prepared by or which bear in
any way on Corvas' compliance with regulatory requirements of governmental
entities, or on the likelihood of timing of approval of any Corvas
Pharmaceutical Products.

         (h) There are no proceedings pending with respect to a violation by
Corvas of the FDCA, FDA regulations adopted thereunder, the Controlled Substance
Act or any other legislation or regulation promulgated by any other United
States governmental entity that reasonably might be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Corvas or to result in criminal liability.

         3.14. Employee Benefit Plans.

         (a) There are no "employee pension benefit plans," as defined in
Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), or "multiemployer plans" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA,
maintained or contributed to by Corvas or any trade or business (whether or not
incorporated) (an "ERISA Affiliate") which is aggregated with Corvas pursuant to
Section 414 of the Code for the benefit of its current or former employees.
Corvas has set forth on Schedule 3.14 of the Corvas Disclosure Schedule all
"employee benefit plans", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, and all bonus,
stock option, stock purchase, incentive, deferred compensation, supplemental
retirement, welfare, severance, fringe benefit (including, but not limited to,
benefits relating to Company automobiles, clubs, vacation, child care,
parenting, sabbatical, sick leave, medical, dental, hospitalization, life
insurance and other types of insurance), and other similar employee benefit
plans, arrangements, and employment and consulting agreements, whether or not
such plans, arrangements, or agreements are "employee benefit plans", written or
otherwise, for the benefit of or relating to, any current or former employee of
Corvas or any ERISA Affiliate (together the "Corvas Employee Plans").

         (b) With respect to each Corvas Employee Plan, Corvas has made

such Corvas Employee Plan, (iii) each trust agreement and group annuity
contract, if any, relating to such Corvas Employee Plan, (iv) the most recent
actuarial report or valuation relating to an Corvas Employee Plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA, and (v) the most recent IRS determination letter, where

         (c) With respect to the Corvas Employee Plans, individually and in the
aggregate, Corvas and its ERISA Affiliates are in full compliance with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the regulations and published authorities
thereunder, and all other laws applicable with respect to all such Corvas
Employee Plans, and no event has occurred, and to the knowledge of Corvas, there
exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which Corvas
could be subject to any liability that is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Corvas, under

                                       18

<PAGE>

ERISA, the Code, or any other applicable law. Corvas has classified all
individuals who perform services for Corvas correctly under each Corvas Employee
Plan, ERISA and the Code as common law employees, independent contractors or
leased employees. Except to the extent required under Section 4980B of the Code,
neither Corvas nor any ERISA Affiliate provides health or welfare benefits
(through the purchase of insurance or otherwise) for any retired or former
employees.

         (d) With respect to the Corvas Employee Plans, individually and in the
aggregate, there are no benefit obligations required to be funded for which
contributions have not been made or properly accrued, and there are no unfunded
benefit obligations which have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise
properly footnoted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
on the financial statements of Corvas. Except as disclosed in Corvas SEC Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement and except as provided for in this
Agreement, neither Corvas nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to any oral or
written (i) union or collective bargaining agreement, (ii) agreement with any
officer or other key employee of Corvas, the benefits of which are contingent,
or the terms of which are materially altered upon the occurrence of a
transaction involving Corvas of the nature contemplated by this Agreement, (iii)
agreement with any officer of Corvas providing any term of employment or
compensation guarantee extending for a period longer than one year from the date
hereof or for the payment of compensation in excess of $100,000 per annum, or
(iv) agreement or plan, including any stock option plan, stock appreciation
right plan, restricted stock plan, or stock purchase plan, any of the benefits
of which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be
accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the
basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         3.15. Compliance with Laws. Corvas has complied with, is not in
violation of, and has not received any notices of violation with respect to, any
federal, state, or local statute, law, or regulation with respect to the conduct
of its business, or the ownership or operation of its business, except for
failures to comply or violations which would not have a Material Adverse Effect
on Corvas.

         3.16. Interested Party Transactions. Except as disclosed in the Corvas
SEC Reports, since the date of Corvas' last proxy statement to its stockholders,
no event has occurred that would be required to be reported by Corvas as a
Certain Relationship or Related Transaction pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation
S-K promulgated by the SEC.

indirectly, in any discussions or negotiations with any other party with respect
to a Corvas Acquisition Proposal.

         3.18. No Secured Debt. Except as disclosed in the Corvas SEC reports,
there is not now any secured debt (including capitalized leases) of Corvas. The
existence of any outstanding secured debt (including capitalized leases) of
Corvas does not violate the terms of any material note, bond, indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, lease, franchise, permit, authorization, license,
contract, instrument or other agreement or commitment to which Corvas is a party
or by which Corvas or any of its assets or properties is bound or encumbered.

Corvas Disclosure Schedule: (i) Corvas is the sole beneficiary of each of the
Corvas Policies; (ii) each of the Corvas Policies is in full force and effect,

likely to experience liquidity problems; and (iv) the Corvas Policies, in the
aggregate are sufficient in kind and coverage limits to provide risk protection
comparable to that provided to prudent companies engaged in activities similar
to those engaged in by Corvas under similar policies customarily maintained by
such companies.

         3.22. Employment Matters. Corvas has complied with, is not in violation

threatened against or affecting Corvas alleging any violation of any of the
foregoing laws, rules or regulations.

respective effective dates, with respect to registration statements filed under
the Securities Act, complied as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case

prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated in such Dendreon SEC Reports or necessary in order to make
the statements in such Dendreon SEC Reports, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

         (b) Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any
related notes) contained in the Dendreon SEC Reports at the time filed or at the
time of their respective effective dates, as the case may be, complied as to
form in all material respects with the applicable published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in accordance with

the respective dates and the results of its operations and cash flows for the

         (c) Dendreon has in place the "disclosure controls and procedures" (as
defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act) required in order
for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Dendreon to
engage in the review and evaluation process mandated by the Exchange Act.
Dendreon's "disclosure controls and procedures" are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by Dendreon in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Dendreon's management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Dendreon required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

         4.05. No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as disclosed in the Dendreon
SEC Reports, Dendreon does not have any liabilities, either accrued or
contingent (whether or not required to be reflected in financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), and whether due or to
become due, which individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Dendreon, other than (i) liabilities
reflected in the Dendreon Balance Sheet, (ii) obligations to perform under
contracts either disclosed in the Dendreon SEC Reports or in the Dendreon
Disclosure Schedule, and (iii) normal or recurring liabilities incurred since
the date of the Dendreon Balance Sheet, in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices.

         4.06. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since the date of the
Dendreon Balance Sheet, Dendreon has conducted its business only in the ordinary
course and in a manner consistent with past practice and, since such date, there
has not been (i) any Material Adverse Effect on Dendreon, (ii) any damage,
destruction, or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) with respect to any
property of Dendreon having a Material Adverse Effect on Dendreon, (iii) any
material change by Dendreon in its accounting methods, principles, or practices
to which Dendreon has not previously consented in writing, (iv) any revaluation
by Dendreon or any of its assets having a Material Adverse Effect on Dendreon,
or (v) any other action or event that would have required the consent of Corvas
pursuant to Section 5.01 of this Agreement had such action or event occurred
after the date of this Agreement.

         4.07. Taxes.

         (a) All Tax Returns, of or relating to any Taxes heretofore required to

or has made adequate provision for the payment of all Taxes.

         (b) As of the date of this Agreement there are no audits or
administrative proceedings, court proceedings or claims pending against Dendreon
with respect to any Taxes, no assessment, deficiency or adjustment has been
asserted or, to the knowledge of Dendreon,

                                       24

are no liens for Taxes upon the assets or properties of Dendreon, except liens
for Taxes not yet delinquent.

         (c) There are not in force any waivers of agreements, arrangements, or
understandings by or with respect to Dendreon of or for an extension of time for
the assessment or payment of any Taxes. Dendreon has not received a written
ruling of a taxing authority relating to Taxes or entered into a written and
legally binding agreement with a taxing authority relating to Taxes that would
have a continuing effect after the Closing Date. Dendreon is not required to
include in income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code by
reason of a voluntary change in accounting method initiated by Dendreon, and to
the knowledge of Dendreon the IRS has not proposed any such adjustment or change
in accounting method.

         (d) To the knowledge of Dendreon, Dendreon has withheld and paid all
Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee, creditor, independent contractor or other third party.

Dendreon as of the date hereof, and the name of the lessor, the date of the
Lease and each amendment to the Lease, and the aggregate annual rental or other
fees payable under any such Lease. All such Leases are valid and binding
obligations of Dendreon and, to Dendreon's knowledge, of each other party
thereto, in accordance with their respective terms, as those terms are reflected
in documents provided to Corvas, subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other similar laws affecting the
rights of creditors generally and (ii) rules of law governing specific
performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies, and Dendreon is not

         (b) Tangible Personal Property. All material items of tangible personal
property of Dendreon are in good operating condition and repair (ordinary wear
and tear excepted), are performing satisfactorily, and are available for use in
the conduct of Dendreon's business. Dendreon has and will have good and
marketable title to all material personal property owned by it, free and clear
of all security interests, mortgages, liens, pledges, charges, valid claims or
encumbrances of any kind or character other than liens (i) under security
agreements disclosed to Corvas; (ii) for taxes not yet due and payable; or (iii)
incurred in the ordinary course of Dendreon's business that do not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Dendreon.

         4.09. Intellectual Property.

         (a) Ownership of Intellectual Property Assets. Dendreon owns or has
valid rights or licenses to use all of the Dendreon Intellectual Property

against Dendreon or, to Dendreon's knowledge, threatened against Dendreon or its
officers, employees or consultants to the effect that Dendreon's right, title
and interest in and to any of the Dendreon Intellectual Property Assets is
invalid or unenforceable by Dendreon. Dendreon is not aware of any material
information that would adversely affect the validity or enforceability of any of
the Patents, Marks, Trade Secrets or Copyrights which constitute Dendreon
Intellectual Property Assets. All former and current employees, consultants and
contractors of Dendreon who were involved in, or who contributed to, the
creation or development of any of the Dendreon Intellectual Property Assets have
executed written instruments with Dendreon that assign to Dendreon all of such
Person's rights to any inventions, improvements, discoveries, writings or
information relating to the business of Dendreon constituting Dendreon
Intellectual Property Assets. To the knowledge of Dendreon, no employee of
Dendreon has entered into any agreement that restricts or limits in any way the
scope or type of work in which the employee may be engaged or requires the
employee to transfer, assign or disclose information concerning his work to
anyone other than Dendreon. A complete list of Dendreon Products is provided in
Schedule 4.09(a) of the Dendreon Disclosure Schedule.

         (b) Patents. Schedule 4.09(b) of the Dendreon Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete and accurate list of all Patents constituting Dendreon
Intellectual Property Assets. All of such issued Patents are currently in
compliance with formal governmental legal requirements (including, without
limitation, payment of filing, examination and maintenance fees and proofs of
working or use.) All of such Patents are valid and enforceable. In each case
where such an issued Patent is held by Dendreon by assignment, the assignment
has been duly recorded with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and all other
jurisdictions of registration. No such issued Patent or patent application has
been or is now involved in any interference, reissue, reexamination or
opposition proceeding. To Dendreon's knowledge, there is no potentially
interfering patent or patent application of any third party that has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Dendreon. All
Dendreon Products made, used or sold under the Patents have been marked with the
proper patent notice.

         (c) Trademarks. Schedule 4.09(c) of the Dendreon Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a complete and accurate list of all Marks constituting Dendreon
Intellectual Property Assets. All such Marks that have been registered with the
U. S. Patent and Trademark Office or any other jurisdiction are currently in
compliance with formal governmental legal requirements (including, without
limitation, the timely post-registration filing of affidavits of use and
incontestability and renewal applications), are, to Dendreon's knowledge, valid
and enforceable in the jurisdictions in which they are registered. In each case
where such a Mark is held by Dendreon by assignment, the assignment has been
duly recorded with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and all other
jurisdictions of registration. No such Mark has been or is now involved in any
opposition, invalidation or cancellation proceeding and, to Dendreon's
knowledge, no such action is threatened against Dendreon with respect to any of
such Marks. All Dendreon Products and materials containing a Mark bear the
proper notice where required by law.

         (d) Copyrights. Dendreon does not have any Copyrights registered with
the U. S. Copyright Office.

         (e) Trade Secrets. Dendreon has taken all reasonable security measures
(including, without limitation, entering into appropriate confidentiality and
nondisclosure agreements with all officers, directors, employees and consultants
of Dendreon and any other Persons with access to the Trade Secrets constituting
Dendreon Intellectual Property Assets) to protect the secrecy, confidentiality
and value of the Trade Secrets constituting Dendreon Intellectual Property
Assets. To the knowledge of Dendreon, there has not been any breach by any party
to any such confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement. The Trade Secrets
constituting Dendreon Intellectual Property Assets have not been disclosed by
Dendreon to any Person other than employees or contractors of Dendreon who had a
need to know and use such Trade Secrets in the course of their employment or
contract performance, or to other persons under confidentiality and
non-disclosure agreements. To the knowledge of Dendreon, Dendreon has the right
to use, free and clear of claims of third parties, all Trade Secrets
constituting Dendreon Intellectual Property Assets. To the knowledge of
Dendreon, no third party has asserted that the use by Dendreon of any Trade
Secret constituting Dendreon Intellectual Property Assets violates the rights of
such third party.

         (f) Exclusivity of Rights. Dendreon has the exclusive right to use,
license, distribute, transfer and bring infringement actions with respect to the
Dendreon Intellectual Property Assets owned or exclusively licensed by Dendreon.

any of the Dendreon Intellectual Property Assets and (ii) is not obligated to

         (g) Licenses Received. All material licenses or other material
agreements under which Dendreon is granted rights by others in Dendreon
Intellectual Property Assets are listed in Schedule 4.09(g) of the Dendreon
Disclosure Schedule. For the purpose of the foregoing sentence, licenses and
agreements for commercial off-the-shelf computer software having a cost of less
than $5,000 per seat or license shall not be deemed material. Except as set
forth in Schedule 4.09(g) of the Dendreon Disclosure Schedule: (i) all licenses
or other agreements under which Dendreon is granted rights by others in Dendreon
Intellectual Property Assets are in full force and effect, (ii) to the knowledge
of Dendreon, there is no material default under any such license or other
agreement by any party thereto, and (iii) all of the rights of Dendreon under
such licenses and other agreements are assignable without the consent of the
licensor except, with respect to this clause (iii), as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Dendreon. True and complete copies
of all such licenses or other agreements, and any amendments thereto, have been
made available or provided to Corvas, and to the knowledge of Dendreon, the
licensors under the licenses and other agreements under which Dendreon is
granted rights have all requisite power and authority to grant the rights
purported to be conferred thereby.

         (h) Licenses Granted. All licenses or other agreements under which
Dendreon has granted rights to others in Dendreon Intellectual Property Assets

         (i) Sufficiency. The Dendreon Intellectual Property Assets constitute
all of the Intellectual Property Assets used in designing, creating and
developing the Dendreon Products and are all of the Intellectual Property Assets
necessary for the operation of Dendreon's business as currently conducted.

         (j) Infringement. None of the Dendreon Products developed or under
development, manufactured or sold by Dendreon, nor any process or know-how used
by Dendreon in connection therewith, infringes, conflicts with or
misappropriates any Copyright or Trade Secret of any Person, or to Dendreon's
knowledge, infringes any Patent, Mark, or other proprietary right of any Person.

         (k) Dendreon Nondisclosure Contracts. To the knowledge of Dendreon,
each of the Dendreon Nondisclosure Contracts is a valid and binding obligation
of the other party thereto enforceable in accordance with its terms, and, to
Dendreon's knowledge, no such third party is in material breach of any such
Dendreon Nondisclosure Contract. A complete list of all Dendreon Nondisclosure
Contracts is provided in Schedule 4.09(k) of the Dendreon Disclosure Schedule.

         4.10. Agreements, Contracts, and Commitments. Schedule 4.10 of the

(within the meaning of Item 601(10) of Regulation S-K) that have not been filed
as exhibits to the Dendreon SEC Reports; and (ii) all amendments to Dendreon
Material Contracts, whether or not such contracts were filed as exhibits to the
Dendreon SEC Reports, unless such amendments were also filed as exhibits to the

Dendreon has not breached, or received in writing any claim or threat that it
has breached, any of the terms and conditions of any Dendreon Material Contracts
in such a manner as would permit any other party to cancel or terminate the same
or would permit any other party to seek material damages from Dendreon under any
Dendreon Material Contract and Dendreon is not aware of the existence of a
material breach of a Dendreon Material Contract by any other party thereto.
Dendreon is not engaged, and has not agreed to engage, in any discussions
related to the material amendment of any Dendreon Material Contract.

         4.11. Litigation. Except as described in the Dendreon SEC Reports,

The Corvas Stockholders' Meeting shall be held (on a date selected by Corvas in
consultation with Dendreon) as promptly as practicable after the Registration

45 calendar days thereafter. Corvas shall use its reasonable efforts to solicit

consultation with an independent financial advisor of national reputation) that
such offer constitutes a Corvas Superior Offer; (iv) Corvas' Board of Directors
determines in good faith, based on the advice of its outside legal counsel,

otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission
of any Corvas Superior Offer or other Corvas Acquisition Proposal, or by any
withdrawal or modification of the Corvas Board Recommendation.

shall include a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of Dendreon
unanimously recommends that Dendreon's stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement
at the Dendreon Stockholders' Meeting (the unanimous recommendation of
Dendreon's Board of Directors that Dendreon's stockholders vote to adopt this
Agreement being referred to as the "Dendreon Board Recommendation"); and (ii)
the Dendreon Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner
adverse to Corvas, and no resolution by the Board of Directors of Dendreon or
any committee thereof to withdraw or modify the Dendreon Board Recommendation in
a manner adverse to Corvas shall be adopted or proposed; it being expressly
understood that, if the Corvas Board Recommendation is no longer unanimous, it

         6.12. NASDAQ Quotation. Dendreon shall use its best efforts to cause
the shares of Dendreon Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved
for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

         6.13. Stock Plans and Other Options.

         (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares
of Corvas Common Stock under the Corvas Option Plans and each Corvas Non-Plan
Option (collectively, "Corvas Stock Options"), whether vested or unvested, shall
be converted into and become the right to acquire shares of Dendreon Common
Stock, and Dendreon shall assume each such Corvas Stock Option in accordance
with the terms and conditions (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of
the Corvas Option Plan under which it was issued and the terms and conditions of
the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced. From and after the
Effective Time, (i) each Corvas Stock Option assumed by Dendreon may be
exercised solely for shares of Dendreon Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares
of Dendreon Common Stock subject to each such Corvas Stock Option shall be equal
to the number of shares of Corvas Common Stock subject to such Corvas Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Conversion
Number, rounding down to the nearest whole share, (iii) the per share exercise
price under each such Corvas Stock Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per
share exercise price under such Corvas Stock Option by the Conversion Number and
rounding up to the nearest cent, and (iv) any restriction on the exercise of any
such Corvas Stock Option shall continue in full force and effect and the term,
exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Corvas Stock
Option shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided, however, that each Corvas
Stock Option assumed by Dendreon in accordance with this Section 6.13(a) shall,
in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to
reflect any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction effected subsequent to the
Effective Time. The adjustment provisions herein with respect to any options
which are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code)
shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with
Section 424(a) of the Code and which does not modify the incentive stock option
within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. The duration and other terms
of the Corvas Stock Options assumed by Dendreon shall be the same as the terms
of the original option except that all references to Corvas shall be deemed to
be references to Dendreon.

         (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Dendreon shall
deliver to the holders of Corvas Stock Options an appropriate notice setting
forth such holder's rights pursuant thereto and the grants made prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the Corvas Option Plans or the stock option agreement
by which they are evidenced shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 6.13 after
giving effect to the Merger). Dendreon shall comply with the terms of the Corvas
Option Plans to ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions
of, the Corvas Option Plans, that Corvas Stock Options which qualified as
incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time continue to qualify as
incentive stock options after the Effective Time.

         (c) Dendreon shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Dendreon Common Stock for delivery
under the Corvas Stock Options assumed in accordance with this Section 6.13. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time,

                                       45

<PAGE>

but in no event later than the third business day following the Closing Date,
Dendreon shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or
other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Dendreon Common Stock
subject to such Corvas Stock Options and shall use its best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such Corvas
Stock Options remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals who
subsequent to the Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where applicable, Dendreon shall administer
the Corvas Option Plans assumed pursuant to this Section 6.13 in a manner that
complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

         (d) As of the Effective Time, the Corvas 1991 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan, as amended, (the "Corvas ESPP") shall be terminated. The rights of
participants in the Corvas ESPP with respect to any offering period then
underway under the Corvas ESPP shall be determined by treating the last business
day prior to the Effective Time as the last day of such offering period and by
making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the
shortened offering period but otherwise treating such shortened offering period
as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the
Corvas ESPP; provided that the shortening of the offering period shall be
effected in a manner that is not a modification of the offer within the meaning
of Section 424(h) of the Code. Prior to the Effective Time, Corvas shall take
all actions that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Section 6.13(d).

         (e) Dendreon shall, prior to the Effective Time, cause Dendreon's Board
of Directors to approve the issuance of shares of Dendreon Common Stock
(including shares of Dendreon Common Stock to be issued in connection with the
exercise of any Corvas Stock Options assumed by Dendreon in the Merger) and the
assumption of Corvas Stock Options, with respect to any employees of Corvas who
will become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act to the extent necessary for such issuance to be an exempt acquisition
pursuant to SEC Rule 16b-3 and will provide a draft of such resolutions to
Corvas' outside legal counsel for review prior to adoption. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Corvas shall approve the disposition
of Corvas Common Stock in connection with the Merger by those directors and
officers of Corvas subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the
Exchange Act to the extent necessary for such disposition to be an exempt
disposition pursuant to SEC Rule 16b-3.

         6.14. Consents. Each of Dendreon and Corvas shall use all reasonable
efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers, and approvals under any of
Dendreon's or Corvas' material agreements, contracts, licenses, or leases in
connection with the Combination.

         6.15. Brokers or Finders. Each of Dendreon and Corvas represents, as to
itself and its Affiliates, that no agent, broker, investment banker, financial
advisor, or other firm or person is or will be entitled to any broker's or
finder's fee or any other commission or similar fee in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except Lazard Freres & Co., LLC,
whose fees and expenses will be paid by Corvas in accordance with Corvas'
agreement with such firm (a copy of which has been delivered by Corvas to
Dendreon prior to the date of this Agreement), and Needham & Company, Inc. and
SG Cowen Securities Corporation, whose fees and expenses will be paid by
Dendreon in accordance with Dendreon's

                                       46

<PAGE>

agreement with such firms (copies of which has been delivered by Dendreon to
Corvas prior to the date of this Agreement.)

         6.16. Employee Benefits; Employee Issues.

         (a) Dendreon agrees that all employees of Corvas who continue
employment with Dendreon or the Continuing Corporation after the Effective Time
("Continuing Employees") shall be eligible to continue to participate in the
Continuing Corporation's retirement, health, vacation and other non-equity based
employee benefit plans; provided, however, that (a) nothing in this Section 6.16
or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Dendreon or the
Continuing Corporation to amend or terminate any such retirement, health,
vacation or other employee benefit plan at any time, and (b) if Dendreon or the
Continuing Corporation terminates any such retirement, health, vacation or other
employee benefit plan, then, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
participate in Dendreon's health, vacation and other non-equity based employee
benefit plans, to substantially the same extent as employees of Dendreon in
similar positions and at similar grade levels. With respect to such benefits and
to the extent permitted under the applicable employee benefit plans of Dendreon,
credit for service accrued by Continuing Employees (and eligible dependents) for
employment with Corvas or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
shall be recognized (except to the extent necessary to prevent duplication of
benefits), any pre-existing condition limitations and eligibility waiting
periods applicable to any Continuing Employee under any group health plan shall
be waived, and employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under any Corvas
Employee Plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles,
co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Corvas Employee Plan.
Corvas' employees shall be eligible for grants of stock options after the
Effective Time under Dendreon's 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and 2002 Broad Based
Equity Incentive Plan on the same terms as Dendreon's employees.

         (b) Dendreon shall use all reasonable efforts to enter into appropriate
employment agreements with the Chairman of its board of directors, Chief
Executive Officer, and President prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this
Section 6.16 or elsewhere in this Agreement, however, shall be construed to
create a right in any employee to employment with Dendreon, the Continuing
Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Dendreon and, subject to any binding
written agreement between an employee and Dendreon or the Continuing
Corporation, the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will"
employment.

         6.17. Reports. From and after the Effective Time and so long as
necessary in order to permit Corvas' Affiliates to sell the shares of Dendreon
Common Stock received by them as a result of the Merger pursuant to Rule 145
and, to the extent applicable, Rule 144 under the Securities Act, Dendreon will
use its best efforts to file on a timely basis all reports required to be filed
by it pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, referred to in
paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or, if applicable,
Dendreon will use its best efforts to make publicly available the information
regarding itself referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 144).

         6.18. Notification of Certain Matters. Corvas will give prompt notice
to Dendreon upon discovery thereof, and Dendreon will give prompt notice to
Corvas upon discovery thereof, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of
any event which occurrence or failure would be

                                       47

<PAGE>

likely to cause the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section
7.02(a) or 7.03(a), and (b) any material failure of Corvas or Dendreon, or any
director, officer, employee, agent or Representative thereof, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder.

         6.19. Additional Agreements; Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including cooperating fully with the other party. In case at any
time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Continuing Corporation
with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities, and
franchises of either of the Constituent Corporations, the proper officers and
directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action.

         6.20. Continuing Indemnification.

         (a) Dendreon shall guaranty the obligations of Corvas to indemnify its
present and former directors and officers, to the extent of, and in accordance
with, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Corvas as in effect on the
date of this Agreement and the Delaware Law. Subject to the Delaware Law,
Corvas' Bylaws relating to indemnification shall not be amended in a manner
which adversely affects the rights of any party entitled to indemnification
thereunder. With respect to any claim relating to an occurrence prior to the
Effective Time, such guarantee shall be subordinate in all respects to the
rights of Corvas and/or such indemnified person under any policy of insurance
maintained by Corvas.

         (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time Corvas will terminate the
existing policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
Corvas (the "Existing D&O Policy") and will obtain a "tail" policy on the
Existing D&O Policy until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time for the
benefit of the Indemnified Persons with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time.

         (c) The provisions of this Section 6.20 are intended to be in addition
to the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of
Corvas by law, charter, statute, bylaws or agreement, and shall operate for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons. The
obligations of Dendreon and the Continuing Corporation under this Section 6.20
shall not be terminated, modified or impaired in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnified Person to whom this Section 6.20 applies without the
consent of such affected Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnified Person to whom this Section 6.20 applies shall be an express third
party beneficiary of this Section 6.20).

         6.21. Board of Directors of Dendreon. Prior to the Effective Time,
Dendreon shall take all necessary actions so that, from and after the Effective
Time, for a period of eighteen months from the Effective Time and thereafter
until duly changed in accordance with applicable law and Dendreon's Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws as then in effect, the Board of Directors of
Dendreon will be comprised of not more than ten directors, unless an increase in
the number of directors is authorized by a majority of the Dendreon Board of
Directors which majority shall

                                       48

<PAGE>

include at least one of the Corvas nominees referred to in the next sentence or
their duly appointed successors. Prior to the Effective Time, Dendreon shall
take all necessary action (including, if necessary, soliciting and obtaining
resignations of serving board members) to cause two nominees of Corvas, who are
reasonably acceptable to Dendreon and who are serving members of the Corvas
Board of Directors, to be appointed, contingent on the occurrence of the Merger,
to the Dendreon Board of Directors. One such director shall be appointed for a
term expiring at the Dendreon annual meeting in 2005 and the other for a term
expiring at the Dendreon annual meeting in 2006.
