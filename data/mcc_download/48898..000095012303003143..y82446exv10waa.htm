submit its preliminary determination and detailed supporting
calculations to both the Company and the Executive within 15 calendar
days after the Termination Date, if applicable, and any other such
time or times as may be requested by the Company or the Executive. If
the Accounting Firm determines that any Excise Tax is payable by the
Executive and that the criteria for reducing the Payment to the
Capped Amount (as described in Section&nbsp;6(a)(i) above) is met, then
the Company shall reduce the Payment by the amount which, based on
the Accounting Firm&#146;s determination and calculations, would provide the
Executive with the Capped Amount, and pay to the Executive such
reduced Payment. If the Accounting Firm determines that an Excise Tax
is payable, without reduction pursuant to Section&nbsp;6(a)(i), above,
the Company shall pay the required Gross-Up Payment to, or for the
benefit of, the Executive within five business days after receipt of
such determination and calculations. If the Accounting Firm determines
that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall, at the same
time as it makes such determination, furnish the Executive with an
opinion that he has substantial authority not to report any Excise
Tax on his/her federal, state, local income or other
tax return. Any determination by the Accounting Firm as to the amount
of the Gross-Up Payment shall be binding upon the Company and the
Executive absent a contrary determination by the Internal Revenue
Services or a court of competent jurisdiction; <i>provided,

due as a result of such contrary determination. As a result of the
uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code (or
any successor provision thereto) and the possibility of similar
uncertainty regarding state or local tax law at the time of any
determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that
Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by the Company should
have been made (an &#147;Underpayment&#148;), consistent with
the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the
Company exhausts or fails to pursue its remedies pursuant to
Section&nbsp;6(a) hereof and the Executive thereafter is required to
make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Executive shall direct the
Accounting Firm to determine the amount of the Underpayment that has
occurred and to submit its determination and detailed supporting
calculations to both the Company and the Executive as promptly as
possible. Any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the
