<P align="center"><FONT size="2">As Adopted by the Board on October&nbsp;7, 1996<BR>
and Approved by Stockholders on November&nbsp;25, 1996<BR>
As Amended by the Board on October&nbsp;9, 2002<BR>

As Amended by the Board on January&nbsp;30, 2003</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose. </B>This 1996 Directors Stock Option Plan (this &#147;Plan&#148;) is
established to provide equity incentives for non-employee members of the Board
of Directors of Intuit Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), who are described in Section&nbsp;6.1
below, by granting such persons options to purchase shares of stock of the
Company.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adoption and Stockholder Approval. </B>This Plan became effective on
October&nbsp;7, 1996, (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;), the date on which it was adopted by
the Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;) and was approved by the
stockholders of the Company, consistent with applicable laws on November&nbsp;25,
1996. No stock option that is granted as a result of any increase in the
number of shares authorized to be issued under this Plan shall be exercised
prior to the time such increase has been approved by the stockholders of the
Company and all such options granted pursuant to such increase shall terminate
if such stockholder approval is not obtained.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Types of Options and Shares. </B>Options granted under this Plan
(&#147;Options&#148;) shall be non-qualified stock options. The shares of stock that may
be purchased upon exercise of Options granted under this Plan are shares of the
Common Stock of the Company (the &#147;Shares&#148;).
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of Shares</B>. The maximum number of Shares that may be issued
pursuant to Options granted under this Plan (the &#147;Maximum Number&#148;) is 1,050,000
Shares, subject to adjustment as provided in Section&nbsp;11 of this Plan. If any
Option is terminated for any reason without being exercised in whole or in
part, the Shares thereby released from such Option shall be available for
purchase under other Options granted under this Plan. At all times during the
term of this Plan, the Company shall reserve and keep available such number of
Shares as shall be required to satisfy the requirements of outstanding Options
granted under this Plan; provided, however, that if the aggregate number of
Shares subject to outstanding Options granted under this Plan plus the
aggregate number of Shares previously issued by the Company pursuant to the
exercise of Options granted under this Plan equals or exceeds the Maximum
Number, then notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no further
Options may be granted under this Plan until the Maximum Number is increased or
the aggregate number of Shares subject to outstanding Options granted under
this Plan plus the aggregate number of Shares previously issued by the Company
pursuant to the exercise of Options granted under this Plan is less than the
Maximum Number.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administration. </B>This Plan shall be administered by the Board. The
interpretation by the Board of any of the provisions of this Plan or any Option
granted under this Plan shall be final and binding upon the Company and all
persons having an interest in any Option or any Shares purchased pursuant to an
Option.

in the case of Options granted pursuant to an amendment increasing the number
of shares that may be issued pursuant to this Plan, such amendment) has been
approved by the stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section&nbsp;15
below.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;An Option shall not be exercisable unless such exercise is in
compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;)
and all applicable state securities laws, as they are in effect on the date of
exercise.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The Board may specify a reasonable minimum number of Shares that may
be purchased upon any exercise of an Option, provided that such minimum number
will not prevent the Non-Employee Director from exercising the full number of
Shares as to which the Option is then exercisable.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nontransferability of Options. </B>During the lifetime of the Non-Employee
Director, an Option shall be exercisable only by the Non-Employee Director or
by the Non-Employee Director&#146;s guardian or legal representative, unless
otherwise permitted by the Board. No Option may be sold, pledged, assigned,
hypothecated, transferred or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by
the laws of descent and distribution.

any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to any Shares subject to an
Option until the Option has been validly exercised. No adjustment shall be
made for dividends or distributions or other rights for which the record date
is prior to the date of exercise, except as provided in this Plan. The Company
shall provide to each Non-Employee Director a copy of the annual financial
statements of the Company, at such time after the close of each fiscal year of
the Company as they are released by the Company to its stockholders.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjustment of Option Shares. </B>In the event that the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company is changed by a stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, combination, reclassification or
similar change in the capital structure of the Company without consideration,
the number of Shares available under this Plan and the number of Shares subject
to outstanding Options and the exercise price per share of such outstanding
Options shall be proportionately adjusted, subject to any required action by
the Board or stockholders of the Company and compliance with applicable
securities laws; provided, however, that no fractional shares shall be issued
upon exercise of any Option and any resulting fractions of a Share shall be
rounded up to the nearest whole Share.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>12. No Obligation to Continue as Director. </B>Nothing in this Plan or any
Option granted under this Plan shall confer on any Non-Employee Director any
right to continue as a director of the Company.

applicable state securities laws and compliance with the requirements of any

assets of the Company, or (e)&nbsp;the acquisition, sale or transfer of a majority

that the Board shall not, without the approval of the stockholders of the
Company, increase the total number of Shares available under this Plan (except
by operation of the provisions of Sections&nbsp;4 and 11 above) or broaden the class
of persons eligible to receive Options. In any case, no amendment of this Plan
may adversely affect any then outstanding Options or any unexercised portions
thereof without the written consent of the Non-Employee Director.
