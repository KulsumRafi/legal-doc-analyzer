<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company hereby employs Executive as Chief Operating Officer or in such other more senior or

the Company, and thereafter, the Company will provide Executive with indemnification and D&amp;O insurance insuring Executive against insurable events which occur or have occurred while Executive was an
Officer of the Company, on terms and conditions that are at least as generous as that then provided to officers of the Company. </FONT></P>

such events Executive's employment is terminated pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;7 above; or (ii)&nbsp;Executive reaches the age of fifty-five (55)&nbsp;and has attained ten

time to time by the Company, after Executive's Separation Date or the end of the Salary Continuation Period, as applicable, for the remainder of Executive's life ("Life Coverage Period"). During the
Life Coverage Period, Executive shall pay twenty percent (20%) of the current premium (revised annually) on an after-tax basis each quarter, and the Company shall pay eighty percent (80%)
of said premium on an after-tax basis, which contribution will be imputed income to Executive. As soon after the Separation Date as Executive becomes eligible for Medicare coverage, the
Company's group health insurance plan shall become secondary to Medicare. </FONT></P>

shall commence on the Separation Date. If Executive engages in any of the activities described in said paragraph&nbsp;14(a)(i)&nbsp;in a business which does not compete with the Company or any of
its subsidiaries during the Life Coverage Period, the Company's group health insurance plan shall become secondary to any primary health insurance plan or coverage made available to Executive by that

disability of an employee shall apply in lieu of the salary and benefits under this Agreement, except that (i)&nbsp;the Escrow Agreement (if then in force) and his indemnification agreement will
continue in force (the Escrow Agreement will be subject to amendment or termination in accordance with its terms), and (ii)&nbsp;he will be entitled to the lifetime group insurance benefits
described in paragraph&nbsp;11. If Executive is disabled so that he cannot perform his duties (as reasonably determined by the Human Resources Committee (HRC)), then the Company may terminate his
duties under this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, disability will be the inability of Executive, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential functions of the job. In
such event, he will receive eighteen (18)&nbsp;months salary continuation (offset by any long term disability benefits to which he is entitled), together with all other benefits, and during such
period of salary continuation any stock options and restricted stock grants then in existence will continue in force for vesting purposes. Executive, if disabled, shall also be eligible for lifetime
health benefits as if he has completed the eligibility requirements of paragraph&nbsp;11 and at the rates set forth in paragraph&nbsp;11. However, during such period of salary continuation for
disability, Executive will not be eligible to participate in the annual bonus plan, nor will he be eligible to receive stock option or restricted stock grants or any other long-term
incentive awards except to the extent approved by the HRC. After the eighteen (18)&nbsp;months of salary continuation has expired, per plan documents, fifty percent (50%) of any remaining unvested
annual options, if any, and fifty percent (50%) of any unvested promotional options, if any, will vest and the other fifty percent (50%) of each of the unvested options will terminate. All PTO will

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive's
position with the Company will or has resulted in his exposure and access to confidential and proprietary information which he did not have access to prior
to holding the position, which information is of great value to the Company and the disclosure of which by him, directly or indirectly, would be irreparably injurious and detrimental to the Company.
During his term of employment and without limitation thereafter, Executive agrees to use his best efforts and to observe the utmost diligence to guard and protect all confidential or proprietary
information relating to the Company from disclosure to third parties. Executive shall not at any time during and after his Separation Date, make available, either directly or indirectly, to any
competitor or potential competitor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or their affiliates or divulge, disclose, communicate to any firm, corporation or other business entity in any manner
whatsoever, any confidential or proprietary information covered or contemplated by this Agreement, unless expressly authorized to do so by the Company in writing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the purpose of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall mean all information of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, relating to or useful in
connection with the business of the Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates, whether or not a "trade secret" within the meaning of applicable law, which at the time of Executive's initial employment is
not generally known to the general public and which has been or is from time to time disclosed to or developed by Executive as a result of his employment with the Company. Confidential Information
includes, but is not limited to the Company's product development and marketing programs, data, future plans, formula, food and beverage procedures, recipes, finances, financial management systems,
player identification systems (Total Rewards), pricing systems, client and customer lists, organizational charts, salary and benefit programs, training programs, computer software, business records,
files, drawings, prints, prototyping models, letters, notes, notebooks, reports, and copies thereof, whether prepared by him or others, and any other information or documents which Executive is told
or reasonably ought to know that the Company regards as confidential. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive
agrees that upon separation of employment for any reason whatsoever, he shall promptly deliver to the Company all Confidential Information, including but not
limited to, documents, reports, correspondences, computer printouts, work papers, files, computer lists, telephone and address books, rolodex cards, computer tapes, disks, and any and all records in
his possession (and all copies thereof) containing any such Confidential Information created in whole or in part by Executive within the scope of his employment, even if the items do not contain
Confidential Information. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive
shall also be required to sign a non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement. Such an agreement shall also remain in full force and effect, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>provided that</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, in the event of any conflict between any such
agreement(s) and this Agreement, this Agreement shall control. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;This
paragraph and any of its provision will survive Executive's separation of employment for any reason. </FONT></P>

relief, including but not limited to a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction and permanent injunction, to prevent any such violations or any continuation of such violations for the
protection of the Company. The granting of injunctive relief will not act as a waiver by the Company to pursue any and all additional remedies. </FONT></P>
