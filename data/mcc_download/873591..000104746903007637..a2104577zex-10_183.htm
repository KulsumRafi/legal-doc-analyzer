<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Licensed
Patents shall mean U.S. Patent Nos. 5,168,062 and 5,385,839, issued December&nbsp;1, 1992, and January&nbsp;31, 1995 respectively, titled "Transfer Vectors

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Licensed
Products shall mean and include any and all biological materials and products and processes the making, having made, using, selling or importing of which would,

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.11&nbsp;For
purposes of this Agreement, Partner shall mean any third party company or legal entity which is not controlled by or under common control with MedImmune, with which

co-develop, co-promote or co-market Licensed Products in the Licensed Field in conjunction with MedImmune. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;UIRF
hereby grants to MedImmune and its Affiliates, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, a non-exclusive license under Licensed Patents to make, have
made, use, import, sell, offer to sell, have sold the Licensed Products within the Licensed Field in the Licensed Territory. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;To
ensure that any Partner (as defined in paragraph&nbsp;1.11) has the appropriate enabling rights to make, have made, use, sell and import the Licensed Products in
the Licensed Field, MedImmune shall
direct its Partner to enter into a direct license with the UIRF for the Licensed Patents in the Licensed Field as outlined below: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MedImmune
agrees to notify such Partner within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the execution of any formal agreement between MedImmune and such Partner, and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;MedImmune
shall notify the Partner that the Partner will need to obtain a separate license to the Licensed Patents for the Licensed Field directly from the UIRF for the
Partner's use, manufacture, sale or import of any Licensed Products and that the license terms of Exhibit&nbsp;A are valid only if the UIRF/Partner license is executed on or before
December&nbsp;1, 1998, and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;MedImmune
shall promptly send copies to UIRF of all such notifications sent to such Partners, specifying the Licensed Products that are the subject of the agreement
between MedImmune and the Partner. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Since
(a)&nbsp;the UIRF has granted a number of non-exclusive licenses to the Licensed Patents and (b)&nbsp;there exist several inter-relationships between UIRF's licensees and
licensees' affiliates, the Partners of MedImmune may already have enabling licenses for the Licensed Patents within the Licensed Field. Additionally, since UIRF will get delayed notification of the
nature of the relationship between MedImmune and its Partner, UIRF cannot be the party determining whether any of MedImmune's Partners have such enabling licenses already. The UIRF will not
intentionally collect any double payments; however, all payments made to UIRF are non-refundable and UIRF shall not be held responsible for any double payments that are made by MedImmune
and/or its Partners. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;In
consideration of the rights granted to MedImmune pursuant to Article&nbsp;2.1 of this Agreement, MedImmune agrees to make the following payments to the UIRF: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;A
non-refundable license fee in the sum of (CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED) upon execution of this Agreement. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Earned
Royalties in an amount equal to (CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED) of the Net Sales of Licensed Products to be paid on a semi-annual basis. MedImmune
agrees to submit to UIRF within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after December&nbsp;31 and June&nbsp;30, reports setting forth for the preceding six (6)&nbsp;month period the Net Sales of Licensed
Products and royalty due thereon and with each such royalty report to pay the amount of royalty due. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>In
the event that a Licensed Product is sold in the Licensed Field in combination with therapeutically active product which is not a Licensed Product for a single price, Net Sales from such sales for
purposes of calculating the amounts due under Section&nbsp;3.3 above shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Sales of that combination by the fraction A/(A&nbsp;+&nbsp;B), where A is the
gross selling price of the same quantity of Licensed Product sold separately by MedImmune in the normal course of business and B is the gross selling price of the other product. In the event that no
such separate sales are made by MedImmune, Net Sales for royalty determination shall be as reasonably allocated between such Licensed Product and such other product, based upon their relative
importance and proprietary protection as agreed to by the parties. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;On
each anniversary of the Effective Date of this Agreement a license maintenance fee of (CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED) until the expiration of the Licensed Patents. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event that MedImmune becomes obligated at any time or from time to time during the term of this Agreement to pay royalties to any third party for the practice of
any method or use of any composition of matter covered by any claim of the Licensed Patents or for the sale of any Licensed Products, MedImmune's royalty obligation to the UIRF shall be reduced by an
amount equal to its royalty obligation to such third party; provided, however, that MedImmune's royalty obligation shall not be reduced by more than fifty percent (50%) for any one calendar quarter. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;MedImmune's
obligation to make payments hereunder shall be suspended during any period of time that MedImmune is enjoined, or reasonably believes it may be enjoined,
from exercising any of its rights hereunder with respect to the Licensed Patents or any Licensed Products. Upon resolution of any such matter, MedImmune shall promptly pay to UIRF all amounts
previously withheld with respect to such matter, less (i)&nbsp;any reduction which may be applicable pursuant to paragraph above, and (ii)&nbsp;expenses incurred in the resolution thereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;MedImmune
shall report, not any less frequently than annually, on its efforts and progress made toward commercialization of any products involving Licensed Patents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;MedImmune
shall keep accurate and correct records of Licensed Products made, used or sold under this Agreement. Such records shall be retained for at least three
(3)&nbsp;years following a given reporting period. UIRF is hereby granted by MedImmune the right, upon reasonable written notice to MedImmune and appropriately bound by confidentiality, to retain an
independent certified public accountant reasonably acceptable to MedImmune to audit MedImmune's records solely to verify sales
of the Licensed Products. UIRF may designate an agent for purposes of this verification and this verification shall be upon reasonable notice to MedImmune. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;All
payments due hereunder shall be payable in United States dollars. Conversion of foreign currency to U.S. dollars shall be made at the conversion rate existing in the
United States as reported in The Wall Street Journal on the last working day of each royalty period. Such payments shall be without deduction of exchange, collection or other charges. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event that MedImmune shall become insolvent, shall make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or shall have a petition in bankruptcy filed for or
