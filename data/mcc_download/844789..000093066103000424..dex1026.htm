has therefore required the execution and delivery of this Agreement as a condition precedent to Lender&#146;s making of the Loan to Borrower in order to protect Lender from any such liabilities, costs and/or expenses, and Lender would not be willing
to make the Loan to Borrower in the absence of the execution and delivery by Indemnitor of this Agreement. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV> <DIV STYLE="text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">NOW,

Hazardous Substances as a result of construction, operations or other activities on, or the contamination of, the Real Property. The term &#147;Applicable Laws&#148; as used in the Agreement shall include, without limitation, (a) The Comprehensive

under this Agreement shall impair any such power, right or privilege, or be construed to be a waiver of any default or an acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such power, right or privilege preclude other or further
exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege. No provision of this Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated except by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the change, waiver,
