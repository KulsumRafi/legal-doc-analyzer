class) by the aggregate number of Membership Shares outstanding (regardless of
class). The number and class of Membership Shares and the resulting Percentage
Interest of the Members is reflected on Exhibit A hereto. Exhibit A hereto shall
                                        ---------         ---------

Shares and the admission of new Members, in each case in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement.

                 ---------------------
contributions of cash or other property to the Company (each, a "Capital
Contribution"). A Member may make a Capital Contribution or loan funds to the
Company with the prior written consent of the Managing Member, which consent may
be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of the Managing Member, for any
reason or no reason.

                 ---------

     (a) Except in connection with a Transfer to a Permitted Transferee (each as
defined in Section 8.1 below) or a Transfer to which the Managing Member
consents pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof in which the transferee has been
admitted as a Substitute Member (as defined below) and has assumed the
obligations of a Member or as otherwise described herein, no Member shall have
the right to withdraw from the Company without the prior written consent of the
Managing Member (which consent may be withheld in Managing Member's sole
discretion, for any reason or no reason). Effective on the date of a permitted
withdrawal, such withdrawing Member shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the
Company and shall no longer be a Member for purposes of this Agreement. From and
after the effective date of such withdrawal, the withdrawing Member shall not be
entitled to receive any distributions from the Company unless the withdrawing
Member was a Member on the record date therefor.

     (b) If a Member withdraws from the Company in violation of Section 3.6(a),
such Member shall not be entitled to any distribution or payment with respect to

Shares and has the right to acquire, from time to time in the future, 4,000,000
Class B Shares underlying the MM Option (as defined in Section 3.10 below) (such
12,600,000 Class B Shares, collectively, the "MM Class B Shares").
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (and assuming

holders of the Managing Member's Class A warrants and holders of options
entitling such holders to purchase shares of the Managing Member's common stock.

     (b) The Managing Member shall have the right, from time to time and on such
terms as the Managing Member may determine in its sole discretion, to distribute
as a dividend to its stockholders rights ("Rights") to purchase MM Class B
Shares held by the Managing Member. At the request of the Managing Member, the
Company shall register both the Rights and Class B Shares issuable upon the
exercise thereof (in this context, collectively, the "Registrable Securities")
with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the "Securities Act"), it being understood and agreed that neither
the MM Class B Shares nor any other debt or equity securities of the Company
shall, without the approval of the Managing Member in its sole discretion, be
listed on any public market or exchange.

     (c) The Members agree that, in connection with any such registration of the
Registrable Securities under the Securities Act, the Company shall:

          (i) File with the SEC a registration statement with respect to such
     Registrable Securities (a "Registration Statement") and use its reasonable
     best efforts to cause that Registration Statement to become effective as
     soon as possible;

          (ii) When required by the Managing Member, and as expeditiously as
     possible, prepare and file with the SEC any amendments and supplements to
     the Registration Statement and the prospectus included in the Registration
     Statement (the "Prospectus") as may be necessary to comply in all material
     respects with the provisions of the Securities Act (including the
     anti-fraud provisions thereof) and to keep the Registration Statement
     effective for so long as the Managing Member may require;

          (iii) When required by the Managing Member, and as expeditiously as
     possible, furnish to the Managing Member such reasonable numbers of copies
     of the Prospectus, including any preliminary prospectus, in conformity with
     the requirements of the Securities Act, and such other documents as the
     Managing Member may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public
     distribution or sale of the Registrable Securities owned by the Managing
     Member;

          (iv) As expeditiously as possible, use its best efforts to register or
     qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement
     under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such states as the Managing Member
     shall reasonably request, and do any and all other acts and things that may
     be necessary or desirable to enable the Managing Member to facilitate the
     public distribution or sale of the Registrable Securities owned by the
     Managing Member;

          (v) Promptly provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such
     Registrable Securities not later than the effective date of such
     Registration Statement;


                                       5
<PAGE>

          (vi) As expeditiously as possible following the effectiveness of such
     Registration Statement, notify the Managing Member of any request by the
     SEC for the amending or supplementing of such Registration Statement or
     prospectus;

          (vii) Use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the lifting of any
     stop order that might be issued suspending the effectiveness of such
     Registration Statement at the earliest possible moment; and

          (viii) Use its reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC in a
     timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under
     the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (at
     any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements).

or assignee of all or a portion of the Membership Shares of a Member (a
"Substitute Member") shall be entitled to any of the rights and benefits under
this Agreement of the transferor or assignor of such interest (other than the
right to distributions) unless and until:

          (i) the Additional Member or the Substitute Member, as the case may

     be, shall accept and assume in writing (in a form determined by the Board
     of Directors) all of the terms, conditions and obligations of this
     Agreement applicable to the Membership Shares being acquired by it.

     (b) As promptly as is reasonably practicable after the admission of an
Additional Member or a Substitute Member in the Company, the Managing Member or
its designee shall amend this Agreement (including Schedule A annexed hereto) to
reflect the addition of the Additional Member, or the addition of the Substitute
Member and the deletion of the Member substituted therefor, and to set forth the
respective designations, preferences and rights, as established by the Managing
Member, of the Membership Shares of such Additional Member or Substitute Member.
The Managing Member shall cause any such amendment to be dated and effective as
of the date upon which any such Additional Member or Substitute Member first
acquired the Membership Shares in question.

                 ----------------------
discretion, determines that conditions are favorable for the Company to
reorganize as a corporation, the Company may be reorganized as a corporation
and, in connection therewith, its equity interests (including but not limited to

                                       6
<PAGE>

convertible into, or options to purchase, such shares of stock) in such
corporation on such terms and conditions as are approved by the Managing Member,
provided that the relative rights and preferences of the Class B Shares shall
not be materially modified. Each Member (including the Class B Members) or other
direct or indirect holder of Membership Shares will be required to execute and
deliver such instruments or documents as may be necessary or advisable in
connection with any such reorganization.

purchase price for such Class B Shares. In connection with each exercise of the
MM Option during the Option Period, the Managing Member shall tender to the
Company the aggregate purchase price for the Class B Shares acquired no later
than five (5) days following its delivery of the written notice contemplated by
this Section 3.10(b).

to the Percentage Interests of each Member. The Managing Member shall not be
entitled to any preferential return on any capital contributed by it to the
Company in connection with the exercise or exercises of the MM Option and shall
only be entitled to a pro rata increase in its Percentage Interest.

loss, damage or claim incurred by such Covered Person by reason of any act or
omission performed or omitted by such Covered Person in good faith on behalf of
the Company and in a manner reasonably believed to be within the scope of the
authority conferred on such Covered Person by this Agreement, except that no
Covered Person shall be entitled to be indemnified in respect of any loss,
damage or claim incurred by such Covered Person by reason of gross negligence or
willful misconduct with respect to such acts or omissions; provided, however,
that any indemnity under this Section 7.3 shall be provided out of and to the
extent of Company assets only, and no Member shall have personal liability on
account thereof.


                                       12
<PAGE>

     (b) Notice of Claims. Any Covered Person seeking indemnification hereunder
         ----------------
(an "Indemnitee") shall promptly, and within 30 days after notice to it (notice
to Indemnitee being the filing of any action, receipt of any claim in writing or
similar form of actual notice) of any claim as to which it asserts a right to
indemnification, notify the party from whom indemnification is sought (an
"Indemnitor") of such claim. Indemnitee shall bill Indemnitor for any such
claims no more frequently than on a monthly basis, and Indemnitor shall promptly
pay (or cause to be paid) Indemnitee upon receipt of any such bill. The failure
of Indemnitee to give the notification to Indemnitor contemplated above in this
Section 7.3(b) shall not relieve Indemnitor from any liability or obligation
that it may have pursuant to this Agreement unless the failure to give such
notice within such time shall have been materially prejudicial to it, and in no
event shall the failure to give such notification relieve Indemnitor from any
liability it may have other than pursuant to this Agreement.

     (c) Third Party Claims. If any claim for indemnification by Indemnitee
         ------------------
arises out of an action or claim by a Person other than Indemnitee, Indemnitor
may, by written notice to Indemnitee, undertake to conduct the defense thereof
and to take all other steps or proceedings to defeat or compromise any such
action or claim, including the employment of counsel; provided, that Indemnitor
shall reasonably consider the advice of Indemnitee as to the defense or
compromise of such actions and claims, and Indemnitee shall have the right to
participate, at its own expense, in such proceedings, but control of such
proceedings shall remain exclusively with Indemnitor. Indemnitee shall provide
all reasonable cooperation to Indemnitor in connection with such proceedings.
Counsel and auditor costs and expenses and court costs and fees of all
proceedings with respect to any such action or claim shall be borne by
Indemnitor. If any such claim is made hereunder and Indemnitor does not elect to
undertake the defense thereof by written notice to Indemnitee, Indemnitee shall
be entitled to control such proceedings and shall be entitled to indemnity with
respect thereto pursuant to the terms of this Section 7.3(b). To the extent that
Indemnitor undertakes the defense of such claim by written notice to Indemnitee
and diligently pursues such defense at its expense, Indemnitee shall be entitled
to indemnification hereunder only to the extent that such defense is
unsuccessful as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction, or by written acknowledgment of the parties.

     Section 7.4 Expenses. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
                 --------
expenses (including legal fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any
claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced
by the Company prior to the final disposition of such claim, demand, action,
suit or proceeding upon receipt by the Company of an undertaking by or on behalf
of the Covered Person to repay such amount if it shall be determined that the
Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in Section 7.3
hereof.

     Section 7.5 Insurance. The Company may purchase and maintain insurance, to
                 ---------
the extent and in such amounts as the Board of Directors shall, in its sole
discretion, deem reasonable, on behalf of Covered Persons and such other persons
as the Board of Directors shall determine, against any liability that may be
asserted against or expenses that may be incurred by any person in connection
with the activities of the Company or such indemnities, regardless of whether
the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability
under the provisions of this Agreement. The Company may enter into indemnity
contracts with Covered Persons and such other Persons as the Board of Directors
shall determine and adopt written procedures pursuant to which arrangements are
made for the advancement of expenses and the funding of obligations under
Section 7.4 hereof and containing such other procedures regarding
indemnification as are appropriate.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                        TRANSFERS OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS

     Section 8.1 Transfers of Membership Shares.
                 ------------------------------

     (a) Generally.
         ---------

          (i) Except as contemplated by Section 3.7 hereof, no Member or
     Securityholder may, at any time, directly or indirectly, assign, transfer,
     sell, exchange, syndicate, lien, encumber, pledge, or hypothecate
     (collectively, a "Transfer") all or any portion of its Membership Shares,
     or any direct or indirect beneficial or equity interest therein, or in the
     Company (collectively, "Equity Interests") to any Person without the prior
     written consent of the Managing Member, which consent may be granted or
     withheld in the Managing Member's sole discretion, for any reason or no
     reason; provided, however, that any Member or Securityholder who is an
     individual may Transfer all or any portion of such Equity Interest to any
     Permitted Transferee without such prior approval.

          (ii) Any individual Member or Securityholder making such Transfer to a
     Permitted Transferee shall provide written notice thereof to the Managing
     Member within ten (10) days of the Applicable Transfer. It is agreed that
     failure to provide such notice to the Managing Member shall make the
     purported Transfer to the Permitted Transferee void ab initio.

          (iii) With respect to Transfers other than Permitted Transfers, the
     Managing Member may condition its approval of any proposed Transfer of
     Membership Shares upon its receipt from the Member proposing to make such
     Transfer (the "Transferring Member") of a written notice to the Managing
     Member (a "Transfer Notice") detailing all of the material terms of such
     proposed Transfer, including the name of proposed third party transferee or
     lender and the economic benefit to be derived by the Transferring Member
     from such transaction.

          (iv) If a Class B Member Transfers all or any portion of its
     Membership Shares to a Permitted Transferee or with the consent of the
     Managing Member as provided for above, the transferee may be admitted to
     the Company as a Substitute Member in accordance with Section 3.8 hereof.
     If a Transfer of Membership Shares is made in accordance with the
     provisions of this Section 8.1, the Managing Member shall amend Schedule A
     hereto to record the admission of the Additional Member.

     (b) Override on Transfers. Notwithstanding the fact that a Transfer may be
         ---------------------
(or may have been effected) to a Permitted Transferee or may have been approved
by the Managing Member pursuant to this Section 8.1, no Transfer of Membership
Shares shall be permitted if such Transfer (i) violates any applicable law,
including federal or state securities laws or regulations, (ii) causes the
Company to be treated as a "publicly traded partnership" for tax purposes or


                                       15
<PAGE>

(iii) would constitute a Transfer of a Membership Share to a Prohibited Owner,
in which case any such purported Transfer shall be void ab initio.

     Section 8.2 Managing Member Right of First Refusal. In the event that a
                 --------------------------------------
Transferring Member is proposing to sell or assign all or any portion of its
Membership Shares to any Person, such Transferring Member shall deliver a
Transfer Notice to the Managing Member no later than thirty (30) days prior to
the contemplated closing of such sale or assignment. For a period of thirty (30)
days following receipt its receipt of such Transfer Notice, the Managing Member
may exercise a right to purchase all or a portion of the Membership Shares
described in such Transfer Notice on the same terms and conditions as set forth
therein. Managing Member's purchase right shall be exercised by written notice
signed by the Managing Member (the "Managing Member Notice") and delivered to
such Transferring Member. The Managing Member shall effect the purchase of the
Transferring Member's Membership Shares, including payment of the purchase
price, not more than thirty (30) days after delivery of the Managing Member
Notice, and at such time the Transferring Member shall sell to the Company the
Membership Shares free and clear of any liens or encumbrances and shall execute
such documentation as the Managing Member may reasonably propose in connection
with such sale. Upon the purchase by the Managing Member of Membership Shares
pursuant to this Section 8.2, such Membership Shares shall be owned for all
purposes by the Managing Member (who may make such acquired Membership Shares
available for issuance pursuant to Section 3.7 hereof) and the resulting
Percentage Interests of the remaining Members shall be amended accordingly.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                    DISSOLUTION, LIQUIDATION AND TERMINATION

     Section 9.1 Dissolution.
                 -----------

          (a) The Company shall dissolve, and its affairs shall be wound up,
     only upon the written consent of the Managing Member.

          (b) The Company shall not be dissolved by the admission of Additional
     Members or Substitute Members in accordance with the terms of this
     Agreement.

     Section 9.2 Liquidation. Upon dissolution of the Company, the Managing
                 -----------
Member shall carry out the winding up of the Company and shall immediately
commence to wind up the Company's affairs; provided, however, that (i) the
Managing Member shall have all of the powers set forth in Section 18-803(b) of
the Act during the period of the winding up of the Company's affairs and (ii) a
reasonable time shall be allowed for the orderly liquidation of the assets of
the Company and the satisfaction of liabilities to creditors so as to enable the
Managing Member to minimize the normal losses attendant upon a liquidation. The
Members shall continue to share in profits and losses of the Company during
liquidation in the same proportions, as specified in Section 4.1 hereof, as
before liquidation, provided that allocations of profits, losses and items
thereof shall be made in a manner that results in the capital account balance
(as described in Treasury Regulation 1.704-1(b)) of each Member is equal to the
distribution to be made to such Member pursuant to Section 9.3(c). The proceeds
of liquidation shall be distributed in the following order and priority:


                                       16
<PAGE>

          (a) first, to creditors of the Company, including Members who are
     creditors, to the extent otherwise permitted by law, in satisfaction of the
     liabilities of the Company (whether by payment or the making of reasonable
     provision for payment thereof); and

          (b) thereafter, to the Members, pro rata in proportion to their
     respective Percentage Interests.

     Section 9.3 Termination. The Company shall terminate when all of the assets
                 -----------
of the Company, after payment of or due provision for all debts, liabilities and
obligations of the Company, shall have been distributed to the Members in the
manner provided for in this Article IX and the certificate of formation shall
have been canceled in the manner required by the Act.

     Section 9.4 Claims of the Members. Upon dissolution of the Company, the
                 ---------------------
Members shall look solely to the Company's assets for the return of their
capital contributions, and if the assets of the Company remaining after payment
of or due provision for all debts, liabilities and obligations of the Company
are insufficient to return such capital contributions, the Members shall have no
recourse against the Company or any other Member.

                                   ARTICLE X
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     Section 10.1 Separability of Provisions. Each provision of this Agreement
                  --------------------------
shall be considered separable and if for any reason any provision or provisions
herein are determined to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal under any existing
or future law, such invalidity, unenforceability or illegality shall not impair
the operation of or affect those portions of this Agreement which are valid,
enforceable and legal.

     Section 10.2 Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendment or joinder
                  ------------
hereto may be executed in any number of counterparts and by facsimile, each of
which, when taken together, shall be deemed an original of this Agreement and
one and the same Agreement.

     Section 10.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire
                  ----------------
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and supersedes all prior understandings or agreements between the parties.

     Section 10.4 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
                  -------------
construed under, the laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to the
conflict of laws principles of such State).

     Section 10.5 Arbitration.
                  -----------

          (a) Any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to
     this Agreement, including any alleged breach or threatened breach of the
     provisions contained in this Agreement, will, upon demand of a party to the
     controversy, claim, or dispute, be resolved timely by arbitration held in
     New York, New York, and administered by the American Arbitration
     Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
     the AAA and, to the maximum extent applicable, pursuant to the Federal
     Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq.

                                       17
<PAGE>

          (b) An award rendered in any such proceeding shall be final, binding,
     and non-appealable, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having
     competent jurisdiction. With respect to a controversy, claim or dispute in
     which the claim or amount in controversy does not exceed $100,000, a single
     arbitrator will be impaneled, who will be chosen by the AAA and have
     authority to render a maximum award of $100,000, including all damages of
     any kind and costs, fees, interest and the like. With respect to a

     exceeds $100,000, the dispute will be decided by a majority vote of three
     arbitrators, each of whom shall be selected by the AAA. All arbitrators
     will be knowledgeable in the subject matter of the dispute.

          (c) The arbitrator(s) may grant any remedy or relief they deem just

     at law or in equity (in which case the party receiving such relief may
     apply to the court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement of such
     provisional or injunctive order, without prejudice to the continued
     arbitration of the matter); provided, however, that the AAA may, upon the
     demand of any party to the controversy, claim, or dispute, administratively
     appoint a single "provisional relief" arbitrator on an expedited basis to
     consider any request for, and grant, such provisional or injunctive remedy;
     and, provided further, that the arbitrators shall award reasonable
     attorneys' fees and expenses to the prevailing party. The arbitrators will
     resolve all disputes in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.
     The arbitrators will make specific, written findings of fact and
     conclusions of law. The arbitrators' findings of fact will be binding on
     all parties and will not be subject to further review.

                  --------

                  ----------
supplemented or amended in any manner only with the approval of the Managing
Member. Any administrative alteration to Schedule A hereto (i.e., correcting a

     Class B Shares under any state or federal law, or under the rulings or

          (iii) The lapse of such reasonable period of time following the

     reasons of administrative convenience;

          (iv) The receipt by the Company of full payment for such Class B

                                       5
<PAGE>

          (v) The Holder's execution of a Joinder Agreement or similar
     instrument (the form of which shall be determined by the Board) whereby the
     Holder agrees to the terms and conditions of the Operating Agreement.

     (d) Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider. If a Holder ceases
         -------------------------------------------------
to be a Director, Officer, Employee or Consultant other than by reason of the
Holder's disability or death, such Holder may exercise his or her Option within
such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement to the extent that
the Option is vested on the date of termination. In the absence of a specified
time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for three (3)
months following the Holder's termination. If, on the date of termination, the
Holder is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Class B Shares covered
by the unvested portion of the Option immediately cease to be issuable under the
Option and shall again become available for issuance under the Plan. If, after
termination, the Holder does not exercise his or her Option within the time
period specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Class B Shares
covered by such Option shall again become available for issuance under the Plan.

     (e) Disability of Holder. If a Holder ceases to be a Director, Officer,
         --------------------
Employee or Consultant as a result of the Holder's disability, as such term is
defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code, or, in the case of a Consultant which
is an entity, the bankruptcy or dissolution of such Consultant, the Holder may
exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the
Option Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination.
In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall
remain exercisable for three (3) years following the occurrence of the Holder's
disability, bankruptcy or dissolution, as the case may be. If, on the date of
disability, bankruptcy or dissolution, the Holder is not vested as to his or her
entire Option, the Class B Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option
shall immediately cease to be issuable under the Option and shall again become
available for issuance under the Plan. If, after disability, bankruptcy or
dissolution, the Holder does not exercise his or her Option within the time
specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Class B Shares covered by
such Option shall again become available for issuance under the Plan.

     (f) Death of Holder. If a Holder dies while still acting as a Director,
         ---------------
Officer, Employee or Consultant, the Option may be exercised within such period
of time as is specified in the Option Agreement, by the Holder's estate or by a
person who acquires the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance,
but only to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death. In the
absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain
exercisable for three (3) years following the Holder's death. If, at the time of
death, the Holder is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Class B
Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall immediately cease to
be issuable under the Option and shall again become available for issuance under
the Plan. The Option may be exercised by the executor or Board of the Holder's
estate or, if none, by the person(s) entitled to exercise the Option under the
Holder's will or the laws of descent or distribution. If the Option is not so
exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the
Class B Shares covered by such Option shall again become available for issuance
under the Plan.


                                       6
<PAGE>

     (g) Buyout Provisions. The Board may at any time offer to buyout for a
         -----------------
payment in cash or Class B Shares, an Option previously granted, based on such
terms and conditions as the Board shall establish and communicate to the Holder
at the time that such offer is made.

     11. Non-Transferability of Options. Except as otherwise provided in this
         ------------------------------
Section 11, Options may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated,
transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of
descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Holder,
only by the Holder. A Holder may transfer an Option to a partnership or trust
solely benefiting the holder or immediate family members, or to an inter vivos
or testamentary trust from which the option or underlying class b shares will be
transferred after the holder's death.

     12. Adjustments Upon Changes In Capitalization, Merger or Asset Sale.
         ----------------------------------------------------------------

     (a) In the event that the Board determines that any distribution (whether
in the form of cash, Class B Shares, other securities or other property),
recapitalization, reclassification, Membership Share split, reverse Membership
Share split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off,
combination, repurchase, liquidation, dissolution, or sale, transfer, exchange
or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company,
or exchange of Membership Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of
warrants or other rights to purchase Class B Shares or other securities of the
Company, or other similar corporate transaction or event, in the Board's sole
discretion, affects the Class B Shares such that an adjustment is determined by
the Board to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the
benefits or potential benefits intended by the Company to be made available
under the Plan or with respect to any Option, then the Board shall, in such
manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of:

          (i) the number and kind of Class B Shares (or other securities or
     property) with respect to which Options Class B Shares may be granted or
     awarded (including, but not limited to, adjustments of the limitations in

     14. Amendment and Termination of the Plan.
         -------------------------------------

     (c) Amendment and Termination. The Board may at any time wholly or
         -------------------------
partially amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.

     (d) Effect of Amendment or Termination. No amendment, alteration,
         ----------------------------------
suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Holder,
unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Holder and the Board, which
agreement must be in writing and signed by the Holder and the Company.
Termination of the Plan shall not affect the Board's ability to exercise the
powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Options granted or awarded under
the Plan prior to the date of such termination.

     15. Inability to Obtain Authority. The inability of the Company to obtain
         -----------------------------
authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is
deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale
of any Class B Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in
respect of the failure to issue or sell such Class B Shares as to which such
requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

     16. Right to Issue of Class B Shares. The Board, during the term of this
         --------------------------------
Plan, shall at all times maintain the right to issue such number of Class B
Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

     17. Investment Intent. The Board may require a Holder, as a condition of
         -----------------
exercising any Option, (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Board
as to the Holder's knowledge and experience in financial and business matters
and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably satisfactory to the
company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial and business matters
and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the
purchaser representative, the merits and risks of exercising the Option, (ii) to
give written assurances satisfactory to the Board stating that the Holder is
acquiring the Class B Shares subject to the Option for the Holder's own account
and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the
Class B Shares and (iii) that the Class B Shares are subject to the restrictions
of transfer contained in the Operating Agreement. The foregoing requirements,
and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, shall be inoperative if
as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the
company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the
then applicable securities laws.

     18. Governing Law. The validity and enforceability of this Plan shall be
         -------------
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware
(including the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware (6 Del.
C.ss.18-101, et seq.), as amended from time to time), without regard to
otherwise governing principles of conflicts of law.
