          (b) There are no material liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of
     American Equity as of December 31,2001 not reflected in the Annual
     Statement of American Equity as of said date referred to in clause (i) of
     paragraph (a). Since said date, there has been no change in the financial
     condition, operations, business or prospects of American Equity from that
     set forth in the Financial Statements as at said date, other than changes
     in the ordinary course of business which have not, either individually or
     in the aggregate, been materially adverse to the financial condition,
     operations, business or prospects of American Equity.

          (c) American Equity has prior to the execution and delivery of this
     Agreement delivered to AEISC a copy of the forms of the Commission
     Agreements and the Eligible Contracts.

     5.03 LITIGATION; OBSERVANCE OF STATUTES, REGULATIONS AND ORDERS. There are
no legal or arbitral proceedings or any proceedings by or before any court,
arbitrator or Governmental Body, now pending or (to the knowledge of American
Equity) threatened against American Equity which, if adversely determined, could

operations, business or prospects of American Equity.

          American Equity is not in default under any Order of any court,
arbitrator or Governmental Body. American Equity is not in violation of any
statute or other rule or regulation of any Governmental Body the violation of
which could be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, operation, business or prospects of American Equity.

     5.04 NO BREACH. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
consummation of the transactions herein contemplated nor the compliance with the
terms and provisions hereof will conflict with or result in a breach of, or
require any consent under, the charter or by-laws of American Equity, or any
statute, other rule or regulation or any Order of any Governmental Body, or any
agreement or instrument to which American Equity is a party or by which it is
bound or to which it is subject, or constitute a default under any such
agreement or instrument, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien

any such agreement or instrument.

and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement; the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement has been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on its part, and this
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by American Equity
and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable in
accordance with its terms.

     5.06 APPROVALS. Except for the reports required under Chapter 521A of the
Iowa Code (2002) applicable to Insurance Holding Company Systems, no
authorization, approvals or consents of, and no filings or registrations with,
any Governmental Body are necessary for the execution, delivery or performance
by American Equity of this

                                       10
<Page>

Agreement or for the validity and enforceability thereof.

     5.07 ERISA. No employee benefit plan established or maintained by American
Equity or to which American Equity has made contributions, which is subject to
Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title 1 of ERISA, or Section 412 of the Code, including,
without limitation, to the knowledge of American Equity, any Multiemployer Plan,
has an accumulated funding deficiency (as such term is defined in Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), or had such a deficiency as of the last day
of the most recent fiscal year of such plan heretofore ended, and each such plan
is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code and any applicable federal or state law. No liability to PBGC
(other than required insurance premiums, all of which have been paid when due)
has been incurred with respect to any such plan and there has not been any
reportable event within the meaning of ERISA, or any other event or condition,
which presents a material risk of termination of any such plan by PBGC. To the
knowledge of American Equity after due inquiry, neither any such plan nor any
trust created thereunder, nor any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged
in a prohibited transaction (as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the
Code) nor will the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute such a
prohibited transaction, in any such case that could subject any such plan,
trust, trustee (to the extent indemnified by American Equity), administrator or
American Equity to any tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed under
Section 4975 or ERISA or by Section 502(i) of ERISA which could have a material
adverse effect on the business, operations or properties of American Equity. No
liability has been incurred by American Equity with respect to any Multiemployer
Plan, within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA as a result of the
complete or partial withdrawal by American Equity from such Multiemployer Plan
under Section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA that could have a material adverse effect on
the business, operations or properties of American Equity; nor has American
Equity been notified by any such Multiemployer Plan that such Multiemployer Plan
is in reorganization or insolvency under and within the meaning of Section 4241
or 4245 of ERISA or that such Multiemployer Plan intends to terminate or has
been terminated under Section 4041A or ERISA.

     5.08 TAXES. American Equity has filed all United States Federal income tax
returns and all other tax returns that are required to have been filed in any
jurisdiction. American Equity has paid all taxes due pursuant to such returns
before they have become delinquent and pursuant to any assessment received by
American Equity. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of American
Equity in respect of taxes and other governmental charges are, in the opinion of
American Equity, adequate.

     5.09 INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. American Equity is not an "investment
company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment company," within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     5.10 PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT. American Equity is not a "holding
company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of
"holding company," within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, as amended.
