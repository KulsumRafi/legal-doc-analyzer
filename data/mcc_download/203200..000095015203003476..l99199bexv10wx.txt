                                                                    2002/6/20R

                          DVD PATENT LICENSE AGREEMENT


         This DVD PATENT LICENSE AGREEMENT is made between Toshiba Corporation
("Licensor"), a Japanese corporation having its principal place of business at
1-1, Shibaura 1-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8001, Japan, under authorization of
the members of the DVD Patent Licensing Group (or "Group", as listed in Exhibit
1 hereto, as may be amended from time to time by Licensor), and Metatec
International, Inc. ("Licensee"), a Ohio corporation having its principal place
of business at 7001 Metatec Boulevard, Dublin, OH 43017, USA, and is effective
as of December 31, 2002 (the "Effective Date").

         WHEREAS, members of the Group have been engaged in the research and
development of systems in which data encoded in digital form and stored on a
disc are read and outputted (whether as data or signals) by means of devices
using an optical read-out beam (such systems, the "DVD Systems"); and

         WHEREAS, members of the Group and others have defined standards for the
DVD Systems, including standards for the production and use of DVD products
constituting the DVD Systems and providing for the interoperability of such DVD
products; and

         WHEREAS, members of the Group own valuable patents (and patent
applications) that are Essential (hereinafter defined) to make, use and sell DVD
Products (as defined in Exhibit 3 hereto), as listed in Exhibit 2 hereto (the
"DVD Patents," as more specifically defined in Exhibit 3 hereto); and

         WHEREAS, members of the Group believe that a non-exclusive joint
licensing program, under which licensees can obtain access to as many Essential
patents as possible in one transaction, is an efficient method for licensing DVD
Patents for the benefit of licensees and the public, and have granted Licensor
the right to grant such licenses with respect to the DVD Patents on their behalf
to licensees that wish to make, use or sell DVD Products; and

         WHEREAS, Licensee wishes to obtain a license under the DVD Patents to
make, use and sell the DVD Products;

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:


                                    ARTICLE 1
                                ADDITIONAL TERMS

         1.1 In addition to the terms set forth herein, this Agreement shall

forth in Exhibit 3 hereto. Terms not defined herein shall have the meaning
ascribed to them in the Conditions, and vice versa.

otherwise dispose of DVD Products under the DVD Patents or any of their claims
pursuant to the Conditions of Exhibit 3.

    2.1.A DVD Players and DVD Decoders (as defined in Article 1 of

customers from any and all claims of infringement of the DVD Patents arising
from Licensee's or its Affiliates' manufacture, use, sale, or disposal by other
means of DVD Products for the period prior to the Effective Date of this
Agreement pursuant to the Conditions of Exhibit 3.

         2.3 Instead of dealing with Licensor to obtain licenses for DVD Patents
of the members of the Group, Licensee shall have the option to negotiate and
take a license under any DVD Patents and other related patents owned by each
member of the Group pursuant to separate negotiations with each of the members
on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, whether or not Licensee
intends to manufacture and/or sell DVD Products in conformity with the DVD
Standard Specifications.

         2.4 IT IS EXPRESSLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE RIGHTS AND LICENSES GRANTED
PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT DO NOT EXTEND TO ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE RIGHTS

Affiliates and each of the other licensees of Licensor under the DVD Patents, a
non-exclusive license to and release from any and all claims of infringement of
any patents that are or become Essential to make, use, or sell DVD Products and

reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms.

         3.2 Licensor shall have the right to terminate the license granted
herein under any of the DVD Patents owned by any member of the Group in the

sold by any member of the Group infringes any patent(s) that are Essential to
make, use, or sell DVD Products in a lawsuit or other proceeding against the
member of the Group, and Licensee has refused to grant such member of the Group
a license on fair and reasonable terms and conditions under such patents upon
which the lawsuit or other proceeding is based for the manufacture, use or sale
of DVD Products. In the event that any dispute arises between Licensee and
Licensor or any other member of the Group as to determination of the fair and
reasonable terms and conditions and cannot be settled between

more non-DVD Player product(s) or component(s) ("Non-DVD Player Product") (each
such single product, a "Combination Product") shall be the greater of (a) US
$4.00 or (b) 4% of the amount calculated under sub-clause (1) or (2) below:

     (1)  in the event that a DVD Player incorporated into a Combination Product
          is substantially similar to a DVD Player that Licensee or Licensee's
          Affiliates manufacture and sell independently of the Combination
          Product, the Net Selling Price of such independently sold,
          substantially similar DVD Player; or

     (2)  in the event that sub-clause (1) does not apply, the product of the
          following formula:

          NSP x [A + C x {A / (A + B)}] / (A+B+C)

                    where

                    A = the material cost of a DVD Player incorporated in a
                    Combination Product;

                    B = the material cost of a Non-DVD Player Product
                    incorporated in such Combination Product;

                    C = the material cost of the portion of such Combination
                    Product that is common to such DVD Player and such Non-DVD
                    Player Product, including, without limitation, the power
                    supply and cabinet; and

                    NSP = the Net Selling Price of such Combination Product.


         2.5 Upon termination of this Agreement, royalties shall be due and
payable with respect to all DVD Products made by, or made for, Licensee but not
yet sold or transferred.

         2.6 Within forty-five (45) days after March 31, June 30, September 30,
and December 31 of each year during the period this Agreement shall be in force
and effect, Licensee hereby undertakes to submit to Licensor, even if it makes
no sales of DVD Products, a statement in writing setting forth with respect to
the preceding quarterly period:


<PAGE>


     (1)  The quantities of DVD Products manufactured (or manufactured for) and
          sold by Licensee and its Affiliates, for each product type of DVD
          Products in the case of DVD Players and DVD Decoders sold; and

     (2)  the trademarks or trade names used on or in connection with the DVD
          Products sold, if any; and

     (3)  a computation of the royalties due under this Agreement.

Licensee shall pay Licensor in the manner and to the account Licensor may
indicate, and within ninety (90) days after the end of each quarterly period,
the royalty due hereunder. All royalties shall be calculated and paid, exclusive
of any taxes or other levies (except withholding taxes imposed by the governing
body of Licensee's domicile), which shall be borne by Licensee. With respect to
withholding taxes imposed by the governing body of Licensee's domicile, Licensee
shall pay such taxes and shall be entitled to deduct such taxes from royalties
paid, so long as Licensee provides Licensor with a tax certificate (or
equivalent document) evidencing such payment and/or obligation. Licensee
covenants to pay such taxes in a timely and lawful manner.

         2.7 All payments which are not made on the due date specified in this
Agreement shall accrue interest at the rate of two percent (2%) per month.

         2.8 Licensee agrees to keep accurate books with respect to sales, other
transfers, and royalties, and to permit Licensor to audit those books no more
than once annually. Such audits may cover the three year period preceding the
audit. Such audits shall be conducted by an independent auditor hired by
Licensor, and the costs thereof shall be borne by Licensor, except that if any
such audit should reveal an underpayment of royalties due hereunder of greater
than 3% for any period audited, Licensee shall bear the costs of such audit, as
well as pay the discrepancy.

                                    ARTICLE 3
                           LIMITATION ON LICENSE GRANT

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.1 of this Agreement or any
other provision of this Agreement or of the Exhibits to this Agreement, no
licenses are granted under this Agreement for the sale, or other disposition of
either (a) DVD Products that are not Ready-to-Use Products or (b) DVD-ROM Drives
or DVD-Decoders that will ultimately be incorporated into DVD-Products other
than personal computers. DVD-ROM Drives or DVD-Decoders that will ultimately be
incorporated into DVD-Products other than personal computers shall only be
manufactured subject to licenses granted to the manufacturers of such DVD
Products (including, as applicable, subject to such manufacturers' "have made"
rights under such licenses); therefore the royalty shall be due on such
subsequently manufactured DVD Product. If, for any reason, a royalty is paid for
such a DVD-ROM Drive or DVD-Decoder, the manufacturer of such subsequently
manufactured DVD Product shall be entitled to subtract a credit for any royalty
already paid (and not refunded) on such DVD-ROM Drive or DVD-Decoder.

                                    ARTICLE 4
                                 CONFIDENTIALITY

Licensee and Licensee's Affiliates and Licensor agree that the royalty reports
required under Article 2.6 of this Exhibit 3, including competitively sensitive
information such as sales volume and selling prices of particular models of DVD
Products contained in such royalty reports, shall be deemed Licensee's

<PAGE>

"Confidential Information" and shall be sent only to employees of Licensor who
are involved in licensing and accounting activities and who are not involved in
the business of selling or developing DVD Products. Such Confidential
Information shall be kept confidential by said employees and shall not be
disclosed by Licensor or its employees to members of the DVD Patent Licensing
Group or to third parties to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Licensee agrees that members of the DVD Patent Licensing Group may have access
to the information contained in such reports regarding the names of licensees,
categories and model numbers of licensed products, total quantities of sales of
such products and total royalties due under this Agreement.
