Massachusetts 02062 ("CorpSoft") and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Intraware,&nbsp;Inc.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, with offices at 25 Orinda Way, Orinda, CA 94563 ("Intraware"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>WHEREAS,
CorpSoft, a leading international reseller of computer software, software licenses, software asset management services, intends to enter into an agreement with Sun Microsystems authorizing
CorpSoft to resell Sun's iPlanet software products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>WHEREAS,
Intraware has experience and expertise in the sale of the iPlanet products to end user customers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>WHEREAS,
Corpsoft and Intraware agree that both parties will benefit by forming a sales alliance whereby Intraware will obtain purchase orders for sales of the iPlanet products to end users and
CorpSoft will process and fulfill such iPlanet orders. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>NOW
THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and the terms, conditions and covenants of this Agreement, the parties hereby agree as follows. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITIONS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Confidential
Information" shall have the same meaning as the term is defined in the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated May&nbsp;10, 2001, between CorpSoft and
Intraware, subject to Section&nbsp;10.1 below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qualified
Customer" shall mean a customer who has been evaluated by the Director of CorpSoft Accounts Receivable or a designee and approved for business, based on written standards
which are provided to Intraware, are reasonable, and impose restrictions no more stringent than those which apply to customer qualification in CorpSoft's software reselling business. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qualified
Order" shall mean an order from a Qualified Customer for iPlanet that meets the terms of the CorpSoft's standard written order acceptance policy, which policy shall be
provided to Intraware, shall be reasonable, and shall impose restrictions no more stringent than those which apply to order acceptance in any other area of CorpSoft's business. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Territory"
shall mean the same geographic area as is set forth in the iPlanet Agreement. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCOPE  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intraware
has experience and expertise in the sale of Sun Microsystems ("Sun") iPlanet E-Commerce Solutions products ("iPlanet") and, as a result, has an established base
of end user iPlanet customers and iPlanet customer prospects in the Territory. Subject to the success of the relationship contemplated hereby, Intraware currently intends to phase out of the business
of reselling iPlanet. CorpSoft intends to enter into a reseller agreement ("iPlanet Agreement") with Sun authorizing CorpSoft to market and resell iPlanet, and to the extent applicable, successor
products to iPlanet, in the Territory. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CorpSoft
agrees to retain the services of Intraware's sales representatives to obtain purchase orders for iPlanet to Qualified Customers in the Territory as set forth herein.
Intraware will refer its existing iPlanet customers and all of its iPlanet customer prospects to CorpSoft. For the duration of this Agreement, it is the intention of CorpSoft and Intraware that each
party benefit and share equally in the operating profits and losses (as specified in the "Operating Income" line in Exhibit&nbsp;C hereto) resulting from the sales alliance herein. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CorpSoft

to pursue any other business opportunities or interests. </FONT></P>

inform their respective employees of such. Neither party shall represent or imply, directly or indirectly, that it has the authority to represent or bind the other by contract or in any way to incur
obligations of any kind on behalf of the other party or take any action that would lead any person to believe the party has such authority, provided, however, that Intraware, in the course of
performing its obligations under this Agreement, may submit binding quotes to customers for sales of iPlanet, so long as such quotes to do not require CorpSoft to act in a manner inconsistent with its
written customer qualification standards or its written order acceptance policy referred to in Sections 1.2 and 1.3 above, respectively</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>.</B></FONT></P>
