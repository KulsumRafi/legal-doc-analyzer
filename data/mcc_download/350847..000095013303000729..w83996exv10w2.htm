</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT </B>(the <B>&#147;Agreement&#148;</B>) is entered into as of
this 19th day of November, 2002, by and between Riggs National Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the <B>&#147;Company&#148;</B>), and Steven T. Tamburo&nbsp;(<B>&#147;Indemnitee&#148;</B>).

<P align="center"><FONT size="2"><B>RECITALS</B>
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The Company is aware that because of the increased exposure to
litigation costs and risks resulting from service to corporations, talented and
experienced persons are increasingly reluctant to serve or continue serving as
directors or executive officers of corporations unless they are protected by
comprehensive liability insurance and indemnification;
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Plaintiffs often seek damages in such large amounts, and the costs of
litigation may be so great (whether or not the case is meritorious), that the
defense and/or settlement of such litigation is usually beyond the personal
resources of directors and executive officers;
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Based upon their experience as business managers, the Board of
Directors of the Company (the <B>&#147;Board&#148;</B>) has concluded that, to retain and
attract talented and experienced individuals to serve as directors and
executive officers of the Company, it is appropriate for the Company to
contractually indemnify its directors and its executive officers, and to assume
for itself liability for expenses and damages in connection with claims against
such directors and executive officers in connection with their service to the
Company; and
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The Company believes that it is fair and proper to protect its
directors and executive officers from the risk of judgments, settlements and
other liabilities and expenses that may occur as a result of their service to
the Company.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NOW, THEREFORE, </B>the parties, intending to be legally bound, for good and
valuable consideration, hereby agree as follows:
</FONT>

or a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another
domestic or foreign corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise serving at the request, for the convenience, or to represent the
interests of the Company.

sought from the Company under this Agreement, deliver written notice to the
Company of the commencement or threat of commencement thereof, provided that

such defense, (ii)&nbsp;obtains approval from Indemnitee of its proposed counsel and

incurred by Indemnitee with respect to such Proceeding, unless (x)&nbsp;the
Liabilities incurred by Indemnitee were previously authorized by the Company or

on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any Proceeding referred to in

Indemnitee in connection with any other Proceeding between the Company and

the Board who were directors immediately prior to such Change of Control, then,
with respect to all matters thereafter arising concerning the rights of
Indemnitee to payments of Liabilities under this Agreement or any other
agreement or under the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company,

behalf of Indemnitee and all persons who are the beneficiaries of
indemnification agreements with the Company similar to this Agreement by a
committee consisting of those persons who were members of the Board immediately
prior to such Change of Control and who are no longer serving on the Board, and
such selection shall be approved by the Company, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The Independent Legal Counsel, among other things,
shall render its written opinion to the Company and Indemnitee as to whether
and to what extent Indemnitee would be permitted to be indemnified under
applicable law. The Company agrees to abide by such opinion and to pay the
reasonable fees of the Independent Legal Counsel referred to above and to fully
indemnify the Independent Legal Counsel against any and all expenses (including
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees), claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto.
