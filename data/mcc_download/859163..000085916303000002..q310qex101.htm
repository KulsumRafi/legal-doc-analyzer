<P ALIGN="CENTER">NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' STOCK OPTION PLAN</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">AS AMENDED FEBRUARY 4, 2003</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Adjusted for June 1, 2000 2-for-1 stock split)</P>
</B>
<P>&#9;1.  <U>Adoption and Purpose.</U>  The AVX Corporation (the "Company") hereby adopts the AVX Corporation Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") to secure for the Company and its stockholders the benefits of the incentive inherent in increased common stock ownership by the members of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company who are not employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (a "Non-Employee Director").</P>

<P>&#9;2.  <U>Administration.</U>  The Plan shall be administered by the Board.  The Board shall have all the powers vested in it by the terms of the Plan, such powers to include authority (within the limitations described herein) to prescribe the form of the agreement embodying awards of stock options made under the Plan (the "Options") and the power to determine the restrictions, if any, on the ability of participants to earn-out and to dispose of any stock issued in connection with the exercise of any Options granted pursuant to the Plan.  The Board shall, subject to the provisions of the Plan, have the power to interpret the Plan and to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan as it may deem desirable.  Any decisions of the Board in the administration of the Plan, as described herein, shall be final and conclusive.  The Board may authorize any one or more of their number (each, a "Director") or the Secretary or any other officer of the Company to execute and deliver documents on behalf of the Board.  The Board hereby authorizes the Secretary to execute and deliver all documents to be delivered by the Board pursuant to the Plan.  No member of the Board shall be liable for anything done or omitted to be done by such member or by any other member of the Board in connection with the Plan, except for such member's own willful misconduct or as expressly provided by statute.</P>

<P>&#9;3.  <U>Shares Subject to Plan.</U>  The stock which may be issued and sold under the Plan will be the Common Stock (par value $0.01 per share) of the Company.  The total amount of stock for which Options may be granted under the Plan shall not exceed 650,000 shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment as provided in Paragraph 6 below.  The stock to be issued may be either authorized and unissued shares or shares held by the Company in its treasury.  Shares that by reason of the expiration of an option or otherwise are no longer subject to purchase pursuant to an Option granted under the Plan may be reoffered under the Plan.</P>

<P>&#9;4.  <U>Participants.</U>  Each Non-Employee Director shall be eligible to receive an Option in accordance with Paragraph 5 below.  </P>

<P>&#9;5.  <U>Terms and Conditions of Options.</U>  Each Option granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an agreement in such form as the Board shall prescribe from time to time in accordance with the Plan, and shall comply with the following terms and conditions:</P>

<P>&#9;7.  <U>Nonexclusive Plan.</U>  Neither the adoption of the Plan by the Board nor the submission of the Plan to the stockholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it may deem desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of stock options otherwise than under the Plan, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.</P>

<P>&#9;8.  <U>Section 16 Persons.</U>  Transactions under the Plan are intended to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3 or its successors under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").  To the extent any provision of the Plan or action by the Committee fails to so comply, it shall be deemed null and void, to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Committee.</P>

<P>&#9;9.  <U>Nonassignability.</U>  Options may not be transferred other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  During a Director's lifetime, options granted to a Director may be exercised only by the Director or by his or her guardian or legal representative.</P>

<P>&#9;10.  <U>Amendment or Discontinuance.</U>  The Plan may be amended or discontinued by the Board without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, except that (a) stockholder approval shall be required for any amendment that would (i) increase (except as provided in Section 6 hereof) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock for which Options may be granted under the Plan, (ii) change the class of persons eligible to participate in the Plan or (iii) adopt any other amendments to the Plan that are considered material for purposes of Rule 16b-3(b) under the Exchange Act and (b) to the extent required by Rule 16b-3 under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in effect from time to time, Plan provisions relating to the amount, price and timing of Options shall not be amended more than once every six months, except to comply with changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or the rules thereunder in effect from time to time.  No termination, modification or amendment of the Plan may, without the consent of the Director to whom any Option shall theretofore have been granted, adversely affect the rights of such Director (or his or her transferee) under such Option.</P>

<P>&#9;11.  <U>Effect of Plan.</U>  Neither the adoption of the Plan nor any action of the Board shall be deemed to give any Non-Employee Director any right to be granted an option to purchase Common Stock or any other rights except as may be evidenced by a stock option agreement, or any amendment thereto, duly authorized by the Board and executed on behalf of the Company, and then only to the extent and on the terms and conditions expressly set forth therein.</P>

<P>&#9;12.  <U>Term.</U>  Unless sooner terminated by action of the Board, this Plan will terminate on August 1, 2005.  The Board may not grant Options under the Plan after that date, but Options granted before that date will continue to be effective in accordance with their terms.</P>

<P>&#9;13.  <U>Effectiveness; Approval of Stockholders.</U>  The Plan shall take effect upon its adoption by the Board, but its effectiveness and the exercise of any options shall be subject to the approval of the holders of a majority of the voting shares of the Company, which approval must occur within twelve months after the date on which the Plan is adopted by the Board.</P>

<P>&#9;14.  <U>Withholding Taxes.</U>  If the Board shall so require, as a condition of exercise, each Non-Employee Director shall agree that (a) no later than the date of exercise of any Option, such Non-Employee Director will pay to the Company or make arrangements satisfactory to the Board regarding payment of any Federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld upon the exercise of such option (any such tax, a "Withholding Tax"); and (b) the Company shall, to the extent permitted or required by law, have the right to deduct from any payment of any kind otherwise due to such Non-Employee Director, any such Withholding Tax.</P></DIR>
