<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
Ladies and Gentlemen:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">It is presently proposed that Sears
Roebuck Acceptance Corp. (&quot;<u>SRAC</u>&quot;) enter into a 364-Day Credit
Agreement dated the date hereof (the &quot;<u>Credit Agreement</u>&quot;) with
the Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and Citibank, N.A., as
administrative agent. Subject to the provisions contained in the Credit
Agreement, SRAC will be required, among other things, to maintain a Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for any fiscal quarter of
not less than 1.15 and has, as a condition to the effectiveness of the Credit
Agreement, agreed that Sears, Roebuck and Co. (&quot;<u>Sears</u>&quot;) will
continue to own and hold all legal title to and beneficial interest in all of
the outstanding voting stock of SRAC, Sears will maintain a ratio of EBITDA (as
defined below) to Interest (as defined below) of not less than 3.0 and Sears
will not create or suffer to exist, Liens (as defined in the Credit Agreement)
other than as set forth in this letter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">This is to confirm our agreement
(&quot;<u>Credit Agreement Support Letter</u>&quot;) that, so long as amounts
owing by SRAC under the Credit Agreement have not been paid or any Lender shall
have any commitment to lend under the Credit Agreement, Sears will:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(a) pay SRAC such amounts which,
  together with any other earnings available to SRAC therefor, are sufficient
  for SRAC to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for any fiscal quarter of
  not less than 1.15 to 1 as long as SRAC is required by the provisions of the
  Credit Agreement to maintain such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(b) continue to own and to hold all
  legal title to and beneficial interest in all of the outstanding voting stock
  of SRAC as long as the failure of Sears to own and hold such voting stock
  would constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement,</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(c) maintain, as of the end of each
  fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated EBITDA of Sears and its subsidiaries
  for the four fiscal quarters then ended to Interest of Sears and its
  subsidiaries during such period of not less than 3.0 to 1,</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(d) not create or suffer to exist, or
  permit any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (other than SRAC) to create or
  suffer to exist, any Lien on or with respect to any of its properties, whether
  now owned or hereafter acquired, or assign, or permit any of its subsidiaries
  to assign, any right to receive income, other than:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(i) Permitted Liens (as defined in
    the Credit Agreement),</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(ii) additional purchase money
    Liens upon or in any real property or equipment acquired or held by Sears or
    any subsidiary in the ordinary course of business to secure the purchase
    price of such property or equipment or to secure Debt (as defined in the
    Credit Agreement) incurred solely for the purpose of financing the
    acquisition of such property or equipment, or Liens existing on such
    property or equipment at the time of its acquisition (other than any such
    Liens created in contemplation of such acquisition that were not incurred to
    finance the acquisition of such property) or extensions, renewals or
    replacements of any of the foregoing for the same or a lesser amount, <u>provided</u>,
    <u>however</u>, that no such Lien shall extend to or cover any properties of
    any character other than the real property or equipment being acquired, and
    no such extension, renewal or replacement shall extend to or cover any
    properties not theretofore subject to the Lien being extended, renewed or
    replaced, <u>provided</u> <u>further</u> that the aggregate principal amount
    of the indebtedness secured by the additional Liens referred to in this
    clause&nbsp;(ii) shall not exceed $50,000,000 at any time outstanding after
    the Effective Date (as defined in the Credit Agreement),</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(iii) the Liens existing on January
    31, 2003 and described on Schedule&nbsp;I hereto (which shall be delivered
    on or prior to April 1, 2003),</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(iv) Liens on property of an entity
    existing at the time such entity is merged into or consolidated with Sears
    or any subsidiary of Sears or becomes a subsidiary of Sears; <u>provided</u>
    that such Liens were not created in contemplation of such merger,
    consolidation or acquisition and do not extend to any assets other than
    those of the entity so merged into or consolidated with Sears or such
    subsidiary or acquired by Sears or such subsidiary,</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(v) Liens on assets securing
    indebtedness and other obligations calculated as the higher of</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(A) the book value of assets
      (other than accounts receivable) so encumbered as at December 28, 2002 (or
      if such asset was acquired after such date, the book value of such asset
      as of the date of the acquisition thereof) and, in the case of accounts
      receivable, to the face amount thereof, and</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(B) the principal amount of the
      indebtedness secured thereby,</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">in the aggregate at any time of not
    more than $2,300,000,000 <u>plus</u> 85% of the face amount of accounts
    receivable in excess of $32,595,000,000 at any time outstanding in addition

      receivable, to the face amount thereof, and</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(B) the principal amount of the
      indebtedness secured thereby,</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">in the aggregate at any time of not
    more than the amount by which $3,500,000,000 exceeds the aggregate
    commitments of the Lenders under the Credit Agreement at such time in
    addition to the Liens permitted by clauses (i) through (v) of this
    subsection (d), and</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(vii) the replacement, extension or
    renewal of any Lien permitted by clause&nbsp;(iii) or (iv) above upon or in
    the same property theretofore subject thereto or the replacement, extension

    contingent obligor) of the Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) secured
    thereby,</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(e) deliver to SRAC (i) no later than

  within five days after any officer of Sears knows or should have had knowledge
  of the occurrence of each default under this agreement by Sears continuing on
  the date of such statement, a statement of an Authorized Officer of Sears
  setting forth details of such default and the action that Sears has taken and
  proposes to take with respect thereto, and</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">(f) not enter into or suffer to
  exist, or permit any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries to enter into or suffer
  to exist, any agreement prohibiting or conditioning the creation or assumption
  of any Lien upon any of its property or assets except (i) in favor of the
  Agent for the benefit of the Lenders or (ii) in connection with (A) purchase
