arbitrator(s) will have the authority to decide whether any Claim is barred by the statute of limitations and, if so, to dismiss the arbitration on that basis. For
purposes of the application of the statute of limitations, the service on JAMS under applicable JAMS rules of a notice of Claim is the equivalent of the filing of a lawsuit. Any dispute concerning
this arbitration provision or whether a Claim is arbitrable shall be determined by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) shall have the power to award legal fees pursuant to the terms of this

(ii)&nbsp;initiate judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure against any real or personal property collateral; (iii)&nbsp;exercise any judicial or power of sale rights, or (iv)&nbsp;act in a court
of law to obtain an interim remedy, such as but not limited to, injunctive relief, writ of possession or appointment of a receiver, or additional or supplementary remedies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
procedure described above will not apply if the Claim, at the time of the proposed submission to arbitration, arises from or relates to an obligation to the Bank
secured by real property. In this case, both the Borrower and the Bank must consent to submission of the Claim to arbitration. If both parties do not consent to arbitration, the Claim will be resolved
as follows: The Borrower and the Bank will designate a referee (or a panel of referees) selected under the auspices of JAMS in the same manner as arbitrators are selected in JAMS administered
proceedings. The designated referee(s) will be appointed by a court as provided in California Code of Civil Procedure Section&nbsp;638 and the following related sections. The referee (or the
presiding referee of the panel) will be an active attorney or a retired judge. The award that results from the decision of the referee(s) will be entered as a judgment in the court that appointed the
referee, in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 644 and 645. </FONT></P>
