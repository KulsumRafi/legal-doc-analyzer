<PAGE>

                                                                               3

                  (c)   Anything herein or in any other Operative Agreement to

rights with respect to, or collecting against, the Guarantors under this
Guarantee.

                  3.    Right of Set-off. In addition to any rights now or
hereafter granted under applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of
limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default, each of the Investors, Agent and each Lender is hereby
authorized at any time or from time to time, without presentment, demand,
protest or other notice of any kind to the Borrower, the Guarantors or to any
other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to
appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other
Indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Investor, Agent or such Lender
(including, without limitation, by branches and agencies of such Investor, Agent
or such Lender wherever located) to or for the credit or the account of the
Guarantors against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of the
Guarantors hereunder or under any of the other Operative Agreements, and all
other claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with this
Guarantee or any other Operative Agreement, irrespective of whether such
Investor, Agent or such Lender shall have made any demand hereunder and although
said obligations, liabilities or claims, or any of them, shall be contingent or
unmatured. Each of the Investors, Agent and each Lender shall notify such
Guarantor promptly of any such set-off and the application made by such
Investor, Agent or such Lender; provided, that the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

                  4.    No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment or payments
made by the Guarantors hereunder or any set-off or application of funds of the
Guarantors by any Lender, the Guarantors shall not be entitled to exercise or
enforce any subrogation rights of the Investors, Agent or any Lender against the
Borrower or any other Person or any collateral security or guarantee or right of
offset held by the Investors, Agent or any Lender for the payment of the
Guaranteed Obligations, nor shall the Guarantors seek or be entitled to seek any
contribution or reimbursement from the Borrower or any other Person in respect
of payments made by the Guarantors hereunder, until all amounts owing to the
Investors, Agent and the Lenders by the Borrower on account of the Guaranteed
Obligations and all amounts owing hereunder are paid in full and the Commitments
are terminated. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantors on account of such
subrogation rights at any time when all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all
amounts owing hereunder shall not have been paid in full or the Commitments
shall not have been terminated, such amount shall be held by the Guarantors in
trust for the Investors, Agent and the Lenders, segregated from other funds of
the Guarantors, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by the Guarantors, be turned
over to the Agent in the exact form received by the Guarantors (duly

<PAGE>

                                                                               4

indorsed by the Guarantors to the Agent, if required), to be applied against the
Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Agent
may determine.

                  5.    Amendments, etc. with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations; Waiver of Rights. The Guarantors shall remain obligated hereunder
notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against the Guarantors
and without notice to or further assent by the Guarantors, any demand for
payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations made by the Investors, Agent or any
Lender may be rescinded by such party and any of the Guaranteed Obligations
continued, and the Guaranteed Obligations, or the liability of any other party
upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor
or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in
part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived,
surrendered or released by the Investors, Agent or any Lender, and the Credit
Agreement, the Participation Agreement and the other Operative Agreements may be
amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the Agent
(or the Required Lenders, as the case may be) may deem advisable from time to
time in accordance with the terms thereof, and any collateral security,
guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Investors, Agent or any
Lender for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations may be sold, exchanged,
waived, surrendered or released. Neither the Investors, Agent nor any Lender
shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any
time held by it as security for the Guaranteed Obligations or for this Guarantee
or any property subject thereto. When making any demand hereunder against the
Guarantors, the Investors, Agent or any Lender may, but shall be under no
obligation to, make a similar demand on the Borrower or any other guarantor, and
any failure by the Investors, Agent or any Lender to make any such demand or to
collect any payments from the Borrower or any other guarantor or any release of
the Borrower or such other guarantor shall not relieve the Guarantors from their
obligations under this Guarantee, and shall not impair or affect the rights and
remedies, express or implied, or as a matter of law, of the Investors, Agent or
any Lender against the Guarantors. For the purposes hereof "demand" shall
include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.

                  6.    Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Each Guarantor
waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any
of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the
Investors, Agent or any Lender upon this Guarantee or acceptance of this
Guarantee, the Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be
deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended,
amended or waived, in reliance upon this Guarantee; and all dealings between the
Borrower and such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Agent and the Lenders, on
the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively presumed to have been had or
consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee. Each Guarantor waives diligence,
presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to
or upon the Borrower or such Guarantor with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations. Each Guarantor understands and agrees that this Guarantee shall be
construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee and surety of
payment without regard to (a) the validity, regularity or enforceability of the
Credit Agreement or any other Operative Agreement, any of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of
offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the
Investors, Agent or any Lender, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other
than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to
or be asserted by the Borrower or such Guarantor against the

<PAGE>

                                                                               5

Investors, Agent or any Lender, or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with
or without notice to or knowledge of the Borrower or such Guarantor) which
constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal
discharge of the Borrower for the Guaranteed Obligations, or of such Guarantor
under this Guarantee, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When pursuing its
rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the Investors, the Agent
and any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and
remedies as it may have against the Borrower or any other Person or against any
collateral security or guarantee for the Guaranteed Obligations or any right of
offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Investors, Agent or any
Lender to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from
the Borrower or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral
security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of
the Borrower or any such other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee
or right of offset, shall not relieve such Guarantor of any liability hereunder,
and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied
or available as a matter of law, of the Investors, the Agent and the Lenders
against such Guarantor. This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and
be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon such Guarantor
and the successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of the
Investors, the Lessor, the Agent and the Lenders, and their respective
successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns, until all the Guaranteed
Obligations and the obligations of such Guarantor under this Guarantee shall
have been satisfied by payment in full and the Commitments shall be terminated,
notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of the Credit Agreement
the Borrower may be free from any Guaranteed Obligations.

                  7.    Reinstatement. This Guarantee shall continue to be
effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any
part thereof, of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored or returned by the Investors, Agent or any Lender upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the
Borrower or the Guarantors, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a
receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the
Borrower or the Guarantors or any substantial part of its property, or
otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

                  8.    Payments. The Guarantors hereby guarantee that payments
hereunder will be paid to the Agent without set-off or counterclaim in Dollars
at the office of the Agent located at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017.

                  9.    Representations, Warranties. In order to induce the
Lenders to enter into the Credit Agreement and to make the Loans, the Investors
to enter into the Participation Agreement and make the Investor Contribution and
the Lessor to enter into the Lease, Holdings and HCC hereby jointly and
severally represent and warrant to the Beneficiaries as follows, all of which
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Guarantee and the Credit
Agreement and the making of the Loans:

                  9.1   Financial Condition. (a) The unaudited pro forma
consolidated balance sheet of HCC and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at

consummation of the TIDES issuance. The Pro Forma Balance Sheet has been
prepared based on the best information available to Holdings and HCC as of the
date of delivery thereof, and presents fairly in all material respects on a
pro forma basis the estimated financial position of HCC and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as at September 30, 1999, assuming that the events specified in the
preceding sentence had actually occurred at such date.

                  (b)   The audited consolidated balance sheets of HCC as at
December 31, 1997 and December 31, 1998, and the related consolidated statements
of income and of cash flows for the fiscal years ended on such dates, reported
on by and accompanied by an unqualified report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial condition of
HCC as at such date, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
consolidated cash flows for the respective fiscal years then ended. The
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of HCC as at March 31, 1999 and June 30,
1999, and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income and cash flows
for the three and six-month periods ended on such date, present fairly in all
material respects the consolidated financial condition of HCC as at such date,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows
for the three and six-month periods then ended (subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments). All such financial statements, including the related schedules and
notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently
throughout the periods involved (except as approved by the aforementioned firm
of accountants and disclosed therein). Holdings, HCC and its Subsidiaries do not
have any material Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities and liabilities
for taxes, or any long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments,
including any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange transaction or
other obligation in respect of derivatives, that are not reflected in the most
recent financial statements referred to in this paragraph. During the period
from September 30, 1999 to and including the date hereof there has been no
Disposition by Holdings or any of its Subsidiairies, as applicable, of any
material part of their business or property (other than to Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries).

                  9.2   No Change. Since September 30, 1999 (a) there has been
no development or event nor any prospective development or event, which has had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (b) except
as disclosed on Schedule 9.2 to this Agreement, as of the date of this
Agreement, no dividends or other distributions have been declared, paid or made
upon the Capital Stock of Holdings or HCC nor has any of the Capital Stock of
Holdings or HCC (other than in connection with the Restructuring) been redeemed,
retired, purchased or otherwise acquired for value by Holdings or any of its
respective Subsidiaries.

                  9.3   Corporate Existence; Compliance with Law. Each Guarantor
(a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the corporate power and authority,
and the legal right, to own and operate its property, to lease the property it
operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged,
(c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing under the
laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or
the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law except to
the extent that the failure to comply therewith would not, in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                                                                               7

                  9.4   Corporate Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations.
Each Guarantor has the corporate power and authority, and the legal right, to
make, deliver and perform the Operative Agreements to which it is a party. HCC
has the corporate power and authority, and the legal right, to perform the
Operative Agreements and has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize
the performing under the Operative Agreements on the terms and conditions of the
Operative Agreements. Each Guarantor has taken all necessary corporate action to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee. No consent
or authorization of, filing with or other act by or in respect of, any
Governmental Authority or any other Person (other than consents that have been
obtained and consents or authorizations the failure to obtain would not, in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect) is required
in connection with the Loans or with the execution, delivery, performance,
validity or enforceability of this Guarantee or any of the other Operative
Agreements, except consents, authorizations, filings and notices described in
Schedule 9.4, which consents, authorizations, filings and notices have been
obtained or made and are in full force and effect. This Guarantee has been duly
executed and delivered on behalf of the Guarantors party hereto. This Guarantee
constitutes, each Operative Agreement when executed and delivered will
constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantors party
thereto enforceable against such Guarantors in accordance with their respective
terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether
enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law).

                  9.5   No Legal Bar. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Guarantee and the other Operative Agreements, the Loans and the use of the
proceeds thereof will not violate any Requirement of Law or Contractual
Obligation of any Guarantor party thereto and will not result in, or require,
the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of their respective properties or
revenues pursuant to any such Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation,
except as contemplated hereby or thereby and except to the extent any such
violation or creation or imposition of a Lien would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  9.6   No Material Litigation. Except as set forth in HCC's
Form 10-Q, filed with respect to the period ending September 30, 1999, no
litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or
Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of HCC, threatened by or
against any Guarantor or against any of their respective properties or revenues
(a) with respect to this Guarantee or the other Operative Agreements or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, or (b) which would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  9.7   No Default. None of the Guarantors nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries is in default under or with respect to any of their
respective Contractual Obligations in any respect which if not cured would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing.

                  9.8   Ownership of Property; Liens; Leases of Equipment. Each
of the Guarantors has good record and marketable title in fee simple (except for
exceptions to title as will not in the aggregate materially interfere with the
present or contemplated use of the property

<PAGE>

                                                                               8

affected thereby) to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all its real property,
and good title to all its other property, and none of such property is subject
to any Lien except as permitted by Section 11.3. None of the Equipment or
Inventory (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) owned by any Guarantor has
been leased by such Guarantor as lessor, except pursuant to operating leases
(which do not constitute Financing Leases). As used herein, Equipment or
Inventory leased by a Guarantor under a Financing Lease shall be deemed "owned"
by such Guarantor.

                  9.9   Intellectual Property. Each Guarantor owns, or is
licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, trade secrets, copyrights,
technology, know-how and processes necessary for the conduct of its business as
currently conducted except for those the failure to own or license which would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (the "Intellectual
Property"). To the knowledge of each Guarantor, no claim has been asserted and
is pending by any Person challenging or questioning the use of any such
Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual
Property, nor does each Guarantor know of any valid basis for any such claim,
which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The use of
such Intellectual Property by the Guarantors does not infringe on the rights of
any Person, except for such claims and infringements that, in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  9.10  Taxes. Each of the Guarantors has filed or caused to be
filed all tax returns which, to the knowledge of each Guarantor, are required to
be filed and has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or
on any assessments made against it or any of its property and all other taxes,
fees or other charges imposed on it or any of its property by any Governmental
Authority (other than any the amount or validity of which are currently being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which
reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the books of any of the
Guarantors, as the case may be); no tax Lien has been filed against the
property of any Guarantor, and, to the knowledge of each Guarantor, no claim is
being asserted, with respect to any such tax, fee or other charge.

                  9.11  Federal Regulations. No part of the proceeds of any
Loans will be used for "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock" within the
respective meanings of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as now and from time to time
hereafter in effect or for any purpose which violates the provisions of the
Regulations of such Board of Governors. If requested by any Lender or the Agent,
HCC will furnish to the Agent and each Lender a statement to the foregoing
effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form U-1 referred to in said
Regulation U.

                  9.12  ERISA. Neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section
302 of ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on
which this representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and
each Plan has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of ERISA and the Code. No termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred and
no lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen during the five-year period
prior to the date as of which this representation is deemed made. The present
value of all accrued benefits under each Single Employer Plan maintained by HCC,
or any Commonly Controlled Entity (based on those assumptions used to fund the
Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation

<PAGE>

                                                                               9

date prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made,
exceed the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits.
Neither HCC nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has had a complete or partial
withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan, and neither HCC nor any Commonly
Controlled Entity would become subject to any liability under ERISA if HCC or
any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all
Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on
which this representation is made or deemed made. No such Multiemployer Plan is
in Reorganization or Insolvent. The present value (determined using actuarial
and other assumptions which are reasonable in respect of the benefits provided
and the employees participating) of the liability of HCC and each Commonly
Controlled Entity for post retirement benefits to be provided to their current
and former employees under Plans which are welfare benefit plans (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) does not, in the aggregate, exceed the assets under all
such Plans allocable to such benefits.

                  9.13  Investment Company Act; Other Regulations. None of the
Guarantors is an "investment company", or a company "controlled" by an
"investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended. None of the Guarantors is subject to regulation under any Federal or
State statute or regulation which limits its ability to incur Indebtedness or
change rates or change tariffs. None of the Guarantors are "holding companies"
or "subsidiary companies" of a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a
"holding company" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, as amended.

                  9.14  Subsidiaries. As of the Initial Closing Date, Holdings
has no Subsidiaries other than as set forth on Schedule 9.14. Except if a
Guarantor, other than cash or Cash Equivalents located in bank accounts at the
Agent, none of the assets owned by any Unqualified Subsidiary as of the date
hereof are located within the United States of America or any territory thereof.

                  9.15  Environmental Matters. Each of the representations and
warranties set forth in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this subsection is true
and correct with respect to each parcel of real property owned or operated by
any of the Guarantors (the "Properties"), except to the extent that the facts
and circumstances giving rise to any such failure to be so true and correct
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:

                  (a)   Except as set forth on Schedule 9.15, the Properties do
        not contain, and have not previously contained, in, on, or under,
        including, without limitation, the soil and groundwater thereunder, any
        Hazardous Substances in concentrations which violate Environmental Laws.

                  (b)   Except as set forth on Schedule 9.15, the Properties and
        all operations and facilities at the Properties are in compliance with
        all Environmental Laws, and there is no Hazardous Substances
        contamination or violation of any Environmental Law which would
        reasonably be expected to interfere with the continued operation of any
        of the Properties or impair the fair saleable value of any thereof.

                                                                              10

                  (c)   Except as set forth on Schedule 9.15, none of the
        Guarantors has received any complaint, notice of violation, alleged
        violation, investigation or advisory action or of potential liability or
        of potential responsibility regarding environmental protection matters
        or environmental permit compliance with regard to the Properties which
        has not been resolved, nor is HCC aware that any Governmental Authority
        is contemplating delivering to any Guarantor any such notice.

                  (d)   Hazardous Substances have not been generated, treated,
        stored, disposed of, at, on or under any of the Properties in
        concentrations that violate Environmental Laws, nor have any Hazardous
        Substances been transferred to any other location, in violation of any
        Environmental Laws from the Properties or as a result of the sale or
        lease of any equipment or inventory of any Guarantor.

                  (e)   There are no governmental, administrative actions or
        judicial proceedings pending or contemplated under any Environmental
        Laws to which any Guarantor is or to HCC's knowledge will be named as a
        party with respect to the Properties, nor to HCC's knowledge are there
        any consent decrees or other decrees, consent orders, administrative
        orders or other orders, or other administrative or judicial requirements
        outstanding under any Environmental Law with respect to any of the
        Properties.

                  9.16  Accuracy and Completeness of Information. The factual
statements contained in the Operative Agreements and each other agreement,
instrument, certificate and document related thereto and any other certificates
or documents furnished or to be furnished to the Investors, the Agent or the
Lenders by any Guarantor from time to time in connection with this Guarantee (in
any case excluding any of the financial statements referred to in Section 9.l(a)
and 10.1 hereof), taken as a whole, and taking into consideration all
corrections or substituted documents, do not and will not, as of the date when
made, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances in which the same were made, all except
as otherwise qualified herein or therein.

                  9.17  Year 2000. The Year 2000 date change has not resulted in
disruption of Holdings' and its Subsidiaries' computer hardware, software,
databases, systems and other equipment containing embedded microchips (including
systems and equipment supplied by others or with which Holdings' or its
Subsidiaries' systems interface), or to Holdings' or its Subsidiaries'
operations or business systems, or to the best of Holdings' and its
Subsidiaries' knowledge, to the operations or business systems of Holdings'
major vendors, customers, suppliers and counterparties. Holdings has no reason
to believe that liabilities and expenditures related to the Year 2000
date-change (including, without limitation, costs caused by reprogramming
errors, the failure of others' systems or equipment, and the potential
liability, if any, of Holdings or its Subsidiaries for Year 2000 related costs
incurred or disruption experienced by others) will result in a Default or a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  9.18  Senior Indebtedness. The Guaranteed Obligations
constitute "Senior Indebtedness" of HCC under and as defined in the Shareholder
Subordinated Loan Agreement.

                                                                              11

The obligations of the Guarantors under the Agreement constitute "Senior
Indebtedness" of such applicable Guarantors under and as defined in the
Shareholder Subordinated Loan Agreement.

                  9.19  Representations and Warranties in Existing Guarantee.
The representations and warranties contained in Section 9 of the Existing
Guarantee and in any amendment, consent or waiver thereto were true and correct
in all material respects on and as of the dates when made pursuant to the
Existing Guarantee.

                  10.   Affirmative Covenants of the Guarantor. Each Guarantor
hereby covenants and agrees that so long as this Guarantee is in effect and
until the Commitments have terminated and the Guaranteed Obligations and all

satisfy at or before maturity or before they become delinquent, as the case may

the books of Holdings or any Subsidiary of Holdings, as the case may be.

                  10.4  Conduct of Business and Maintenance of Existence.

maintain all property material to the conduct of its business in good working
order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and (b) maintain, with
