                                 AMENDMENT NO. 4
                                     TO THE
                        KINDRED & AFFILIATES 401(k) PLAN

     This is Amendment No. 4 to the Kindred & Affiliates 401(k) Plan (the
"Plan") as last amended and restated as of March 1, 2000.

                                    RECITALS

A.   Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (the "Company") maintains the Plan and has
     reserved the right in Section 9.1 of the Plan to amend the Plan from time
     to time in its discretion.

B.   The Company wishes to amend the Plan to provide for automatic correction of
     any failures of a discrimination test applicable to the matching
     contribution formula under the Plan.


                                    AMENDMENT

     1.   Section 3.2 of the Plan is hereby amended effective January 1, 1997 by
the addition of the following new subsection (e) at the end thereof:

          (e)  Each Matching Contribution level under Section 3.2(d) above must
               benefit a group of Participants that satisfies Code Section
               410(b) minimum coverage requirements (without regard to the
               average benefit percentage test of Treasury Regulation Section
               1.410(b)-5) for each Plan Year, as required by Treasury
               Regulation Section 1.401(a)(4)-4. If the Administrator determines
               that such minimum coverage requirement of Section 410(b) of the
               Code is not initially satisfied for one of the Matching
               Contribution levels for a Plan Year, the following rules shall
               apply:

               (i)  the Administrator shall establish a list of Non-Highly
                    Compensated Employee Participants who do not have the
                    necessary completed Years of Service to be eligible for the
                    level of Matching Contribution that does not meet the
                    coverage requirement;

               (ii) the Administrator shall designate the Non-Highly Compensated
                    Employee Participant from among the group identified in (i)
                    above with the highest number of Years of Service as of
                    March 31 of the Plan Year as eligible for that Matching
                    Contribution level (if more than one Participant meets that
                    condition, only the Participant with the earliest hire date
                    shall be considered so eligible), and

               (iii) if the minimum coverage requirement is still not satisfied,
                     step (ii) is repeated so that the Participant with the next
                     highest number of Years of Service (or earliest hire date)
                     shall be designated as eligible for that level of Matching
                     Contribution, and so on until the minimum coverage
                     requirement is satisfied.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Employer has caused this Amendment No. 4 to be
executed this 18th day of December, 2002.
