Dear _______:

The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors recently agreed to extend
the following benefits to you should your employment with the Company ever be
terminated without cause. The benefits should include the following:

         o        Two weeks base salary (excluding bonuses, commissions and any
                  other forms of incentives or overtime pay) for each continuous
                  full year of employment and a pro rata payment for any partial
                  year of employment with the Company as of the date of the
                  covered employee's termination of employment.

         o        One week of base salary (excluding bonuses, commissions and
                  any other forms of incentives or overtime pay) for each
                  $10,000 of annual income (which shall be the sum of base
                  salary and the highest potential award payable to such
                  executive under the Company's bonus program for the year that
                  the employee is terminated).

         o        All options previously awarded to you will, to the extent not
                  already vested, vest immediately and you shall have the lesser
                  of (i) 365 days or (ii) the remaining option term to exercise
                  any and all of your vested options.

You will not be entitled to duplicate payments if payment is due under any other
severance program offered by the Company. However, you will be entitled to
receive this payment in lieu of a severance payment.

A condition of the payment will be the requirement that you sign a general
release. In addition, it is required that you keep the existence of this benefit
confidential.

Please acknowledge receipt of this letter and your agreement to execute a
general release prior to receipt of the above-referenced benefit.

Sincerely,



James L. Payne
