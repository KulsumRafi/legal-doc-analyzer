<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company proposes to issue Common Stock Purchase Warrants, as hereinafter described (the "Warrants"), to purchase up to an aggregate 1,514,840 shares of its Common Stock, par value

of the Warrant Price as defined in and determined in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;7 hereof for the number of Warrant Shares in respect of which such Warrants are then exercised
(the "Exercise Amount"). Payment of the Exercise Amount shall be made (i)&nbsp;by payment to the Company in cash, by certified or official bank check, or by wire transfer of the Exercise Amount,
(ii)&nbsp;by surrender to the Company for cancellation of securities (which may include Warrant Shares received in respect of such Warrants being exercised) of the Company having a Market Price (as
hereinafter defined) on the date of exercise equal to the Exercise Amount; or (iii)&nbsp;by a combination of the methods described in clauses (i)&nbsp;and (ii)&nbsp;above, in each case at the
option of the Holder. For purposes hereof, the term "Market Price" shall mean (1)&nbsp;the average of the daily closing price of a share of Common Stock or other securities of the Company, as the
case may be, for the 15 consecutive trading days preceding the date the Warrant is presented for exercise on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock, or securities are
listed or admitted to trading or, (2)&nbsp;if not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the average of the reported bid and asked prices during such 15 trading day
period in the over-the-counter market as furnished by the National Quotation Bureau,&nbsp;Inc., or, if such firm is not then engaged in the business of reporting such prices,
as furnished by any member of the National Association of Securities Dealers,&nbsp;Inc. selected by the Company or, (3)&nbsp;if the Common Stock or securities are not publicly traded, the Market
Price for such day shall be the fair market value thereof determined jointly by the Company and the Holder; provided, however, that if pursuant to this subclause (3)&nbsp;such parties are unable to
reach agreement within a reasonable period of time, the Market Price shall be determined in good faith by the independent investment banking firm selected jointly by the Company and the Holder or, if
that selection cannot be made within 15&nbsp;days, by
an independent investment banking firm selected by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its rules. </FONT></P>

to Section&nbsp;3.4 and Section&nbsp;4 hereof, upon the surrender of a Warrant that is exercisable under this Agreement and payment of the Warrant Price as aforesaid, the
Company shall cause to be issued and delivered with all reasonable dispatch (but in not event later than (i)&nbsp;5 business days after payment is received if payment is made in immediately
available funds or by the surrender of securities and (ii)&nbsp;10 business days after payment is received if payment is not made in immediately available funds or by the surrender of securities) to

such Warrants, together with cash, as provided in Section&nbsp;8 hereof, in respect of any fractional Warrant Shares otherwise issuable upon such surrender. If permitted by applicable law, to the
extent that the Warrant Price consideration consists solely of securities (which may include Warrant Shares received in respect of such Warrants being exercised) of the Company, the Warrant Shares so
acquired (together with the related certificate or certificates) shall be deemed to have been acquired as of the date hereof. The rights of purchase represented by the Warrants shall be exercisable,
at the election of the Holders thereof, either in full or from time to time in part and, in the event that a certificate evidencing Warrants is exercised in respect of less than all of the Warrant
Shares purchasable on exercise at any time prior to the date of expiration of the Warrants, the Company shall, at the time of delivery of the certificate or certificates representing Warrant Shares,
deliver to the Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights to purchase the remaining Warrant Shares, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical to this Warrant. </FONT></P>

provided in Section&nbsp;7.2(f)) (the "Spread") and (y)&nbsp;the number of shares which would have been issued upon exercise of the Warrants had the Company not made the election set forth herein.
In the event the Company notifies the Holder that it does not intend to exercise its right to pay the Spread (or fails to notify the Holder of its intent within such 10 business day period), the
Holder will have 60&nbsp;days to obtain the funds necessary to acquire the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Warrants and/or exercise the registration rights provided in Exhibit&nbsp;B. If
the Holder fails to obtain the funds necessary to acquire the Common Stock within such 60&nbsp;days, the requirement to provide the notices contemplated by this Section&nbsp;3.4 shall once again
be applicable. If the Holder exercises the Holder's registration rights, the Holder need not pay for the Warrant Shares until such registration shall become effective and the issuance of shares of
Common Stock pursuant thereto shall have been consummated. The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause the certificates representing the Warrant Shares to be issued upon exercise of such
Warrants to be issued to the Holder promptly following the payment of the Warrant Price by the Holder. </FONT></P>

any time after December&nbsp;31, 2003, and subject to the restrictions contained in this Agreement, upon a written request to register under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, by the Purchaser, or by the Holders of (i)&nbsp;Warrants representing the right to purchase Warrant Shares and/or (ii)&nbsp;Warrant Shares, which in the aggregate comprise 50% or
more of the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (the "Majority Holders"), the Company shall promptly prepare and file no later than 45&nbsp;days following any such request at its
sole expense, a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") to register the resale of the Warrant Shares to be received by any Holder, and any other shares of
Common Stock held by the Purchaser (the "Registrable Securities"). However, in no event will the Company be required to file more than one such registration statement and the Company shall not be
required to file&nbsp;a registration statement relating to the registration of the Warrants. The Company shall notify all other Holders of Registrable Securities of such registration, and shall
allow such Holders a reasonable opportunity to participate in such registration. Subject to subsection (c)&nbsp;hereof, the Holders acknowledge that the Company may include in such registration

limitations: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company shall be entitled to postpone for up to 120&nbsp;days in any twelve-month period the filing of any registration statement otherwise required to be
prepared and filed by it pursuant to subsection (a)&nbsp;if, at the time it receives a request for such registration, the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that such registration and
sale would materially interfere with any financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or other material transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries and promptly gives the Holders
written notice of such determination. If the Company shall so postpone the filing of a registration statement, the requesting party or parties shall have the right to withdraw
the request for registration by giving written notice to the Company within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice of postponement (and, in the event of such withdrawal, such request shall not
be counted for purposes of determining the number of requests for registration to which the Holders are entitled pursuant to subsection (a)). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;A
registration statement with respect to a registration requested pursuant to subsection (a)&nbsp;that has not become effective within 120&nbsp;days following any
such request shall not be counted for the purpose of determining the number of requests for registration to which the Holders are entitled pursuant to subsection (a)&nbsp;unless agreed to by the
Purchaser and by the Majority Holders or more of the Registrable Securities outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that such failure to become effective is the result of action or

any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise hereunder, except to the extent of actual prejudice. In case such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly
notified, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, if the defendants in any action include both the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party and there is a conflict of interest which would prevent counsel for the indemnifying party from also representing the indemnified party, the indemnified party or parties shall have
the right to select one separate counsel to participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party
of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party pursuant to the provisions of said subsection (f)(i)&nbsp;or (ii)&nbsp;for any

at any time after December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company shall determine to register any of its equity securities either for its own account or for the account of a
security holder or holders exercising their respective demand registration rights, other than a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans, a registration on Form&nbsp;S-4 or
any successor or substitute form or a registration relating solely to a Commission Rule&nbsp;145 transaction, or a registration on any registration form which does not permit secondary sales or does
not include substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a registration statement covering the sale of Registrable Securities, the Company will (i)&nbsp;promptly give to
each of the Holders a written notice thereof (which shall include a list of the jurisdictions in which the Company intends to attempt to qualify such securities under the applicable blue sky or other
state securities laws); and (ii)&nbsp;include in such registration (and any related qualification under blue sky laws or other compliance), and in any underwriting involved therein, all the Warrant
Shares specified in a written request or requests, made by the Holders within twenty (20)&nbsp;days after receipt of the written notice from the Company described in clause&nbsp;(i) above, except
as set forth in paragraph&nbsp;(h) below. Such written request may specify all or a part of the Holders' Warrant Shares. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the registration of which the Company gives notice is for a registered public offering involving an underwriting, the Company shall so advise each of the Holders as a
part of the written notice given pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;(g). In such event, the right of each of the Holders to registration pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;(g) shall be conditioned upon such
Holders' participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holders' Warrant Shares in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. The Holders whose shares are to be included in such
registration shall (together with the Company and the other stockholders distributing their securities through such underwriting (the "Other Stockholders")) enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the representative of the underwriter or underwriters selected for underwriting by the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of paragraph&nbsp;(g) and this
paragraph&nbsp;(h), if the representative determines that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, the representative may (subject to the allocation
priority set forth below) limit the number of Warrant Shares to be included in the registration and underwriting. The Company shall so advise all holders of securities requesting registration, and the
number of shares of securities that are entitled to be included in the registration and underwriting shall be allocated in the following manner: The securities to be sold by the Company and securities
held by persons who by contractual right initiated the demand for such registration ("Demanding Holders") shall not be subject to reduction. The securities of the Company held by Holders, and Other
Stockholders of the Company (other than securities held by Demanding Holders) shall be reduced, on a </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>pro rata</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> basis (based on the number of shares
proposed to be sold by such Holders and other stockholders), by such minimum number of shares as is necessary to comply with such limitation. If any of the Holders or Demanding Holders or any officer,
director or Other Stockholder disapproves of the
terms of any such underwriting, such holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company and the underwriter. Any Warrant Shares or other securities excluded or withdrawn from such
underwriting shall be withdrawn from such registration. </FONT></P>
