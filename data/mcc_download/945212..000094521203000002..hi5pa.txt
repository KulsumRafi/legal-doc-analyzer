                                   ARTICLE II

                    SALE OF HOME LOANS AND RELATED PROVISIONS

               Section 2.1   Sale of Home Loans.

               (a) The Seller,  by the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
does hereby sell,  assign,  set over,  and  otherwise  convey to the  Purchaser,
without  recourse,  all of its right,  title and  interest  in, to and under the
following,  and wherever  located:  (i) the Home Loans,  all  interest  accruing
thereon and all collections in respect thereof  received on or after the Cut-off
Date;  (ii)  property  which  secured a Home Loan and which has been acquired by
foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure;  (iii) the interest of the Seller in
any  insurance  policies in respect of the Home Loans;  and (iv) all proceeds of
the foregoing.  Such conveyance  shall be deemed to be made, with respect to the
Cut-off Date Loan  Balances,  as of the Closing Date,  subject to the receipt by
the Seller of  consideration  therefor as provided  herein  under  clause (b) of
Section 2.2.

               (b) In  connection  with  such  conveyance,  the  Seller  further
agrees,  at its own expense,  on or prior to the Closing Date to indicate in its
books and records that the Home Loans have been sold to the  Purchaser  pursuant
to this Agreement and to deliver to the Purchaser true and complete lists of all
of the Home Loans  specifying for each Home Loan (i) its account number and (ii)
its Cut-off  Date Loan  Balance.  Such  lists,  which form part of the Home Loan
Schedule,  shall  be  marked  as  Exhibit  1 to this  Agreement  and are  hereby
incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement.

               (c) In connection with such conveyance by the Seller,  the Seller
shall on behalf of the Purchaser deliver to, and deposit with the Custodian,  on
or before the Closing Date, the following  documents or instruments with respect
to each Home Loan:

                      (i) the original  Mortgage Note endorsed  without recourse
        to the Grantor Trustee and showing an unbroken chain of endorsement from
        the  originator  thereof to the Person  endorsing it or, with respect to
        any  Home  Loan  as  to  which  the  original  Mortgage  Note  has  been
        permanently  lost or destroyed  and has not been  replaced,  a Lost Note
        Affidavit  from the related seller or  Residential  Funding  Corporation
        stating the  original  Mortgage  Note was lost,  misplaced  or destroyed
        together with a copy of such Note;

                      (ii) the  original  Mortgage  with  evidence of  recording
        thereon,  or a copy of the original  Mortgage with evidence of recording
        thereon;



                                              2

<PAGE>



                      (iii)  assignments  (which may be  included in one or more
        blanket  assignments  if  permitted by  applicable  law) of the Mortgage
        recorded to "JPMorgan  Chase Bank as Grantor  Trustee" c/o the Seller at
        an address specified by the Seller; and

                      (iv)  originals  of  any  intervening  assignments  of the
        Mortgage, with evidence of recording thereon, or a copy of such original
        intervening assignment with evidence of recording indicated thereon; and

                      (v)  a  true  and   correct   copy  of  each   assumption,
        modification,  consolidation or substitution agreement, if any, relating
        to the Home Loan.

               Within the time period for the review of each  Mortgage  File set
forth in Section 2.3 of the Custodial Agreement,  if a defect or omission in any
Mortgage File is discovered  which may materially and adversely affect the value
of the related Home Loan, or the interests of the Grantor Trustee or the Grantor
Trustee  Certificateholder  in such Home Loan, including the Seller's failure to
deliver any document  required to be delivered to the Custodian on behalf of the
Grantor  Trustee  (provided that a Mortgage File will not be deemed to contain a
defect for an unrecorded  assignment  under clause (iii) above if the Seller has
submitted such assignment for recording or if such assignment is not required to
be recorded pursuant to the terms of the following paragraph),  the Seller shall
cure such defect,  repurchase the related Home Loan at the  Repurchase  Price or
substitute an Eligible  Substitute  Loan for the related Home Loan upon the same
terms  and   conditions  set  forth  in  Section  3.1  hereof  for  breaches  of
representations  and  warranties  as to the Home Loans.  As set forth in Section
2.03 of the Custodial  Agreement,  the Custodian  shall deliver to the Indenture
Trustee a  certificate  (the  "Interim  Certification")  to the effect  that all
documents  required to be delivered pursuant to this Subsection 2.1(c) have been
executed  and  received  and  that  such  documents  relate  to the  Home  Loans
identified  on the Home  Loan  Schedule,  except  for any  exceptions  listed on
Schedule B attached to such Interim Certification.

               Within 60 days after the  receipt by the Master  Servicer  of the
recording  information,  the Seller at its own expense shall complete and submit
for recording in the appropriate public office for real property records each of
the assignments  referred to in clause (iii) above.  While such assignment to be
recorded is being  recorded,  the  Custodian  shall  retain a photocopy  of such
assignment.  If any  assignment is lost or returned  unrecorded to the Custodian
because of any defect  therein,  the Seller is required to prepare a  substitute
assignment  or cure such defect,  as the case may be, and the Seller shall cause
such assignment to be recorded in accordance with this paragraph.

               In the event that the Seller  delivers to the Custodian on behalf
of the Grantor  Trustee any Mortgage  Note or  assignment  in blank,  the Seller
shall, or shall cause the Custodian to, complete the endorsement of the Mortgage
Note and the assignment in conjunction with the Interim  Certification issued by
the Custodian.

               In  instances   where  an  original   Mortgage  or  any  original
intervening  assignment  of Mortgage  was not, in  accordance  with clause (ii),
(iii), (iv) or (v) above (or copies thereof as


                                              3

<PAGE>



permitted  in  this  section  2.1(c)  above),  delivered  by the  Seller  to the
respective Custodian prior to or concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this  Agreement,  the Seller will deliver or cause to be delivered the originals
of such documents to such Custodian promptly upon receipt thereof.

               The Purchaser  hereby  acknowledges  its acceptance of all right,
title and interest to the property, conveyed to it pursuant to this Section 2.1.

               (d) The parties  hereto  intend that the  transactions  set forth
herein  constitute  a sale by the Seller to the  Purchaser  of all the  Seller's
right,  title and interest in and to the Home Loans and other property as and to
the extent  described  above. In the event the transactions set forth herein are
deemed not to be a sale,  the Seller  hereby  grants to the Purchaser a security
interest in all of the Seller's  right,  title and interest in, to and under the
Home Loans and such other  property,  to secure all of the Seller's  obligations
hereunder,  and this  Agreement  shall  constitute  a security  agreement  under
applicable  law. The Seller agrees to take or cause to be taken such actions and
to  execute  such  documents,  including  without  limitation  the filing of all
necessary  UCC-1  financing  statements  filed in the State of Minnesota  (which
shall have been submitted for filing as of the Closing Date),  any  continuation
statements with respect thereto and any amendments thereto required to reflect a
change in the name or  corporate  structure  of the  Seller or the filing of any
additional UCC-1 financing  statements due to the change in the principal office
or jurisdiction of incorporation of the Seller,  as are necessary to perfect and
protect the Purchaser's interests in each Home Loan and the proceeds thereof.

               Section 2.2   Payment of Purchase Price.

               (a) The  "Purchase  Price" for the Home Loans  shall be an amount
equal to $258,980,684.18 in immediately available funds.

               (b) In  consideration  of the  sale of the  Home  Loans  from the
Seller to the  Purchaser on the Closing  Date,  the  Purchaser  shall pay to the
Seller on the Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately  available funds to a
bank account designated by the Seller, the amount specified above in clause (a);
provided,  that  such  payment  may be on a net  funding  basis if agreed by the
Seller and the Purchaser.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES;

        business in which it is currently engaged.  The Seller is duly qualified
        to do business as a foreign  corporation and is in good standing in each
        jurisdiction in which the character of the business  transacted by it or
        properties  owned or leased by it  requires  such  qualification  and in

        the business,  properties,  assets or condition  (financial or other) of
        the Seller;

                      (ii) The  Seller  has the  power  and  authority  to make,
        execute,  deliver and perform its  obligations  under this Agreement and
        all of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, and has taken
        all necessary corporate action to authorize the execution,  delivery and
        performance  of  this  Agreement.  When  executed  and  delivered,  this
        Agreement will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
        Seller  enforceable in accordance with its terms,  except as enforcement
        of such terms may be limited by  bankruptcy,  insolvency or similar laws
        affecting  the  enforcement  of creditors'  rights  generally and by the
        availability of equitable remedies;

                      (iii) The Seller is not  required to obtain the consent of
        any other  Person or any  consent,  license,  approval or  authorization
        from, or registration or declaration  with, any governmental  authority,
        bureau  or  agency  in   connection   with  the   execution,   delivery,
        performance,  validity or enforceability  of this Agreement,  except for
        such consents, licenses,  approvals or authorizations,  or registrations
        or  declarations,  as shall have been obtained or filed, as the case may
        be;

                      (iv) The execution and delivery of this  Agreement and the
        performance of the transactions  contemplated  hereby by the Seller will
        not violate any provision of any existing law or regulation or any order
        or decree of any court  applicable to the Seller or any provision of the
        Certificate of  Incorporation  or Bylaws of the Seller,  or constitute a
        material breach of any mortgage,  indenture, contract or other agreement
        to which the Seller is a party or by which the Seller may be bound;

                      (v)  No  litigation  or  administrative  proceeding  of or
        before any court, tribunal or governmental body is currently pending, or
        to the knowledge of the Seller threatened,  against the Seller or any of
        its  properties  or with respect to this  Agreement  or the  Certificate
        which in the  opinion  of the  Seller  has a  reasonable  likelihood  of
        resulting in a material adverse effect on the transactions  contemplated
        by this Agreement;

                      (vi) This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
        obligation of the Seller,  enforceable  against the Seller in accordance
        with its terms,  except as  enforceability  may be limited by applicable
        bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
        now or hereafter in effect affecting the enforcement of


                                              5

        creditors'  rights in general and except as such  enforceability  may be
        limited  by  general  principles  of  equity  (whether  considered  in a
        proceeding at law or in equity);

                      (vii) This  Agreement  constitutes  a valid  transfer  and
        assignment  to the  Purchaser  of all right,  title and  interest of the
        Seller in, to and under the Home Loans,  all monies due or to become due
        with  respect  thereto,  and all  proceeds  of such  Cut-off  Date  Loan

        specified  in the  definition  of  "Grantor  Trust" as being part of the
        corpus of the Trust conveyed to the Purchaser by the Seller;

                      (viii) The Seller is not in  default  with  respect to any
        order or decree of any court or any order,  regulation  or demand or any
        federal,  state,  municipal or governmental  agency, which default might
        have  consequences  that  would  materially  and  adversely  affect  the
        condition  (financial  or  other)  or  operations  of the  Seller or its
        properties or might have  consequences  that would materially  adversely
        affect its performance hereunder; and

                      (ix) The Seller has not  transferred the Home Loans to the
        Purchaser  with  any  intent  to  hinder,  delay or  defraud  any of its
        creditors.

               (b)    As to the Home Loans:

                       (iii) The related Mortgage Note and the Mortgage have not
        been  assigned  or  pledged,  the Seller has good and  marketable  title
        thereto  and the  Seller is the sole  owner and  holder of the Home Loan
        free and clear of any and all liens, claims, encumbrances, participation
        interests,  equities,  pledges,  charges or  security  interests  of any
        nature  and has full right and  authority,  under all  governmental  and
        regulatory  bodies  having   jurisdiction  over  the  ownership  of  the

 clause (a) above which materially and adversely affects


                                              9

<PAGE>



 the  interests of the Grantor  Trust  Certificateholder  in any Home Loan,  the
 Seller shall,  within 45 days of its discovery or its receipt of notice of such
 breach,  either (i) cure such  breach in all  material  respects or (ii) to the
 extent that such breach is with  respect to a Home Loan or a Related  Document,
 either (A)  repurchase  such Home Loan from the Grantor Trust at the Repurchase
 Price,  or (B) substitute one or more Eligible  Substitute  Loans for such Home
 Loan, in each case in the manner and subject to the conditions and  limitations
 set forth below.

               Upon  discovery by the Seller or upon notice from the  Purchaser,
 the Grantor Trustee,  the Issuer,  the Owner Trustee,  the Indenture Trustee or
 any Custodian, as applicable,  of a breach of any representation or warranty in
 clause (b) above  with  respect  to any Home Loan or upon the  occurrence  of a
 Repurchase  Event that  materially  and adversely  affects the interests of the
 Grantor Trust  Certificateholder  or of the Purchaser in such Home Loan (notice
 of which shall be given to the Grantor Trustee and the Purchaser by the Seller,
 if it discovers the same),  notwithstanding the Seller's lack of knowledge with
 respect to the  substance of such  representation  and  warranty or  Repurchase
 Event,  the Seller shall,  within 90 days after the earlier of its discovery or
 receipt of notice thereof,  either cure such breach or Repurchase  Event in all
 material  respects  or either (i)  repurchase  such Home Loan from the  Grantor
 Trust  at the  Repurchase  Price,  or  (ii)  substitute  one or  more  Eligible
 Substitute  Loans for such Home Loan, in each case in the manner and subject to
 the  conditions set forth below.  The  Repurchase  Price for any such Home Loan
 repurchased  by the Seller  shall be deposited or caused to be deposited by the
 Master Servicer in the Custodial  Account  maintained by it pursuant to Section
 3.02 of the Servicing Agreement.

               The Seller may only  substitute  an Eligible  Substitute  Loan or
 Loans for a Deleted Loan pursuant to this Section  3.1(c) if the Seller obtains
 an Opinion of Counsel  generally  to the  effect  that the  substitution  of an
 Eligible  Substitute  Loan or Loans for a Deleted Loan will not cause an entity
 level  federal or state  income tax to be imposed  on the  Grantor  Trust.  The
 Seller shall also deliver to the Custodian on behalf of the Grantor Trust, with
 respect to such Eligible  Substitute Loan or Loans, the original  Mortgage Note
 and all other documents and agreements as are required by Section 2.1(c),  with
 the Mortgage Note endorsed as required by Section 2.1(c).  No substitution will
 be made in any  calendar  month  after the  Determination  Date for such month.
 Monthly Payments due with respect to Eligible  Substitute Loans in the month of
 substitution shall not be part of the Grantor Trust and will be retained by the
 Master  Servicer and remitted by the Master  Servicer to the Seller on the next
 succeeding  Payment  Date,  provided  that a  payment  at  least  equal  to the
 applicable  Monthly  Payment has been received by the Grantor  Trust,  for such
 month  in  respect  of  the  Deleted  Loan.  For  the  month  of  substitution,
 distributions  to  the  Grantor  Trust  Certificate  Account  pursuant  to  the
 Servicing  Agreement will include the Monthly Payment due on a Deleted Loan for
 such month and  thereafter  the Seller  shall be entitled to retain all amounts
 received in respect of such Deleted Loan.  The Master  Servicer  shall amend or
 cause to be  amended  the Home Loan  Schedule  to reflect  the  removal of such
 Deleted Loan and the substitution of the Eligible  Substitute Loan or Loans and
 the Master Servicer shall deliver the amended Home Loan Schedule to the Grantor
 Trustee. Upon such substitution, the Eligible Substitute Loan or Loans shall be
 subject  to the terms of this  Agreement  and the  Servicing  Agreement  in all
 respects,  the  Seller  shall be deemed to have  made the  representations  and
 warranties (other than any statistical representation


                                       10

<PAGE>



 or warranty) with respect to the Eligible  Substitute Loan set forth in Section
 3.1(b) as of the date of  substitution,  and the Seller  shall be  obligated to
 repurchase  or  substitute  for any  Eligible  Substitute  Loan  as to  which a
 Repurchase  Event has  occurred  as provided  herein.  In  connection  with the
 substitution of one or more Eligible  Substitute  Loans for one or more Deleted
 Loans,   the  Master  Servicer  will  determine  the  amount  (such  amount,  a
 "Substitution  Adjustment  Amount"),  if any, by which the aggregate  principal
 balance of all such Eligible Substitute Loans as of the date of substitution is
 less than the  aggregate  principal  balance of all such  Deleted  Loans (after
 application of the principal  portion of the Monthly  Payments due in the month
 of  substitution  that are to be distributed  to the Grantor Trust  Certificate
 Account in the month of  substitution).  The Seller shall deposit the amount of
 such shortfall into the Custodial  Account on the day of substitution,  without
 any reimbursement therefor.

               Upon  receipt by the  Grantor  Trustee  on behalf of the  Grantor
 Trust and the Custodian of written notification, signed by a Servicing Officer,
 of the deposit of such Repurchase Price or of such  substitution of an Eligible
 Substitute Loan (together with the complete  related Mortgage File) and deposit
 of any  applicable  Substitution  Adjustment  Amount  as  provided  above,  the
 Custodian  on behalf of the  Grantor  Trustee  shall  release to the Seller the
 related  Mortgage File for the Home Loan being  repurchased or substituted  for
 and the  Grantor  Trustee on behalf of the  Grantor  Trust  shall  execute  and
 deliver  such  instruments  of  transfer or  assignment  prepared by the Master
 Servicer,  in each case without recourse,  as shall be necessary to vest in the
 Seller or its designee such Home Loan released  pursuant  hereto and thereafter
 such Home Loan shall not be an asset of the Grantor Trust.

               It is understood  and agreed that the obligation of the Seller to
 cure any breach,  or to repurchase or substitute for, any Home Loan as to which
 such a breach has occurred and is continuing  shall  constitute the sole remedy
 respecting  such breach  available to the  Purchaser,  the Issuer,  the Grantor
 Trust Certificateholder,  the Certificateholder (or the Owner Trustee on behalf
 of the  Certificateholder)  and the  Noteholders  (or the Indenture  Trustee on
 behalf of the Noteholders) against the Seller.

               It  is  understood  and  agreed  that  the   representations  and
 warranties  set  forth  in this  Section  3.1  shall  survive  delivery  of the
 respective Mortgage Files to the Grantor Trustee, or the Custodian.

 Trust  Certificateholder,  as assignee of the  Purchaser,  in, to and under the
 Home Loans  against all claims of third parties  claiming  through or under the
 Seller; provided,  however, that nothing in this Section 4.1 shall be deemed to
 apply to any Liens for  municipal  or other local taxes and other  governmental
 charges if such taxes or governmental  charges shall not at the time be due and
 payable or if the Seller shall currently be contesting the validity  thereof in
 good faith by appropriate proceedings.

                                    ARTICLE V

 accordance therewith.

                                   ARTICLE VI

 liability  is  expressly  waived  and  released  as  a  condition  of,  and  as
 consideration for, the execution of this Agreement. Except as and to the extent
 expressly provided herein or in the Servicing  Agreement,  the Seller shall not
 be under any liability to the Grantor Trust,  the Grantor  Trustee,  the Trust,
 the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Securityholders. The Seller and
 any director,  officer,  employee or agent of the Seller may rely in good faith
 on any document of any kind prima facie properly  executed and submitted by any
 Person respecting any matters arising hereunder.

               Section 8.5  Relationship  of Parties.  Nothing herein  contained
 shall be deemed or construed to create a partnership  or joint venture  between
 the parties  hereto,  and the  services  of the Seller  shall be rendered as an
 independent contractor and not as agent for the Purchaser.

               Section 8.6  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one
 or  more   counterparts  and  by  the  different  parties  hereto  on  separate
 counterparts,  each of  which,  when so  executed,  shall  be  deemed  to be an

 agreement.

               Section 8.7 Further Agreements. The Purchaser and the Seller each
 agree  to  execute  and  deliver  to  the  other  such  additional   documents,
 instruments  or agreements as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the
 purposes of this Agreement.

               Section 8.8 Intention of the Parties.  It is the intention of the
 parties that the Purchaser is purchasing,  and the Seller is selling,  the Home
 Loans,  rather than a loan by the  Purchaser to the Seller  secured by the Home
 Loans. Accordingly, the parties hereto each intend to treat the transaction for
 federal  income tax  purposes  as a sale by the  Seller,  and a purchase by the
 Purchaser,  of the Home Loans.  The Purchaser will have the right to review the
 Home Loans and the Related  Documents to determine the  characteristics  of the
 Home Loans which will affect the federal income tax  consequences of owning the
 Home Loans and the Seller will cooperate  with all reasonable  requests made by
 the Purchaser in the course of such review.

 Seller,  Purchaser and their respective successors and assigns. The obligations
 of the Seller under this  Agreement  cannot be assigned or delegated to a third
 party  without  the consent of the  Purchaser,  which  consent  shall be at the
 Purchaser's sole discretion,  except that the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
 that the Seller may assign its  obligations  hereunder to any  Affiliate of the
 Seller,  to any Person  succeeding to the business of the Seller, to any Person
 into which the Seller is merged and to any Person  resulting  from any  merger,
 conversion or  consolidation to which the Seller is a party. The parties hereto
 acknowledge  that the  Purchaser is acquiring the Home Loans for the purpose of
 transferring  them to the  Grantor  Trust in  exchange  for the  Grantor  Trust
 Certificate  which will be backed by the Home Loans, and then  transferring the
 Grantor  Trust  Certificate  to the  Issuer,  which  will  issue a  Certificate
 representing  interests in and Notes secured by the Grantor Trust  Certificate.
 As an  inducement  to the  Purchaser  to purchase  the Home  Loans,  the Seller
 acknowledges and consents to (i) the assignment by the Purchaser to the Grantor
 Trustee of all of the  Purchaser's  rights against the Seller  pursuant to this
 Agreement  insofar  as such  rights  relate to Home  Loans  transferred  to the
 Grantor  Trustee  and to the  enforcement  or  exercise  of any right or remedy
 against the Seller  pursuant to this Agreement by the Grantor  Trustee and (ii)
 the Grantor  Trustee's  assignment  of its  interest in this  Agreement  to the
 Issuer and the enforcement by the Indenture  Trustee (as pledgee of the Grantor
 Trust  Certificate) or the Issuer (or the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer
 or the  Certificateholder) of any such right or remedy against the Seller. Such
 enforcement of a right or remedy by the Grantor Trustee, the Indenture Trustee,
 the Issuer or the Owner Trustee as applicable,


                                       14

 shall  have the same  force  and  effect  as if the  right or  remedy  had been
 enforced or exercised by the Purchaser directly.

               Section 8.10 Survival.  The  representations  and warranties made
 herein by the Seller and the  provisions of Article VI hereof shall survive the
 purchase of the Home Loans hereunder.
