                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

                    SUBSCRIPTION AND STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This Subscription and Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into
as of the 22nd day of November, 2002, by and among National Waterworks Holdings,
a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and the persons set forth on the

         WHEREAS, the Purchasers wish to purchase from the Company, and the
Company wishes to issue and sell to the Purchasers shares of the Company's class
B common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class B Common Stock").

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises,
representations, warranties, covenants and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound,
mutually agree as follows:

the Company does hereby agree to sell to the Purchasers concurrently with the
Closing, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock set forth below the name
of each Purchaser on the signature pages hereto (collectively, the "Shares") for
the total purchase price set forth below the name of each Purchaser on the

Common Stock hereunder shall occur at a closing (the "Closing") to be held

Filter Corporation and National Waterworks, Inc. (f/k/a Blue Acquisition Corp.).
Payment of the Purchase Price shall be made by each Purchaser (against receipt
of a share certificate delivered by the Company) to the Company or its designee
at the Closing by delivery of a wire transfer of same day funds denominated in
U.S. dollars, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing with the Company.

                                   ARTICLE II

                  Representations and Warranties of the Company

         The Company represents and warrants to each Purchaser that:

         2.1 Organization and Standing. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted.
<PAGE>
         2.2 Authorization. All corporate action on the part of the Company
necessary for the authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company, and for the authorization, issuance and delivery of
the Shares being sold under this Agreement, has been taken. This Agreement, when
executed and delivered by all parties hereto, shall constitute the valid and
legally binding obligation of the Company, except to the extent the
enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy laws, insolvency laws,
reorganization laws, moratorium laws or other laws affecting creditors' rights
generally or by general equitable principles.

         2.3 Validity of Shares. The Shares, when issued, sold and delivered in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, shall be duly and validly issued,
and fully paid and nonassessable.

         2.4 Securities Act. The sale of Shares in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement (assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Sponsor contained in Article III hereof) is exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act").

                                   ARTICLE III

                  Representations, Warranties and Agreements of

                                 the Purchasers

         Each Purchaser, separately and not jointly, represents and warrants to
the Company and each other Purchaser that:

         3.1 Authorization. This Agreement, when executed and delivered by it,
will constitute its valid and legally binding obligation, except to the extent
the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy laws, insolvency laws,
reorganization laws, moratorium laws or other laws affecting creditors' rights
generally or by general equitable principles.

         3.2      Investment Representations.

                  (a) The Shares to be received by it will be acquired by it for
investment for its own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view
to the sale or distribution of any part thereof in violation of applicable
federal and state securities laws, and it has no current intention of selling,
granting participation in or otherwise distributing the same, in each case, in
violation of applicable federal and state securities laws. By executing this
Agreement, such Purchaser further represents that it does not have any contract,
undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or grant
participation to such person, or to any third person, with respect to any of the
Shares, in each case, in violation of applicable federal and state securities
laws.

                  (b) Such Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been
registered under the 1933 Act on the basis that the sale provided for in this
Agreement and the issuance of securities hereunder is exempt from registration
under the 1933 Act pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof and regulations issued
thereunder.

                  (c) It has such knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment. Such Purchaser further represents that it has had access, during the
course of the transactions contemplated hereby and prior to its purchase of
Shares, to the same kind of information that is specified in Part I of a
registration statement under the 1933 Act and that it has had, during the course
of the transactions contemplated hereby and prior to its purchase of the Shares,
the opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers from, the Company
concerning the terms and conditions of the offering and to obtain additional
information (to the extent the Company possessed such information or could
acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense) necessary to verify the
accuracy of any information furnished to it or to which it had access. Such
Purchaser understands that no federal or state agency has passed upon this
investment or upon the Company, nor has any such agency made any finding or
determination as to this investment.

                  (d) Such Purchaser understands that the Shares may not be
sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of without registration under the 1933
Act or an exemption therefrom, and that in the absence of an effective
registration statement covering the Shares or an available exemption from
registration under the 1933 Act, the Shares must be held indefinitely. Such
Purchaser must be prepared to bear the economic risk of this investment for an
indefinite period of time. In particular, such Purchaser acknowledges that it is
aware that the Shares may not be sold pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the
1933 Act unless all of the conditions of that Rule are met. Among the current
conditions for use of Rule 144 by certain holders is the availability to the
public of current information about the Company. Such information is not now
available, and the Company has no current plans to make such information
available. Such Purchaser represents that, in the absence of an effective
registration statement covering the Shares, it will sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of the Shares only in a manner consistent with its representations set
forth herein and then only in accordance with the Stockholders' Agreement
referred to in Article VI.

                  (e) Such Purchaser acknowledges that this investment is not
recommended for investors who have any need for a current return on this
investment or who cannot bear the risk of losing their entire investment. Such
Purchaser acknowledges that: (i) it has adequate means of providing for its
current needs and possible personal contingencies and has no need for liquidity
in this investment; (ii) its commitment to investments which are not readily
marketable is not disproportionate to its net worth; and (iii) its investment in
the Shares will not cause its overall financial commitments to become excessive.
