<p align="left"><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> ICI today issues an update on
  current trading for the first quarter of 2003. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> Group sales and cash flow for
  the quarter are both expected to be satisfactory, in spite of continuing challenging
  trading conditions. Whilst Paints is performing in line with our expectations
  and Uniqema continues to experience difficult conditions, as in Q4, Group trading
  performance so far this year has been impacted by two principal factors:</font></p>

</table>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> As a result ICI expects Q1 profit
  before taxation, before exceptionals and goodwill amortisation, to be around
  &pound;50m in comparison with last year&#8217;s &pound;66m.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="sans-serif"><u>National Starch</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> Petrochemical-based raw material
  prices have risen rapidly in Q1. To address this, National Starch has implemented
  and is continuing to implement price increases across its Adhesive and Specialty
  Polymer businesses. Given the inevitable lag in pricing to offset raw material
  cost increases, the benefit of improved pricing will be limited in Q1. Consequently,
  Q1 trading profit is expected to be around &pound;39m (Q1 2002: &pound;55m).
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> Cost reduction programmes are
  being initiated.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> <u>Quest</u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> Quest reported sales in Q1 are
  expected to be some 10% below 2002.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> As reported at the time of the
  Q2 2002 results, Quest experienced production problems at its Naarden, Netherlands
  facility, as a result of systems changes. In response, a series of actions were
  initiated to tackle these production problems and restore customer service levels.
  Customer service levels in Q1 are now better than prior year comparators. As
  indicated at the full year 2002 results, we continue to forecast a one-off cost
  impact of less than &pound;5m in the current year relating to these problems.</font></p>

<hr noshade align="center" width="100%" size="2">
<div style="page-break-before:always"></div>
<page>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> However, Q1 sales for the European
  food business are now expected to be around 20% lower than the comparable period
  last year, mainly as a result of business lost following the customer service
  problems in 2002. This is the main additional contributor to a forecast reduction
  in Quest&#8217;s Q1 trading profit from &pound;29m in 2002 to around &pound;9m
  this year.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> Further action is being taken
  in order to sustain the improvements in customer service, restore market position
  and reduce costs. These include:</font></p>

    the year, were &pound;6,125m, 5% lower than 2001 (&pound;6,425m in 2001 and
    &pound;6,415m in 2000 or &pound;7,748m including discontinued operations).
    The lower sales in 2002 were largely the consequence of divestments, principally
    in the Regional and Industrial businesses, and adverse foreign exchange translation
    effects.</font></p>
  <p> <font size=2 face="sans-serif">International Business sales, at &pound;5,543m,
    were 1% ahead of 2001 on a comparable basis. Growth resumed in North America
    and remained strong in Asia, more than offsetting lower sales in Latin America,
    where economic conditions remained challenging. Sales in Europe were slightly
    ahead of the prior year. Each of the International Businesses delivered comparable
    sales growth, with National Starch and Performance Specialties both 2% ahead,
    and Paints and Quest both 1% ahead of last year.</font></p>
  <p> <font size=2 face="sans-serif">As reported sales for the International Businesses
    were 2% below 2001 (2001 &pound;5,645m; 2000 &pound;5,570m), with the effects
    of foreign exchange translation (&#150;2%), and divestments in Performance

    for the year, at &pound;543m, (2001 &pound;569m; 2000 &pound;600m) was only
    1% lower than 2001 on a comparable basis. Paints and National Starch both
    made good progress in difficult conditions, and were up 9% and 5% respectively
    on a comparable basis. However, comparable trading profit was 23% lower for
    Quest, which was impacted by supply chain problems, and 24% lower for Performance
    Specialties, with Uniqema being particularly affected by rising raw material

    a &pound;10m trading loss for the year, &pound;14m lower than in 2001 (2000

    losses from Huntsman International Holdings LLC (which ceased to be accounted
    for as an associate from 17 June 2002) were offset by losses in Irish Fertilizer
    Industries (which went into liquidation in November 2002). The Group result
    included the Group&#146;s share of operating profit before exceptional items
    from associates of &pound;18m (2001 &pound;57m; 2000 &pound;100m) less net
    interest payable by associates of &pound;28m (2001 &pound;67m; 2000 &pound;60m).</font></p>

    for the year was &pound;123m compared to &pound;162m in 2001 (2000 &pound;202m
    excluding exceptional interest income), primarily as a result of lower average
    net debt following the successful completion of the Rights Issue, and lower
    interest rates during the year.</font></p>

    lower than last year (2000 &pound;450m). Lower trading profits for the International
    Businesses, by &pound;26m, and a loss for Regional and Industrial businesses
    were almost entirely offset by the lower interest costs. Profit before tax,
    but after goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was &pound;317m compared
    to &pound;205m in 2001 (2000 &pound;87m loss, including the provision for
    loss on the sale of the Chlor-Chemicals, Klea and Crosfield operations of

  <p> <font size=2 face="sans-serif">During 2002 the adverse currency translation
