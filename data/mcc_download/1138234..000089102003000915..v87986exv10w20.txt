                           DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

             (Amended and Restated Effective as of January 1, 2002)

                                    PREAMBLE

      The Plan was previously established effective December 15, 1993, to
provide deferred compensation benefits to eligible executives and key management
employees of AT&T Wireless and its Affiliated Companies that participate in the
Plan. The Plan was subsequently amended and restated effective December 1, 1995,
and again, effective as of December 1, 1996, and again, effective August 1,
2001. The Plan is amended and restated herein primarily (i) to allow for the
timely deferral of restricted stock units and retention incentive awards and
(ii) to incorporate a prior amendment with respect to 401(k) make-up
contributions and installment payments.

                                       1.
                           PURPOSE AND EFFECTIVE DATE

1.1. PURPOSE

      The purpose of the Plan is to promote the success of AT&T Wireless and its
Affiliated Companies that participate in the Plan by:

      (a) Providing selected executives with the ability to defer compensation
on a pre-tax basis in order to permit them to supplement their retirement
savings;

      (b) Requiring Senior Executives to defer annual compensation in excess of
one million dollars ($1,000,000) until the taxable year in which such amounts
would be deductible by the Company, thereby preserving the federal income tax
deduction for the Company and increasing the employees' personal interest in the
continued success and growth of the Company;

      (c) Providing executives participating in the LTIP with a mechanism
effective January 1, 2002, for deferring receipt of Stock Option Gains,
Performance Share Awards, and Restricted Stock Awards otherwise payable under
the LTIP, thereby providing an effective means for executives to maintain
beneficial ownership of AWS Stock; and

      (d) Providing selected executives with 401(k) Make-Up Contributions in
order to allocate a 401(k) contribution that more fairly corresponds to their
compensation.

      It is intended that the Plan provide deferred compensation for "a select
group of management or highly compensated employees" within the meaning of
Sections 201, 301, and 401 of ERISA and, therefore, to be exempt from the
provisions of Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Title I of ERISA.

1.2. EFFECTIVE DATE

      The amended and restated Plan, as set forth herein, shall be effective
January 1, 2002 (except as otherwise stated herein), and shall constitute the
amendment and restatement of the Prior Plan.

1.3. TRANSITION FROM PRIOR PLAN

      Amounts accrued under the Prior Plan shall, subject to certain transition
rules and account mapping principles set forth herein, become the initial
balances due to Participants and Beneficiaries under this Plan. Any elections
made by Participants under the Prior Plan shall continue in full force and
effect, except as expressly provided herein.

Period by the Committee must be filed with the Committee during the applicable
special Enrollment Period. Failure to timely file a Cash Compensation Deferral
Agreement during the applicable Enrollment Period shall preclude the Covered
Employee from deferring any Salary or Bonus, as applicable, during the Deferral
Period that follows immediately after the end of the applicable Enrollment
Period.

      4.2.5 EFFECTIVE DATE OF CASH COMPENSATION DEFERRAL AGREEMENTS. The

      Period and shall be applicable to the Covered Employee's Salary earned and
      payable during the Deferral Period that begins on such date.

            (c) A Cash Compensation Deferral Agreement filed for the deferral of
      Bonus during the normal Enrollment Period in July of a Plan Year or a
      special Enrollment Period (if any) designated during a Plan Year for a
      Newly-Designated Covered Employee shall become effective as of the
      immediately following January 1 and shall be applicable to the Covered
      Employee's Bonus payable during the Deferral Period that begins on such

as of the last day of the Deferral Period to which the Cash Compensation
Deferral Agreement is applicable.

      4.2.6 VALUATION FUND ALLOCATIONS. At the time the Covered Employee files
his Cash Compensation Deferral Agreement with the Committee, the Participant

Allocation for the amounts deferred under the Cash Compensation Deferral
Agreement and allocable to each Deferred Cash Compensation Account.

      4.2.8 MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM DEFERRAL AMOUNTS - BONUS. A Covered Employee may
elect to defer from a minimum of ten percent (10%) to a maximum of one hundred
percent (100%) of each payment of his Bonus.

      4.2.9 PAYMENT OF PAYROLL TAXES. In the event FICA and all other
payroll-related taxes cannot be paid from a Covered Employee's nondeferred Cash
Compensation, the amount of a Covered Employee's deferred Cash Compensation
shall be reduced until the Company can make all FICA and other payroll-related
tax payments for the Covered Employee from the Covered Employee's nondeferred
Cash Compensation.

      4.2.10 IRREVOCABILITY OF CASH COMPENSATION DEFERRAL AGREEMENTS. Once a
Participant has filed a Cash Compensation Deferral Agreement with the Committee,
that Deferral Agreement shall remain in effect for the applicable Deferral
Period and shall be irrevocable throughout such Deferral Period, except as

Disability; or (ii) incurs a Termination of Service.

DEFERRAL AGREEMENTS. In the event that a Covered Employee files a Cash
Compensation Deferral Agreement with the Committee that contains information

of the Committee, is incomplete or inaccurate, the Committee shall be authorized
to make the applicable assumptions (if any) set forth in Appendix "D".

4.3. EMERGENCY BENEFIT; WAIVER OF DEFERRALS

      4.3.1 PAYMENT OF EMERGENCY BENEFIT. In the event that the Committee, upon
written petition of the Participant (or the Beneficiary of a deceased
Participant), determines that the Participant (or the Beneficiary of a deceased
Participant) has suffered an unforeseeable financial emergency (as defined in
Section 4.3.3), the Company shall pay to the Participant (or the Beneficiary of
a deceased Participant), as soon as possible following such determination, an
amount from any of the Participant's (or Beneficiary's) Deferred Cash
Compensation Accounts not in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy the
unforeseeable financial emergency. If the amount necessary to satisfy the
unforeseeable financial emergency is less than Ten Thousand dollars ($10,000),
no payment shall be made under this Section 4.3.

      4.3.2 WAIVER OF CASH COMPENSATION DEFERRAL AGREEMENT. In the event that
the Committee, upon written petition of the Participant, determines that the
Participant has suffered an unforeseeable financial emergency (as defined in

waiver of a Participant's Cash Compensation Deferral Agreement pursuant

      4.3.3 DEFINITION OF UNFORESEEABLE FINANCIAL EMERGENCY. For purposes of
Section 4.3, an "unforeseeable financial emergency" is an unanticipated
emergency that is caused by an event beyond the control of the Participant (or
the Beneficiary of a deceased Participant) and that would result in severe
financial hardship to the individual if the emergency distribution were not
permitted. An unforeseeable financial emergency does not include changes in
Earnings crediting rates under the Plan or changes in the financial status of
the Company.

      4.3.4 SUSPENSION OF RIGHT TO MAKE DEFERRALS. Any Participant who receives
an emergency benefit distribution pursuant to Section 4.3.1 must cease all
voluntary deferrals of Cash Compensation under the Plan effective as of the date
of the emergency benefit distribution and may not resume or elect to make any
new voluntary deferrals of Cash Compensation under the Plan until the first
Deferral Period beginning at least twelve (12) months following receipt of the
emergency benefit distribution.

4.4. STOCK OPTION GAIN DEFERRAL

      4.4.1 STOCK OPTION GAIN DEFERRAL ELECTION. A Covered Employee can elect to
defer receipt of Net Shares of AWS Stock resulting from an exercise of an
exercisable Stock Option Grant awarded to the Covered Employee if (i) the
Covered Employee files a Stock Option Gain Deferral Agreement with the Committee
at least six (6) months in advance of the Covered Employee's exercise of the
stock option; (ii) such Covered Employee pays, through an attestation acceptable
to the Committee, the exercise price in shares of AWS Stock that is
non-compensable or that the Covered Employee owns and has owned continuously for
the six (6) month period ending on the date of exercise of the stock option; and
(iii) such Covered Employee complies with all other rules related to the
deferral of Stock Option Gains that the Committee may establish. A Stock Option
Gain Deferral Agreement shall expire at any time elected by a Covered Employee
and shall automatically be terminated (only on a prospective basis with respect
to subsequent stock option exercises) on a Covered Employee's termination of
employment, on a Change in Control, or at any other time determined by the
Committee. At the time the Covered Employee files the Stock Option Gain Deferral
Agreement with the Committee, the Covered Employee can also choose to use some
of the shares subject to the stock option to satisfy any FICA or any other taxes
due upon the stock option exercise.

      4.4.2 CONTENTS OF STOCK OPTION GAIN DEFERRAL AGREEMENT. A Stock Option
Gain Deferral Agreement shall be made in writing and in such form and manner as
may be prescribed by the Committee. The Stock Option Gain Deferral Agreement
shall specify such items as the Committee may reasonably require, including
without limitation (i) the identity of the Stock Option Grant that is subject to
the deferral election (by reference to the grant date, the number of shares
granted, and the exercise price); (ii) the expiration date (if any) of the Stock
Option Gain Deferral Agreement; (iii) the time and form of payment from the
Participant's Deferred Shares Account; and (iv) whether any shares from the
Stock Option Grant will be withheld to pay FICA or other taxes as set forth in
Section 6.12.

             AT&T WIRELESS SERVICES, INC. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN


      4.4.3 DEFERRAL OF NET SHARES. A Stock Option Gain Deferral Agreement may
expire according to its terms. A Covered Employee may choose to defer receipt of
all or only a portion of the Net Shares to be received upon exercise of the
Stock Option Grant; provided, however, that an award will not be deferred if it
will expire, by its terms, before the end of the six (6) month period commencing
with the date that the Stock Option Gain Deferral Agreement is filed with the
Committee. If only a portion of the Net Shares is deferred, the portion of the
Net Shares that is not deferred will be distributed under the LTIP or such other
long term incentive plan of AT&T Wireless as may be in effect at the time of
exercise. If a Stock Option Grant, as to which a Covered Employee has made a
Stock Option Gain Deferral Agreement, terminates prior to the exercise date
selected by the Covered Employee, or if the Covered Employee dies or fails to
deliver personally owned shares in payment of the exercise price, then the
Covered Employee's Stock Option Gain Deferral Agreement shall not become
effective. Upon exercise of a Stock Option Grant covered by a properly filed
Stock Option Gain Deferral Agreement, the Company shall not deliver the shares
of AWS Stock. Following such deferral election, the number of deferred shares of
AWS Stock will be credited as Share Equivalents under the Covered Employee's
Deferred Shares Account under the Plan. The Committee may establish additional
procedures to effect the deferral of Stock Option Gains.

      4.4.4 SHARE EQUIVALENTS. The deferred amounts of Net Shares will be
treated as though invested in Share Equivalents, and the Company's liability
must be satisfied in shares of AWS Stock.

      4.4.5 AT&T WIRELESS SERVICES, INC. LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN. The Plan
governs the deferral of receipt of AWS Stock issuable upon the exercise of stock
options for AWS Stock. The stock options are governed by the LTIP or such other
AT&T Wireless long term incentive plan under which they are granted. No stock
options or shares of AWS Stock are authorized to be issued under the Plan. No
Participant who elects under the Plan to defer the receipt of AWS Stock issuable
upon the exercise of stock options will have any rights as a stockholder of AT&T
Wireless with respect to allocations of Share Equivalents made to his Deferred
Shares Account, except the right to receive Dividend Equivalent allocations
under Section 5.3.5.

4.5. DEFERRAL OF PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS

period that contains the vesting date for a Restricted Stock Award, to defer
receipt of not less than five percent (5%) or more than one hundred percent
(100%) of a Restricted Stock Award. A Covered Employee may make such election by
filing a Restricted Stock Deferral Agreement.

      4.6.2 CONTENTS OF RESTRICTED STOCK DEFERRAL AGREEMENT. A Restricted Stock
Deferral Agreement shall be made in writing and in such form and manner as may

limitation (i) the identity of the Restricted Stock Award that is subject to the
deferral election (by reference to the award date); and (ii) the expiration date
of the Restricted Stock Deferral Agreement (if any).

with the Committee in such form and manner as may be required by the Committee.

Mandatory Deferral Agreement shall further provide for the Senior Executive's
Mandatory Deferrals to be bound by the terms of the Plan and such other rules
and procedures deemed advisable by the Committee. A Mandatory Deferral Agreement
shall be effective as of the first pay period in the first taxable year during
which the Senior Executive's Total Compensation would, but for the application
of the Mandatory Deferral provisions of the Plan, exceed one million dollars
($1,000,000) for the taxable year. Except for changes in the form of payment
election made pursuant to Section 6.7, a Senior Executive's Mandatory Deferral
Agreement (i) shall continue to be effective for all Plan Years that the
Participant is a Senior Executive; and (ii) shall be irrevocable until the
Senior Executive has received distribution of all his Accounts under the Plan.

      4.7.2 PRIORITY FOR MANDATORY DEFERRALS. A Senior Executive who is subject
to Mandatory Deferrals for a particular taxable year shall have his Total
Compensation (to the extent not otherwise deferred herein) reduced in the
following order of priority until his Total Compensation for the taxable year
does not exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000):

the Participant to reflect the different types of Deferred Cash Compensation
Accounts described in Section 5.2.2 that are chosen by the Participant (or
otherwise established through the mapping process provided for in Section
5.1.1), and the Participant shall designate the portion of each deferral of Cash
Compensation that is to be credited to his respective Deferred Cash Compensation
Accounts. The Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts established and maintained
under the Plan shall be used solely to calculate the amount payable to the
respective Participants under the Plan and shall not constitute a separate fund
of assets. Each Deferred Cash Compensation Account established for a Participant
shall be denominated on a monetary basis.

      5.2.2 TYPES OF DEFERRED CASH COMPENSATION ACCOUNTS. Subject to the terms

maximum extent possible, and any remaining amount shall reduce the

manner determined by the Committee.

      5.2.5 DETERMINATION OF DEFERRED CASH COMPENSATION ACCOUNT VALUES. Each of
a Participant's Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts as of the close of each
Determination Date shall consist of the balance of the particular Deferred Cash
Compensation Account as of the immediately preceding Determination Date,
adjusted as follows:

            (a) NEW DEFERRALS OF CASH COMPENSATION. Each Deferred Cash
      Compensation Account shall be increased by any deferred Cash Compensation
      credited to such Account in accordance with Section 5.2.4 since the prior
      Determination Date in the proportion designated by the Participant in his
      Cash Compensation Deferral Agreement, except that no amount of new
      deferrals of Cash Compensation shall be credited to an Account at the same
      time that a distribution or withdrawal is to be made from that same
      Account.

            (b) DISTRIBUTIONS AND WITHDRAWALS. Each Deferred Cash Compensation
      Account shall be reduced by the amount of each benefit payment made from
      that Account pursuant to Article 6 since the prior Determination Date.
      Benefit payments (whether distributions or withdrawals) shall be deemed to
      have been made proportionally from each of the Valuation Funds to which
      such Deferred Cash Compensation Account is allocated, based on the
      proportion that such Valuation Fund bears to the sum of all Valuation
      Funds among which such Account is allocated by that Participant as of the
      Determination Date immediately preceding the date of payment.

            (c) EARNINGS. Each Deferred Cash Compensation Account shall be
      increased or decreased by the Earnings credited to such Account since the
      prior Determination Date as though the balance of that Account had been
      invested in the applicable Valuation Funds designated by the Participant
      in his Valuation Fund Allocation applicable to the accounts on such
      Determination Date.

      5.2.6 RESTRICTIONS ON REALLOCATIONS AMONG ACCOUNTS. Once an amount of Cash
Compensation deferred by a Participant under the Plan and any Earnings thereon
have been credited to one of the Participant's Deferred Cash Compensation

Account shall be credited with the number of Share Equivalents equal to the
number of share of AWS Stock the Participant would have otherwise received had

Restricted Stock Award.

      5.3.5 DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS. Dividend Equivalents equal to one hundred
percent (100%) of the dividends payable on AWS Stock shall be credited to a
Participant's Deferred Shares Account based on the number of Share Equivalents
held in such Participant's Deferred Shares Account on the particular AWS Stock
dividend date. Dividend Equivalents credited to the Deferred Shares Account
shall be reinvested in Share Equivalents based on the Fair Market Value of AWS
Stock on the particular dividend date. No fractional Share Equivalents will be
credited.

      5.3.6 NO ALLOCATION AMONG VALUATION FUNDS. The balance in a Participant's
Deferred Shares Account shall be credited with Share Equivalents at all times. A

outstanding shares of AWS Stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split,
recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, reorganization, combination
or exchange of shares, or other similar corporate change, the Committee shall
make the appropriate adjustment in each Participant's Deferred Shares Account.

      5.4.4 DETERMINATION OF ACCOUNT VALUES. A Participant's 401(k) Make-Up
Contributions Account as of the close of each Determination Date shall consist

      distributions or withdrawals) shall be deemed to have been made
      proportionally from each of the Valuation Funds to which such Account is
      allocated, based on the proportion that such Valuation Fund bears to the
      sum of all Valuation Funds among which such Account is allocated by that
      Participant as of the Determination Date immediately prior to the date of
      payment.

            (c) EARNINGS. Such Account shall be increased or decreased by the
      Earnings credited to such Account since the prior Determination Date as

      Date.

      5.4.5 RESTRICTIONS ON REALLOCATIONS AMONG ACCOUNTS. Once an amount has

Account.

      5.5.1 PURPOSE OF VALUATION FUNDS. The Committee shall designate one or
more Valuation Funds from time to time. The Valuation Funds are used solely to
calculate the Earnings that are credited to each Participant's Deferred Cash
Compensation Accounts and 401(k) Make-Up Contributions Account in accordance
with Article 5, and do not represent, nor should they be interpreted as,
investments in the underlying Valuation Funds or convey any beneficiary interest
on the part of the Participant or Beneficiary in any asset or other property of
the Company. The Valuation Funds are used solely to calculate the Earnings that
are credited to each Participant's Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts and
401(k) Make-Up Contributions Account in accordance with Article 5, and do not
represent, nor should they be interpreted as, investments in the underlying
investment funds or convey any beneficial interest on the part of the
Participant or Beneficiary in any asset or other property of the Company. The
determination of the increase or decrease in the performance of each Valuation
Fund shall be made by the Committee in its reasonable discretion.

      5.5.2 DETERMINATION OF VALUATION FUNDS TO BE OFFERED TO PARTICIPANTS. The
Committee shall have the sole discretion to determine the type, character, and
number of Valuation Funds and to select the Valuation Funds to be made available
to Participants or Beneficiaries from time to time. The Committee may change or
eliminate, on a prospective basis, the Valuation Funds made available hereunder
from time to time. The Committee shall periodically distribute (or otherwise
communicate) an updated list of the Valuation Funds to Participants and
Beneficiaries. The Valuation Funds available to Participants and Beneficiaries
under the Plan as of January 1, 2002 are listed in Appendix "C".

      5.5.3 PARTICIPANT VALUATION FUND ALLOCATIONS. A Participant or Beneficiary
shall make a Valuation Fund Allocation to designate, at a time and in a manner
acceptable to the Committee, one or more Valuation Funds for each of a
Participant's Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts for the sole purpose of
determining the amount of Earnings to be credited or debited to such Account as
if such Account held actual assets and such assets were investment funds
underlying the respective Valuation Funds. Such Valuation Fund Allocation shall
designate (i) the Deferred Cash Compensation Account to which it applies; (ii)
the portion of each Deferred Cash Compensation Account balance that shall be
allocated among the available Valuation Funds (in whole percentages); and (iii)
the portion of each future deferral of Cash Compensation made to each Deferred
Cash Compensation Account that shall be allocated among the available Valuation
Funds (in whole percentages). Any Valuation Fund Allocation shall apply to each
succeeding deferral of Cash Compensation to a Deferred Cash Compensation Account
until such time as the Participant or Beneficiary shall file a new Valuation
Fund Allocation applicable to such Deferred Cash Compensation Account with the
Committee. If a Participant or Beneficiary fails, for any reason, to make a
valid Valuation Fund Allocation for any of his Accounts, the Participant or
Beneficiary shall be deemed to have elected the Money Market Valuation Fund for
the entire Account balance until such time as the Participant or Beneficiary
makes a valid Valuation Fund Allocation. This Section 5.5.3 shall also generally
apply to Valuation Fund Allocations with respect to a Participant's 401(k)
Make-Up Contributions Account.

      5.5.4 COMMITTEE TO ESTABLISH VALUATION FUND ALLOCATION PROCEDURES. Any
Valuation Fund Allocation shall be subject to such rules as the Committee may
prescribe, including, without limitation, rules concerning (i) the form, time,
and manner for filing the Valuation Fund Allocation with the Committee; (ii) the
minimum percentage of the total Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts that may be
allocated to any specific Valuation Fund choice; (iii) the frequency of changing
Valuation Fund directions by filing a new Valuation Fund Allocation with the
Committee; and (iv) the method of crediting Earnings for any portion of a
Deferred Cash Compensation Account or 401(k) Make-Up Contributions Account which
is not covered by any valid Valuation Fund Allocation.

      5.5.5 CHANGES IN VALUATION FUND ALLOCATION. A Participant or Beneficiary
may change his Valuation Fund Allocation for any designated Deferred Cash
Compensation Account or 401(k) Make-Up Contributions Account by making a new
Valuation Fund Allocation for the particular Account at any time. Any modified
Valuation Fund Allocation submitted via the Plan's electronic Internet system
and received by the Committee or its designee by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time shall be
effective as of the next succeeding Determination Date. Any modified

Valuation Fund Allocation submitted to the Committee in paper form shall be
effective no later than the third Determination Date after the Determination
Date on which such form is received by the Committee.

      5.5.6 NO REQUIREMENT TO FOLLOW INVESTMENT REQUESTS. Neither the Committee
nor the Company shall be obligated to comply with, or be liable for the failure
to comply with, the investment requests of any Participant or Beneficiary that
are made in the form of a Valuation Fund Allocation. The Company shall have sole
discretion whether or not to invest any of the Company's funds (whether or not
in trust) in the manner requested by the Participant or Beneficiary, from time
to time, in his Valuation Fund Allocations. However, Earnings shall be credited
based on the Participant's or Beneficiary's Valuation Fund Allocation applicable
to his Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts and 401(k) Make-Up Contributions
Account, from time to time, whether or not the Committee actually invests funds
in accordance with the Participant's or Beneficiary's Valuation Fund Allocation.

      5.5.7 NO REQUIREMENT TO FUND ACCOUNTS. The Company shall not be required
to fund its obligations under the Plan in any manner and shall not be required
to invest the amounts credited to a Participant's Deferred Cash Compensation
Accounts or 401(k) Make-Up Contributions Account in any particular investment,
including any Valuation Funds. The Company may, without limitation, purchase
life insurance or any security or other property with respect to any or all of
its obligations under the Plan. Participants and Beneficiaries shall have no
right, title, or interest in any assets held by the Company (or any trust that
may be established and maintained pursuant to Section 9.1) by reason of a
Participant's participation in the Plan.

5.6. VESTING OF ACCOUNTS

      Each Participant shall at all times be one hundred percent (100%) vested
in his Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts and Deferred Shares Account. 401(k)
Make-Up Contributions shall be subject to the same vesting schedule as would
have applied to the underlying contributions in the 401(k) Plan (Matching
Contributions, Fixed Contributions and Employer Discretionary Contributions, as
defined in the 401(k) Plan) as of the date such Contributions are allocated to
the 401(k) Make-Up Contributions Account.

5.7. PARTICIPANT ACCOUNT STATEMENTS

      Each Participant shall be provided with a statement showing the balance in
the Participant's Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts, Deferred Shares Account,
and 401(k) Make-Up Contributions Account as of the last day of each calendar
quarter. Such statements shall be provided as soon as practicable, but no later

allowed to make a new Termination Distribution Election that shall be applicable
to all of the Participant's Accounts (other than a Deferred Benefit Account in

Participant changes (if ever) such Termination Distribution Election pursuant to
the provisions of Section 6.5.3 and Section 6.7.

as of July 31, 2001) at any time, and such Termination Distribution Election
shall apply to the distribution of all of the Participant's Accounts if he

Retirement or death). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 6.5.1
and this Section 6.5.3, if the Participant incurs a Termination of Service

Distribution Election shall supersede any prior Death Benefit Distribution
Election made by the Participant prior to August 1, 2001, for any of his
Deferred Benefit Accounts under the Prior Plan. If a Participant does not make a
new Death Benefit Distribution Election prior to August 1, 2001, the
Participant's Death Benefit Distribution Election effective as of August 1,
2001, shall be determined through application of the applicable mapping
principles set forth in Appendix "B". The "default" Death Benefit Distribution

6.7. CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION ELECTIONS

      A Participant may change the form of benefit payment designated in a
Distribution Election previously made pursuant to Section 6.3, 6.4, 6.5 or 6.6,
or the election of an In-Service Account Withdrawal Commencement Date previously
made pursuant to Section 6.4 by filing a new Distribution Election with the
Committee at any time, provided, however, that such new Distribution Election
shall be subject to the following conditions and limitations:

            (a) A change in the time or form of payment shall be effective only
      if the new Distribution Election is filed with the Committee at least
      twelve (12) full months prior to January 1 of the Plan Year during which
      payments from the Account to which the change applies is otherwise
      scheduled to commence and the Committee approves such Distribution
      Election.

            (b) An In-Service Withdrawal Election may be modified to delay, but
      not accelerate, an In-Service Withdrawal Commencement Date.

            (c) No Participant may change his election of an In-Service
      Withdrawal Commencement Date more than two (2) times after (i) the
      Participant's initial election of an In-Service Withdrawal Commencement
      Date (if such initial election is made on or after August 1, 2001); or
      (ii) the In-Service Withdrawal Election deemed to be in effect as of
      August 1, 2001 (due to mapping of elections pursuant to Section 6.4.1).

            (d) If a Participant changes the form of payment for an Account and
      then incurs a Termination of Service (other than due to death) within
      twelve (12) months of the date the applicable Distribution Election is
      changed, the previous Retirement Distribution Election or Termination
      Distribution Election, as applicable, for the Account shall be reinstated
      and apply to the distribution of the Account, provided that such prior
      Distribution Election had been in effect for at least twelve (12) months
      before it was revoked or changed.

            (e) No change in Distribution Election shall permit a Covered
      Employee to receive a distribution from any Account during the period in
      which he is a Senior Executive to the extent such distribution would cause
      the Senior Executive's Total Compensation to exceed one million dollars
      ($1,000,000) in a taxable year.

      Prior Plan, such monthly installments shall be converted to annual
      installments, effective February 1, 2002, by paying the aggregate monthly
      installments due and owing in a Plan Year in a single lump sum as soon as
      reasonably practicable after the beginning of such Plan Year, but in no
      event later than the date on which the first monthly installment for such
      Plan Year would have otherwise been paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing
      provisions of this Section 6.8.1(f) to the contrary, an affected
      Participant shall have the right to petition AT&T Wireless's Employee
      Compensation and Benefits Committee (or its successor), in writing, to

be made in the form of whole shares of AWS Stock, except that any fractional
shares shall be paid in cash.

      6.8.3 PAYMENT PURSUANT TO EFFECTIVE BENEFIT ELECTION. Subject to Sections
6.8.1(f) and 6.9.1, a Participant's latest applicable Distribution Election
filed with the Committee shall be effective for the entire Account balance to
which it pertains. If, at the time payment of benefits under this Plan becomes
due and payable, the Participant's most recent applicable Distribution Election
as to the form of payment was made within one (1) year of such payment, then the
most recent Distribution Election made by the Participant more than one (1) year
prior to the time of payment shall instead be used to determine the form of
payment.

      6.8.4 ELECTION OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF PAYMENTS. A Participant may make a
Retirement Distribution Election specifying a different form of payment for each
of his Retirement Accounts and an In-Service Withdrawal Election specifying a
different form of payment for each of his In-Service Withdrawal Accounts.

      6.8.5 NO VALID FORM OF PAYMENT ELECTION. In the event no valid
Distribution Election for the applicable distribution event exists at the time
of a Participant's death, Disability, Retirement, Termination of Service or
In-Service Withdrawal Commencement Date, as applicable, distribution of the
applicable Account shall be made in annual installments to the Participant (or
the Participant's Beneficiary if the Participant is deceased) over a period of
five (5) years.

      6.8.6 DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS. Any annual
installment payment from a Participant's Deferred Cash Compensation Account or
401(k) Make-Up Contributions Account shall be equal to the balance of the
Account on the December 31 immediately prior to the payment, multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is one (1) and the denominator of which
commences at the number of annual payments initially chosen by the Participant
and is reduced by one (1) in each succeeding year; provided, however, that for
the final installment payment from the Account, the entire remaining value of
the Account shall be distributed to the Participant (or Beneficiary of a
deceased Participant). Earnings on the unpaid balance of the Account from which
installment payments are being made shall continue to be credited to the Account
throughout the installment distribution period based on the most recent
Valuation Fund Allocation made for the Account by the Participant in accordance
with Section 5.5.

      6.8.7 SMALL ACCOUNT LUMP SUM PAYMENT RULE. Notwithstanding any
Distribution Election made by the Participant to the contrary, if the balance

Deferred Shares Account and 401(k) Make-Up Contributions Account as of the time
payments are to commence from any of such Accounts is less than Twenty-five
Thousand dollars ($25,000) in the aggregate, the remaining unpaid balance of
such Accounts shall be paid in a lump sum.

6.9. COMMENCEMENT OF BENEFIT PAYMENTS

      6.9.1 BENEFIT COMMENCEMENT EVENT OCCURS ON OR BEFORE JULY 31, 2001. If the
Retirement, Termination of Service, death, Disability or In-Service Withdrawal
Commencement Date of a Participant occurs on or before July 31, 2001, and the
distribution of the Participant's Account from which distribution is to be made
as a result of such event has not commenced as of July 31, 2001, then
commencement of payments under the Plan to the Participant (or Beneficiary of a
deceased Participant) shall begin as soon as administratively feasible within
sixty (60) days following the receipt of notice by the Committee of the event
which entitles the Participant (or Beneficiary of a deceased Participant) to
payments under this Plan. Any such payments shall be made in the form of payment
specified in the Participant's Distribution Election in effect on the date of
the Participant's Retirement, Termination of Service, death, Disability or
In-Service Withdrawal Commencement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6.9.1 to the contrary, to the extent the
Participant's Distribution Election contains an election of monthly installments
over a period of up to one-hundred and twenty (120) months, or, prior to August
1, 2001, the Participant did not file a valid Distribution Election (in which
case, under the terms of the Prior Plan, the form of payment is monthly
installments over a period of sixty (60) months), the form of payment shall be
deemed converted from monthly installments to annual installments by paying the
aggregate monthly installments due and owing in a Plan Year in a single lump sum
within sixty (60) days following the receipt of notice by the Committee of the
event which entitles the Participant (or Beneficiary of a deceased Participant)
to payments under the Plan and, for any subsequent Plan Year, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the beginning of such Plan Year.

      6.9.2 BENEFIT COMMENCEMENT EVENT OCCURS AFTER JULY 31, 2001. Payment of
benefits under the Plan to a Participant (or his Beneficiary if the Participant
is deceased) pursuant to Section 6.2 shall commence as soon as administratively
feasible (but in no event more than sixty (60) days) after the last day of the
Plan Year during which the Retirement, Termination of Service, death, or
In-Service Withdrawal Commencement Date of a Participant occurs which entitles a
Participant (or Beneficiary of a deceased Participant) to payments from one or
more Accounts under the Plan. If a Participant has elected to receive his
distribution in the form of annual installments, all subsequent annual
installments shall be made on approximately the same date each calendar year
thereafter for the remainder of the distribution period.

      6.9.3 SPECIAL BENEFIT COMMENCEMENT RULES WHEN BENEFIT COMMENCEMENT EVENT
OCCURS AFTER JULY 31, 2001. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.9.2 to
the contrary, a Participant shall have the right to petition the Committee, in
writing, to seek the commencement of the distribution of his Accounts within
sixty (60) days after his Termination of Service if:

            (a) The Participant was a Participant in the Plan on July 31, 2001;

            (b) The Participant incurs a Termination of Service during the
      period beginning August 1, 2001, and ending December 31, 2002;

            (c) The Participant's petition is applicable only to Cash
      Compensation Deferral Agreement filed prior to August 1, 2001;

            (d) Under the terms of the Plan in existence as of July 31, 2001,
      such Participant was entitled to have the distribution of his Accounts
      commence within sixty (60) days after Termination of Service; and

            (e) The Participant's petition establishes good reason (as
      determined by the Committee in is sole discretion) why the commencement of
      distribution of the Participant's Accounts should commence within sixty
      (60) days after the Participant's Termination of Service.

      If, upon receipt, the Committee approves any such petition, the
distribution of the Participant's Accounts shall commence within sixty (60) days
after the Participant's Termination of Service or as soon as administratively
possible thereafter in the form previously elected by the Participant at least
twelve (12) months prior to the Termination of Service by the Participant.

6.10. UNSCHEDULED LUMP-SUM WITHDRAWALS

      6.10.1 ELECTION OF UNSCHEDULED LUMP-SUM WITHDRAWALS. Notwithstanding any
Distribution Election to the contrary, any Participant (or Beneficiary of a
deceased Participant) shall have the right, at any time (including after
distribution from an Account has commenced pursuant to Section 6.2 and Section
6.9), to elect to receive an unscheduled withdrawal of part or all of his
Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts, including any Earnings credited to such
Accounts. Each unscheduled withdrawal election shall be made in a form and
manner acceptable to the Committee and shall be subject to the following
conditions and limitations:

            (a) The unscheduled withdrawal election must specify the Account or
      Accounts from which the amount is to be withdrawn and, if the withdrawal
      is to be made from more than one Account, the relative amounts to be
      withdrawn from each Account.

            (b) The unscheduled withdrawal election must specify the amount of
      an Account (in whole dollars) or the percentage of an Account (determined
      as of the most recent Determination Date) to be withdrawn.

            (c) Unless otherwise specified in the unscheduled withdrawal
      election, a partial withdrawal from an Account shall be made on a pro-rata
      basis from each Valuation Fund among which such Account is then allocated.

            (d) Payment of any unscheduled withdrawal under this Section 6.10.1
      shall be made in a single lump sum payment within thirty (30) days after
      the Committee's receipt of the unscheduled withdrawal election.

            (e) A Participant shall be limited to making no more than one
      unscheduled withdrawal election under this Section 6.10.1 during any Plan
      Year.

            (f) The minimum allowable amount of any unscheduled withdrawal under
      this Section 6.10.1 shall be Ten Thousand dollars ($10,000) (before the

             AT&T WIRELESS SERVICES, INC. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN


            (g) No Participant shall be eligible to receive an unscheduled
      withdrawal under this Section 6.10.1 if he is required to make Mandatory
      Deferrals under the Plan for that taxable year.

      6.10.2 UNSCHEDULED WITHDRAWAL PENALTY. The amount a Participant (or a
Beneficiary of a deceased Participant) elects to withdraw from any Deferred Cash
Compensation Account pursuant to Section 6.10.1 shall be subject to a ten
percent (10%) early withdrawal penalty. Such penalty shall apply to the value of
the amount being withdrawn as of the date of the distribution to the Participant
(or Beneficiary of a deceased Participant). In addition, if a Participant makes
an unscheduled withdrawal election pursuant to Section 6.10.1 while he is an
active employee of the Company, the Participant's Cash Compensation Deferral
Agreement, Stock Option Gain Deferral Agreement, Performance Share Award
Deferral Agreement, and Restricted Stock Deferral Agreement, if any, in effect
as of the date the unscheduled withdrawal election is filed with the Committee
shall be immediately terminated, and the Participant's right to make deferrals
of Cash Compensation, Stock Option Gains, Performance Share Awards, or
Restricted Stock Awards under the Plan shall be suspended during the remainder
of the Plan Year during which the unscheduled withdrawal election is filed with
the Committee and the immediately following Plan Year.

6.11. FINANCIAL HARDSHIP AND DISABILITY

      Upon a finding by the Committee that a Participant has suffered a
Financial Hardship or Disability, the Committee may (i) amend the Participant's
existing Cash Compensation Deferral Agreement, Stock Option Gain Deferral
Agreement, Performance Share Award Deferral Agreement, or Restricted Stock
Deferral Agreement; or (ii) make distributions from any or all of the
Participant's Accounts as the Committee may determine. The amount of any such
distribution shall be limited to the amount reasonably necessary to meet the
Participant's needs resulting from the Financial Hardship or Disability, and
will not exceed the Participant's Account balances. Distributions due to a
Financial Hardship may not be made to the extent that a Participant's Financial
Hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by
insurance or otherwise by liquidation of the Participant's assets, to the extent
the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe Financial Hardship
or by cessation of deferrals under the Plan. If a distribution is made due to
Financial Hardship or Disability, the Participant's deferrals under the Plan
shall cease for the period of the Financial Hardship or Disability and for
twelve (12) months thereafter. Any resumption of the Participant's deferrals
under the Plan after such twelve (12) month period shall be made only at the
election of the Participant in accordance with Article 4. No Participant shall
be eligible to receive a distribution pursuant to this Section 6.11 if he is
required to make Mandatory Deferrals under the Plan for that taxable year.

6.12. TAX WITHHOLDING

      Benefit payments under the Plan shall be subject to applicable federal,
state, local, and foreign tax withholding laws, and the Company shall withhold
from payments made hereunder any taxes required to be withheld from such
payments under such law. A Beneficiary, however, may elect not to have
withholding of federal income tax pursuant to Section 3405(a)(2) of the


ARTICLE 6                              43                     FORM AND TIMING OF

<PAGE>

             AT&T WIRELESS SERVICES, INC. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN


Code, or any successor provision thereto. When a distribution is to be made from
an Participant's Deferred Shares Account, the Company shall withhold from any
such distribution a sufficient number of Share Equivalents to satisfy the tax
withholding requirements under the applicable federal, state, local, and foreign
tax withholding laws. Any such withholding of Share Equivalents shall cause a
corresponding reduction in the number of shares of AWS Stock to be actually
distributed to the Participant under the Plan. In no event will the Company
purchase or otherwise issue cash for any AWS Stock distributed under the Plan.

6.13. FACILITY OF PAYMENT OF BENEFITS

      If a Plan benefit is payable to a minor, to a person declared incompetent,
or to a person incapable of handling the disposition of the property, the
Committee may direct payment to the guardian, legal representative, or person
having the care and custody of such minor, incompetent, or other person. The
Committee may require proof of incompetency, minority, incapacity, or
guardianship as it may deem appropriate prior to such distribution. Any
distribution of benefits made pursuant to this Section 6.13 shall completely
discharge the Committee and the Company from all liability with respect to such
benefit.

6.14. SPECIAL RULES FOR DISTRIBUTION OF DEFERRED SHARES ACCOUNT

      The Company shall distribute each Participant's Deferred Shares Account
following his Retirement (or such earlier date as may be specified in the
Participant's Stock Option Gain Deferral Agreement), subject to the following
rules:

      6.14.1 LUMP SUM DISTRIBUTION FROM DEFERRED SHARES ACCOUNT. If a
Participant has elected to receive a single, lump sum distribution of his
Deferred Shares Account, the Company shall issue to the Participant (or
Beneficiary of a deceased Participant), within three (3) days of the scheduled
distribution date (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter) shares

Participant's Deferred Shares Account. Any fractional number of Share
Equivalents thereafter remaining shall be paid to the Participant (or
Beneficiary of a deceased Participant) in cash.

      6.14.2 INSTALLMENT DISTRIBUTIONS FROM DEFERRED SHARES ACCOUNT. If a
Participant has elected to receive distribution of his Deferred Shares Account
in annual installments, the number of Share Equivalents to be covered by the
initial distribution shall be determined by dividing the total number of Share
Equivalents in the Participant's Deferred Shares Account on the initial
distribution date by the number of installments to be made, and the quotient
shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. The number of Share Equivalents to
be covered by each annual installment distribution thereafter to the Participant
shall be recalculated each year in a similar manner to reflect changes in the
number of Share Equivalents credited to the Participant's Deferred Shares
Account and the remaining number of annual installments to be made. After
determining the number of Share Equivalents to be covered by each annual
installment distribution, the Company shall issue to the Participant (or
Beneficiary of a deceased Participant), within three (3) days of the scheduled
distribution date (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter) shares
of AWS Stock equal to the number of Share

Equivalents that are to be covered by the particular installment payment. Any
fractional number of Share Equivalents that remain at the time of the final
installment shall be paid to the Participant (or Beneficiary of a deceased
Participant) in cash.

      6.14.3 RESTRICTION ON DISTRIBUTIONS WHEN PARTICIPANT SUBJECT TO MANDATORY
DEFERRALS. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or the Participant's Stock
Option Gain Deferral Agreement to the contrary, no distribution shall be made
from a Participant's Deferred Shares Account during a taxable year if the
Committee determines that the Participant may be required to make Mandatory
Deferrals under the Plan for such taxable year.

6.15. EFFECT OF PAYMENT OF BENEFITS

      The full payment of the balance credited to all of a Participant's
Accounts shall completely discharge all obligations on the part of the Company
to the Participant (or the Beneficiary of a deceased Participant) with respect
to the operation of the Plan, and the Participant's (or Beneficiary's) rights
under the Plan shall terminate.

                             BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

7.1. DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY

      Each Participant shall have the right, at any time, to designate any
person, persons, or entity as a Beneficiary (either primary and contingent) to
whom benefits under the Plan shall be paid in the event of the Participant's
death prior to complete distribution of the balance of all of the Participant's
Accounts. Each Beneficiary Designation shall be made in a written form
prescribed by the Committee, and shall be effective only when filed with the
Committee during the Participant's lifetime.

      A Beneficiary Designation made by the Participant that provides for
payment of fifty percent (50%) or more of the value of all of the Participant's
Accounts to a Beneficiary other than the Participant's Spouse shall not be
effective unless either (i) the Participant's Spouse executes a written consent
that acknowledges the effect of the Beneficiary designation; or (ii) it is
established that the Spouse's consent cannot be obtained because the
Participant's Spouse cannot be located.

7.2. CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

      A Participant may change any Beneficiary Designation at any time without
the consent of any designated Beneficiary by the filing of a new Beneficiary
Designation with the Committee in the manner described for in Section 7.1;
provided, however, that if the Participant is married, the new Beneficiary
Designation shall be subject to the consent requirements in Section 7.1. The
filing of a new Beneficiary Designation form will cancel all Beneficiary
designations previously filed by the Participant for the Plan.

7.3. NO BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

      If any Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary in the manner provided
in this Article 7, if the Participant's Beneficiary Designation is void, or if
all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant or are not otherwise in
existence at the time of the Participant's death, then the Participant's
designated Beneficiary shall be deemed to be the Participant's estate and all
benefits shall be paid to such estate in a lump sum.

7.4. CHANGE IN MARITAL STATUS

      If the Participant's marital status changes after the Participant made a
Beneficiary Designation, the following rules shall apply:

<PAGE>

             AT&T WIRELESS SERVICES, INC. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN


      (a) If the Participant is married at time of death but was unmarried when
the Beneficiary Designation was made, the Beneficiary Designation shall be void
unless the Participant's Spouse has consented to the Beneficiary Designation
prior to the Participant's death in the manner prescribed in Section 7.1.

      (b) If the Participant is unmarried at the time of death but was married
when the designation was made:

            (i) The Beneficiary Designation shall be void if the Spouse was
      named as Beneficiary.

            (ii) The Beneficiary Designation shall remain valid if a non-Spouse
      Beneficiary was named.

      (c) If the Participant was married when the Beneficiary Designation was
made and is married to a different Spouse at the time of death, the Beneficiary
Designation shall be void unless the Participant's Spouse at time of death has
consented to the Beneficiary Designation prior to the Participant's death in the
manner prescribed in Section 7.1.

7.5. EFFECT OF PAYMENT TO BENEFICIARY

      The payment to the Participant's Beneficiary of the balance of all of the
deceased Participant's Accounts in accordance with Section 6.2.4 shall
completely discharge the Company's obligations under the Plan with respect to
the Participant.

8.1. ADMINISTRATION BY COMMITTEE

      The Plan shall be administered by the Committee, or any successor thereto,
appointed by the Board of Directors. Any decision of the Committee that does not
constitute an abuse of discretion must be upheld by a court of law or by an
arbitrator.

8.2. DUTIES AND POWER OF COMMITTEE

      The Committee shall be the "named fiduciary" for the Plan responsible for
(i) the general operation and administration of the Plan; (ii) the proper
execution of the Plan's provisions; (iii) the interpretation of the Plan and the
determination of all questions arising hereunder; and (iv) the maintenance of
all necessary books of accounts and records. The Committee shall have power to
establish, interpret, enforce, amend, and revoke, from time to time, such rules
for the administration of the Plan and the conduct of its business as it deems
appropriate, including the power (i) to decide or resolve any and all questions
including interpretations of the Plan, as may arise in connection with the Plan;
and (ii) to remedy ambiguities, inconsistencies, and omissions (provided such
rules are uniformly applied to all persons similarly situated). The Committee
may delegate its authority to administer the Plan.

8.3. COMMITTEE DISCRETION

      The Committee shall have sole, complete, and absolute discretion to make
the decisions, determinations, and designations provided for in the Plan, and
any statement in the Plan providing that the Committee shall make any decision,
determination, and designation shall be construed and interpreted to mean that
the Committee shall make such decision, determination, and designation in it
sole, complete, and absolute discretion.

8.4. AGENTS

      In the administration of the Plan, the Committee, from time to time, may
(i) employ accountants, actuaries, advisors, attorneys, consultants,
recordkeepers, and agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it
sees fit; and (ii) consult with legal counsel who may be counsel to AT&T
Wireless.

8.5. BINDING EFFECT OF DECISIONS

      Any decision that the Committee is required or authorized to make with
respect to the administration, interpretation, and application of the Plan and
the rules promulgated hereunder (except for an initial adverse benefit
determination made pursuant to Section 10.2.2) shall be

final, conclusive, and binding on all Participant's, Beneficiaries, and other
persons (if any) having any interest in the Plan.

8.6. FILING WITH COMMITTEE

      All requirements in the Plan that an agreement, election, designation,
allocation or other form be "made", "submitted to," or "filed with the
Committee" shall be construed and interpreted as a requirement that any such
agreement, election, designation, allocation or other form be (i) filed,
submitted, and actually received by the Committee (or its delegate); (ii) filed
in a form and manner either prescribed by, approved by, or acceptable to the
Committee; (iii) properly completed with all relevant information required by
the Committee (as determined by the Committee); and (iv) properly signed or
executed (when applicable). No agreement, election, designation, allocation, or
other form required to be "made", "submitted to," or "filed with the Committee"
shall become effective until all the foregoing conditions of this Section 8.6
have been satisfied with respect such agreement, election, designation,
allocation, or other form.

8.7. INDEMNITY OF COMMITTEE

      To the extent permitted by applicable law, AT&T Wireless shall indemnify,
hold harmless, and defend the members of the Committee against any and all
claims, loss, damage, expense, or liability arising from any action or failure
to act with respect to the Plan, except with respect to acts of gross negligence
on the part of any Committee member.

                               SOURCE OF PAYMENTS

9.1. ESTABLISHMENT OF TRUST

      AT&T Wireless may, in its sole discretion, establish one or more trusts to
acquire and hold cash, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, insurance policies, or other
assets to be used to make payments of benefits under the terms of the Plan,
provided that such trust does not cause the Plan to be "funded" within the
meaning of the Code or ERISA. Any funds held in such a trust shall, for purposes
of the Plan, be considered to be part of the general assets of the Participating
Company which contributed the funds, and no Participant or Beneficiary shall
have any interest or right in such funds. To the extent trust assets are
available, they may be used to pay benefits arising under the Plan and, to the
extent permitted by such trust, all costs, charges, and expenses relating
thereto. To the extent that the funds held in the trust are insufficient to pay
such benefits, costs, charges, and expenses, each Participating Company shall
pay such benefits, costs, charges, and expenses from its respective general
assets.

      In addition, a Participating Company may, in its sole discretion, direct
that payments required under the Plan to any Participant or Beneficiary be made
through the purchase and distribution of one or more nontransferable annuity
contracts or cause the trustee of any trust to purchase and distribute such
annuity contracts. Any such purchase and distribution of an annuity contract
shall be a full and complete discharge of the liability of the Plan, AT&T
Wireless, and each Participating Company for payments of benefits assumed by the
issuer of the annuity contract.

9.2. OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY

      Notwithstanding the fact that a trust may be established under 9.1, the
Company shall remain liable for paying the benefits under the Plan. However, any
payment of benefits to a Participant or Beneficiary made by a trust established
pursuant to Section 9.1 shall satisfy the Company's obligation to make such
payment to such Participant or Beneficiary.

9.3. UNFUNDED STATUS

      The Plan at all times shall be entirely unfunded for purposes of the Code
and ERISA, and, except as provided in Section 9.1, no provision shall at any
time be made with respect to segregating any assets of AT&T Wireless or any
other Participating Company for payment of any benefits hereunder. The Plan
constitutes a mere promise by each Participating Company to make payments of
benefits, if any, in the future. No Participant or Beneficiary shall have any
interest in any particular assets of AT&T Wireless or any Participating Company
by reason of the Participant's or Beneficiary's right to receive benefits under
the Plan, and to the extent the Participant or Beneficiary acquires a right to
receive Benefits under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right
of any unsecured general creditor of the Participating Company.

determination shall be reviewed by the Committee, which may, but shall not be

11.1. RIGHT TO AMEND PLAN

      The Plan may be amended at any time, in whole or in part, by the Board of
Directors, in its sole discretion, at any time. Notice of any such amendment
shall be given in writing to the Committee and to each Participant (or
Beneficiary if a Participant is deceased). The Committee shall have the right to
amend the Plan at any time, in whole or in part, to clarify the provisions of
the Plan, to change administrative provisions of the Plan, or to effect legal
compliance. Unless otherwise authorized by the Board of Directors (or its
delegate), no amendment to the Plan shall be effective until it is reduced to
writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of AT&T Wireless. No amendment
shall decrease the value of a Participant's Accounts or deprive the Participant
or Beneficiary of any rights to which the Participant or Beneficiary would have
been entitled if the Plan had been terminated immediately prior to the effective
date of such amendment.

11.2. COMPANY'S RIGHT TO TERMINATE PLAN

      The Board of Director's may, at any time, partially or fully terminate the
Plan and may terminate any deferral election pertaining to any Participant at
any time. In the event of any such termination, the Participant shall be
entitled to the payment of the amount of that Participant's Account as of the
Determination Date immediately following such termination. Such benefit shall be
paid to the Participant in monthly installments over a period of no more than
ten (10) years, except that the Company, in its sole discretion, may pay out
such benefit in a lump sum or in installments over a period shorter than ten
(10) years. In the event benefits are paid out in installments, the Company
shall have the sole authority to choose the Valuation Funds used to value the
balance in each Account.

11.3. RIGHT TO SUSPEND BENEFIT PAYMENTS

      If the Board of Directors determines that payments of benefits under the
Plan would have a materially adverse effect on the Company's ability to carry on
its business, the Board of Directors may suspend such benefit payments
temporarily for such time as in its sole discretion it deems advisable, but in
no event for a period in excess of one (1) year. During the period of
suspension, earnings and losses shall continue to be credited to each
Participant's Accounts, if any. The Company shall pay such suspended payments or
distributions in a lump sum immediately upon the expiration of the period of
suspension.

11.4. ERISA PLAN STATUS

      The Plan is intended to provide benefits for "a select group of management
or highly compensated employees" within the meaning of Sections 201, 301, and
401 of ERISA, and therefore to be exempt from Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Title I of
ERISA. Accordingly, the Plan shall terminate and existing Account balances shall
be paid in a single, actuarially equivalent lump sum and no further benefits,
vested or nonvested, shall be paid hereunder in the event it is determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction or by an opinion of counsel for AT&T Wireless
that the Plan constitutes an employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA which is not so exempt.

      OR POTENTIAL CHANGE IN CONTROL

      Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary (including
but not limited to the provisions of Section 11.1 and Section 11.2), the
following restrictions on the amendment or termination of the Plan shall
supersede any conflicting provisions of the Plan and shall apply during a
Potential Change in Control Period or upon the occurrence of a Change in
Control:

      (a) No provision of the Plan pertaining to the amount or types of
permissible deferrals, the crediting of Earnings to Accounts, the right to elect

benefit payments, the authority of the Committee, or the definitions of the
terms "Change in Control" (as defined in Section 12.2), "Potential Change in
Control" (as defined in Section 12.3) or "Potential Change in Control Period"
(as defined in Section 12.4) may be amended, modified, or suspended, unless and
until the Committee obtains the written consent of at least eighty percent (80%)
of the affected Participants (or the Beneficiary of a deceased Participant);

      (b) No other amendment to the Plan that may adversely affect the rights of
a Participant or Beneficiary shall be effective unless either (i) the written
consent to the adoption of the specific provision is obtained in advance from
the affected Participant or Beneficiary; or (ii) the amendment is required by
applicable law or a governmental agency; and

      (c) The Plan may not be terminated until all benefit liabilities under the
Plan to all Participants and Beneficiaries have been completely satisfied by the
Company.

12.2. CHANGE IN CONTROL

      "Change in Control" means the earliest of the following to occur:

      (a) An acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning
of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as

of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of either (1) the then outstanding shares
of common stock of AT&T Wireless or its successor (the "Outstanding Wireless

directors (the "Outstanding Wireless Voting Securities"); excluding, however,
the following:

            (1) Any acquisition directly from AT&T Wireless, other than an
      acquisition by virtue of the exercise of a conversion privilege unless the
      security being so converted was itself acquired directly from AT&T
      Wireless;

             AT&T WIRELESS SERVICES, INC. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN


            (2) Any acquisition by AT&T Wireless;

            (3) Any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust)

            (4) Any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction
      which complies with clauses (1), (2), and (3) of Section 12.2(c).

immediately following the date the common stock is distributed to the
stockholders of AT&T Corp. pursuant to that Separation and Distribution
Agreement between AT&T Corp. and AT&T Wireless (the "Post-Distribution Board
Date") such that the individuals who, as of the Post-Distribution Board Date,
constitute the Board of Directors (such Board of Directors shall be hereinafter
referred to as the "Incumbent Board") cease, for any reason, to constitute at
least a majority of the Board of Directors so replaced; provided, however, that
for purposes of this definition, any individual who becomes a member of the
Board of Directors subsequent to the Post-Distribution Board Date, whose
election, or nomination for election, by AT&T Wireless's stockholders was
approved by a vote of at least a majority of those individuals who are members
of the Board of Directors and who were also members of the Incumbent Board (or
deemed to be such pursuant to this proviso) shall be considered as though such
individual were a member of the Incumbent Board; and provided further, however,
that any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result
of or in connection with either an actual or threatened solicitation with
respect to the election of directors (as such terms are used in Rule 14a-12(c)
of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) or other actual or
threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of an Entity
other than the Board of Directors shall not be so considered as a member of the
Board of Directors;

      (c) The consummation of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, sale, or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of AT&T Wireless
(each, a "Corporate Transaction") excluding, however, such a Corporate
Transaction pursuant to which:

            (1) All or substantially all of the individuals and entities who are
      the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Wireless Common
      Stock and the Outstanding Wireless Voting Securities immediately prior to
      such Corporate Transaction will beneficially own, directly or indirectly,
      more than sixty percent (60%) of, respectively, the outstanding shares of
      common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
      securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the
      case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Corporate Transaction
      (including, without limitation, a corporation or Person which as a result
      of such transaction owns AT&T Wireless or all or substantially all of AT&T
      Wireless's assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries (a
      "Parent Company")) in substantially the same proportions as their
      ownership, immediately prior to such

      Corporate Transaction, of the Outstanding Wireless Common Stock and the
      Outstanding Wireless Voting Securities, as the case may be;

            (2) No Entity (other than AT&T Wireless, any employee benefit plan
      (or related trust) of AT&T Wireless, such corporation resulting from such
      Corporate Transaction, or, if reference was made to equity ownership of
      any Parent Company for purposes of determining whether clause (1) above is
      satisfied in connection with the applicable Corporate Transaction, such
      Parent Company) will beneficially own, directly or indirectly, twenty
      percent (20%) or more of, respectively, the outstanding shares of common
      stock of the corporation resulting from such Corporate Transaction or the
      combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of such
      corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors unless
      such ownership resulted solely from ownership of securities of AT&T
      Wireless prior to the Corporate Transaction; and

            (3) Individuals who were members of the Board of Directors will
      immediately after the consummation of the Corporate Transaction constitute
      at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the
      corporation resulting from such Corporate Transaction (or, if reference
      was made to equity ownership of any Parent Company for purposes of
      determining whether clause (1) above is satisfied in connection with the
      applicable Corporate Transaction, of the Parent Company); or

      (d) The approval by the stockholders of AT&T Wireless of a complete
liquidation or dissolution of AT&T Wireless.

12.3. POTENTIAL CHANGE IN CONTROL

      "Potential Change in Control" shall mean the earliest of any of the
following to occur:

      (a) When any Person (including AT&T Wireless) publicly announces an
intention (1) to acquire five percent (5%) or more of the then outstanding
voting securities of AT&T Wireless ("Voting Securities"), provided such
acquisition is not by a Related Person, or (2) to merge or consolidate AT&T
Wireless with another entity, transfer or sell assets of AT&T Wireless, or
liquidate or dissolve AT&T Wireless, in each case described in this subsection
in a transaction that would, if completed, constitute a Change in Control; or

      (b) When any Person other than a Related Person:

            (1) Acquires five percent (5%) or more of the then outstanding
      Voting Securities, other than as a holder whose investment in AT&T
      Wireless is eligible to be reported on Schedule 13G pursuant to Rule
      13d-1(b)(1) promulgated under the Exchange Act (the "Eligible Person"); or

            (2) Initiates a tender or exchange offer to acquire such number of
      Voting Securities as would result in such Person holding twenty percent
      (20%) or more of the then outstanding Voting Securities; or

less than five percent (5%) of the then outstanding Voting Securities, shall
have abandoned the tender or exchange offer, or, following a shareholders'
meeting, shall not have elected a member of the Board of Directors, as the case
may be; or

      (d) The date a Change in Control occurs.

                                       13.
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

13.1. UNFUNDED PLAN

      The Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan maintained primarily to
provide deferred compensation benefits for a "select group of management or
highly compensated employees" within the meaning of Sections 201, 301, and 401
of ERISA, and therefore to be exempt from the provisions of Parts 2, 3, and 4 of
Title I of ERISA. Accordingly, the Board of Directors may terminate the Plan and
make no further benefit payments or remove certain employees as Participants if
it is determined by the United States Department of Labor, a court of competent
jurisdiction, or an opinion of counsel for AT&T Wireless that the Plan
constitutes an employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2)
of ERISA which is not so exempt.

13.2. NO RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE TRUST

      Any trust, and any assets held by a trust to assist the Company in meeting
its obligation under the Plan, shall in no way be deemed to controvert the
provisions of Section 13.1.

13.3. NO IMPLIED RIGHTS

      Neither the establishment of the Plan nor any amendment hereof shall be
construed as giving any Participant, Beneficiary, or any other person any legal
or equitable right unless such right shall be specifically provided for in the
Plan or conferred by specific action of the Company in accordance with the terms
and provisions of the Plan. Except as expressly provided in the Plan, the
Company shall not be required or be liable to make any payment under the Plan.

13.4. UNSECURED GENERAL CREDITOR

      Neither the Participant nor any other person shall acquire, by reason of
the Plan, any right in or title to any assets, funds, or property of the Company
whatsoever including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any
specific funds, assets, or other property which the Company, in its sole
discretion, may set aside. Any benefits which become payable hereunder shall be
paid from the general assets of the Company. Any property held by the Company
for the purpose of generating the cash flow for benefit payments shall remain
its general, unpledged, and unrestricted assets. The Company's obligation under
the Plan shall be an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future.
With respect to amounts credited to any Accounts hereunder and any benefits
payable hereunder, a Participant or Beneficiary shall have the status of general
unsecured creditors of the Company by which such Participant is employed and may
look only to the Company and its general assets for payment of such benefits
with no secured or preferential rights to any assets of Company or any other
party for payment of benefits under the Plan. The Participant shall have only a
contractual right to the amounts, if


ARTICLE 13                             61                     GENERAL PROVISIONS
<PAGE>

             AT&T WIRELESS SERVICES, INC. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN


any, payable hereunder unsecured by any asset of the Company. Nothing contained
in the Plan constitutes a guarantee by the Company that the assets of the
Company shall be sufficient to pay any benefit to any person. Notwithstanding
any other provision of the Plan, Participants and Beneficiaries shall be
unsecured general creditors.

13.5. NONASSIGNABILITY

      Neither the Participant nor any other person shall have any voluntary or
involuntary right to commute, sell, assign, pledge, anticipate, mortgage, or
otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate, or convey in advance of receipt the
amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, which are expressly
declared to be nonassignable and nontransferable. No part of the amounts payable
shall be, prior to actual payment, subject to seizure or sequestration for the
payment of any debts, judgments, alimony, or separate maintenance owned by the
Participant or any other person, or be transferable by operation of law in the
event of the Participant's or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency.

13.6. PROHIBITION AGAINST ALIENATION

      Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, no right or benefit under the
Plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or charge, and any attempt to so anticipate,
alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, or charge the same shall be
void. No such right or benefit shall be liable for or subject to the debts,
contracts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of the person entitled to such
right or benefit.

13.7. NO RIGHT TO CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT

      The terms and conditions of the Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a
contract of employment between the Company and the Participant, and the
Participant (or his Beneficiary) shall have no rights against the Company except
as may otherwise be specifically provided herein. Nothing in the Plan shall be
deemed to give a Participant the right to be retained in the employment of the
Company or to interfere with the right of the Company to discipline or discharge
him at any time. The Company expressly reserves the right to dismiss any person
at any time, with or without cause, without liability for the effect that such
dismissal might have upon him as a Participant in the Plan or for any other
purpose. Nothing herein shall be construed as fixing or regulating the Salary or
Bonus payable to the Participant.

13.8. GOVERNING LAW

      The Plan shall be construed, interpreted, and governed in accordance with
applicable federal law and, to the extent not preempted by such federal law, the
laws of the State of Washington.

13.9. SAVINGS CLAUSE

      If any provision of the Plan is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision and the remaining provisions hereof shall continue to
be construed and enforced as if the invalid or unenforceable provision had not
been included.

13.10. NOTICE

      Any notice required or permitted to be given to the Committee under the
Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand-delivered, or sent by registered
or certified mail, to the Committee at the Company's principal place of
business. Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if
delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt
for registration or certification. Mailed notice to a Participant or Beneficiary
shall be directed to the individual's last known address in Company's records.

13.11. TRANSFERS OF EMPLOYEES AMONG COMPANIES

      Transfers of employment between Affiliated Companies and AT&T Wireless or
other Affiliated Companies shall be treated as continuous and uninterrupted
service under the Plan and shall not be considered a Termination of Service
(except as otherwise determined by the Committee).

13.12. SUCCESSORS

      The Plan and any Deferral Agreement hereunder shall bind and inure to the
benefit of and be binding on (i) the Company and its successors and assigns,
including without limitation, any corporation into which the Company may be
merged or consolidated, or which acquires all or substantially all of the assets
and business of the Company, and successors of any such corporation or other
business entity; and (ii) the Participant and the Participant's Beneficiary,
heirs, executors, administrators, and legal representatives.

13.13. PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS

      A Participant shall be required to cooperate with the Company by
furnishing any and all information requested by the Company, in order to
facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder, and taking such other action as
may be requested by the Company.

13.14. GENDER, NUMBER, AND HEADINGS

      Whenever any words are used herein in the masculine gender, they shall be
construed as though they were also used in the feminine gender in all cases
where they would so apply. Whenever any words used herein are in the singular
form, they shall be construed as though they

were also used in the plural form in all cases where they would so apply.
Headings of Articles, Sections, and Appendices as used herein are inserted
solely for convenience and reference and shall have no force or effect in the
construction or interpretation of the Plan or any of its provisions. All
Article, Section and Appendix references made in this Plan document are to the
Articles, Sections and Appendices of this Plan document unless otherwise
specified.

13.15. ERISA PLAN DOCUMENT

      This Plan document is the plan document required by ERISA. The information
contained herein provides the final and exclusive statement of the terms of the
Plan and represents the entire agreement between the Company and any
Participant. The Plan supersedes any and all prior agreements between the
Company and any Participant, whether such agreement or agreements were written
or oral. This document legally governs the operation of the Plan, and any claim
of right or entitlement under the Plan shall be determined solely in accordance
with its provisions. To the extent that there are any inconsistencies between
the terms of any related materials and the terms of this Plan document, the
terms of this Plan document shall control and govern the operation of the Plan.
No other evidence, whether written or oral, shall be taken into account in
determining the right of a Covered Employee, a Participant, a Senior Executive,
or a Beneficiary, as applicable, to any benefit of any type provided under the
Plan.

amendment and restatement of the Plan effective as of January 1, 2002.
