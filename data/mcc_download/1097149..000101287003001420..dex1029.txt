                              INIVISIBLE IT, INC.

This Master Software Professional Services Agreement (the "Agreement") is made

        the parties (the "WORK") in accordance with the terms and conditions of
        this Agreement, and on the price, delivery dates and specifications
        described in the applicable Schedule for the WORK. The Schedules shall
        be in the form attached hereto and shall be signed by both parties,

        attached to this Agreement. INVISIBLE IT is not obligated to perform any
        WORK hereunder and ALIGN has not contracted for any WORK unless and
        until a Schedule is executed by both parties and attached hereto.

2.      Payment. ALIGN shall pay INVISIBLE IT for the WORK as described on the
        applicable Schedule for such WORK. For fixed fee WORK ALIGN agrees to
        remit payment in advance of the performance of such WORK or on other

        all information and know-how transmitted by the disclosing party to the
        receiving party and that has been designated as proprietary and/or
        confidential or that, by the nature of the circumstances surrounding the
        disclosure, ought in good faith to be treated as proprietary and/or
        confidential ("Confidential Information"), and the receiving party will
        make no use of such information and know-how except under the terms and
        during the existence of this Agreement. Each party's obligation under
        this Section 3 with respect to any particular information shall extend
        to the earlier of such time as such information is publicly available

        termination of this Agreement. INVISIBLE IT certifies that it will
        comply with all applicable provisions of Insurance Portability and

4.      Ownership of WORK; Assignment of Rights to ALIGN.

        (a) ALIGN agrees that all systems, programs, INVISIBLE IT specifications
            and other materials and hardware, and all intellectual property
            incorporated therein (collectively referred to as "INVISIBLE IT
            Information") owned by INVISIBLE IT or licensed to INVISIBLE IT by
            third parties prior to the execution of this Agreement and used in
            conjunction with the Services for ALIGN shall continue to belong to
            INVISIBLE IT or their third party licensors. To the extent that such
            INVISIBLE IT Information is incorporated into any work product or
            deliverable developed by INVISIBLE IT hereunder, INVISIBLE IT hereby
            grants to ALIGN a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive worldwide
            royalty-free right to use, execute, reproduce, display, perform,
            distribute, modify, and prepare derivative works (collectively,
            "Distribute") and have Distributed, to and by third parties, such
            INVISIBLE IT Information in conjunction with such work product or
            deliverable, and modified version thereof.

            not divulge any Confidential Information of ALIGN; and (ii) will not
            be granted or issued or used by any direct competitor of ALIGN
            (listed on Schedule B hereto and includes any orthodontic or dental
            companies, as updated from time to time by mutual written consent)
            during the term of this Agreement. Such system administration
            utilities be considered INVISIBLE IT Information and licensed to
            ALIGN as set forth in Section 4(a).

        (c) If INVISIBLE IT agrees in writing as to a particular deliverable for
            WORK for ALIGN, then such WORK shall be deemed specially ordered and
            commissioned by ALIGN and may be incorporated in existing ALIGN
            works as a compilation or collective work. In that case, INVISIBLE
            IT agrees that all copyrights in the WORK shall be owned by ALIGN
            and the WORK shall be a "work made for hire" for copyright purposes
            (the "ASSIGNED WORK").

        (d) INVISIBLE IT hereby assigns to ALIGN, its successors and assigns,
            all rights, title and interest in and to the ASSIGNED WORK
            including, without limitation, the following:

            (i)   any U.S. copyrights that INVISIBLE IT may possess or acquire
                  in the ASSIGNED WORK and all copyrights and equivalent rights
                  in the ASSIGNED WORK throughout the world, including all
                  renewals and extensions of such rights that may be secured
                  under the laws now or hereafter in force and effect in the
                  United States of America or in any other country or countries;

            (ii)  all rights in and to any inventions, ideas, designs, concepts,
                  techniques, discoveries, or improvements, whether or not
                  patentable, embodied in the ASSIGNED WORK or developed in the
                  course of INVISIBLE IT's creation of the ASSIGNED WORK,
                  including but not limited to all trade secrets, utility and
                  design patent rights and equivalent rights in and to such
                  inventions and designs throughout the world regardless of
                  whether or not legal protection for the ASSIGNED WORK is
                  sought;

            (iii) any documents, magnetically or optically encoded media, or
                  other materials created by INVISIBLE IT as part of the
                  ASSIGNED WORK under this Agreement; and

            (iv)  the right to sue for infringements which may occur before the
                  date of this Agreement, and to collect and retain damages from
                  any such infringements from the ASSIGNED WORK.

        (e) At ALIGN's expense, INVISIBLE IT shall execute and deliver such
            instruments and take such other action as may be requested by ALIGN
            to perfect or protect ALIGN's rights in the ASSIGNED WORK and to
            carry out the assignments contemplated in subparagraph (b) of this
            section. In this regard, INVISIBLE IT agrees to cooperate with ALIGN
            in the filing and prosecution of any copyright or patent
            applications that ALIGN may elect to file on the ASSIGNED WORK or
            inventions and designs relating to the ASSIGNED WORK. ALIGN
            acknowledges that INVISIBLE IT has taken no action to assist in the
            registration of the copyrights or the ASSIGNED WORK and will do so
            only as and when requested by ALIGN.

6.3     Process.

        (a)    If any action shall be brought against ALIGN or INVISIBLE IT for
               a INVISIBLE IT Claim or a ALIGN Claim, respectively, the
               indemnified party shall promptly notify the indemnifying party in
               writing, specifying the nature of the action and the total
               monetary amount sought or other such relief as is sought therein.
               The indemnified party shall cooperate with the indemnifying party
               at the indemnifying party's expense in all reasonable respects in
               connection with the defense of any such action. The indemnifying
               party may upon written notice thereof to the indemnified party
               undertake to conduct all proceedings or negotiations in
               connection therewith, assume the defense thereof, and if it so
               undertakes, it shall also undertake all other required steps or
               proceedings to settle or defend any such action, including the
               employment of counsel which shall be satisfactory to the
               indemnified party, and payment of all expenses. The indemnified
               party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and
               participate in the defense thereof. The indemnifying party shall
               reimburse the indemnified party upon demand for any payments made
               or loss suffered by it at any time after the date hereof, based
               upon the judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction or
               pursuant to a bona fide compromise or settlement of claims,
               demands, or actions, in respect to any damages to which the
               foregoing relates.

        (b)    If any WORK OR ASSIGNED WORK furnished hereunder is in any action
               held to constitute an infringement and its use is enjoined,
               INVISIBLE IT shall immediately and at its expense:

               (i)   procure for ALIGN the right to continue use, sale, and
                     marketing of the WORK or the ASSIGNED WORK; or

               (ii)  replace or modify the WORK or the ASSIGNED WORK with a
                     version of the WORK or the ASSIGNED WORK that is
                     non-infringing.

        If (i) or (ii) are not available to INVISIBLE IT, INVISIBLE IT shall
        refund to ALIGN all amounts paid to INVISIBLE IT by ALIGN hereunder for
        the particular WORK and/or for the particular ASSIGNED WORK.

6.4     Survival.

        The foregoing indemnity provision of this Section 6 shall survive any
        termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of three (3)
        years.

7.      Termination.

        (a)    This Agreement shall commence as of the Effective Date and shall
               remain in force in perpetuity unless earlier terminated as set
               forth in Section 7(b).

        (b)    Termination for Cause. Either party may suspend performance
               and/or terminate (A) this Agreement or (B) a particular Schedule
               under this Agreement immediately upon written notice at any time
               if:

               (i)   The other party is in material breach of any material
                     warranty, term, condition or covenant of this Agreement,
                     other than those contained in Section 3, and fails to cure
                     that breach within thirty (30) days after written notice
                     thereof; or

               (ii)  The other party is in material breach of Section 3.

        (c)    ALIGN shall have the right to cancel any Schedule pursuant to the
               terms of such Schedule. Such terms may include cancellation fees,
               as the parties may agree, for a termination without cause. In the
               event ALIGN cancels a Schedule, ALIGN will provide INVISIBLE IT
               written notice of such cancellation. Upon receipt of such notice,
               INVISIBLE IT will discontinue all work thereunder. Except in
               cases of cancellation for cause as specified in Section 7(b) of
               this Agreement, ALIGN will pay for all work performed by
               INVISIBLE IT up until the date of receipt of the cancellation
               notice and cancellation fees, if any, specified in such Schedule.
               In the event of cancellation of a Schedule, upon request by
               ALIGN, INVISIBLE IT agrees to turn over to ALIGN all Assigned
               Work with respect to such Schedule within ten (10) days of
               payment of all outstanding amounts.

 9.     Arbitration.

        (a)    Except for injunctive relief sought pursuant to Section 3(c), all
               disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement,
               including any questions regarding its existence, validity, breach
               or termination, shall be finally settled by binding arbitration
               under the CPR Non-Administered Arbitration Rules ("Rules") of the
               CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution ("CPR") by a sole arbitrator
               in accordance with said Rules. The arbitration shall be governed
               by the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1-16.

        (b)    Both parties shall agree on a sole arbitrator within 30 days.
               Should the two parties fail, within the above time-limit, to
               reach agreement on the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be
               appointed by CPR under the applicable Rules ("Appointing
               Authority"). If there are two or more defendants, any nomination
               of an arbitrator by or on behalf of such defendants must be by
               joint agreement between them. If such defendants fail, within the
               time-limit fixed by the Appointing Authority, to agree on such
               joint nomination, the proceedings against each of them must be
               separated. The arbitrator must have sufficient experience in the
               software industry and in international business transactions.

        (c)    Notwithstanding the Rules, the parties (i) shall submit their
               dispute to the arbitrator within 2 months following their
               decision that they could not resolve their dispute, (ii) each
               party shall have no more than 2 days to present its case and
               (iii) the arbitrator shall be instructed to render its decision
               within 30 days following the conclusion of each party's
               presentation.

        (d)    The arbitrator shall specify the basis for its decision. The
               arbitrator shall not award any punitive damages. The decision of
               the arbitrator shall be considered as a final and binding
               resolution of the

               dispute,  shall not be  subject to appeal and may be entered as a
               judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

        (e)    The seat of arbitration shall be Santa Clara, California. The
               procedural law of this place shall apply where the Rules are
               silent, however no jury trial shall be allowed in the arbitration
               proceedings and discovery shall be limited as set forth in the
               Rules.

        (f)    The whole arbitration procedure shall be executed pursuant to a
               strict non disclosure agreement signed by the parties and the
               arbitrators agreeing to conduct such proceedings and maintaining
               in confidence all confidential information or trade secrets
               disclosed or produced in the course thereof. All press releases
               or public statements regarding the status of such proceedings
               shall be prepared jointly and only by the parties.

10.     Miscellaneous.

        (a)    INVISIBLE IT is an independent contractor for ALIGN, and nothing
               in this Agreement shall be construed as creating an
               employer-employee relationship, a partnership, or a joint venture
               between the parties.

        (b)    In the event taxes are required to be withheld on payments made
               hereunder by any U.S. (state or federal) or foreign government,
               ALIGN may deduct such taxes from the amount owed INVISIBLE IT and
               pay them to the appropriate taxing authority. ALIGN shall in turn
               promptly secure and deliver to INVISIBLE IT an official receipt
               for any taxes withheld. ALIGN will use reasonable efforts to
               minimize such taxes to the extent permissible under applicable
               law.

        (c)    This Agreement shall be construed and controlled by the laws of
               the State of California, Northern District. The federal and state
               courts within the State of California, Northern District, shall
               have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute arising
               with this Agreement and INVISIBLE IT hereby consents to such
               jurisdiction. In any action or suit to enforce any right or
               remedy under this Agreement or to interpret any provision of this
               Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its
               costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

        (d)    This Agreement does not constitute an offer by ALIGN and it shall
               not be effective until signed by both parties. This Agreement
               constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
               to the WORK and all other subject matter hereof and merges all
               prior and contemporaneous communications. It shall not be
               modified except by a written agreement dated subsequent to the
               date of this Agreement and signed on behalf of INVISIBLE IT and
               ALIGN by their respective duly authorized representatives. Any
               Schedules attached to this Agreement must be signed on behalf of
               INVISIBLE IT and ALIGN by their respective duly authorized
               representatives. Schedules shall not act to amend this Agreement.
               The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall take precedence
               over any conflicting terms and conditions in any Schedule;
               provided, however, to the extent the terms and conditions of a
               particular Schedule so conflict with the terms and conditions of
               this Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Schedule shall
               take precedence only with respect to the Services under that
               Schedule.

        (e)    This Agreement may be assigned by ALIGN or by INVISIBLE IT with
               mutual prior written approval. Except as otherwise provided, this
               Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
               parties' successors and lawful assigns.

        (f)    ALIGN and INVISIBLE IT mutually agree that they will use
               reasonable commercial efforts to not recruit and hire employees
               of the other party, assigned to work under this Agreement during
               their assignment under the applicable Schedule of this Agreement.
               Should either party solicit and hire an employee form the other,
               The hiring party shall pay a one-time, liquidated damage fee
               equal to fifty-five percent (55%) of such employee's offered
               annual salary. Each party agrees to pay any such employment fee
               within ten (10) days following the employee's commencement of
               employment.

        (g)    A service charge of one percent (1%) per month or the highest
               rate allowed by law shall apply to all overdue amounts owed to
               Supplier. ALIGN acknowledges that unpaid invoices may result in
               the interruption of services provided.
