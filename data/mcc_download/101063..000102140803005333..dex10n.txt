                       CHIQUITA BRANDS INTERNATIONAL, INC.
                      2002 STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLAN
                 NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AWARD AND AGREEMENT

GRANT: Chiquita Brands International, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the
"Company"), hereby awards you (the "Optionee" named below) a Non-Qualified Stock
Option ("Option") under the Chiquita 2002 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the
"Plan") to purchase the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock, par
value $.01 per share ("Shares"), at the Option Price, set forth below, subject
to the following terms and conditions:

          Optionee:         No. of Shares:      Option Price:      Grant Date:
          ---------         --------------      -------------      -----------

   Cyrus F. Freidheim, Jr.      150,000             $11.73        March 11, 2003

Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, capitalized terms have the meanings
specified in the Plan.

VESTING: This Option vests between the Grant Date and March 11, 2006, with
one-third of the total number of Shares vesting (becoming exercisable) on March
11 in each of 2004, 2005 and 2006 or, if earlier, upon a Change of Control of
the Company; provided that you have remained continuously employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or served as a director of the Company (such
employment or service being hereinafter referred to as "Service") through the
applicable vesting date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may elect, by filing
a written election with the Company prior to the date of a Change of Control, to
waive all or a portion of your rights to vest in this Option by reason of the
Change of Control. If your Service terminates because of your death or
Disability, all the Shares covered by this Option will vest on termination of
your Service. If your Service terminates because of your Retirement (as defined
below), vesting of the Shares covered by this Option will cease as of the date
of your Retirement. For purposes of this Option, notwithstanding the provisions
of the Plan, your "Retirement" shall be deemed to occur upon the termination of
your Service for any reason other than Cause or your death or Disability.

TERM: This Option expires 10 years from the Grant Date set forth above. If your
Service terminates prior to the expiration date, this Option will be subject to
earlier termination as specified in the Plan or this Agreement.

EXERCISE: In order to exercise this Option, you must deliver to the Company a
written notice indicating the number of Shares being exercised, accompanied by
full payment of the Option Price. You must exercise this Option for at least 100
shares, unless the total number of vested Shares covered by this Option is less
than 100, in which case you must exercise this Option for all then-vested
Shares. You may pay the Option Price in cash or in shares of Common Stock owned
by you for at least six months prior to the exercise. You will have no rights as
a stockholder with respect to the Shares before exercise of this Option and
delivery to you of a certificate evidencing those Shares.

TAXES: You must pay all applicable U.S. federal, state and local taxes resulting
from the issuance of Shares upon exercise of this Option. The Company has the
right to withhold all applicable taxes due upon the exercise of this Option (by
payroll deduction or otherwise) from the proceeds of such exercise or from
future earnings (including salary, bonus, director's fees or any other
payments).

CONDITIONS: This Option is governed by and subject to the terms and conditions
of the Plan, which contains important provisions of this award and forms a part
of this Agreement. A copy of the Plan is being provided to you, along with a
summary of the Plan. If there is any conflict between any provision of this
Agreement and the Plan, this Agreement will control, unless the provision is not
permitted by the Plan, in which case the provision of the Plan will apply. Your
rights and obligations under this Agreement are also governed by and are subject
to applicable U.S. laws.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: To acknowledge receipt of this award, please sign and return
one copy of this Agreement to the Corporate Secretary's Office, Attention:
Barbara Howland.
