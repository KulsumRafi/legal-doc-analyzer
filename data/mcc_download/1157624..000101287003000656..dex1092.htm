foregoing option to extend is personal to the original Tenant signing the Lease, and shall not be assigned or transferred by any assignee, sublessee or transferee under a Transfer except for a Permitted Transfer. </FONT></P><P

party, by giving written notice to the other party, shall appoint an appraiser to render a written opinion of the Fair Market Rent for the Extension Period. Each appraiser must be a member of the Appraisal Institute of America (MAI) for at least
five years and with at least five years experience in the appraisal of rental rates of office buildings in the area in which the Building is located and otherwise unaffiliated with either Landlord or Tenant. The two appraisers shall render their
written opinion of the Fair Market Rent for the Extension Period to Landlord and Tenant within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the second appraiser. If the Fair Market Rent of each appraiser is within five percent (5%) of each other, then
the average of the two appraisals of Fair Market Rent shall be the Base Monthly Rent for the Extension Period. If one party does not appoint its appraiser as provided above, then the one appointed shall determine the Fair Market Rent. The Fair
Market Rent so determined under this section shall be binding on Landlord and Tenant. The appraisers&#146; determination of Fair Market Rent shall be based on rental of space of the same age, construction, size and location as the Premises with the

unable to agree on the third appraiser within said ten (10) day period, Landlord and Tenant shall mutually agree on the third appraiser within ten (10) days thereafter and if the parties fail to agree within said time period, then at the request of
either Landlord or Tenant, such third appraiser shall be promptly appointed by the then Presiding Judge of the Superior Court of the State of California for the County where the Premises are located The third appraiser shall be a person who has not

Opinion shall be the Base Monthly Rent during the Extension Period. If the fair market rent of the Third Opinion is not equidistant from the fair market rent made by Landlord&#146;s and Tenant&#146;s appraiser, then the two closest fair market
determinations made by Landlord&#146;s appraiser, Tenant&#146;s appraiser and the Third Opinion shall be average and such average shall be the Base Monthly Rent during the applicable Extension Period. The fair market rent determined in accordance

there is a material change in the terms for lease of the Expansion Space being proposed by Landlord as provided in Section 3.3 below. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord shall have the right to lease portions of the Expansion Space to different
