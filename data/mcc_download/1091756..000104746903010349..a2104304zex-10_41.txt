     The Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate are part of a duly
authorized issue of Warrants expiring January 15, 2008, entitling the holder on
exercise to receive shares of Common Stock and are issued or to be issued
pursuant to the Amended and Restated Warrant and Registration Rights Agreement
dated as of February 21, 2003 (the "Amended and Restated Warrant and
Registration Rights Agreement"), duly executed and delivered by the Company to
U.S. Bank National Association, as warrant agent (the "Warrant Agent"), which
Amended and Restated Warrant and Registration Rights Agreement is hereby
incorporated by reference in and made a part of this instrument and is hereby
referred to for a description of the rights, limitation of rights, obligations,
duties and immunities thereunder of the Warrant Agent, the Company and the
holders (the words "holders" or "holder" meaning the registered holders or
registered holder) of the Warrants. A copy of this Amended and Restated Warrant
and Registration Rights Agreement may be obtained by the holder hereof upon
written request to the Company. Capitalized terms used herein without being
otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Amended and
Restated Warrant and Registration Rights Agreement.

     Each Warrant may be exercised at any time on or after the date of issuance
of such Warrant and on or before the Expiration Date. The holder of Warrants
evidenced by this Warrant Certificate may exercise them as follows:

               (I)   The Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate may be
          exercised by the holder hereof, in whole or in part, during normal
          business hours on any Business Day on or prior to the Expiration Date,
          by surrender of this Warrant Certificate to the Company at its
          principal office, accompanied by a subscription substantially in the
          form attached to this Warrant Certificate duly executed by such holder
          and accompanied by (a) wire transfer of immediately available funds or
          (b) certified or official bank check payable to the order of the
          Company, in each case in the amount obtained by multiplying (i) the
          number of shares of Common Stock (without giving effect to any
          adjustment thereof pursuant to the provisions of the Amended and
          Restated Warrant and Registration Rights Agreement) for which the
          Warrant evidenced by this Warrant Certificate is then being exercised,
          as designated in such subscription, by (ii) the Initial Exercise
          Price. Thereupon, such holder shall be entitled to receive the number
          of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
          shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) determined as provided in
          Sections 6 and 7 of the Amended and Restated Warrant and Registration
          Rights Agreement.

               (II)  The Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate may be
          converted by the holder hereof, in whole or in part, into shares of
          Common Stock (or Other Securities), during normal business hours on
          any Business Day on or prior to the Expiration Date, by surrender of
          this Warrant Certificate to the Company at its principal office,
          accompanied by a conversion notice substantially in the form attached
          to this Warrant Certificate duly executed by such holder. Thereupon,
          such holder shall be entitled to receive a number of duly authorized,

          (or Other Securities) equal to:

          (a)  the excess of

               (i) (x) the number of shares of Common Stock (or Other
          Securities) determined as provided in Sections 6 and 7 of the Amended
          and Restated Warrant and Registration Rights Agreement which such
          holder would be entitled to receive upon exercise of the Warrants
          represented by this Warrant Certificate for the number of shares of
          Common Stock designated in such conversion notice (without giving
          effect to any adjustment thereof pursuant to Sections 6 or 7 of the
          Amended and Restated Warrant and Registration Rights Agreement)
          MULTIPLIED BY (y) the Current Market Price of each such share of
          Common Stock (or such Other Securities) so receivable upon such
          exercise

          OVER

               (ii) (x) the number of shares of Common Stock (without giving
          effect to any adjustment thereof pursuant to Sections 6 or 7 of the
          Amended and Restated Warrant and Registration Rights Agreement or
          other provisions thereof) which such holder would be entitled to
          receive upon exercise of the Warrants represented by this Warrant
          Certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock designated in
          such conversion notice (without giving effect to any adjustment
          thereof pursuant to Sections 6 or 7 of the Amended and Restated
          Warrant and Registration Rights Agreement) MULTIPLIED BY (y) the
          Initial Exercise Price

          DIVIDED BY

          (b) such Current Market Price of each such share of Common Stock (or
          Other Securities).

               (III) The Warrant represented by this Warrant Certificate may be
          exercised by the holder hereof, in whole or in part, during normal
          business hours on any Business Day on or prior to the Expiration Date,
          by surrender of this Warrant Certificate to the Company at its
          principal office, accompanied by a note tender notice substantially in
          the form attached to this Warrant Certificate duly executed by such
          holder and accompanied by a Note. Thereupon, such holder shall be
          deemed to have exercised the Warrant represented by this Warrant
          Certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock (up to the
          maximum number of shares of Common Stock set forth on the face of this
          Warrant Certificate and without giving effect to any adjustment
          thereof pursuant to Sections 6 or 7 of the Amended and Restated
          Warrant and Registration Rights Agreement or other provisions thereof)
          obtained by dividing (i) the sum of the outstanding face amount of
          such Note (or such lesser amount indicated on the note tender notice)
          PLUS any cash or payment-in-kind interest accrued on such Note, PLUS
          any accrued prepayment penalty or premium by (ii) the Exercise Price.
          Thereupon, such holder shall be entitled to receive the number of duly
          authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
          Common Stock (or Other Securities) determined as provided in Sections
          6 and 7 of the Amended and Restated Warrant and Registration Rights
          Agreement.

          In the event that upon any exercise of Warrants evidenced hereby the
number of Warrants exercised shall be less than the total number of Warrants
evidenced hereby, there shall be issued to the holder hereof or its assignee a
new Warrant Certificate of like tenor, dated the date hereof and calling in the
aggregate on the face or faces thereof for the number of Warrants (without
giving effect to any adjustment thereof pursuant to the terms of the Amended and

                                       -6-
<Page>

Restated Warrant and Registration Rights Agreement) to the number of Warrants
called for on the face of this Warrant Certificate minus the number of Warrants
designated by the holder upon such exercise.

     Upon the exercise of the Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate as
provided above, the Company may elect either (i) to comply with the requirements
of Section 7.3(a) of the Amended and Restated Warrant and Registration Rights
Agreement with respect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock in connection
with such exercise or (ii) upon written notice to the holder not more than two
Business Days following the date of exercise, to pay to the holder an amount
equal to the Market Price for each share of Common Stock issuable upon such
exercise (the "Cash Close Out") in lieu of issuing such Common Stock. Any Cash
Close Out made in accordance with this paragraph shall be paid within two
Business Days of the exercise of the Warrants evidenced by this Warrant
Certificate by (a) wire transfer of immediately available funds or (b) certified
or official bank check payable to the order of the holder hereof.

     The Company will not be required to issue fractional shares of Common Stock
upon exercise of the Warrants or distribute share certificates that evidence
fractional shares of Common Stock. In lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock,
there may be paid to the registered Holder of this Warrant Certificate at the
time such Warrant Certificate is exercised an amount in cash equal to the same
fraction of the Current Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Business
Day immediately proceeding the date this Warrant Certificate is surrendered for
exercise.

     The holders of the Warrants are entitled to certain registration rights
with respect to the Common Stock purchasable upon exercise thereof. Such
registration rights are set forth in Section 8 of the Amended and Restated
Warrant and Registration Rights Agreement.

     Warrant Certificates, when surrendered at the office of the Warrant Agent
by the registered holder thereof in person or by legal representative or
attorney duly authorized in writing, may be exchanged, in the manner and subject
to the limitations provided in the Amended and Restated Warrant and Registration
Rights Agreement, but without payment of any service charge, for another Warrant
Certificate or Warrant Certificates of like tenor evidencing in the aggregate a
like number of Warrants.

     Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of this Warrant
Certificate at the office of the Warrant Agent a new Warrant Certificate or
Warrant Certificates of like tenor and evidencing in the aggregate a like number
of Warrants shall be issued to the transferee(s) in exchange for this Warrant
Certificate, subject to the limitations provided in the Amended and Restated
Warrant and Registration Rights Agreement, without charge except for any tax or
other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.

     The Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the registered
holder(s) thereof as the absolute owner(s) of this Warrant Certificate
(notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made by
anyone), for the purpose of any exercise hereof, of any distribution to the
holder(s) hereof, and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the
Warrant Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. Neither the
Warrants nor this Warrant Certificate entitled any holder hereof to any rights
of a stockholder of the Company.
