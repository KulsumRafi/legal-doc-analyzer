which Employee develops for Employer's use, or for use by Employer's controlled subsidiaries or affiliates, during the term of this Agreement, will be considered "work made for hire" within the
meaning of the United States Copyright Act, Title 17, United States Code, which vests all copyright interest in and to the Work in the Employer. In the event, however, that any court of competent
jurisdiction finally declares that the Work is not or was not a work made for hire as agreed, Employee agrees to assign, convey, and transfer to the Employer all right, title and interest Employee may
presently have or may have or be deemed to have in and to any such Work and in the copyright of such work, including but not limited to, all rights of reproduction, distribution, publication, public
performance, public display and preparation of derivative works, and all rights of ownership and possession of the original fixation of the Work and any and all copies. Additionally, Employee agrees
to execute any documents necessary for Employer to record and/or perfect its ownership of the Work and the applicable copyright. The foregoing will not apply to any writings Employee develops which
are not for Employer's use or are in each instance specifically excluded in advance of publication from the coverage of the foregoing by Employer's Board of Directors.

controlled subsidiaries or affiliates will be entitled to appropriate equitable relief, including, but not limited to, a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, without the necessity
of posting a bond. Employee will also be entitled to seek equitable relief against Employer in connection with enforcement of the covenants and obligations set forth in Sections 8, 9, and 10. The
