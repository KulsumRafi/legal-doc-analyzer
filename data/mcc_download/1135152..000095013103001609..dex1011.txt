                        COMMERCIAL PAPER DEALER AGREEMENT
                                  4(2) Program

         This agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the understandings between the
Issuer and the Dealer in connection with the issuance and sale by the Issuer of
its short-term promissory notes through the Dealer (the "Notes").

         Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 6 hereof.

         The Addendum to this Agreement, and any Annexes or Exhibits described
in this Agreement or such Addendum, are hereby incorporated into this Agreement
and made fully a part hereof.

Section 1.   Offers, Sales and Resales of Notes

         1.1 While (i) the Issuer has and shall have no obligation to sell the
Notes to the Dealer or to permit the Dealer to arrange any sale of the Notes for
the account of the Issuer, and (ii) the Dealer has and shall have no obligation
to purchase the Notes from the Issuer or to arrange any sale of the Notes for
the account of the Issuer, the parties hereto agree that in any case where the
Dealer purchases Notes from the Issuer, or arranges for the sale of Notes by the
Issuer, such Notes will be purchased or sold by the Dealer in reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Issuer contained
herein or made pursuant hereto and on the terms and conditions and in the manner
provided herein.

         1.2 So long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, and in addition
to the limitations contained in Section 1.7 hereof, the Issuer shall not,
without the consent of the Dealer, offer, solicit or accept offers to purchase,
or sell, any Notes except (a) in transactions with one or more dealers which may
from time to time after the date hereof become dealers with respect to the Notes
by executing with the Issuer one or more agreements which contain provisions
substantially identical to Section 1 of this Agreement, of which the Issuer
hereby undertakes to provide the Dealer prompt notice or (b) in transactions
with the other dealers listed on the Addendum hereto, which are executing
agreements with the Issuer which contain provisions substantially identical to
Section 1 of this Agreement contemporaneously herewith. In no event shall the
Issuer offer, solicit or accept offers to purchase, or sell, any Notes directly
on its own behalf in transactions with persons other than broker-dealers as
specifically permitted in this Section 1.2.

         1.3 The Notes shall be in a minimum denomination or minimum amount,
whichever is applicable, of $250,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
thereof, will bear such interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at
such discount from their face amounts, as shall be agreed upon by the Dealer and
the Issuer, shall have a maturity not exceeding 365 days from the date of
issuance (exclusive of days of grace) and shall not contain any provision for
extension, renewal or automatic "rollover."

         1.4 The authentication, delivery and payment of the Notes shall be
effected in accordance with the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement and the Notes
shall be represented by book-entry Notes registered in the name of DTC or its
nominee in the form or forms annexed to the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement.

         1.5 If the Issuer and the Dealer shall agree on the terms of the
purchase of any Note by the Dealer or the sale of any Note arranged by the
Dealer (including, but not limited to, agreement with respect to the date of
issue, purchase price, principal amount, maturity and interest rate (in the case
of interest-bearing Notes) or discount thereof (in the case of Notes issued on a
discount basis), and appropriate compensation for the Dealer's services
hereunder) pursuant to this Agreement, the Issuer shall cause such Note to be
issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Issuing and Paying
Agent Agreement and payment for such Note shall be made by the purchaser
thereof, either directly or through the Dealer, to

<PAGE>

                                       2

the Issuer. Except as otherwise agreed, in the event that the Dealer is acting
as an agent and a purchaser shall either fail to accept delivery of or make
payment for a Note on the date fixed for settlement, the Dealer shall promptly
notify the Issuer, and if the Dealer has theretofore paid the Issuer for the
Note, the Issuer will promptly return such funds to the Dealer upon notice of
such failure. If such failure occurred for any reason other than default by the
Dealer, the Issuer shall reimburse the Dealer on an equitable basis for the
Dealer's loss of the use of such funds for the period such funds were credited
to the Issuer's account.

         1.6 The Dealer and the Issuer hereby establish and agree to observe the
following procedures in connection with offers, sales and subsequent resales or
other transfers of the Notes:

             (a) Offers and sales of the Notes by or through the Dealer shall be
         made only to investors reasonably believed by the Dealer to be: (i)
         Institutional Accredited Investors or Sophisticated Individual
         Accredited Investors, (ii) non-bank fiduciaries or agents that will be
         purchasing Notes for one or more accounts, each of which is an
         Institutional Accredited Investor or Sophisticated Individual
         Accredited Investor, and (iii) Qualified Institutional Buyers.

             (b) Resales and other transfers of the Notes by or through the
         Dealer or by other holders thereof shall be made only in accordance
         with the restrictions in the legends described in clause (e) below.

             (c) No general solicitation or general advertising shall be used in
         connection with the offering of the Notes. Without limiting the
         generality of the foregoing, without the prior written approval of
         Dealer, the Issuer shall not issue any press release or place or
         publish any "tombstone" or other advertisement relating to the Notes.

             (d) No sale of Notes to any one purchaser shall be for less than
         $250,000 principal or face amount, and no Note shall be issued in a
         smaller principal or face amount. If the purchaser is a non-bank
         fiduciary acting on behalf of others, each person for whom such
         purchaser is acting must purchase at least $250,000 principal or face
         amount of Notes.

             (e) Offers and sales of the Notes by the Issuer through the Dealer
         acting as agent for the Issuer shall be subject to the restrictions
         described in the legend appearing on Exhibit A hereto. A legend
         substantially to the effect of such Exhibit A shall appear as part of
         the Private Placement Memorandum used in connection with offers and
         sales of Notes hereunder.

             (f) The Dealer shall furnish or shall have furnished to each
         purchaser of Notes for which it has acted as the Dealer a copy of the
         then-current Private Placement Memorandum unless such purchaser has
         previously received a copy of the Private Placement Memorandum as then
         in effect. The Private Placement Memorandum shall expressly state that
         any person to whom Notes are offered shall have an opportunity to ask
         questions of, and receive information from, the Issuer and the Dealer
         and shall provide the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the
         persons from whom information regarding the Issuer may be obtained.

             (g) The Issuer agrees, for the benefit of the Dealer and each of
         the holders and prospective purchasers from time to time of the Notes
         that, if at any time the Issuer shall not be subject to Section 13 or
         15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Issuer will furnish, upon request and at
         its expense, to the Dealer and to holders and prospective purchasers of
         Notes information required by Rule 144A(d)(4)(i) in compliance with
         Rule 144A(d).

             (h) In the event that any Note offered or to be offered by Dealer
         would be ineligible for resale under Rule 144A, the Issuer shall
         immediately notify Dealer (by telephone, confirmed in writing) of such
         fact and shall promptly prepare and deliver to Dealer an amendment or
         supplement to the Private Placement Memorandum describing the Notes
         that are ineligible, the reason for such ineligibility and any other
         relevant information relating thereto.

                                       3

             (i) The Issuer represents that it may issue commercial paper in the
         United States market in reliance upon, and in compliance with, the
         exemption provided by Section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act. In that
         connection, the Issuer agrees that (a) the proceeds from the sale of
         the Notes will be segregated from the proceeds of the sale of any such
         commercial paper by being placed in a separate account; (b) the Issuer
         will institute appropriate corporate procedures to ensure that the
         offers and sales of notes issued by the Issuer pursuant to the Section
         3(a)(3) exemption are not integrated with offerings and sales of Notes
         hereunder; and (c) the Issuer will comply with each of the requirements
         of Section 3(a)(3) of the Act in selling commercial paper or other
         short-term debt securities other than the Notes in the United States.

         1.7 The Issuer hereby represents and warrants to the Dealer, in
connection with offers, sales and resales of Notes, as follows:

             (a) Issuer hereby confirms to the Dealer that (except as permitted
         by Section 1.6(i)) within the preceding six months neither the Issuer
         nor any person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to
         in Section 1.2 hereof acting on behalf of the Issuer has offered or
         sold any Notes, or any substantially similar security of the Issuer
         (including, without limitation, medium-term notes issued by the
         Issuer), to, or solicited offers to buy any such security from, any
         person other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in
         Section 1.2 hereof. The Issuer also agrees that (except as permitted by
         Section 1.6(i)), as long as the Notes are being offered for sale by the
         Dealer and the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof as
         contemplated hereby and until at least six months after the offer of
         Notes hereunder has been terminated, neither the Issuer nor any person
         other than the Dealer or the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2
         hereof (except as contemplated by Section 1.2 hereof) will offer the
         Notes or any substantially similar security of the Issuer for sale to,
         or solicit offers to buy any such security from, any person other than
         the Dealer and the other dealers referred to in Section 1.2 hereof
         (except to the extent any of the foregoing would not cause the offer
         and sale of the Notes by the Issuer to be integrated with other offers
         and sales so as to no longer come within the exemption provided by
         Section 4(2) of the Securities Act), it being understood that such
         agreement is made with a view to bringing the offer and sale of the
         Notes within the exemption provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities
         Act and shall survive any termination of this Agreement. The Issuer
         hereby represents and warrants that it has not taken or omitted to
         take, and will not take or omit to take, any action that would cause
         the offering and sale of Notes hereunder to be integrated with any
         other offering of securities, whether such offering is made by the
         Issuer or some other party or parties, under circumstances that would
         cause the offering and sale of the Notes by the Issuer to fail to be
         exempt under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.

             (b) The Issuer represents and agrees that the proceeds of the sale
         of the Notes are not currently contemplated to be used for the purpose
         of buying, carrying or trading securities within the meaning of
         Regulation T and the interpretations thereunder by the Board of
         Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In the event that the Issuer
         determines to use such proceeds for the purpose of buying, carrying or
         trading securities, whether in connection with an acquisition of
         another company or otherwise, the Issuer shall give the Dealer at least
         five business days' prior written notice to that effect. The Issuer
         shall also give the Dealer prompt notice of the actual date that it
         commences purchasing securities with the proceeds of the Notes.
         Thereafter, in the event that the Dealer purchases Notes as principal
         and does not resell such Notes on the day of such purchase, to the
         extent necessary to comply with Regulation T and the interpretations
         thereunder, the Dealer will sell such Notes only to offerees it
         reasonably believes to be Qualified Institutional Buyers or to
         Qualified Institutional Buyers it reasonably believes are acting for
         other Qualified Institutional Buyers, in each case in accordance with
         Rule 144A.

Section 2.   Representations and Warranties of Issuer

The Issuer represents and warrants that:

obligations under the Notes, this Agreement and the Issuing and Paying Agent
Agreement.

         2.2 This Agreement and the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement have been

enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and limitations on
rights to indemnity and contribution imposed by applicable law.

         2.3 The Notes have been duly authorized, and when issued and delivered
as provided in the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, will be duly and validly

affecting creditors' rights generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a

contribution imposed by applicable law.

         2.4 Assuming compliance by the Dealer with the procedures applicable to
it set forth in Section 1.6 hereof, the offer and sale of Notes in the manner
contemplated hereby do not require registration of the Notes under the
Securities Act, pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section
4(2) thereof, and no indenture in respect of the Notes is required to be
qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

         2.5 The Notes will rank at least pari passu with all other unsecured
and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer.

         2.6 Assuming compliance by the Dealer with the procedures applicable to

Notes or the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, except as may be required by
the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states in connection with the
offer and sale of the Notes.

         2.7 Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, nor the issuance and delivery of the Notes
in accordance with the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement, nor the fulfillment
of or compliance with the terms and provisions hereof or thereof by the Issuer,
will (i) result in the creation or imposition of any mortgage, lien, charge or
encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any of the properties or assets of the
Issuer, or (ii) violate or result in a breach or an event of default under any
of the terms of the Issuer's charter documents or by-laws, any material contract
or instrument to which the Issuer is a party or by which it or its property is
bound, or any law or regulation or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any
court or government instrumentality, to which the Issuer is subject or by which
it or its property is bound, which breach or event of default could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or
otherwise) or operations of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or the ability of the Issuer to perform its obligations under this Agreement,
the Notes or the Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement.

         2.8 There is no litigation or governmental proceeding pending, or to
the knowledge of the Issuer threatened, against or affecting the Issuer or any
of its subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to result in a material
adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) or operations of the
Issuer and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the ability of the Issuer to
perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Notes or the Issuing and
Paying Agent Agreement.

         2.9  The Issuer is not an "investment company" or an entity
"controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

         2.10 The Private Placement Memorandum delivered to investors in
connection with any sale of Notes will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; provided, that the Issuer makes no representation or warranty as to
the Dealer Information.

         2.11 Each (a) issuance of Notes by the Issuer hereunder and (b)
amendment or supplement of the Private Placement Memorandum shall be deemed a
representation and warranty by the Issuer to the Dealer, as of the date thereof,
that, both before and after giving effect to such issuance and after giving
effect to such amendment or supplement, (i) the representations and warranties
given by the Issuer set forth above in this Section 2 remain true and correct on
and as of such date as if made on and as of such date, (ii) in the case of an
issuance of Notes, the Notes being issued on such date have been duly and
validly issued and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Issuer, enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or
at law) and limitations on rights to indemnity and contribution imposed by
applicable law and (iii) in the case of an issuance of Notes, since the date of
the most recent Private Placement Memorandum, there has been no material adverse
change in the condition (financial or otherwise) or operations of the Issuer and
its subsidiaries taken as a whole which has not been disclosed to the Dealer in
writing.

Section 3.    Covenants and Agreements of Issuer

The Issuer covenants and agrees that:

         3.1  The Issuer will give the Dealer prompt notice (but in any event
prior to any subsequent issuance of Notes hereunder) of any amendment to,
modification of, or waiver with respect to, the Notes or the Issuing and Paying
Agent Agreement, including a complete copy of any such amendment, modification
or waiver.

         3.2  The Issuer shall, whenever there shall occur any event that could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the condition
(financial or otherwise) or operations of the Issuer and its subsidiaries taken
as a whole or the ability of the Issuer to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or the Notes, notify the Dealer (by telephone, confirmed in writing)
of such event prior to subsequent issuances of Notes hereunder. The Issuer
shall, whenever it receives notice of any downgrading or intended downgrading or
any review for potential change in the rating accorded any of the Issuer's
securities by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization which
has published a rating of the Notes, promptly, and in any event prior to any
subsequent issuance of Notes hereunder, notify the Dealer (by telephone,
confirmed in writing) of such occurrence.

         3.3  The Issuer shall from time to time upon request of the Dealer
furnish to the Dealer copies of all materials provided by the Issuer to any
national securities exchange regarding (i) the Issuer's operations and financial
condition, and (ii) the Issuer's ability to pay the Notes as they mature.

         3.4  The Issuer will take all such action as the Dealer may reasonably
request to ensure that each offer and each sale of the Notes will comply with
any applicable state Blue Sky laws; provided, that the Issuer shall not be
obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a
foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or
subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in
which it is not otherwise so subject.

         3.5  The Issuer shall not issue Notes hereunder until the Dealer shall
have received (a) an opinion of counsel to the Issuer, addressed to the Dealer,
satisfactory in form and substance to the Dealer, (b) a copy of the executed
Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement as then in effect, (c) a copy of resolutions

<PAGE>

                                       6

adopted by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, satisfactory in form and
substance to the Dealer and certified by the Secretary or similar officer of the
Issuer, authorizing execution and delivery by the Issuer of this Agreement, the
Issuing and Paying Agent Agreement and the Notes and consummation by the Issuer
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (d) a copy of the executed
Letter of Representations among the Issuer, the Issuing and Paying Agent and DTC
and (e) such other certificates, opinions, letters and documents as the Dealer
shall have reasonably requested.

         3.6  The Issuer shall reimburse the Dealer for all of the Dealer's
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to this Agreement up to $10,000,
including expenses incurred in connection with its preparation and negotiation,
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including, but not limited to, the
printing and distribution of the Private Placement Memorandum), and, if
applicable, for the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the Dealer's
counsel.

Section 4.    Disclosure

         4.1  The Private Placement Memorandum and its contents (other than the
Dealer Information) shall be the sole responsibility of the Issuer. The Private
Placement Memorandum shall contain a statement expressly offering an opportunity
for each prospective purchaser to ask questions of, and receive answers from,
the Issuer concerning the offering of Notes and to obtain relevant additional
information which the Issuer possesses or can acquire without unreasonable
effort or expense.

         4.2  The Issuer agrees to promptly furnish the Dealer the Company
Information as it becomes publicly available.

         4.3  (a) The Issuer further agrees to notify the Dealer promptly upon
the occurrence of any event relating to or affecting the Issuer that would cause
the Company Information then in existence to include an untrue statement of a
material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading.

              (b) In the event that the Issuer gives the Dealer notice pursuant
to Section 4.3(a) and the Dealer notifies the Issuer that it then has Notes it
is holding in inventory, the Issuer agrees promptly to supplement or amend the
Private Placement Memorandum so that such Private Placement Memorandum, as
amended or supplemented, shall not contain an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, and the Issuer shall make such supplement or amendment available to
the Dealer.

              (c) In the event that (i) the Issuer gives the Dealer notice
pursuant to Section 4.3(a), (ii) the Dealer does not notify the Issuer that it
is then holding Notes in inventory and (iii) the Issuer chooses not to promptly
amend or supplement the Private Placement Memorandum in the manner described in
clause (b) above, then all solicitations and sales of Notes shall be suspended
until such time as the Issuer has so amended or supplemented the Private
Placement Memorandum, and made such amendment or supplement available to the
Dealer.

Section 5.    Indemnification and Contribution

         5.1  The Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Dealer and each
individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association or other entity
controlling the Dealer within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act (hereinafter the "Indemnitees") against any and
all liabilities, penalties, suits, causes of action, losses, damages, claims,
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel) or judgments of whatever kind or nature (each a
"Claim"), imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against the Indemnitees arising
out of or based upon (i) any allegation that the Private Placement Memorandum
included (as of any relevant time of an offer and sale of the Notes by the
Issuer) or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted (as of any
relevant time of an offer and sale of the Notes by the Issuer) or omits to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or

<PAGE>

                                       7

(ii) arising out of or based upon the breach by the Issuer of any agreement,
covenant or representation made in or pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
however, the obligations of the Issuer under this Section 5 shall not inure to
the benefit of any Indemnitee on account of any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities from the sale of any Notes by the Dealer to any investor if a copy
of the Private Placement Memorandum (as amended or supplemented, if prior to

                           FURTHER PROVISIONS RELATING
                               TO INDEMNIFICATION

         (a) The Issuer agrees to reimburse each Indemnitee for all expenses
(including reasonable fees and disbursements of internal and external counsel)
as they are incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any
loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect of which indemnification may
be sought under Section 5.1 of the Agreement (whether or not it is a party to
any such proceedings).

         (b) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee of notice of the existence
of a Claim arising under Section 5.1 of the Agreement, such Indemnitee will, if
a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Issuer, notify the Issuer
in writing of the existence thereof; provided that (i) the omission so to notify
the Issuer will not relieve it from any liability which it may have hereunder
unless and except to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such Claim and the
Issuer is materially prejudiced thereby, and (ii) the omission so to notify the
Issuer will not relieve it from liability which it may have to an Indemnitee
otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In case any such Claim is
made against any Indemnitee and it notifies the Issuer of the existence thereof,
the Issuer will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it
may elect by written notice delivered to the Indemnitee, to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee; provided that
if the defendants in any such Claim include both the Indemnitee and the Issuer
and the Indemnitee shall have concluded that there may be legal defenses
available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the
Issuer, the Issuer shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Claim
on behalf of such Indemnitee, and the Indemnitee shall have the right to select
separate counsel to assert such legal defenses on behalf of such Indemnitee.
Upon receipt of notice from the Issuer to such Indemnitee of the Issuer's
election so to assume the defense of such Claim and approval by the Indemnitee
of counsel, the Issuer will not be liable to such Indemnitee for expenses
incurred thereafter by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof
(other than reasonable costs of investigation) unless (i) the Indemnitee shall
have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal
defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being
understood, however, that the Issuer shall not be liable for the expenses of
more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel in the
jurisdiction in which any Claim is brought), approved by the Dealer,
representing the Indemnitee who is party to such Claim), (ii) the Issuer shall
not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee to represent
the Indemnitee within a reasonable time after notice of existence of the Claim
or (iii) the Issuer has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the
Indemnitee. The indemnity, reimbursement and contribution obligations of the
Issuer hereunder shall be in addition to any other liability the Issuer may
otherwise have to an Indemnitee and shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of any successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives of the
Issuer and any Indemnitee. The Issuer agrees that without the Dealer's prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, it will not
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim in
respect of which indemnification may be sought under Section 5.1 of the
Agreement (whether or not the Dealer or any other Indemnitee is an actual or
potential party to such Claim), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of each Indemnitee from all liability arising
out of such Claim. The Dealer agrees that without the Issuer's prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, it shall not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim in respect of
which indemnification may be sought under Section 5.1 of the Agreement (whether
or not the Issuer is an actual or potential party to such Claim).
