                             PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

               RPM desires to reincorporate in Delaware via a merger of RPM with
        and into a newly formed Ohio merger subsidiary of RPM-Delaware (the
        "REINCORPORATION").

               Immediately after the Reincorporation, RPM-Delaware desires to
        unconditionally assume RPM's obligations as Servicer and Performance
        Guarantor under the Agreements and the other Transaction Documents
        referenced therein (the "ASSUMPTION").

               The parties are willing to permit the assumption by RPM-Delaware
        of RPM's obligations under the Transaction Documents, and to release RPM
        from further liability for such obligations, on the terms and subject to
        the conditions hereinafter set forth.

               NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the other
mutual covenants herein contained, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

               1.     Assumption and Release. By its signature below, effective
as of the Effective Time (hereinafter defined), RPM-Delaware hereby absolutely
and unconditionally assumes and agrees to become primarily liable for all of
RPM's representations, covenants, promises, indemnities and other obligations
under the Transaction Documents as initial Servicer and/or as the Performance
Guarantor, whether now existing, hereafter arising, absolute or contingent, and
each of the other parties hereto hereby releases RPM from further liability
therefor.

               2.     Amendments.  From and after the Effective Time, all
references in the Agreements and other Transaction Documents to "RPM, Inc." or
"RPM" are hereby replaced with "RPM International Inc." and "RPM-Delaware,"
respectively, and all references to the Performance Guarantor shall be deemed to
be references to RPM-Delaware.

               3.     Representations.  In order to induce the other parties
hereto to agree to the assumption, release and amendments set forth above,
RPM-Delaware hereby represents and warrants to the other parties hereto as
follows:

               (a)    Existence and Power. RPM-Delaware is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware. RPM-Delaware
is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation, and has and holds all corporate power and all governmental
licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its
<PAGE>

business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted except where
the failure to so qualify or so hold could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

               (b)    Power and Authority; Due Authorization, Execution and
Delivery. The execution and delivery by RPM-Delaware of this Amendment, and the
performance of its obligations hereunder, are within its corporate powers and
authority and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on its
part. This Amendment has been duly executed and delivered by RPM-Delaware.

               (c)    No Conflict. The execution and delivery by RPM-Delaware of
this Amendment, and the performance of the obligations assumed by it hereunder
do not contravene or violate (i) its certificate of incorporation or by-laws,
(ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to it, (iii) any restrictions under
any agreement, contract or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or
any of its property is bound, or (iv) any order, writ, judgment, award,
injunction or decree binding on or affecting it or its property, and do not
result in the creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim on assets of
RPM-Delaware or its Subsidiaries (except as created under the Transaction
Documents) except, in any case, where such contravention or violation could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               4.     Conditions Precedent; Effective Time.  The assumption and
amendments will become effective immediately after the latest to occur of the
following (the "EFFECTIVE TIME"):

        Assistant Secretary of RPM-Delaware certifying: (i) a copy of the
        resolutions of the Board of Directors of RPM-Delaware, authorizing
        RPM-Delaware's execution, delivery and performance of this Amendment and
        the other documents to be delivered by it hereunder; (ii) the names and
        signatures of the officers authorized on its behalf to execute this
        Amendment and the other documents to be delivered by it hereunder and
        (iii) a copy of RPM-Delaware's by-laws; and

               (g)    Receipt by the Agent of a favorable opinion of legal
        counsel for RPM-Delaware, reasonably acceptable to the Agents, in
        substantially the form of the opinion given with respect to RPM at the
        time of the initial purchase under the

<PAGE>

        RPA, which addresses the following matters with respect to RPM-Delaware:
        (i) due incorporation, valid existence and good standing, (ii) requisite

the other parties hereto hereby covenants and agrees that, prior to the date
that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding senior
indebtedness of such Conduit, it will not institute against, or join any other
Person in instituting against, such Conduit any bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or other similar proceeding
under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States.

               5.2.  CHOICE OF LAW.  THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS (AND NOT THE LAW OF CONFLICTS) OF
THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.

               5.3.   WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY
MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT
OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AMENDMENT OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS OR THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER.

               5.4.   Binding Effect.  This Amendment shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns (including any trustee in bankruptcy).

               5.5.   Counterparts.  This Amendment may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of
which when taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
