Party becoming obligated to indemnify or make any other payment to the Indemnified Party under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the
Indemnifying Party, notify the Indemnifying Party promptly in writing of the commencement thereof. The failure of the Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have on account of this indemnification or otherwise, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after being so notified, to assume the defense of such litigation or proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. In any such litigation or proceeding the defense of which the Indemnifying Party shall have so assumed, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate therein and retain
its own counsel at its own expense unless (i)&nbsp;the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii)&nbsp;the named parties to
any such litigation or proceeding (including the impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and representation of both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them; in either such case, such separate counsel may be retained by the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party's expense, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be obligated to pay for more than one counsel (in addition to
any local counsel) for all such Indemnified Party, unless the representation of all Indemnified Parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests
between them or each such Indemnified Party is a named party to any such litigation or proceeding. To the extent that the settlement of such an action or proceeding, the defense of which has been
assumed by the Indemnifying Party, involves payment of money, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, in consultation with the Indemnified Party, to settle those aspects dealing only with the
payment of money. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any such defense or settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into a consent decree involving injunctive or other
non-monetary relief or consent to an injunction without the Indemnified Party's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate,
and shall use its best efforts to cause its employees and the employees of any of its respective subsidiaries to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding
assumed by the Indemnifying Party. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
Indemnifying Party's obligation under this Section&nbsp;9 shall not affect the other party's right to seek any remedy upon a default by the Indemnifying Party
under this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
sums payable by an Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Section&nbsp;9 shall be paid without any deduction, withholding counter-claim or set-off. </FONT></P>

provide, promptly upon request therefor by Owner's Board of Directors, such information regarding the Services and Management Fees as shall be reasonably available. In the event Manager determines
that any of the Services require the expenditure or other commitment, whether contingent or otherwise, by or on behalf of Owner in excess of $750,000 in any one expenditure or other commitment for
such Service or $1,500,000 in the aggregate in any series of related expenditures or other commitments for such Service, Manager shall seek the prior written approval of the Board Directors of Owner;
provided, however, that the following expenditures or commitments shall be exempted from such approval requirements: (a)&nbsp;operating expenses and commitments incurred in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practice (e.g., film licensing transactions with studios and distributors), (b)&nbsp;expenses and commitments incurred pursuant to contracts and other arrangements
that have been approved by Owner's Board of Directors, (c)&nbsp;maintenance and upkeep of Theatres and other facilities and (d)&nbsp;expenditures required as a result of an emergency situation, as
determined by Manager in its reasonable discretion. Manager shall not dispose of any real or personal property of Owner having a value in excess of $250,000 without the prior written consent of the
Board of Directors of Owner. </FONT></P>

with Owner shall be required to ascertain whether Manager is acting in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If Manager acts without authority, it shall be liable to Owner for any damages
arising out of its unauthorized actions. Subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;11 of this Agreement, Manager shall have the exclusive power and authority to conduct the business of Owner with
respect to the Services; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a derogation of the ultimate authority of the Board of Directors of Owner over the
business and affairs of Owner, or to prevent such Board of Directors from exercising its authority with respect thereto. Subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;11 of this Agreement, Manager is
hereby expressly authorized to make all decisions with respect to the Services and to take all actions necessary or reasonably appropriate to carry out such decisions. All documents executed on behalf
of Owner with respect to the Services need only be signed by an authorized employee of Manager. In case at any time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, Owner will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as Manager may reasonably request. </FONT></P>
