<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dear
Bill: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
will confirm our understanding and agreement with respect to your taking the position of Chief Operating Officer of TMP Worldwide&nbsp;Inc. (the "Company"). You and the Company
hereby agree as follows: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
The Company agrees to employ you and you agree to be employed by the Company as Chief Operating Officer, with such duties and responsibilities with respect to the Company and its
affiliates as the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") or such other person from time to time designated by the CEO to deal with matters related to this agreement (the "Designee") shall
reasonably direct. You agree to devote your best efforts, energies, abilities and full business time, skill and attention to your duties. You agree to perform the duties and responsibilities assigned
to you to the best of your ability, in a diligent, trustworthy, businesslike and efficient manner for the purpose of advancing the business of the Company and to adhere to any and all of the
employment policies of the Company. Your role in this position will commence on October&nbsp;21, 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
In consideration for your services and other agreements hereunder, during your employment the Company shall (a)&nbsp;pay you a base salary of $550,000 per year (prorated for periods
of less than a full year) in regular installments in accordance with the Company's payroll practice for salaried employees, (b)&nbsp;provide you with medical, dental and disability coverage, if any,
and 401(k) Plan, life insurance and other benefit plan eligibility, if any, comparable to that regularly provided to other senior management in accordance with the Company's policies,
(c)&nbsp;provide you with 4 weeks vacation per year in accordance with the Company's policies (prorated for periods of less than a full year), and (d)&nbsp;with respect to employment in calendar
year 2003 and any calendar year thereafter, provide you with annual performance based bonuses of up to 100% of your base salary on the basis of satisfaction of such performance goals as are
established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company under the Company's 1999 Long Term Incentive Plan within 90&nbsp;days of the commencement of the applicable
calendar year period. For any period of employment following December&nbsp;31, 2003, your base salary will increase to $600,000 per annum (prorated for period of less than a full year). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
You may terminate this agreement at any time upon 60&nbsp;days' prior written notice. The Company may terminate this agreement at any time upon written notice. This agreement shall
also terminate automatically in the event you should die or, in the reasonable determination of the Company, become unable to perform by reason of physical or mental incompetency your obligations
hereunder for a period of 120&nbsp;days in any 365&nbsp;day period. It is understood and agreed that in the event that this agreement is terminated by the Company in accordance with the second
sentence of this Section&nbsp;3 other than for Cause (as defined below), then subject to (i)&nbsp;your execution and delivery of the Company's then current form of separation agreement and general
release applicable to similarly situated employees and (ii)&nbsp;the expiration of any rescission period provided thereby (without the rescission having been exercised), you shall, as your sole and
exclusive remedy, be entitled to (i)&nbsp;receive as severance your then applicable base salary hereunder for a period of twelve months (the "Specified Period"), payable in regular installments in
accordance with the Company's applicable payroll practice for salaried employees and (ii)&nbsp;during the Specified Period, have the Company make available to you (and/or pay COBRA premiums on)
medical and dental benefits on the same terms and conditions as would have been made available to you had you remained employed by the </FONT></P>

Company during such period. Except as expressly provided in the preceding sentence, in the event of the termination of this agreement or your employment for any reason, the Company shall have no
further obligations to you hereunder or with respect to your employment from the effective date of termination. "Cause" shall mean the occurrence of any one or more of the following events:
(i)&nbsp;your willful failure or gross negligence in performance of your duties or compliance with the reasonable directions of the CEO or the Designee that remains unremedied for a period of twenty
(20)&nbsp;days after the CEO or the Designee has given written notice specifying in reasonable detail your failure to perform such duties or comply with such directions; (ii)&nbsp;your failure to
comply with a material employment policy of the Company that remains unremedied for a period of twenty (20)&nbsp;days after the CEO or the Designee has given written notice to you specifying in
reasonable detail your failure to comply; or (iii)&nbsp;your commission of (a)&nbsp;a felony, (b)&nbsp;criminal dishonesty or (c)&nbsp;fraud. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
You acknowledge that you have not relied on any representation not set forth in this agreement. You represent that you are free to enter into this employment arrangement and that you
are not bound by any restrictive covenants or similar provisions restricting the performance of your duties hereunder. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
In the event of any Change in Control (as defined in Option Agreement between you and the Company dated October&nbsp;10, 2002), the options covered by the October&nbsp;10, 2002
Option Agreement and any options which may be granted to you by the Company from time to time after the date hereof pursuant to written option agreements, shall automatically and immediately become
(i)&nbsp;fully vested and (ii)&nbsp;exercisable for the balance of the ten year term provided by the applicable stock option agreement, subject to the other terms of such option agreement, subject
to the provisions of Section&nbsp;6 below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
Notwithstanding anything in Section&nbsp;5 to the contrary, you shall in no event be entitled to any payment or acceleration of options or shares of Company common stock that would
cause any portion of the amount received by you to constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined under Section&nbsp;280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). In
furtherance of the provisions of this Section&nbsp;6, the following provisions shall apply: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
Anything in this agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that any payment or acceleration of options or shares of Company common stock by the Company to or for your
benefit (collectively, a "Payment") would be nondeductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes because of Section&nbsp;280G of the Code, then the aggregate present value of amounts
payable or distributable to or for your benefit pursuant to this agreement or any option agreement shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount (as defined below). Any such reduction shall be accomplished
first by reducing the number of options to acquire Company common stock which otherwise would have immediately vested in full, as determined in the reasonable discretion of the Board of Directors of
the Company (the "Board"), provided that any options so reduced shall continue to vest in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreements irrespective of your continued employment or, if
earlier, the date or dates on which such options can vest without being deemed nondeductible, as determined in the reasonable discretion of the Board, and second, if necessary, by reducing cash
payments constituting part of the payments or other consideration to which you become entitled (collectively, such cash payments, other consideration and the aggregate present value of the immediate
vesting of options (calculated in accordance with Section&nbsp;280G of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder) are referred to as the "Severance Amount"). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
The "Reduced Amount" shall be the amount, expressed in present value, which maximizes the aggregate present value of the Severance Amount without causing any Payment to be
nondeductible by the Company because of Section&nbsp;280G of the Code. For purposes of this clause&nbsp;(2), present value shall be determined in accordance with Section&nbsp;280(d)(4) of the
Code. </FONT></P>

All determinations required to be made under this Section&nbsp;6 shall be made by the Company's independent public accountants (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed
supporting calculations to the Company and you. Any such determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and you. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
It is possible that as a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;280G of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm, a portion of
the Severance Amount will have been made by the Company which should not have been made ("Overpayment") or that an amount in addition to the Severance Payment which will not have been made could have
been made ("Underpayment"), in each case, consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(x)
Overpayment. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against you which the Accounting Firm believes has a high
probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for your benefit shall be treated for all purposes as a loan ab
initio (from the beginning) to you which you shall repay to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section&nbsp;1274(d) of the Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(y)
Underpayment. If precedent or other substantial authority indicates that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for your
benefit together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section&nbsp;1274(d) of the Code. </FONT></P>
