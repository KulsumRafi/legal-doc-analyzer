NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants provided for herein,
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:

1.   ADD NEW SECTION 2. PRODUCT FORECASTS - The following Section 2, governing
     Product Forecasts, is hereby added to this Agreement:

     "2.  PRODUCT FORECASTS

     2.1  On or before the first of each calendar month of the Term of this
          Agreement, BRIGHTPOINT agrees to furnish a non-binding, rolling, ++
          month forecast of its anticipated sales of Products under this
          Agreement (each, a "Forecast"), which data will be utilized in the
          Demand Supply Balancing ("DSB") process set forth in Section 4.1.1 of
          the VMI Statement of Work attached hereto as Attachment 10 ("VMI
          Statement of Work"). The parties will conduct ++ reviews of Forecasts
          to maximize the stability of such Forecasts. Under the VMI Program as

          NOKIA agrees to maintain in the inventory of Products owned by NOKIA
          and held by BRIGHTPOINT as Bailed Inventory at BRIGHTPOINT's facility
          located at 501 Airtech Parkway, Plainfield, Indiana (which facility is
          designated as "US 17" in NOKIA's system, and "NOK5" in BRIGHTPOINT's
          system, and which facility is hereinafter referred to as "NOK5") such
          amounts of Product equal to ++ Days of Supply (as defined in Section
          4.1.4 of Attachment 10, and calculated in accordance with Section
          4.3(ii) of Attachment 10) of Products as set forth in the then current
          Forecast, provided, however, that NOKIA shall have ++ days from the
          Effective Date of Amendment No. 1 to the Distributor Agreement to
          reduce BRIGHTPOINT's current inventory of Products to the ++ Days of
          Supply standard. Upon the expiration of such ++ day Product inventory
          transition period, if the inventory levels held in NOK5 during the
          remainder of the term of the VMI Program exceed ++ Days of Supply as
          set forth in the then current Forecast, NOKIA shall have the right,
          upon providing ++ days' prior written notice to BRIGHTPOINT, to sell
          or distribute the amount of inventory of Products exceeding ++ Days of
          Supply of Products as set forth in the then current Forecast to any
          third party entity (subject to the terms, conditions and limitations
          set forth in the Agreement). For purposes of this Agreement, Bailed
          Inventory shall mean the inventory of Products owned by NOKIA and held
          by BRIGHTPOINT at NOK5 under a legal bailment relationship, with NOKIA
          as bailor and BRIGHTPOINT as bailee.

          defined in Section 4.1) and until the time of Product Issue

     the cost of insurance to cover such shipments from NOK5 to Fulfill1. Upon
     BRIGHTPOINT's receipt of each shipment from NOK5 into Fulfill1, BRIGHTPOINT
     will mark the bill of lading with substantially the following phrase
     "received in good condition except as noted, contents subject to complete
     inspection/verification for hidden damages and/or shortages". Any claims of

     then current Forecast, and NOKIA, pursuant to Section 2.1, sells or
     distributes the amount of Products exceeding ++ Days of Supply as set forth
     in the then current Forecast to a third party customer of NOKIA, ++

6.   SECTION 4.4 - Section 4.4 is amended in its entirety to state as follows:

     "BRIGHTPOINT shall be responsible for all taxes, fees or other charges
     imposed by any governmental entity arising with respect to (i) the sale of

Technology at (800) 952-2355 ext. 2314.


The carrier must provide Brightpoint with a valid PO# or RA# in order to
schedule a shipment. If the carrier has a valid PO#, Brightpoint's Receiving
Clerk will verify the validity of the PO# using Brightpoint's Warehouse
Management System, issue a RA#, and schedule an appointment in the next
available opening. A RA# will be accepted and appointment will be set at that
time. If the PO# is not valid, Brightpoint's Receiving Clerk will investigate
the matter. Supplier agrees to cooperate with and assist the Brightpoint
Purchasing Department and the National Brightpoint receives the necessary
information, Brightpoint will contract the carrier to schedule the appointment.


II.  DELIVERY SCHEDULING PROCEDURES

All freight shipments must be scheduled for a delivery appointment 24 hours
prior the actual delivery arrival of the shipment. The carrier should send the
correct APPOINTMENT REQUEST FORM (included on the following pages) as soon as it
receives the shipment. This practice will help expedite the shipment into
Brightpoint's facility and help eliminate any additional transit time.


The following information is required for all appointment requests:

o    all valid PO#s
o    number of cartons for each PO

procedures when making an appointment.

SMALL PACKAGE CARRIER SHIPMENTS
Small package carrier (i.e. UPS, Airborne, Federal Express) shipments are
limited to no more than 200 pounds or 10 boxes per shipment, per d ay. Shipments
exceeding these criteria will be treated as receipts without an appointment. For
shipments of 200 pounds/10 cartons or greater, vendor must contact Brightpoint's
Freight Manager at (800) 952-2355 extension 2227 for assistance with carrier
information.

                                STATEMENT OF WORK
     1.    SCOPE

Upon the Effective Date of this Amendment No.1, BRIGHTPOINT and NOKIA agree to
institute the VMI Program, under which NOKIA will manage and own certain Product
inventory for BRIGHTPOINT's handset distribution business located in Plainfield,
Indiana. Under the VMI Program, BRIGHTPOINT will provide a Forecast of Products,
pursuant to Section 2 of the Agreement, for the initial transfer of Products to
NOK5 to be held by BRIGHTPOINT as Bailed Inventory. As BRIGHTPOINT requires
additional Products, BRIGHTPOINT will, from time to time, deliver to NOKIA a
BRIGHTPOINT Purchase Order (as hereinafter defined) for the issuance of Products
to BRIGHTPOINT from NOK5 inventory. This Statement of Work describes the VMI
Program, including scope, processes, timelines, and system input and outputs.
Under the VMI Program, BRIGHTPOINT will not carry Product inventory on its
financial books and NOKIA will receive ++. NOKIA will own Product inventory,
though BRIGHTPOINT will remain in possession and/or control of the Product.

<PAGE>

     NOKIA) performed by or on behalf of NOKIA, except for claims caused by the
     gross negligence or willful misconduct of NOKIA. Such Additional Insured
     Endorsement shall provide that such insurance is primary and shall not
     contribute with any insurance or self-insurance that NOKIA has procured to
     protect itself unless claims are wholly due to the gross negligence or
     willful misconduct of NOKIA.

     b.    Each of the insurance limits required by this Appendix shall be fully
     paid and exhausted before NOKIA, including any and all of NOKIA's separate
     insurance coverage, if any, including NOKIA's umbrella and/or excess
     insurance policies, if any, becomes involved in the defense or payment of

     compliance with the terms of this Appendix.

5.   Waiver of Subrogation

     Where permitted by law, BRIGHTPOINT waives and will require its insurers to
     waive all rights of subrogation and recovery against the Additional
     Insureds, whether sounding in contract, tort (including negligence and
     strict liability) or otherwise, unless such damages are caused in whole or
     in part due solely to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of NOKIA,
     or acts or omissions of NOKIA triggering strict liability.

6.   Proof of Insurance

     a.   Before commencement of the parties' agreement(s) and prior to NOKIA
          having any obligation to pay BRIGHTPOINT whatsoever, BRIGHTPOINT shall
          provide to NOKIA a certificate of insurance (ACCORD Form 25-S (1/95),
          or the latest edition) signed by a duly authorized officer or agent of
          the insurer certifying that the minimum insurance coverages set forth
          in Section 2 of this Appendix are in effect. Further, the certificate
          of insurance must state that NOKIA will receive at least 30 days'
          written notice of policy cancellation, non-renewal or material
          modification. BRIGHTPOINT shall thereafter provide NOKIA, at least 30
          days' prior to the expiration date of the cancelled, non-renewed or
          materially modified policy, written evidence by an insurance
          certificate that such policy has been replaced, renewed or modified
          with no lapse in coverage by another policy which meets the minimum
          insurance coverages set forth in Section 2 of this Appendix. If
          BRIGHTPOINT does not provide NOKIA with such certificates of insurance
          within 30 days after the date of the parties' agreement(s) and after
          each policy renewal thereafter, then NOKIA may (i) suspend payments to
          BRIGHTPOINT until evidence of required coverage is provided or (ii)
          terminate the parties' agreement(s) or any then-current statement(s)
          of work, work order(s), etc.

     b.   NOKIA's approval of any of BRIGHTPOINT's insurance coverages does not
          relieve or limit any of BRIGHTPOINT's obligations under the parties'
          agreement(s), including, but not limited to, liability under the
          indemnification and defense provisions of the parties' agreement(s)
          for claims exceeding required insurance limits.

     c.   In no event shall NOKIA's allowing BRIGHTPOINT to begin or complete
          its obligations under the parties' agreement(s), or acceptance of any
          such performance or payment therefor, be construed as a waiver of
          NOKIA's right to assert a claim against BRIGHTPOINT for breach of
          BRIGHTPOINT's obligations under this Appendix, or declare BRIGHTPOINT
          in default of the parties' agreement(s) for failure to comply with any
          of BRIGHTPOINT's obligations under this Appendix, all and each of
          which are deemed material.

7.   Subcontractor Requirements

     BRIGHTPOINT shall require each of its subcontractors, if any and as may be
     authorized under the parties' agreement(s) by NOKIA, to comply with all of
     the terms of this Appendix. This includes, but is not limited to,
     maintaining the minimum insurance coverages and limits, naming the
     Additional Insureds as additional insureds under all liability insurance
     policies and waiving all subrogation and other rights of recovery, if any,
     against the Additional Insureds and any assignee thereof, whether in
     contract or tort (including negligence and strict liability) or otherwise.
