<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dear
Mr.&nbsp;Rose: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>This
letter confirms the terms of your employment by Activision Publishing,&nbsp;Inc. ("Employer"), on the terms and conditions set forth below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Term  </I></B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
initial term of your employment under this agreement shall commence on November 01, 2002 and expire on March&nbsp;31, 2005, unless earlier terminated as provided
below (the "initial term"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Employer
shall have the option to extend the initial term of this agreement for an additional successive one-year period. The initial term and the option
period, if exercised, shall be referred to as the "term." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Employer
may exercise the option granted to it under this agreement by giving written notice to Employee at least sixty (60)&nbsp;days prior to the expiration of the
initial term. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Salary  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
full consideration for all rights and services provided by you under this agreement, you shall receive an annual base salary of $240,000 from the effective date of
this Agreement to October&nbsp;31, 2003. On November&nbsp;1, 2003, your annual base salary will be increased to $260,000. On November&nbsp;1, 2004, your annual base salary will be increased to
$280,000. If Employer exercises its option pursuant to Paragraph&nbsp;1(b), your annual base salary on November&nbsp;1, 2005, will be increased to $300,000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Base
salary payments shall be made in accordance with Employer's then prevailing payroll policy. Each base salary referred to in Paragraph&nbsp;2(a) shall constitute
your minimum base salary during the applicable period, and your base salary may be increased above the minimum at any time if Employer's Board of Directors (or the Compensation Committee of such Board
of Directors), in its sole and absolute discretion, elects to do so. In the event of an increase in your base salary beyond the applicable minimum base salary for a particular period, such increased
base salary shall then constitute your minimum base salary for all subsequent periods under this agreement. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Employer
shall not be required to actually use your services during the term of this agreement. You will not be permitted or authorized to act on behalf of Employer if
Employer is not utilizing your services unless specifically authorized in writing to the contrary by Employer. If Employer chooses not to use your services, Employer will continue your coverage under
Employer's health, life insurance and disability plans, and participation in Employer's 401(k) plan during this period. Payment of your base salary during the term of your employment under this
agreement will discharge Employer's obligations to you hereunder. Your obligations to Employer under this agreement generally, and specifically with regard to Paragraph&nbsp;8, shall continue
throughout the term of this agreement. Moreover, you have an obligation to abide by the terms of the Employee Proprietary Information Act executed by you. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to your base salary, you may be eligible to receive an annual discretionary bonus. Your target bonus is 55%, provided that the actual amount of this bonus,
if any, is within the sole and absolute discretion of the Employer's Board of Directors (or the Compensation Committee of the </FONT></P>

Board of Directors). Certain of the criteria that will be considered to evaluate your eligibility for a bonus is your achievement of specific objectives and/or your contribution to the success of the
corporate goals and objectives. Employer's overall financial performance will also be considered in determining whether any bonus is awarded and, if so, the amount. Discretionary bonuses, if granted,
are generally paid to employees in May. You must remain continuously employed by Employer through the date on which the discretionary bonus is paid to be eligible to receive a bonus. Employer retains
the right to modify, at any time, any and all of the criteria used to determine whether Employee is eligible for a bonus and, if so, the amount of any such bonus. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;You
also are being granted, under the Activision&nbsp;Inc. ("company") existing or modified Board-approved stock option plan, a non-qualified stock option
("NQSO") to purchase 40,000 shares of the company's common stock. Such option is in addition to the stock options of Employer previously granted to you. The option to purchase 40,000 shares referred
to above will vest ratably over four years, with one fourth of the amount granted vesting at the end of each year. The option will have an exercise price that will be the market low of such common
stock on the date that it is issued, and will be governed in all other respects by the company's stock option plan in effect at the time of the grant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Other Benefits  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall be entitled to those benefits which are standard for persons in similar positions with Employer, including coverage under Employer's health, life
insurance and disability plans, and eligibility to participate in Employer's 401(k) plan. Nothing paid to you under any such plans and arrangements (nor any bonus or stock options which Employer's
Board of Directors (or the Compensation Committee of such Board of Directors), in its sole and absolute discretion, shall provide to you)) shall be deemed in lieu, or paid on account, of your base
salary. You expressly agree and acknowledge that after the expiration or early termination of the term of your employment under this agreement pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;9, you are entitled to no
additional benefits, except as specifically provided under the benefit plans referred to above and those benefit plans in which you subsequently may become a participant, and subject in each case to
the terms and conditions of each such plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, you shall be entitled to receive those benefits provided by COBRA upon the expiration or earlier
termination of this agreement. </FONT></P>
