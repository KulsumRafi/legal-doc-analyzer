&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Committee shall be the administrator of the Plan and will administer the Plan,
interpret, construe and apply its provisions and determine entitlement to
benefits, all in its discretion. The Committee may further establish, adopt or
revise such rules and regulations as it may deem necessary or advisable for the
administration of the Plan. References to determinations or other actions by
SBC, herein, shall mean actions authorized by the Committee, the Chairman, the
Senior Executive Vice President of SBC in charge of Human Resources, or their
respective successors or duly authorized delegates, in each case in the
discretion of such person. All decisions by SBC shall be final and binding. </FONT></P>

Plan,  exclusive of Article 8, is  21,000,000.  The number of Stock Options and shares of Stock which may be issued
pursuant to Article 8 of the Plan is  34,000,000  each.  Of the foregoing  Stock  Options,  the number of incentive
Stock  Options  which may be issued  pursuant to the Plan is  34,000,000.  Conversions  of stock  awards into Share
Units  pursuant to Section 4.4 and their  eventual  distribution  shall count only  against the limits of the plans
from which they are  transferred  or contributed  and shall not be applied  against the limits in this Plan. To the
extent Share Units are acquired  through  deferrals  of Stock or  contributions  of cash where the payment of which
would otherwise be deductible by SBC under Section 162(m) of the Code  regardless of the size of the  distribution,
and such  Share  Units  are  available  for  distribution,  they  shall be  distributed  first.  In the  event  SBC
determines  that  continuing  the  purchase  of Share  Units under the Plan may cause the number of shares of Stock
that are to be distributed  under this Plan (which may take into account,  among other things,  the number of Share
Units  acquired and the number of Stock  Options  issued or required to be issued,  reduced by the number of shares
of Stock that would be withheld for income tax purposes) to exceed the number of authorized  shares of Stock,  then
SBC may cancel further  purchases of Share Units and require that any further  dividend  equivalents on Share Units
be paid in cash to the Participants.</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In the event of a merger, reorganization,  consolidation,  recapitalization,  separation, liquidation,
stock dividend,  stock split,  share combination,  or other change in the corporate  structure of SBC affecting the
shares of  Stock,  such  adjustment  shall be made to the  number  and  class of the  shares of Stock  which may be
delivered  under the Plan (including but not limited to individual  limits),  and in the number and class of and/or
price of  shares of Stock  subject  to  outstanding  Options  granted  under  the  Plan,  and/or  in the  number of

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject

Board to adjudicate claims brought by or in respect to Participants and their
beneficiaries relating to benefits under the Plan. A Participant may apply in
writing to the Claims Board to make a claim under this Plan. The Claims Board
shall provide written notice within 90 days to a Participant whose claim
hereunder has been denied, setting forth reasons for such denial or explaining
that an extension of the time for processing the claim is necessary, written in
a manner calculated to be understood by such person. After receipt of such
notice, or expiration of 90 days without any response from the Claims Board, the
Participant may appeal the decision in writing to the Senior Executive Vice
President of SBC in charge of Human Resources, or to the person&#146;s
successor, within 90 days, except that if the Participant is an Insider, as that
term is used in the 2001 Incentive Plan, then the Participant&#146;s appeal
shall be to the Committee. The Participant shall receive a full and fair review
of the decision denying the claim in accordance with the requirements of ERISA. </FONT></P>

Contributions under Article 5 or increasing or decreasing the number of Options

consent of a Participant, to alter, to the material detriment of such

credited to such Participant&#146;s Accounts under the Plan. For purposes of
this section, an alteration to the material detriment of a Participant shall
mean a material reduction in the period of time over which Stock may be
distributed to a Participant, any reduction in the Participant&#146;s number of
vested Share Units or Options, or an increase in the Exercise Price or decrease

terminate an election to acquire Share Units with Employee Contributions when
able to do so shall each be conclusively deemed to be the consent of the

the exercise of an Option, SBC shall withhold shares of Stock sufficient in
value, using the FMV on the date determined by SBC to be used to value the Stock

taxes required by law to be withheld as a result of such distribution. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any

otherwise determined by the Committee, when the method of payment for the
Exercise Price is from the sale by a stockbroker pursuant to Section 8.5(b)(ii),

Secretary or Assistant Secretary, or their respective delegates or shall be made
in such other manner as permitted or required by SBC or the General Counsel,

election), which may waive any defects in form. Unless made irrevocable by the

No assets of any Employer shall be held under any trust for the benefit of

under this Plan. Any and all of each Employer&#146;s assets shall be, and

any amounts due an Employer by a Participant, including but not limited to
overpayments under any compensation or benefit plans. In addition, SBC may also
cancel a Stock Option to satisfy such an obligation to an Employer. For this
purpose, each Stock Option shall be valued by subtracting the Exercise Price of
the Stock Option from the FMV of the Stock on such date. </FONT></P>
