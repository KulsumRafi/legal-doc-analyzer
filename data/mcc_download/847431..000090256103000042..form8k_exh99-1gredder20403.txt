                                                    Dated as of January 31, 2003


Each of the Purchasers Listed
on Schedule 1.01

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         NYMAGIC,  INC., a New York corporation  (the "COMPANY"),  hereby agrees
with each of you as follows:


1.       PURCHASE AND SALE OF UNITS

         1.01.  THE UNITS.  The Company has  authorized  the sale of (i) 400,000
shares of its  authorized  shares of Common  Stock  (the  "SHARES")  held in the
Company's  treasury and (ii) options  (the  "OPTIONS")  in the form of EXHIBIT A
hereto to purchase an additional 400,000 shares of Common Stock (such additional
400,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate  issuable from time to time upon
exercise of the Options,  collectively, the "OPTION SHARES") at a purchase price
of  $21.00  per  Unit,  to  the  persons   (individually,   a  "PURCHASER"   and
collectively,  the  "PURCHASERS")  and in the  respective  amounts  set forth in
SCHEDULE 1.01 hereto.

         1.02. PURCHASE PRICE AND CLOSING.  The Company agrees to issue and sell
to the  Purchasers  and, in  consideration  of and in express  reliance upon the
representations,  warranties, covenants, terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Purchasers, severally, but not jointly, agree to purchase that number of the
Units set forth opposite their  respective names in SCHEDULE 1.01. The aggregate
purchase  price of the  Units  being  acquired  by each  Purchaser  is set forth
opposite such Purchaser's name in SCHEDULE 1.01. The closing of the purchase and
sale of the Units to be acquired by the  Purchasers  from the Company under this
Agreement  (the  "CLOSING")  shall take place  (including  by means of  courier,
facsimile  and  electronic  transmissions)  at the  offices of  Morgan,  Lewis &
Bockius LLP, 101 Park Avenue,  New York, New York 10178 at 10:00 a.m. on January
31, 2003 (the "CLOSING DATE"). At the Closing,  the Company will deliver to each
Purchaser  certificates  for the number of (i) Shares and (ii) Options,  in each
case,  set forth  opposite its name under the heading  "Number of Common Shares"
and "Number of Options",  as applicable,  in SCHEDULE 1.01  registered,  in each
case,  on the books of the Company in such  Purchaser's  name (or its  nominee),
against  delivery  of a transfer  of funds to the account of the Company by wire
transfer,  representing the cash  consideration for the Units set forth opposite
such Purchaser's name under the heading  "Aggregate  Purchase Price" on SCHEDULE
1.01.

2.       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         The Company hereby represents and warrants to the Purchasers, as of the
Closing Date, as follows:
<PAGE>


         2.01. ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION. The Company is a corporation duly
incorporated,  validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of New York and the Company is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation
in each jurisdiction in which qualification is required, except where failure to
so qualify could not reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect.
All of the  Subsidiaries of the Company are listed on SCHEDULE  2.01(A).  All of
the Insurance  Subsidiaries of the Company are listed on SCHEDULE 2.01(B).  Each
Subsidiary is duly  organized,  validly  existing and in good standing under the
laws of its  jurisdiction of  organization  and is qualified to do business as a
foreign entity in each jurisdiction in which  qualification is required,  except
where failure to so qualify could not  reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         2.02.  AUTHORIZED  CAPITAL STOCK. As of the date hereof, the authorized
capital stock of the Company  consists of  30,000,000  shares of Common Stock of
which 9,276,398 shares are issued and outstanding,  5,855,826 shares are held in
treasury and 618,700 shares are reserved for issuance under the Company's  stock
option plans and for the issuance  upon the exercise or  conversion  of warrants
and other convertible  securities issued by the Company. All of such outstanding
shares of capital stock,  which are  outstanding  or held in treasury,  are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and have been issued in
compliance  with all state and  federal  securities  laws and were not issued in
violation  of or subject to any  preemptive  rights or other rights to subscribe
for or  purchase  securities.  No shares of  capital  stock of the  Company  are
subject to preemptive  rights or any other similar rights of the shareholders of
the Company or any liens or encumbrances  imposed through the actions or failure
to act of the Company.  Except as disclosed in the Company's  publicly available
filings with the Commission filed before the date of this Agreement (the "PUBLIC
FILINGS") and except for the transactions  contemplated hereby, (i) there are no
outstanding  options,  warrants,  scrip,  rights to subscribe for, puts,  calls,
rights of first refusal, agreements, understandings, claims or other commitments
or rights of any  character  whatsoever  that could require the Company to issue
additional shares of capital stock of the Company;  (ii) there are no agreements
or arrangements  (other than the Registration  Rights Agreement) under which the
Company is or will be obligated  to register  the sale of any of its  securities
under the Securities Act; (iii) there are no  anti-dilution  or price adjustment
provisions  contained in any security issued by the Company (or in any agreement
providing rights to security  holders) that will be triggered by the issuance of
the Shares,  the Options and, upon exercise,  the Option Shares;  and (iv) there
are no shareholders  agreements,  voting agreements or other similar  agreements
with respect to the Common Stock.  The Company has  furnished to the  Purchasers
true and correct copies of the Certificate of  Incorporation as in effect on the
date  hereof,  the  Bylaws as in effect on the date  hereof and the terms of all
securities  (other than employee stock options)  convertible into or exercisable
for Common Stock of the Company and the material  rights of the holders  thereof
in respect  thereto.  The  description of the Company's  stock,  stock bonus and
other stock plans or  arrangements  and the options or other rights  granted and
exercised  thereunder,  set forth in the Public  Filings  accurately  and fairly
presents in all  material  respects  the  information  required to be shown with
respect to such plans,  arrangements,  options and rights.  With respect to each
Subsidiary,  (i) all the  issued  and  outstanding  shares of each  Subsidiary's
capital stock have been duly authorized and validly  issued,  are fully paid and
nonassessable,  have been issued in compliance with applicable federal and state
securities  laws,  were not issued in violation of or subject to any  preemptive
rights or other rights to subscribe for or purchase  securities,  and (ii) there
are no outstanding options to purchase, or any preemptive rights or other rights
to subscribe for or to

                                       2

purchase,  any securities or obligations  convertible  into, or any contracts or
commitments to issue or sell,  shares of the  Subsidiary's  capital stock or any
such options,  rights,  convertible securities or obligations.  All Subsidiaries
included on SCHEDULE  2.01(A) are one hundred percent (100%) owned,  directly or
indirectly, by the Company.

         2.03. ISSUANCE, SALE AND DELIVERY OF THE SHARES AND THE OPTIONS.

         (a)   The Shares have been duly authorized  and, when issued, delivered
and paid for in the manner set forth in this Agreement, will be duly authorized,
validly issued,  fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of all pledges,
liens, restrictions,  claims and encumbrances,  and will conform in all material
respects  to the  description  thereof  set  forth  in the  Public  Filings.  No
preemptive  rights or other  rights to  subscribe  for or  purchase  exist  with
respect to the issuance  and sale of the Shares by the Company  pursuant to this
Agreement. The Board of Directors has approved the issuance from the treasury of
the Shares pursuant to the terms hereof. No further  corporate  authorization or
approval  (including  the approval of the  Company's  shareholders)  is required

contemplated by this Agreement and the Related  Agreements,  including,  without
limitation,  the issuance of the Shares and the inclusion  thereof of the Shares

Options,  free  and  clear  of all  pledges,  liens,  restrictions,  claims  and
encumbrances. The Option Shares are duly authorized and reserved for issuance in
the Company's treasury.  Upon exercise of the Options, in whole or, from time to
time, in part,  and upon payment of the exercise price  therefor,  in accordance
with the terms of the Options,  each  Purchaser will acquire good and marketable
title  to  the  Option  Shares,   free  and  clear  from  all  pledges,   liens,
restrictions,  claims and  encumbrances,  will not be subject to any  preemptive
rights  or other  similar  rights  of  shareholders  of the  Company  and,  upon
issuance,   the  Option   Shares  will  be  validly   issued,   fully  paid  and
non-assessable  and will conform in all material  respects to the description of
the Common Stock set forth in the Public  Filings.  The Board of  Directors  has
approved the issuance of the Options and the Option Shares pursuant to the terms
hereof. No further corporate  authorization or approval  (including the approval
of the Company's shareholders) is required under the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Related Agreements,  including,  without limitation, the issuance of the Options
and the inclusion thereof of the Option Shares for trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.

         2.04.  DUE EXECUTION, DELIVERY AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS  AGREEMENT.  The
Company has full legal right,  corporate  power and authority to enter into this
Agreement,  each Related  Agreement  and perform the  transactions  contemplated
hereby and thereby.  This  Agreement  and each Related  Agreement  has been duly
authorized,  executed and delivered by the Company. The execution,  delivery and
performance of this Agreement and each Related  Agreement by the Company and the
consummation  of the  transactions  herein  contemplated  will not  violate  any
provision  of  the  organizational  documents  of  the  Company  or  any  of its
Subsidiaries and will not result in the creation of any lien,  charge,  security
interest  or  encumbrance  upon  any  assets  of  the  Company  or  any  of  its
Subsidiaries  pursuant to the terms or provisions  of, and will not (i) conflict
with,  result in the breach or violation of, or constitute,  either by itself or
upon notice or

                                       3
<PAGE>

the  passage  of time or  both,  a  default  under  (A)  any  agreement,  lease,
franchise,  license,  permit or other  instrument to which the Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries
or any of their respective  properties may be bound or affected and in each case
which could have a Material Adverse Effect,  or (B) any statute or any judgment,
decree,  order,  rule  or  regulation  of  any  court  or any  regulatory  body,
administrative  agency or other  governmental  body applicable to the Company or
any of  its  Subsidiaries  or any of  their  respective  properties  where  such
conflict, breach, violation or default is likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.  No  consent,  approval,  authorization  or other  order  of any  court,
regulatory body,  administrative  agency or other  governmental body is required
for the execution and delivery of this Agreement,  each Related Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Related
Agreement,  except for compliance with the federal securities laws applicable to
the sale of the Units.  Upon the  execution  and delivery of this  Agreement and
each  Related  Agreement,  and  assuming  the valid  execution  thereof  by each
Purchaser,  if  applicable,  this  Agreement  and each  Related  Agreement  will
constitute  valid  and  binding  obligations  of  the  Company,  enforceable  in
accordance with their respective terms,  except as enforceability may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting  creditors' and contracting  parties'  rights  generally and except as
enforceability  may be subject to general  principles of equity  (regardless  of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

         2.05. NO DEFAULTS. Except as disclosed in the Public Filings and except
as to defaults,  violations and breaches which  individually or in the aggregate
could not have a Material  Adverse  Effect,  neither  the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries  is in violation or default of any provision of its  certificate of
incorporation or bylaws, or, to the Company's Knowledge, in breach of or default
with respect to any provision of any agreement,  judgment, decree, order, lease,
franchise,  license,  permit  or other  instrument  to which it is a party or by
which it or any of its  properties are bound;  and, to the Company's  Knowledge,
there does not exist any state of fact  which,  with  notice or lapse of time or
both,  would constitute an event of default on the part of the Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries  as defined in such  documents,  except such  defaults  which,
individually or in the aggregate, could not have a Material Adverse Effect.

         2.06. NO ACTIONS.  Except as disclosed in the Public Filings, there are
no legal or governmental actions,  suits or proceedings pending or threatened in
writing to which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries is or may be a party or
of which property owned or leased by the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  is
or may be the subject,  or related to environmental or  discrimination  matters,
which actions,  suits or proceedings,  individually  or in the aggregate,  might
prevent the Company's  execution,  delivery and  performance  of this  Agreement
and/or each Related Agreement.

         2.07. NO MATERIAL  CHANGE.  Except as disclosed in the Public  Filings,
since September 30, 2002 the Company and the  Subsidiaries  have conducted their
businesses  only in the  ordinary  course and in a manner  consistent  with past
practice, and there has not occurred any event, condition,  circumstance, change
or  development  (whether  or not in the  ordinary  course  of  business)  that,
individually  or in the  aggregate,  has had or could  reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.


                                       4
<PAGE>

         2.08.  COMPLIANCE.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
been  advised that it is not  conducting  its  business in  compliance  with all
applicable  laws,  rules and  regulations  of the  jurisdictions  in which it is
conducting its business,  except where failure to be so in compliance  could not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         2.09.  TAXES. To the Company's  Knowledge,  each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries  has filed all  necessary  federal,  state and  foreign  income and
franchise  tax returns  and has paid or accrued all taxes shown as due  thereon,
and neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries has been advised in writing
of any tax  deficiency  which has been asserted or  threatened  against it which
could have a Material Adverse Effect.

         2.10.  TRANSFER TAXES. On the Closing Date, all stock transfer or other
taxes (other than income taxes) which are required to be paid in connection with
the sale and transfer of the Units to be sold to each  Purchaser  hereunder will
be, or will have been,  fully paid or  provided  for by the Company and all laws
imposing such taxes will be or will have been complied with.

         2.11. INVESTMENT COMPANY.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is an
"investment  company" or an "affiliated  person" of, or "promoter" or "principal
underwriter"  for an investment  company,  within the meaning of the  Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

         2.12.  COMPLIANCE  WITH  SECURITIES  LAWS.  Neither the Company nor any
Person acting on behalf of the Company has conducted any "general solicitation,"
as described in Rule 502(c) under Regulation D promulgated  under the Securities
Act  ("REGULATION  D"), with respect to any of the Units being  offered  hereby.
Neither the Company,  nor any of its Affiliates,  nor any Person acting on their
behalf,  has directly or indirectly  made any offers or sales of any security or
solicited any offers to buy any security under  circumstances that would prevent
the parties  hereto  from  consummating  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby
pursuant to an exemption from registration  under the Securities Act pursuant to
the provisions of Regulation D. The transactions  contemplated by this Agreement
and the Options are exempt from the registration  requirements of the Securities
Act, assuming the accuracy of the  representations and warranties herein of each
Purchaser  to the extent  relevant for such  determination.  The issuance of the
Units to each  Purchaser  will not be integrated  with any other issuance of the
Company's  securities  (past,  current or  future)  which  requires  shareholder
approval under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or which would result in
a violation of the Securities Act.

         2.13. PUBLIC FILINGS; UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Since December 31, 2001,
the  Company  has  filed  all  required  reports,   schedules,   forms,   proxy,
registration and other statements and other documents with the Commission. As of
the date of this  Agreement,  the last Public  Filing filed by the Company was a
Report on Form 8-K,  dated  November 14,  2002.  As of their  respective  filing
dates,  the  Public  Filings   complied  in  all  material   respects  with  the
requirements  of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder applicable to
the Public  Filings.  As of their  respective  filing dates,  none of the Public
Filings  contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make the
statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under which they were made,
not  misleading,  except to the extent  such  statements  have been  modified or
superseded  by a later Public Filing filed and publicly  available  prior to the
Closing Date, the circumstances or bases for which


                                       5
<PAGE>

modifications  or  supersessions  have not and will not  individually  or in the
aggregate  result  in any  material  liability  or  obligation  on behalf of the
Company under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the rules  promulgated under
the  Securities  Act  or the  Exchange  Act,  or any  federal,  state  or  local
anti-fraud,  blue-sky,  securities  or similar  laws.  The Company does not have
pending  before  the  Commission  any  request  for  confidential  treatment  of
information  and to the Company's  Knowledge no such request is  contemplated by
the Company prior to the time the  Registration  Statement which is contemplated
by  the  Registration  Rights  Agreement  is  first  ordered  effective  by  the
Commission  and there is not pending nor, to the Company's  Knowledge,  is there
contemplated,  nor has there been any, investigation by the Commission involving
the Company or any current or former  director  or officer of the  Company.  The
Company and its  Subsidiaries  are unaware of any facts or  circumstances  which
might give rise to any of the foregoing.  The consolidated  financial statements
of the Company included in the Public Filings (as amended or supplemented by any
later filed Public  Filings filed and publicly  available  prior to December 31,
2002),  comply as to form in all material  respects with  applicable  accounting
requirements  and the rules  and  regulations  of the  Commission  with  respect
thereto,  have been  prepared in accordance  with GAAP  (except,  in the case of
unaudited statements,  as permitted by Form 10-Q of the Commission) applied on a
consistent  basis  during the periods  involved  (except as may be  indicated in
notes thereto) and fairly  present the  consolidated  financial  position of the
Company  and the  Subsidiaries  as of the  dates  thereof  and the  consolidated
results of their  operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject,
in the case of unaudited  statements,  to normal  year-end  audit  adjustments).
Except  as set  forth  in the  Public  Filings,  neither  the  Company  nor  any
Subsidiary has any obligation or liability of any nature  whatsoever  (direct or
indirect,  matured or  unmatured,  absolute,  accrued,  contingent or otherwise)
either (i) required by GAAP to be set forth on a  consolidated  balance sheet of
the  Company  and the  Subsidiaries  or in the  notes  thereto  or  (ii)  which,
individually  or in the  aggregate,  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  have a
Material  Adverse Effect,  other than  liabilities and obligations  reflected or
reserved against in the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
consolidated  subsidiaries  included in the Company's  quarterly  report on Form
10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2002, or incurred since the date of the
balance sheet  included in such financial  statements in the ordinary  course of
business which are not individually or collectively  material to the Company and
the Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

         2.14. REPORTING COMPANY; FORM S-3; NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE. The Company
is subject to the reporting  requirements  of the Exchange Act, has one class of
securities  registered  under  Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and has filed all
reports  required  thereby.  The Company is eligible to register  the Shares for
resale  by each  Purchaser  on a  registration  statement  on Form S-3 under the
Securities  Act.  There  exist  no facts or  circumstances  (including,  without
limitation,  any  required  approvals or waivers or any  circumstances  that may
delay or prevent the obtaining of accountant's  consents) that reasonably  could
be expected to prohibit or delay the preparation and filing of the  Registration
Statement.  No  shareholder  of the  Company  has any right  (which has not been
waived or has not expired by reason of lapse of time following  notification  of
the Company's intent to file the Registration  Statement) to require the Company
to  register  the  sale of any  shares  owned  by  such  shareholder  under  the
Securities Act in the Registration  Statement.  The Common Stock, the Shares and
the Option Shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Company has
taken no action  designed to, or likely to have the effect of,  terminating  the
registration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act or de-listing the Common
Stock, the Shares and the Option Shares from the New York Stock


                                       6
<PAGE>

Exchange,  nor has the Company received any notification  that the Commission or
the New York Stock Exchange is contemplating  terminating  such  registration or
listing.

         2.15.  GOVERNMENTAL PERMITS, ETC.  To the Company's Knowledge,  each of
the  Company  and its  Subsidiaries  has  all  necessary  franchises,  licenses,
certificates and other authorizations from any foreign,  federal, state or local
government  or  governmental  agency,  department  or body  that  are  currently
necessary for the operation of the business of the Company and its  Subsidiaries
as  currently  conducted,  except  where the failure to possess  currently  such
franchises, licenses, certificates and other authorizations could not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,  and the Company and Subsidiaries
have not  received  any notice of  proceedings  relating  to the  revocation  or
modification of any such permit or any circumstance which would lead the Company
to believe that such proceedings are reasonably likely which, individually or in
the  aggregate,  if the subject of an unfavorable  decision,  ruling or finding,
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         2.16.   BROKERS.   No broker, finder, investment banker or other Person
is entitled to receive any  brokerage,  finder's or other fee or  commission  in
connection with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and the Related
Agreements based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company.

         2.17. REGULATORY FILINGS.  Except as set forth in the Public Filings or
that could not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have
a  Material  Adverse  Effect,  the  Company  and each  Subsidiary  has  filed or
otherwise  provided  all  reports,  data,  other  information  and  applications
required  to  be  filed  with  or  otherwise  provided  to  the  office  of  the
Superintendent  of the New  York  State  Insurance  Department,  and  all  other
federal,  state or local  governmental  authorities with  jurisdiction  over the
Company and each  Subsidiary  and all required  regulatory  approvals in respect
thereof  are in full force and effect on the date  hereof.  All such  regulatory
filings were in compliance  with  applicable law when filed and no  deficiencies
have been  asserted  by such  governmental  authority  with  respect to any such
regulatory filings that have not been satisfied.

         2.18.  A.M. BEST RATING.  Each Insurance  Subsidiary is currently rated
A-Excellent by A.M. Best Company, Inc. ("A.M. BEST") and neither the Company nor
any Insurance Subsidiary has received any communication from A.M. Best that A.M.
Best intends to lower or remove such rating.

         2.19. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS.  Since September 30, 2002,

         (a)   All material Contracts to which  the Company or any Subsidiary is
a party or by which the  Company or any  Subsidiary  or any of their  respective
assets  may be bound  have been  filed  with the  Commission  (and are  publicly
available),  are described in the Public  Filings or have been made available to
the Purchasers and, in each case, are in full force and effect.

         (b)   There  has  not  been (i)  any  change  by  the  Company  in  its
accounting methods, principles or practices, (ii) any revaluation by the Company
of any of its or any Subsidiary's material assets that could, individually or in
the aggregate,  result in a Material Adverse Effect, (iii) any entry outside the
ordinary course of business by the Company or any


                                       7
<PAGE>

Subsidiary into any commitments or transactions material, individually or in the
aggregate,  to the  Company  and the  Subsidiaries  taken as a  whole,  (iv) any
declaration,  setting  aside or payment of any  dividends  or  distributions  in
respect  of the  shares of Common  Stock or any  redemption,  purchase  or other
acquisition of any of the Company's securities, (v) any grant or issuance of any
Equity  Securities  of the Company or any  Subsidiary  or (vi) any  increase in,
establishment  of or  amendment  of  any  Employment,  Consulting  or  Severance
Agreement, bonus, insurance, deferred compensation,  pension, retirement, profit
sharing,  stock option  (including,  without  limitation,  the granting of stock
options,  stock  appreciation  rights,  performance  awards, or restricted stock
awards),  stock  purchase  or  other  employee  benefit  plan  or  agreement  or
arrangement,  or any other  increase  in the  compensation  payable or to become
payable to any present or former directors, officers or employees of the Company
or any  Subsidiary,  except in the ordinary  course of business  consistent with
past practice.

         (c)   No transaction  has occurred between or among the Company, any of
the  Subsidiaries,  officers or directors or any of their respective  affiliates
that will be required to be described under applicable securities laws in future
Public Filings and that have not otherwise been disclosed to the Purchasers.

3.       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASERS

         Each of the Purchasers,  severally,  but not jointly, hereby represents
and warrants to the Company, as of the Closing Date, as follows:

         3.01.  ORGANIZATION  AND  STANDING  OF  THE  PURCHASERS.  Each  of  the
Purchasers  that is not an individual (an "ENTITY  PURCHASER") is a corporation,
partnership or limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization.

         3.02.  AUTHORITY; ENFORCEABILITY. Each of the Entity Purchasers has all
requisite  corporate,   partnership  or  limited  liability  company  power  and
authority to enter into this Agreement and each Related Agreement to which it is
a  party  and to  carry  out  its  obligations  hereunder  and  thereunder.  The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each Related Agreement
to which it is a party  by each of the  Entity  Purchasers  have  been  duly and
validly authorized by all requisite corporate,  partnership or limited liability
company proceedings,  as the case may be, on the part of each of the Purchasers.
This  Agreement and each Related  Agreement to which it is a party when executed
and  delivered by each of the  Purchasers  is a valid and binding  obligation of
such Purchaser, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except that
(a) such enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,
moratorium, rehabilitation, liquidation, conservatorship,  receivership or other
similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors'  rights generally
and (b) the remedy of specific  performance  and  injunctive  and other forms of
equitable  relief may be subject to equitable  defenses and to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

         3.03.  ACQUISITION  FOR  INVESTMENT.  Each  of  the  Purchasers  is  an
"accredited  investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of  Regulation  D.
Each of the Purchasers is acquiring the Units solely for its own account for the
purpose of investment and not with a view to or for sale


                                       8
<PAGE>

in connection with any distribution  thereof, and it has no present intention or
plan to effect any  distribution  of the Units,  the Shares,  the Options or the
Option Shares. Each of the Purchasers  represents that it has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business  matters as to be capable of evaluating the
merits and risks of its  investment in the Units and that it is able to bear the
economic risk  associated  with such investment and can afford the complete loss
of such  investment.  The Purchasers  acknowledge that the offer and sale of the
Shares,  the Options and the Option  Shares have not been  registered  under the
Securities Act.

4.       CONDITIONS AT CLOSING

         4.01. PURCHASERS' OBLIGATION. The obligation of each Purchaser to close

5.       COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY AND OTHER AGREEMENTS

         5.01.  FORM D; BLUE SKY LAWS;  FORM 8-K. The Company will file a Notice
of Sale of  Securities  on Form D with respect to the Units,  if required  under
Regulation  D, and to provide a copy thereof to each  Purchaser  promptly  after
such filing. The Company will take such action as it reasonably determines to be
necessary to qualify the Shares,  the Options and the Option  Shares for sale to
the Purchasers under this Agreement under applicable  securities (or "blue sky")
laws of the states of the United  States  (or to obtain an  exemption  from such
qualification),  and will  provide  evidence  of any such action so taken to the
Purchasers  on or prior to the date of the  Closing.  The Company will file with
the Commission a Current  Report on Form 8-K  disclosing  this Agreement and the
transactions  contemplated  hereby  within  three (3)  business  days  after the
Closing Date.

         5.02.  REPORTING  STATUS;  ELIGIBILITY TO USE FORM S-3.  Throughout the
Registration  Period (as  defined in the  Registration  Rights  Agreement),  the
Company will timely file all reports,  schedules,  forms,  statements  and other
documents  required to be filed by it with the  Commission  under the  reporting
requirements  of the Exchange Act, and the Company will not terminate its status
as an  issuer  required  to file  reports  under  the  Exchange  Act even if the
Exchange  Act  or  the  rules  and  regulations  thereunder  would  permit  such
termination.  The Company  will use its  reasonable  best efforts to continue to
meet, the "registrant  eligibility"  requirements  for a secondary  offering set
forth in the general  instructions to Form S-3 to enable the registration of the
Registrable   Securities  as  defined  in  the  Registration  Rights  Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) in the case of any consolidation or merger of
the Company with or into any other corporation or Person, or any other corporate
reorganization,  in which the Company  shall not be the  continuing or surviving
entity of such  consolidation,  merger or reorganization,  or any sale of all or
substantially  all of the  assets of the  Company  (any such  transaction  being
hereinafter  referred to as a  "REORGANIZATION"),  in which,  in each case,  the
consideration  to be paid to the Purchasers  upon the  consummation or effective
date of such  Reorganization  (the "EFFECTIVE  DATE") is all cash for all of the
securities of the Company  beneficially  owned by all of the Purchasers then, in
each case, upon the Effective Date the obligations under this Section 5.02 shall
terminate,  (b) in the case of any  Reorganization in which the consideration to
be paid to all of the  Purchasers  upon the  Effective  Date is  securities of a
Person  other  than  the  Company  for  all of  the  securities  of the  Company
beneficially owned by all of such Purchasers and such securities are listed on a
national  securities  exchange  or the  NASDAQ  National  Market,  then upon the
Effective  Date the  obligations  under this Section  5.02 shall NOT  terminate;
PROVIDED  that the  obligations  under this  Section 5.02 shall  terminate  with
respect  to  securities  of  the  Company  if  all  of  such  Purchasers  do not
beneficially   own  any   securities   of  the  Company  as  a  result  of  such
Reorganization  or (c) in the case of any proposed  Reorganization  in which the
consideration  to be paid to all of the  Purchasers  upon the Effective  Date is
securities  of a Person for all of the  securities  of the Company  beneficially
owned by such  Purchasers  and such  securities  are NOT  listed  on a  national
securities exchange or the NASDAQ National Market, then the Company shall obtain
the  PRIOR  written   consent  of  the   Purchasers  who   beneficially   own  a
majority-in-interest of the Units (determined on an as-exercised basis) prior to
effecting such Reorganization.

         5.03.  LISTING.   The Company will use its best  efforts to obtain and,
so long as any Purchaser  beneficially  owns any of the Shares,  the Options and
the  Option  Shares and the shares


                                       10
<PAGE>

of Common Stock,  options and the shares of Common Stock  underlying  options to
purchase Common Stock purchased from the  Shareholder,  maintain the listing and
trading of its Common Stock  (including the Shares and the Option Shares) on the
New York Stock  Exchange  and will  comply in all  respects  with the  Company's
reporting,  filing  and other  obligations  under the bylaws or rules of the New
York  Stock  Exchange.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  (a) in the case of any
Reorganization  in which the consideration to be paid to the Purchasers upon the
Effective Date is all cash for all of the securities of the Company beneficially
owned by all of the  Purchasers,  then upon the Effective  Date the  obligations
under this Section 5.03 shall terminate,  (b) in the case of any  Reorganization
in  which  the  consideration  to be  paid  to all of the  Purchasers  upon  the
Effective  Date is  securities of a Person other than the Company for all of the
securities of the Company  beneficially owned by all of such Purchasers and such
securities are listed on a national  securities  exchange or the NASDAQ National
Market,  then upon the Effective  Date the  obligations  under this Section 5.03
shall NOT  terminate;  PROVIDED that the  obligations  to list and maintain such
listing of securities of the Company shall  terminate if all of such  Purchasers
do not  beneficially  own any  securities  of the  Company  as a result  of such
Reorganization  or (c) in the case of any proposed  Reorganization  in which the
consideration  to be paid to all of the  Purchasers  upon the Effective  Date is
securities  of a Person for all of the  securities  of the Company  beneficially
owned by all of such Purchasers and such securities are NOT listed on a national
securities exchange or the NASDAQ National Market, then the Company shall obtain
the  PRIOR  written   consent  of  the   Purchasers  who   beneficially   own  a
majority-in-interest of the Units (determined on an as-exercised basis) prior to
effecting such Reorganization. Until a Purchaser transfers, assigns or sells all
of the Shares, the Options and the Option Shares and the shares of Common Stock,
options and the shares of Common  Stock  underlying  options to purchase  Common
Stock purchased from the Shareholder  beneficially owned by it, the Company will
promptly provide to each Purchaser  copies of any notices it receives  regarding
the continued eligibility of the Shares and the Option Shares for listing on the
New York Stock Exchange.

         5.04. NO INTEGRATION.  The Company will not make any offers or sales of
any security  under  circumstances  that would cause the offering of the Shares,
the Options and the Option  Shares to be integrated  with any other  offering of
securities  by the  Company  (i) for the  purpose  of any  shareholder  approval
provision  applicable  to the Company or its  securities or (ii) for purposes of
any registration requirement under the Securities Act.

         5.05.  THE OPTION  SHARES.  The Company has authorized and has reserved
and  covenants  to  continue  to reserve,  free of  preemptive  rights and other
similar  contractual  rights of shareholders,  a sufficient number of authorized
shares of Common  Stock held in its  treasury  to satisfy  the  exercise  of the
Options.

         5.06. USE OF PROCEEDS. The Company shall use the net cash proceeds from
the issuance and sale of the Units for general corporate purposes.

         5.07.  DEALINGS WITH  AFFILIATES.  Except for  transactions  between or
among the Company and any of the Subsidiaries,  the Company will not enter into,
or permit any Subsidiary to enter into, any transaction(s)  (including,  without
limitation, any loans or extensions of credit, release of guarantee,  management
contract or royalty agreements,  deferred or contingent  compensation agreement,
consulting or other  agreement) with any Affiliate,  except  transactions in the
ordinary


                                       11
<PAGE>

course of business and at prices and on terms not less  favorable to the Company
or such Subsidiary than could be obtained on an arms-length basis from unrelated
third parties or otherwise approved by the disinterested and independent members
of the Board of Directors.

         5.08.  APPOINTMENT  TO BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  So long as Conning  Capital
Partners VI, L.P.  ("CONNING") and its affiliates  beneficially own an aggregate
of 50% of the Shares and the Option Shares purchased hereunder and the shares of
Common Stock and the shares of Common Stock  underlying  the options to purchase
Common Stock purchased from the Shareholder pursuant to the Shareholder Purchase
Agreement,  the  Company  hereby  agrees to take all action  within its power to
cause one (1)  individual  designated by Conning (the "CONNING  DESIGNEE") to be
nominated,  appointed and elected to the Board of Directors and appointed to the
following  committees of the Board of Directors:  (i)  Underwriting,  (ii) Human
Resources and (iii) Audit.

         5.09.  OBSERVATION  RIGHT.  So long as Conning is entitled to designate
the Conning  Designee,  the Purchasers shall have the right to designate one (1)
individual  (the  "OBSERVER")  to attend any meeting of the Board of  Directors;
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  at the  reasonable  request of the Chairman of the Board of
Directors,  Conning  shall  remove the  individual  serving as the  Observer and
designate another individual to be the Observer. The Observer shall not have the
right to vote on any matter presented to the Board of Directors but the Observer
may  participate  in  discussions  thereon.  The  Observer  shall be entitled to
receive all written  materials and other  information  given to the directors in
connection  with such meetings at the same time such  materials and  information
are given to the directors  and the  Observers  shall execute and deliver to the
Company a  confidentiality  agreement in the form and substance  satisfactory to
the Company.

         5.10. [INTENTIONALLY DELETED].

         5.11.  ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES.  The Purchasers  acknowledge that each
certificate  representing the Shares, the Options and the Option Shares shall be
stamped or otherwise  imprinted  with a legend  substantially  in the  following
form:

                  "THE OFFER AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED
                  BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
                  UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,
                  AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN
                  COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION
                  REQUIREMENTS THEREOF OR PURSUANT TO AN
                  EXEMPTION THEREFROM."

The  Company  will  not give to its  transfer  agent of the  Common  Stock  (the
"TRANSFER  AGENT")  any  instruction  with  respect to the Shares and the Option
Shares other than as described in this Section 5.

         5.12.  UNRESTRICTED  SECURITIES.  If (i) the Shares, the Options or the
Option  Shares  represented  by a  certificate  have  been sold  pursuant  to an
effective  registration  statement filed under the Securities Act, (ii) a holder
of the Shares,  the Options or the Option  Shares  provides  the Company and the
Transfer   Agent,  as  applicable,   with  an  opinion  of  counsel   reasonably



                                       12
<PAGE>

satisfactory  to the Company to the effect that a public sale or transfer of any
of such securities may be made without registration under the Securities Act and
such sale either has occurred or may occur without  restriction on the timing or
manner of such sale or transfer  or (iii) the Shares,  the Options or the Option
Shares  represented by a certificate  can be sold without  restriction as to the

Act,  the  Company  will permit the  transfer of the Shares,  the Options or the
Option  Shares,  as the case may be, and the Transfer  Agent or the Company,  as
applicable,  will  issue one or more  certificates,  free  from any  restrictive
legend, in such name and in such denominations as specified by such holder.

         5.13. SALE OF COMPANY SECURITIES.  So long as Conning has exercised its
rights  to  designate  the  Conning  Designee,  Conning  will  and  will use its
reasonable  best  efforts  to cause  its  affiliates  to abide by the  Company's
policies relating to sales and purchases of securities of the Company by members
of the Board of Directors and the executive officers of the Company.

without  limitation,  reasonable  attorneys'  fees,  charges and  disbursements)
incurred by such  Purchaser  as a result of any  inaccuracy  in or breach of the
representations,  warranties or covenants  made by the Company or any Subsidiary
herein or in any of the Related  Agreements.  Each  Purchaser  severally but not
jointly  agrees to indemnify  and save  harmless the Company and its  directors,
officers,  Affiliates,  successors  and  assigns  from and  against  any and all
losses,  liabilities,  deficiencies,  costs,  damages and  expenses  (including,
without  limitation,  reasonable  attorneys'  fees,  charges and  disbursements)
incurred  by the  Company  as a result  of any  inaccuracy  in or  breach of the
representations, warranties or covenants made by such Purchaser herein; PROVIDED
that, with respect to each indemnifying  party, the amount of indemnity provided
to the indemnified party shall be limited to $10,500,000.

         7.02.  INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE. Any party entitled to indemnification
under this Section 7 (an  "INDEMNIFIED  PARTY") will give written  notice to the
indemnifying  party of any claim with respect to which it seeks  indemnification
promptly after the discovery by such party of any matters giving rise to a claim
for  indemnification;  PROVIDED  that  the  failure  of any  party


                                       16
<PAGE>

entitled to  indemnification  hereunder to give notice as provided  herein shall
not relieve  the  indemnifying  party of its  obligations  under this  Section 7
except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually  prejudiced by such
failure  to give  notice.  In case any  action,  proceeding  or claim is brought
against  an  indemnified  party in respect  of which  indemnification  is sought
hereunder,  the  indemnifying  party shall be entitled  to  participate  in and,
unless  in the  reasonable  judgment  of the  indemnified  party a  conflict  of
interest  between  it and the  indemnifying  party may exist in  respect of such
action,  proceeding  or claim,  to assume  the  defense  thereof,  with  counsel
reasonably  satisfactory  to the  indemnified  party.  In  the  event  that  the
indemnifying  party  advises an  indemnified  party that it will  contest such a
claim for  indemnification  hereunder,  or  fails,  within  thirty  (30) days of
receipt of any indemnification  notice to notify, in writing,  such party of its
election to defend,  settle or  compromise,  at its sole cost and  expense,  any
action,  proceeding or claim (or  discontinues  its defense at any time after it
commences such defense),  then the indemnified party may, at its option, defend,
settle or otherwise compromise or pay such action or claim. In any event, unless
and until the indemnifying  party elects in writing to assume and does so assume
the defense of any such claim,  proceeding or action,  the  indemnified  party's
costs and expenses  arising out of the defense,  settlement or compromise of any
such action,  claim or  proceeding  shall be losses  subject to  indemnification
hereunder.  The indemnified  party shall  cooperate fully with the  indemnifying
party in connection  with any negotiation or defense of any such action or claim
by the  indemnifying  party  and shall  furnish  to the  indemnifying  party all
information  reasonably available to the indemnified party which relates to such
action or claim. The indemnifying  party shall keep the indemnified  party fully
apprised  at  all  times  as to the  status  of the  defense  or any  settlement
negotiations  with respect thereto.  If the indemnifying  party elects to defend
any such  action or claim,  then the  indemnified  party  shall be  entitled  to
participate  in such  defense  with  counsel  of its choice at its sole cost and
expense.  The  indemnifying  party shall not be liable for any settlement of any
action, claim or proceeding effected without its written consent;  PROVIDED that
the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably  withhold,  delay or condition its
consent.  Anything  in  this  Section  7 to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  the
indemnifying  party shall not,  without the  indemnified  party's  prior written
consent,  settle or compromise  any claim or consent to entry of any judgment in
respect thereof which imposes any future  obligation on the indemnified party or
which does not include,  as an  unconditional  term  thereof,  the giving by the
claimant or the plaintiff to the indemnified party, a release from all liability
in respect of such claim. The indemnity  agreements contained herein shall be in
addition to (a) any cause of action or similar  right of the  indemnified  party
against  the  indemnifying   party  or  others,  and  (b)  any  liabilities  the
indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law.
