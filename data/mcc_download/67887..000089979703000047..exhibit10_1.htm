Purpose, Definitions, Administration, Amendment</p>
</u></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Moog Inc. Supplemental Retirement Plan is an unfunded
plan, not intended to qualify under the Internal Revenue Code, maintained for
the purpose of providing additional retirement benefits for a select group of
management or highly compensated employees of Moog Inc., and participation in
the Moog Inc. Supplemental Retirement Plan is limited consistent with such
purpose. Benefits under the Moog Inc. Supplemental Retirement Plan are intended
to supplement benefits provided under the Moog Inc. Employees' Retirement Plan
and benefits received from Social Security.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following words and phrases as used herein have the
following meanings:</p>

      <dir>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Cause&quot; means: any harmful act or omission that
        constitutes a willful and a continuing material failure by the Executive
        to perform the material and essential obligations under his Employment
        Termination Benefits Agreement (other than as a result of death or total
        or partial incapacity due to physical or mental illness); or the
        Executive's conviction of a felony, or any willful perpetration by the
        Executive of a common law fraud upon the Company; or any willful
        misconduct or bad faith omission by the Executive constituting
        dishonesty, fraud or immoral conduct, which is materially injurious to
        the financial condition or business reputation of the Company. Anything
        in this definition to the contrary notwithstanding, the termination of
        the Executive's employment by the Company is not considered to have been
        for Cause if the termination resulted from: bad judgment or mere
        negligence on the part of the Executive; or an act or omission by the
        Executive without intending to gain, directly or indirectly, a
        substantial personal profit to which the Executive was not legally
        entitled; or an act or omission by the Executive that the Executive

        transfer shall be deemed to occur if shares of Common Stock are either
        transferred or made the subject of options, warrants, or similar rights
        granting a third party the opportunity to acquire ownership or voting

        parties to Employment Termination Benefits Agreements will be considered
        as having been consented to for purposes of this Plan.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Plan shall be operated under the direction of the
Compensation Committee, which shall have all authority and powers necessary to
administer the Plan and construe the Plan terms, make factual determinations,
resolve any ambiguities or inconsistencies, determine eligibility for
participation or benefits, and decide all questions arising in the Plan
administration, interpretation or application; provided, however, that all such

Plan shall continue and benefits shall continue to accrue under the Plan, based
on the terms of the Plan as of the date preceding such action, for all
individuals who are Participants or Spouses on such date.</p>

Participant's eligibility for early or normal Retirement benefits under this
Plan. Supplemental Benefits shall be payable to a Spouse who receives

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eligibility for the benefits of this Plan is limited to
Executives of the Company and does not extend to officers or executives of any
affiliate or subsidiary.</p>

determined according to the following schedule:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Early payment of Supplemental Benefits under this Plan shall
be made to an Executive who elects earlier Retirement under the Moog Inc.
Employees' Retirement Plan; provided, however, that no early payment shall be
made unless the Executive's Retirement is at age 60 or later with a combined
total of age and Years of Service with the Company at least equal to 90;
provided, further, that the Supplemental Benefits payable under this Plan shall
be reduced by the early payment actuarial discount established under the Moog
Inc. Employees' Retirement Plan for the commencement of benefits before age 65.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Supplemental Benefits shall be payable to an
Executive who receives benefits under the Moog Inc. Employees' Retirement Plan
because of Disability, without regard to such Participant's eligibility for
early or normal Retirement benefits under this Plan.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event of commencement of Supplemental Benefits prior
to attainment of age&nbsp;62, the Supplemental Benefit payable under this Plan shall
include a Social Security &quot;bridge&quot; payment equal to the amount of the Social
Security benefit at age&nbsp;62, until such time as the Executive attains age&nbsp;62.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event of commencement of Supplemental Benefits between
age&nbsp;62 and age&nbsp;65, the Social Security benefit amount to be used in determining
the Supplemental Benefit payable under this Plan shall be the Social Security
benefit amount payable on the actual date of Retirement.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Spouse shall receive a payment of Supplemental Benefits
determined by applying the above benefit formula if, and to the extent that, the
Spouse receives pre-retirement surviving spouse benefits under the Moog Inc.
Employees' Retirement Plan because the Executive died before commencing benefit
payments under the Moog Inc. Employees' Retirement Plan; provided, however, that
if the Executive had not attained age 65 when he died, the Supplemental Benefits
shall be determined as if the Executive attained age 65 on the day before his
death.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supplemental Benefits under this Plan, to which a Spouse is
entitled pursuant to the preceding paragraph, shall be paid to a Spouse who
receives pre-retirement surviving spouse benefits from the Moog Inc. Employees'
Retirement Plan before the Participant would have attained age 65; provided,
however, that the Supplemental Benefits payable under this Plan shall be reduced
by the early payment actuarial discount established under the Moog Inc.
Employees' Retirement Plan for the commencement of benefits before age 65.</p>
<b><font FACE="(normal text)">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE IV.</font><u><br>
Time and Form of Benefit Payment</p>
</u></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any benefit under this Plan shall be paid to the Participant,
or his Spouse, at the same time and in the same form and manner as benefit
payments are made to, or on behalf of, the Participant or Spouse under the Moog
Inc. Employees' Retirement Plan, except as otherwise provided in Article III.</p>
<b><font FACE="(normal text)">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE V.</font><u><br>
Funding</p>
</u></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Plan shall be maintained as an unfunded Plan which is
not intended to meet the qualification requirements of Section&nbsp;401 of the Code.
All benefits under this Plan shall be payable solely from the general assets of
the Company and a Participant or Spouse shall have only the rights of a general
unsecured creditor of the Company. No benefits under this Plan shall be payable
from the trust fund maintained under or in accordance with the provisions of the
Moog Inc. Employees' Retirement Plan. The Company, however, has established a
grantor trust, to which the Company makes contributions from time to time in
accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement.</p>
<b><font FACE="(normal text)">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE VI.</font><u><br>
Effective Date</p>
</u></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Effective Date of this Plan shall be October&nbsp;1, 1978. The
Effective Date of the amendment and restatement of this Plan shall be November
29, 2001, and the amended and restated terms of the Plan shall apply to only
Participants employed by the Company on or after the Effective Date of the
amendment and restatement.</p>
<b><font FACE="(normal text)">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE VII.</font><u><br>
Agreement Not to Compete</p>
</u></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Payment of benefits under this Plan is contingent upon the
Participant's agreement not to directly or indirectly engage in or compete with
the business of the Company, either as owner, partner or employee for a period
of the later to occur of the expiration of three years after Retirement or the
attainment of 65&nbsp;years of age. In the event a Participant shall compete with the
business of the Company, payment of benefits under this Plan shall be suspended
so long as such Participant engages in activity deemed to be in competition with
the business of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Article VII
shall not apply to a Participant after the Participant's Involuntary Termination
of Employment by virtue of a Change of Control.</p>
<b><font FACE="(normal text)">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE VIII.</font><u><br>
Benefits Upon Certain Terminations or Change of Control</p>
</u></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The provisions of this Article&nbsp;VIII shall apply only where
there has been an Involuntary Termination of Employment or a Change of Control.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon an Involuntary Termination of Employment, other than by
virtue of a Change of Control, a Participant who would be eligible to receive
benefits under this Plan if he was then age&nbsp;65 or more, shall be vested in his
benefits under this Plan upon such Involuntary Termination of Employment and,
upon attainment of age&nbsp;65, shall receive such benefits determined as follows:
the benefit payable at age&nbsp;65 shall be determined under Article&nbsp;III using the
Executive's Compensation paid prior to such Involuntary Termination of
Employment, instead of Compensation paid prior to Retirement, subject to further
adjustment by reducing the combined benefit target of Article&nbsp;III by one percent
for each year of the Participant's age under 65 at the time of such Involuntary
Termination of Employment. For example, a Participant age&nbsp;45 at the time of such
Involuntary Termination of Employment, with 15&nbsp;Years of Service to the Company,
upon attaining age&nbsp;65, would have a combined benefit target of 44&nbsp;percent
(55&nbsp;percent - (55&nbsp;percent&nbsp;x 20&nbsp;percent) &nbsp;=&nbsp; 44&nbsp;percent) instead of the
combined benefit target of 55&nbsp;percent that would be payable if the Participant
were then 65&nbsp;years of age with 15&nbsp;Years of Service.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon a Change of Control, a Participant who would be eligible
to receive benefits under this Plan if he was then age&nbsp;65 or more, shall be
vested in his benefits under this Plan upon such Change of Control and, upon
attainment of age&nbsp;65, shall receive such benefits determined as follows: the
benefit payable at age&nbsp;65 shall be determined under Article&nbsp;III using the
greater of the Compensation paid to the Executive prior to such Change of
Control or the Compensation paid to the Executive prior to Retirement.</p>
<b><font FACE="(normal text)">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE IX.</font><u><br>
Miscellaneous</p>
</u></b><u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Social Security</u>: Any increases in Social Security
benefits payable to a Participant after Retirement shall not be considered in
determining any benefits payable under this Plan.</p>

assigned or alienated, or be subjected by attachment or otherwise to the claims
of creditors of any Participant or Spouse.</p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nonguarantee of Employment</u>: This Plan shall not be
construed as giving any Participant the right to be retained in the employment
of the Company.</p>

respect to the payment of benefits under this Plan to a Spouse because
pre-retirement surviving spouse benefits are payable under the Moog Inc.
Employees' Retirement Plan) or Article IV (with respect to the payment of
benefits under this Plan to a Spouse because of the form and manner of benefit
payments elected by the Participant under the Moog Inc. Employees' Retirement
Plan), there shall be no death benefit payable under this Plan.</p>
