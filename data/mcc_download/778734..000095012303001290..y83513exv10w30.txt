                           LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT

      THIS LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT is made this day of January 31, 2003, by
and among FLEET CAPITAL CORPORATION ("LENDER"), a Rhode Island corporation with
an office at 5950 Sherry Lane, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75225; and MEASUREMENT
SPECIALTIES, INC. ("MSI"), a New Jersey corporation with its chief executive
office and principal place of business at 710 Route 46 East, Fairfield, New
Jersey 07004, IC SENSORS, INC. ("IC"), a California corporation with an address
in care of MSI at 710 Route 46 East, Fairfield, New Jersey 07004 (MSI and IC
being hereinafter referred to individually as a "BORROWER" and collectively as
the "BORROWERS"). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement have the meanings
assigned to them in Appendix A, General Definitions. Accounting terms not
otherwise specifically defined herein shall be construed in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied.

                                   SECTION 1
                                 CREDIT FACILITY

      Subject to the terms and conditions of, and in reliance upon the
representations and warranties made in, this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, Lender agrees to make a Total Credit Facility of up to $15,000,000
available upon Borrowers' request therefor, as follows:

      1.1   REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS.

            (a) LOANS AND RESERVES. Lender agrees, for so long as no Default or
Event of Default exists, to make Revolving Credit Loans to Borrowers from time
to time, as requested by Borrowers in the manner set forth in subsection 3.1(a)
hereof, up to a maximum principal amount at any time outstanding equal to the
Borrowing Base at such time. Lender shall have the right to establish reserves
in such amounts, and with respect to such matters, as Lender shall, in the
exercise of its reasonable credit judgment, deem necessary or appropriate,
against the amount of Revolving Credit Loans which Borrowers may otherwise
request under this subsection 1.1(a), including, without limitation, with
respect to (i) price adjustments, damages, unearned discounts, returned products
or other matters for which credit memoranda are issued in the ordinary course of
any Borrower's business; (ii) shrinkage, spoilage and obsolescence of Inventory;
(iii) slow moving Inventory; (iv) other sums chargeable against Borrowers' Loan
Account as Revolving Credit Loans under any section of this Agreement; (v)
amounts owing by any Borrower to any Person to the extent secured by a Lien on,
or trust over, any Property of such Borrower; and (vi) such other matters,
events, conditions or contingencies as to which Lender, in its sole credit
judgment, determines reserves should be established from time to time hereunder.
The Revolving Credit Loans shall be further evidenced by the Revolving Credit
Note and shall be secured by all of the Collateral. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Initial Availability Reserve will be established as a reserve
with respect to the Borrowing Base.

            (b) USE OF PROCEEDS. The Revolving Credit Loans shall be used solely
for (i) the satisfaction of a portion of the existing Indebtedness of Borrowers
to Castletop Capital, L.P., a Texas limited partnership as lender ("CASTLETOP"),
and (ii) any Borrower's general corporate


                                       1
<PAGE>
purposes in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement and all
applicable laws, including, capital expenditures permitted under the terms of
this Agreement.

                                   SECTION 2
                           INTEREST, FEES AND CHARGES

      2.1   INTEREST.

            (a) RATES OF INTEREST. Interest shall accrue on the principal amount
of the Revolving Credit Loans outstanding at the end of each day at a
fluctuating rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i) 1.0% plus the Base Rate or
(ii) the Maximum Rate. The rate of interest applicable to Revolving Credit Loans
shall increase or decrease by an amount equal to any increase or decrease in the
Base Rate, effective as of the opening of business on the day that any such
change in the Base Rate occurs.

            (b) DEFAULT RATE OF INTEREST. Upon and after the occurrence of an
Event of Default, and during the continuation thereof, the principal amount of
all Loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 2% above the interest
rate otherwise applicable thereto (the "DEFAULT RATE").

            (c) MAXIMUM INTEREST. In no event whatsoever shall the aggregate of
all amounts deemed interest hereunder or under the Revolving Credit Note and
charged or collected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or pursuant to the
Revolving Credit Note exceed the Maximum Rate, nor shall any provisions hereof
be construed as a contract to pay, for the use, forbearance or detention of
money with interest at a rate or in an amount in excess of the Maximum Rate. If
any provisions of this Agreement or the Revolving Credit Note contravene any
such law, such provisions shall be deemed amended to conform to such law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no provision of this
Agreement or the Revolving Credit Note shall require the payment or permit the
collection of interest in excess of the Maximum Rate. If any excess of interest
in such respect is herein provided for, or shall be adjudicated to be so
provided, in this Agreement, the Revolving Credit Note or otherwise in
connection with this loan transaction, the provisions of this paragraph shall
govern and prevail, and no Borrower nor the sureties, guarantors, successors or
assigns of any Borrower shall be obligated to pay the excess amount of such
interest, or any other excess sum paid for the use, forbearance or detention of
sums loaned pursuant hereto. If for any reason interest in excess of the Maximum
Rate shall be deemed charged, required or permitted by any court of competent
jurisdiction, any such excess shall be applied as a payment and reduction of the
principal of Indebtedness evidenced by this Agreement and the Revolving Credit
Note; and, if the principal amount hereof has been paid in full, any remaining
excess shall forthwith be paid to Borrowers. In determining whether or not the
interest paid or payable exceeds the Maximum Rate, Borrowers and Lender shall,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, (i) characterize any non-principal
payment as an expense, fee, or premium rather than as interest, (ii) exclude
voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii) amortize, prorate,
allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest
throughout the entire contemplated Term of this Agreement and the Revolving
Credit Note so that the interest for the entire Term does not exceed the Maximum
Rate.


                                       2
<PAGE>
      2.2 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. Interest and unused line fees
hereunder shall be calculated daily and shall be computed on the actual number
of days elapsed over a year of 360 days. For the purpose of computing interest
hereunder, all items of payment received by Lender shall be deemed applied by
Lender on account of the Obligations (subject to final payment of such items) on
the first Business Day after receipt by Lender of such items in Lender's account
located in Hartford, Connecticut.

      2.3 CLOSING FEE. Borrowers shall pay to Lender a closing fee of $150,000
(of which $100,000 was previously paid by the Borrowers), which shall be fully
earned and nonrefundable on the Closing Date and shall be paid concurrently with
the initial Loan hereunder.

      2.4 UNUSED LINE FEE. Borrowers shall pay to Lender a fee equal to 0.375%
per annum of the average monthly amount by which $15,000,000 exceeds the sum of
the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Credit Loans. The unused line
fee shall be payable monthly in arrears on the last day of each calendar month
hereafter.

      2.5 COLLATERAL ADMINISTRATION FEE. Borrowers shall pay to Lender a
collateral administration fee of $25,000 annually, payable on the Closing Date
and each anniversary of the Closing Date thereafter.

      2.6 AUDIT AND APPRAISAL FEES. Borrowers shall pay to Lender $750 per day
for each auditor or appraiser in connection with any audits and appraisals of
Borrowers' books and records for which the Borrowers have an obligation to
reimburse Lender under the terms of this Agreement, plus all out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by such auditors and appraisers. Audit fees shall be payable
on the first day of the month following the date of issuance by Lender of a
request for payment thereof to Borrowers.

      2.7 REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES. If, at any time or times regardless of
whether or not an Event of Default then exists, Lender or any Participating
Lender incurs legal or accounting expenses or any other costs or out-of-pocket
expenses in connection with (i) the negotiation and preparation of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, any amendment of or modification
of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or any sale or attempted
sale of any interest herein to a Participating Lender; (ii) the administration
of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby; (iii) any litigation, contest, dispute, suit,
proceeding or action (whether instituted by Lender, a Borrower or any other
Person) in any way relating to the Collateral, this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents or a Borrower's affairs; (iv) any attempt to enforce any
rights of Lender or any Participating Lender against a Borrower or any other
Person which may be obligated to Lender by virtue of this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, the Account Debtors; or
(v) any attempt to inspect, verify, protect, preserve, restore, collect, sell,
liquidate or otherwise dispose of or realize upon the Collateral; then all such
legal and accounting expenses, other costs and out of pocket expenses of Lender
shall be charged to Borrowers. All amounts chargeable to Borrowers under this
Section 2.7 shall be Obligations secured by all of the Collateral, shall be
payable on demand to Lender or to such Participating Lender, as the case may be,
and shall bear interest from the date such demand is made until paid in full at
the rate applicable to Revolving Credit Loans from time to time. Borrowers shall
also


                                       3
<PAGE>
reimburse Lender for expenses incurred by Lender in its administration of
the Collateral to the extent and in the manner provided in Section 6 hereof.

      2.8 BANK CHARGES. Borrowers shall pay to Lender, on demand, any and all
fees, costs or expenses which Lender or any Participating Lender pays to a bank
or other similar institution (including, without limitation, any fees paid by
Lender to any Participating Lender) arising out of or in connection with (i) the
forwarding to Borrowers or any other Person on behalf of Borrowers, by Lender or
any Participating Lender, of proceeds of loans made by Lender to Borrowers
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) the depositing for collection, by Lender or
any Participating Lender, of any check or item of payment received or delivered
to Lender or any Participating Lender on account of the Obligations.

                                   SECTION 3
                              LOAN ADMINISTRATION.

      3.1 MANNER OF BORROWING REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. Borrowings under the
credit facility established pursuant to Section 1 hereof shall be as follows:

            (a) LOAN REQUESTS. A request for a Revolving Credit Loan shall be
made, or shall be deemed to be made, in the following manner: Borrowers may give
Lender notice of their intention to borrow, in which notice Borrowers shall
specify the amount of the proposed borrowing and the proposed borrowing date, no
later than 11:00 a.m. Dallas, Texas time on the proposed borrowing date,
provided, however, that no such request may be made at a time when there exists
a Default or an Event of Default; and the becoming due of any amount required to
be paid under this Agreement, whether as interest or for any other Obligation,
shall be deemed irrevocably to be a request for a Revolving Credit Loan on the
due date in the amount required to pay such interest or other Obligation. As an
accommodation to Borrowers, Lender may permit telephonic or electronic requests
for loans and electronic transmittal of instructions, authorizations, agreements
or reports to Lender by Borrowers. Unless Borrowers specifically direct Lender
in writing not to accept or act upon telephonic or electronic communications
from Borrowers, Lender shall have no liability to Borrowers for any loss or
damage suffered by Borrowers as a result of Lender's honoring of any requests,
execution of any instructions, authorizations or agreements or reliance on any
reports communicated to it telephonically or electronically and purporting to
have been sent to Lender by Borrowers and Lender shall have no duty to verify
the origin of any such communication or the authority of the person sending it.

            (b) DISBURSEMENT. Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize Lender to
disburse the proceeds of each Revolving Credit Loan requested, or deemed to be
requested, pursuant to this subsection 3.1(b) as follows: the proceeds of each
Revolving Credit Loan requested under subsection 3.1(a)(i) shall be disbursed by
Lender in lawful money of the United States of America in immediately available
funds, in the case of the initial borrowing, in accordance with the terms of the
written disbursement letter from Borrowers, and in the case of each subsequent
borrowing, by wire transfer to such bank account as may be agreed upon by
Borrowers and Lender from time to time or elsewhere if pursuant to a written
direction from Borrowers; and the proceeds of each Revolving Credit Loan
requested under subsection 3.1(a)(ii) shall be disbursed by Lender by way of
direct payment of the relevant interest or other Obligation.


                                       4
<PAGE>
            (c) AUTHORIZATION. Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize Lender, in
Lender's sole discretion, to advance to Borrowers, and to charge to Borrowers'
Loan Account hereunder as a Revolving Credit Loan, a sum sufficient to pay all
interest accrued on the Obligations during the immediately preceding month and
to pay all costs, fees and expenses at any time owed by Borrowers to Lender
hereunder.

      3.2 PAYMENTS. Except where evidenced by notes or other instruments issued
or made by Borrowers to Lender specifically containing payment provisions which
are in conflict with this Section 3.2 (in which event the conflicting provisions
of said notes or other instruments shall govern and control), the Obligations
shall be payable as follows:

            (a) PRINCIPAL. Principal payable on account of Revolving Credit
Loans shall be payable by Borrowers to Lender immediately upon the earliest of
(i) the receipt by Lender or Borrowers of any proceeds of any of the Collateral,
to the extent of said proceeds, (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default in
consequence of which Lender elects to accelerate the maturity and payment of the
Obligations, or (iii) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 4
hereof; provided, however, that if an Overadvance shall exist at any time,
Borrowers shall, on demand, repay the Overadvance.

            (b) INTEREST. Interest accrued on the Revolving Credit Loans shall
be due on the earliest of (i) the first calendar day of each month (for the
immediately preceding month), computed through the last calendar day of the
preceding month, (ii) the occurrence of an Event of Default in consequence of
which Lender elects to accelerate the maturity and payment of the Obligations or
(iii) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 4 hereof.

            (c) COSTS, FEES AND CHARGES. Costs, fees and charges payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be payable by Borrowers as and when provided in
Section 2 hereof, to Lender or to any other Person designated by Lender in
writing.

            (d) OTHER OBLIGATIONS. The balance of the Obligations requiring the

provided in this Agreement, the Other Agreements or the Security Documents, or
on demand, whichever is later.

      3.3 MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS OF PROCEEDS OF SALE, LOSS OR DESTRUCTION OF
COLLATERAL. Except as provided in subsection 6.4(b) hereof, if any Borrower
sells any of the Collateral (other than Inventory), or if any of the Collateral
is lost or destroyed, Borrowers shall pay to Lender, unless otherwise agreed by
Lender, as and when received by any Borrower and as a mandatory prepayment of
the Revolving Credit Loans, a sum equal to the proceeds (including insurance
payments) received by Borrowers from such sale, loss or destruction.

      3.4 APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS AND COLLECTIONS. All items of payment received
by Lender by 12:00 noon, Dallas, Texas time, on any Business Day shall be deemed
received on that Business Day. All items of payment received after 12:00 noon,
Dallas, Texas time, on any Business Day shall be deemed received on the
following Business Day. For the purpose of computing interest hereunder, all
items of payment received by Lender shall be deemed applied by Lender on account
of the Obligations (subject to final payment of such items) on the first
Business Day after receipt of such item in good funds. Borrowers irrevocably
waive the right to


                                       5
<PAGE>
direct the application of any and all payments and collections at any time or
times hereafter received by Lender from or on behalf of Borrowers, and Borrowers
do hereby irrevocably agree that Lender shall have the continuing exclusive
right to apply and reapply any and all such payments and collections received at
any time or times hereafter by Lender or its agent against the Obligations, in
such manner as Lender may deem advisable, notwithstanding any entry by Lender
upon any of its books and records. If as the result of collections of Accounts
as authorized by subsection 6.2(f) hereof a credit balance exists in the Loan
Account, such credit balance shall not accrue interest in favor of Borrowers,
but shall be available to Borrowers at any time or times for so long as no
Default or Event of Default exists.

      3.5 ALL LOANS TO CONSTITUTE ONE OBLIGATION. The Loans shall constitute one
general Obligation of Borrowers, and shall be secured by Lender's Lien upon all
of the Collateral.

      3.6 LOAN ACCOUNT. Lender shall enter all Loans as debits to the Loan
Account and shall also record in the Loan Account all payments made by any
Borrower on any Obligations and all proceeds of Collateral which are finally
paid to Lender, and may record therein, in accordance with customary accounting
practice, other debits and credits, including interest and all charges and
expenses properly chargeable to Borrowers.

      3.7 STATEMENTS OF ACCOUNT. Lender will account to Borrowers monthly with a
statement of Loans, charges and payments made pursuant to this Agreement, and
such account rendered by Lender shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive
upon Borrowers unless Lender is notified by Borrowers in writing to the contrary
within thirty (30) days of the date each accounting is mailed to Borrowers. Such
notice shall only be deemed an objection to those items specifically objected to
therein.

                                   SECTION 4
                              TERM AND TERMINATION

      4.1 TERM OF AGREEMENT. Subject to Lender's right to cease making Loans to
Borrowers upon or after the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, this
Agreement shall be in effect for a period of three years from the date hereof,
through and including January 31, 2006 (the "TERM") unless terminated as
provided in Section 4.2 hereof.

      4.2 TERMINATION.

            (a) TERMINATION BY LENDER. Lender may terminate this Agreement, upon
written notice to the Borrowers, at any time after the occurrence of an Event of
Default and so long as such Event of Default is continuing.

            (b) TERMINATION BY BORROWERS. Upon at least fourteen (14) days prior
written notice to Lender, Borrowers may, at their option, terminate this
Agreement; provided, however, no such termination shall be effective until
Borrowers have paid all of the Obligations in immediately available funds. Any
notice of termination given by Borrowers shall be irrevocable unless Lender
otherwise agrees in writing, and Lender shall have no obligation to make any
Loans on or after the termination date stated in such notice. Borrowers may
elect to terminate


                                       6
<PAGE>
this Agreement in its entirety only. No section of this Agreement or type of
Loan available hereunder may be terminated singly.

            (c) TERMINATION CHARGES. At the effective date of termination of
this Agreement for any reason, Borrowers shall pay to Lender (in addition to the
then outstanding principal, accrued interest and other charges owing under the
terms of this Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents) as liquidated
damages for the loss of the bargain and not as a penalty, an amount equal to 3%
of the Total Credit Facility if termination occurs during the first twelve-month
period of the Term (January 31, 2003 through January 30, 2004) and 2% of the
Total Credit Facility if termination occurs during the second 12-month period of
the Term (January 31, 2004 through January 30, 2005). If termination occurs on
January 31, 2005 through the last day of the Term, no termination charge shall
be payable.

            (d) EFFECT OF TERMINATION. All of the Obligations shall be
immediately due and payable upon the termination date stated in any notice of
termination of this Agreement. All undertakings, agreements, covenants,
warranties and representations of Borrowers contained in the Loan Documents
shall survive any such termination and Lender shall retain its Liens in the
Collateral and all of its rights and remedies under the Loan Documents
notwithstanding such termination until Borrowers have paid the Obligations to
Lender, in full, in immediately available funds, together with the applicable
termination charge, if any. Notwithstanding the payment in full of the
Obligations, Lender shall not be required to terminate its security interests in
the Collateral unless, with respect to any loss or damage Lender may incur as a
result of dishonored checks or other items of payment received by Lender from
Borrowers or any Account Debtor and applied to the Obligations, Lender shall, at
its option, (i) have received a written agreement, executed by Borrowers and by
any Person whose loans or other advances to Borrowers are used in whole or in
part to satisfy the Obligations, indemnifying Lender from any such loss or
damage; or (ii) have retained such monetary reserves and Liens on the Collateral
for such period of time as Lender, in its reasonable discretion, may deem
necessary to protect Lender from any such loss or damage.

<PAGE>
(i) sales of Inventory in the ordinary course of business; and (ii) removals in
connection with dispositions of Equipment that are authorized by subsection
6.4(b) hereof.

            (b) INSURANCE OF COLLATERAL. Borrowers shall maintain and pay for

business, covering casualty, hazard, public liability and such other risks in
such amounts and with such insurance companies as are reasonably satisfactory to
Lender. Borrowers shall deliver the originals of such policies to Lender with
satisfactory lender's loss payable endorsements, naming Lender as loss payee,
assignee or additional insured, as appropriate. Each policy of insurance or
endorsement shall contain a clause requiring the insurer to give not less than
thirty (30) days prior written notice to Lender in the event of cancellation of
the policy for any reason whatsoever and a clause specifying that the interest
of Lender shall not be impaired or invalidated by any act or neglect of
Borrowers or the owner of the Property or by the occupation of the premises for
purposes more hazardous than are permitted by said policy. If Borrowers fail to
provide and pay for such insurance, Lender may, at its option, but shall not be
required to, procure the same and charge Borrowers therefor. Borrowers agree to
deliver to Lender, promptly as rendered, true copies of all reports made in any
reporting forms to insurance companies.

            (c) PROTECTION OF COLLATERAL. All expenses of protecting, storing,
warehousing, insuring, handling, maintaining and shipping the Collateral, any
and all excise, property, sales, and use taxes imposed by any state, federal, or

thereof when due, Lender may, at its option, but shall not be required to, pay
the same and charge Borrowers therefor. Lender shall not be liable or
responsible in any way for the safekeeping of any of the Collateral or for any
loss or damage thereto (except for reasonable care in the custody thereof while
any Collateral is in Lender's actual possession) or for any diminution in the
value thereof, or for any act or default of any warehouseman, carrier,
forwarding agency, or other person whomsoever, but the same shall be at
Borrowers' sole risk.

and after the date hereof, Borrowers shall deliver to Lender, in form acceptable
to Lender, a detailed, aged trial balance of all Accounts existing as of the
last day of the preceding month, specifying the names, addresses, face value,
dates of invoices and due dates for each Account Debtor obligated on an Account
so listed ("SCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS"), and, upon Lender's request therefor, copies
of proof of delivery and the original copy of all documents, including, without
limitation, repayment histories and present status reports relating to the
Accounts so scheduled and such other matters and information relating to the
status of then existing Accounts as Lender shall reasonably request. In
addition, if either Borrower becomes aware of Accounts in an aggregate face
amount in excess of $250,000 becoming ineligible because they fall within one of
the specified categories of ineligibility set forth in the definition of
Eligible Accounts or otherwise established by Lender, Borrowers shall notify
Lender of such occurrence on the first Business Day following such occurrence
and the Borrowing Base shall


                                       11
<PAGE>
thereupon be adjusted to reflect such occurrence. If requested by Lender,
Borrowers shall execute and deliver to Lender formal written assignments of all
of their Accounts weekly or daily, which shall include all Accounts that have
been created since the date of the last assignment, together with copies of
invoices or invoice registers related thereto.

            (b) DISCOUNTS, ALLOWANCES, DISPUTES. If any Borrower grants any
discounts, allowances or credits that are not shown on the face of the invoice
for the Account involved, such Borrower shall report such discounts, allowances
or credits, as the case may be, to Lender as part of the next required Schedule
of Accounts. If any amounts due and owing in excess of $250,000 are in dispute
between any Borrower and any Account Debtor, such Borrower shall provide Lender
with written notice thereof at the time of submission of the next Schedule of
Accounts, explaining in detail the reason for the dispute, all claims related
thereto and the amount in controversy. Upon and after the occurrence of an Event
of Default, Lender shall have the right to settle or adjust all disputes and
claims directly with the Account Debtor and to compromise the amount or extend
the time for payment of the Accounts upon such terms and conditions as Lender
may deem advisable, and to charge the deficiencies, costs and expenses thereof,
including attorney's fees, to Borrowers.

            (c) TAXES. If an Account includes a charge for any tax payable to
any governmental taxing authority, Lender is authorized, in its sole discretion,
to pay the amount thereof to the proper taxing authority for the account of any
Borrower and to charge Borrowers therefor, provided, however that Lender shall
not be liable for any taxes to any governmental taxing authority that may be due
by any Borrower.

            (d) ACCOUNT VERIFICATION. Whether or not a Default or an Event of
Default has occurred, any of Lender's officers, employees or agents shall have
the right, at any time or times hereafter, in the name of Lender, any designee
of Lender, or a Borrower, to verify the validity, amount or any other matter
relating to any Accounts by mail, telephone, electronic communication or
otherwise. Borrowers shall cooperate fully with Lender in an effort to
facilitate and promptly conclude any such verification process.

            (e) MAINTENANCE OF DOMINION ACCOUNT. Borrowers shall maintain a
Dominion Account pursuant to a lockbox arrangement acceptable to Lender with
such banks as may be selected by Borrowers and be acceptable to Lender.
Borrowers shall issue to any such banks an irrevocable letter of instruction
directing such banks to deposit all payments or other remittances received in
the lockbox to the Dominion Account for application on account of the
Obligations. All funds deposited in the Dominion Account shall immediately
become the property of Lender and Borrowers shall obtain the agreement by such
banks in favor of Lender to waive any recoupment, setoff rights, and any
security interest in, or against the funds so deposited, except for claims
related to the administration of such account and the handling of items
collection through such account. Lender assumes no responsibility for such
lockbox arrangement, including, without limitation, any claim of accord and
satisfaction or release with respect to deposits accepted by any bank
thereunder.

            (f) COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS, PROCEEDS OF COLLATERAL. To expedite
collection, Borrowers shall endeavor in the first instance to make collection of
their Accounts for Lender. All remittances received by Borrowers on account of
Accounts, together with the proceeds of


                                       12
<PAGE>
any other Collateral, shall be held as Lender's property by Borrowers as
trustees of an express trust for Lender's benefit and Borrowers shall
immediately deposit same in kind in the Dominion Account. Lender retains the
right at all times after the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default to
notify Account Debtors that Accounts have been assigned to Lender and to collect
Accounts directly in its own name, or in the name of Lender's agent, and to
charge the collection costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees to
Borrowers.

frequently than annually and shall provide to Lender a report based on each such
physical inventory promptly thereafter, together with such supporting
information as Lender shall request.

            (b) RETURNS OF INVENTORY. If at any time or times hereafter any
Account Debtor returns any Inventory to any Borrower the shipment of which
generated an Account on which such Account Debtor is obligated in excess of
$50,000, such Borrower shall immediately notify Lender of the same, specifying
the reason for such return and the location, condition and intended disposition
of the returned Inventory.

      6.4 ADMINISTRATION OF EQUIPMENT.


            (a) RECORDS AND SCHEDULES OF EQUIPMENT. Borrowers shall keep
accurate records itemizing and describing the kind, type, quality, quantity and
value of their Equipment and all dispositions made in accordance with subsection
6.4(b) hereof, and shall furnish Lender with a current schedule containing the
foregoing information on at least an annual basis and more often if requested by
Lender. Immediately on request therefor by Lender, Borrowers shall deliver to
Lender any and all evidence of ownership, if any, of any of the Equipment.

            (b) DISPOSITIONS OF EQUIPMENT. Borrowers will not sell, lease or
otherwise dispose of or transfer any of the Equipment or any part thereof
without the prior written consent of Lender; provided, however, that the
foregoing restriction shall not apply, for so long as no Default or Event of
Default exists, to (i) dispositions of Equipment which, in the aggregate during
any consecutive twelve-month period, has a fair market value or book value,
whichever is less, of $500,000 or less, provided that all proceeds thereof are
remitted to Lender for application to the Loans, or (ii) replacements of
Equipment that is substantially worn, damaged or obsolete with Equipment of like
kind, function and value, provided that the replacement Equipment shall be
acquired prior to or concurrently with any disposition of the Equipment that is
to be replaced, the replacement Equipment shall be free and clear of Liens other
than Permitted Liens that are not Purchase Money Liens, and Borrowers shall have
given Lender at least five (5) days prior written notice of such disposition.

      6.5 PAYMENT OF CHARGES. All amounts chargeable to Borrowers under Section
6 hereof shall be Obligations secured by all of the Collateral, shall be payable
on demand and shall


                                       13

applicable to Revolving Credit Loans from time to time.

stock of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Exhibit
D, there are no outstanding agreements or instruments binding upon any of
Borrower's shareholders (or members, in the case of a limited liability company)
relating to the ownership of its shares of capital stock (or member interests,
in the case of a limited liability company). Measurement Specialties United
Kingdom, Ltd. ("MSUK") qualifies as a "Subsidiary" of MSI but since MSUK is
currently in liquidation, MSUK will not be considered a "Subsidiary" for
purposes of this Agreement.

            (e) CORPORATE NAMES, ETC. Neither Borrowers nor any of their
Subsidiaries have been known as or used any corporate, fictitious or trade names
except those listed on Exhibit E hereto. Except as set forth on Exhibit E,
neither Borrowers nor any of their Subsidiaries have been the surviving
corporation of a merger or consolidation or acquired all or substantially all of
the assets of any Person. Each of Borrower's and its Subsidiaries' jurisdiction
of incorporation or organization, Type of organization and organizational I.D.
number (if any) is set forth on Exhibit E. The exact legal name of each Borrower
and each of its Subsidiaries is set forth on Exhibit E.

            (f) BUSINESS LOCATIONS; AGENT FOR PROCESS. Each Borrower's and each
of its Subsidiaries' chief executive office and other places of business are as
listed on Exhibit B hereto. During the preceding one-year period, neither
Borrowers nor any of their Subsidiaries have had an office, place of business or
agent for service of process other than as listed on Exhibit B. Except as shown
on Exhibit B, no Inventory is stored with a bailee, warehouseman or similar
party, nor is any Inventory consigned to any Person. Except as shown on Exhibit
B, no Inventory is or will be consigned to any Person by Borrowers without
Lender's prior written consent, and, if such consent is given, Borrowers shall,
prior to the delivery of any Inventory on consignment, (i) provide Lender with
all consignment agreements to be used in connection with such consignment, all
of which shall be reasonably acceptable to Lender, (ii) prepare and file
appropriate financing statements with respect to any consigned Inventory,
showing Lender as assignee, (iii) conduct a search of all filings made against
the consignee in all jurisdictions in which any consigned Inventory is to be
located and deliver to Lender copies of the results of all such searches and
(iv) notify, in writing, all the creditors of the consignee which are or may be
holders of Liens in the Inventory to be consigned that Borrowers expect to
deliver certain Inventory to the consignee, all of which Inventory shall be
described in such notice by item or type.

            (g) TITLE TO PROPERTIES; PRIORITY OF LIENS. Borrowers and each of
their Subsidiaries have good, indefeasible and marketable title to and fee

<PAGE>
and subsisting leasehold interests in, all of their real Property, if any, and
good title to all of the Collateral and all of their other Property, in each
case, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens. Borrowers have paid or
discharged all lawful claims which, if unpaid, might become a Lien against any
of Borrowers' Properties that is not a Permitted Lien. The Liens granted to
Lender under Section 5 hereof are first-priority Liens, subject only to
Permitted Liens.

            (h) ACCOUNTS. Lender may rely, in determining which Accounts are
Eligible Accounts, on all statements and representations made by Borrowers with
respect to any Account or Accounts. Unless otherwise indicated in writing to
Lender, with respect to each Account:

            (i) It is genuine and in all respects what it purports to be, and it
      is not evidenced by a judgment;

            (ii) It arises out of a completed, bona fide sale and delivery of
      goods or rendition of services by a Borrower in the ordinary course of its
      business and in accordance with the terms and conditions of all purchase
      orders, contracts or other documents relating thereto and forming a part
      of the contract between a Borrower and the Account Debtor;

            (iii) It is for a liquidated amount maturing as stated in the
      duplicate invoice covering such sale or rendition of services, a copy of
      which has been furnished or is available to Lender;

            (iv) Except for Guaranteed Sale Accounts and the Stayhealthy
      Accounts, such Account, and Lender's security interest therein, is not,
      and will not (by voluntary act or omission of a Borrower) be in the
      future, subject to any offset, Lien, deduction, recoupment, defense,
      dispute, counterclaim or any other adverse condition except for disputes
      resulting in returned goods where the amount in controversy is deemed by
      Lender to be immaterial, and each such Account is absolutely owing to a
      Borrower and is not contingent in any respect or for any reason;

            (v) No Borrower has made any agreement with any Account Debtor
      thereunder for any extension, compromise, settlement or modification of
      any such Account or any deduction therefrom, except discounts or
      allowances which are granted by such Borrower in the ordinary course of
      its business for prompt payment and which are reflected in the calculation
      of the net amount of each respective invoice related thereto and are
      reflected in the Schedules of Accounts submitted to Lender pursuant to
      subsection 6.2(a) hereof;

            (vi) Except for Guaranteed Sale Accounts and the Stayhealthy
      Accounts, there are no facts, events or occurrences which in any way
      impair the validity or enforceability of any Accounts or tend to reduce
      the amount payable thereunder from the face amount of the invoice and
      statements delivered to Lender with respect thereto;

            (vii) To the best of each Borrower's knowledge, the Account Debtor
      thereunder (A) had the capacity to contract at the time any contract or
      other document giving rise to the Account was executed and (B) such
      Account Debtor is Solvent; and


                                       16
<PAGE>
            (viii) To the best of each Borrower's knowledge, there are no
      proceedings or actions which are threatened or pending against any Account
      Debtor thereunder which might result in any material adverse change in
      such Account Debtor's financial condition or the collectibility of such
      Account.

            (i) EQUIPMENT. The Equipment of Borrowers is in good operating
condition and repair, and all necessary replacements of and repairs thereto
shall be made so that the value and operating efficiency of the Equipment shall
be maintained and preserved, reasonable wear and tear excepted. No Borrower will
permit any of the Equipment to become affixed to any real Property leased to
such Borrower so that an interest arises therein under the real estate laws of
the applicable jurisdiction unless the landlord of such real Property has
executed a landlord waiver or leasehold mortgage in favor of and in form
acceptable to Lender, and no Borrower will permit any of the Equipment to become
an accession to any personal Property other than Equipment that is subject to
first-priority (except for Permitted Liens) Liens in favor of Lender.

            (j) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; FISCAL YEAR. The audited Consolidated
balance sheet of MSI and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2002 and the unaudited
Consolidated balance sheet of MSI and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002,
and the related statements of income, changes in stockholder's equity, and cash
flows for the periods ended on such dates, have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP, and present fairly the financial positions of MSI and its Subsidiaries at
such dates and the results of their operations for such periods. Since December
31, 2002, there has been no material change in the condition, financial or
otherwise, of Borrowers and such other Persons as shown on the Consolidated
balance sheet as of such date and no change in the aggregate value of Equipment
and real Property owned by Borrowers or such other Persons, except changes in
the ordinary course of business, none of which individually or in the aggregate
has been materially adverse. The fiscal year of Borrowers and each of their
Subsidiaries ends on March 31st of each year.

            (k) FULL DISCLOSURE. The financial statements referred to in
subsection 7.1(j) hereof do not, nor does this Agreement or any other written
statement of Borrowers to Lender, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein
or herein not misleading. There is no fact which Borrowers have failed to
disclose to Lender in writing which materially affects adversely or, so far as
Borrowers can now foresee, will materially affect adversely the Properties,
business, prospects, profits or condition (financial or otherwise) of Borrowers
or any of their Subsidiaries or the ability of Borrowers or their Subsidiaries
to perform this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

Subsidiaries is now and, after giving effect to the Loans to be made hereunder,
at all times will be, Solvent.

            (m) SURETY OBLIGATIONS. No Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is

performance or completion of performance of any undertaking or obligation of any
Person.

            (n) TAXES. MSI's federal tax identification number is 22-2378738.

Borrowers' Subsidiaries is shown on Exhibit F hereto. Each of Borrowers and
their Subsidiaries has filed all federal, state and local tax returns and other
reports it is required by law to file and has paid, or made provision for the
payment of, all taxes, assessments, fees, levies and other governmental charges
upon it, its income and Properties as and when such taxes, assessments, fees,
levies and charges are due and payable, unless and to the extent any thereof are
being actively contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and such
Borrower maintains reasonable reserves on its books therefor. The provision for
taxes on the books of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries is adequate for all years
not closed by applicable statutes, and for its current fiscal year.

            (o) BROKERS. There are no claims for brokerage commissions, finder's
fees or investment banking fees in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

            (p) PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES. Each of Borrowers
and their Subsidiaries owns or possesses all the patents, trademarks, service

has duly complied with, and its Properties, business operations and leaseholds
are in compliance in all material respects with, the provisions of all federal,
state and local laws, rules and regulations applicable to such Borrower or such
Subsidiary, as applicable, its Properties or the conduct of its business and
there have been no citations, notices or orders of noncompliance issued to such
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries under any such law, rule or regulation. Each
of Borrower and their Subsidiaries has established and maintains an adequate
monitoring system to insure that it remains in compliance with all federal,
state and local laws, rules and regulations applicable to it. No Inventory has
been produced in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. Section201
et seq.), as amended.

            (s) RESTRICTIONS. No Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or subject to any contract, agreement, or charter or other corporate
restriction, which materially and adversely affects its business or the use or
ownership of any of its Properties. No Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or subject to any contract or agreement which restricts its right or
ability to incur Indebtedness, other than as set forth on Exhibit H hereto, none
of which prohibit the execution of or compliance with this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents by such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable.

            (t) LITIGATION. Except as set forth on Exhibit I hereto, there are
no actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending, or to the knowledge of

<PAGE>
business, operations, Properties, prospects, profits or condition of any
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. No Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in default with respect to any order, writ, injunction, judgment, decree or rule
of any court, governmental authority or arbitration board or tribunal.

            (u) NO DEFAULTS. As of the Closing Date, no event has occurred and
no condition exists which would, upon or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or Borrowers' performance hereunder, constitute a Default or an
Event of Default. As of the Closing Date, no Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in default, and no event has occurred and no condition exists
which constitutes, or which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or
both would constitute, a default in the payment of any Indebtedness to any
Person for Money Borrowed.

            (v) LEASES. Exhibit J hereto is a complete listing of all
capitalized leases of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries and Exhibit K hereto is a
complete listing of all operating leases of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries
requiring annual lease payments of $25,000 or more. Each of Borrower and their
Subsidiaries is in full compliance with all of the terms of each of its
respective capitalized and operating leases.

            (w) PENSION PLANS. Except as disclosed on Exhibit L hereto, no
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Plan. Each Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries are in material compliance with the requirements of ERISA and the
regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to each Plan. No fact or
situation that could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse
change in the financial condition of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
exists in connection with any Plan. No Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any withdrawal liability in connection with a Multi-employer Plan.

termination, cancellation or limitation of, or any modification or change in,
the business relationship between any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and
any customer or any group of customers whose purchases individually or in the
aggregate are material to the business of any Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, or with any material supplier, and there exists no present
condition or state of facts or circumstances which would materially affect
adversely any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or prevent any Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries from conducting such business after the consummation of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement in substantially the same manner in
which it has heretofore been conducted.

            (y) LABOR RELATIONS. Except as described on Exhibit M hereto, no
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining
agreement. There are no material grievances, disputes or controversies with any
union or any other organization of any Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries'
employees, or threats of strikes, work stoppages or any asserted pending demands
for collective bargaining by any union or organization.

representation and warranty contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall be continuous in nature and shall remain accurate, complete and
not misleading at all times during the term of this Agreement, except for
changes in the nature of Borrowers' or their Subsidiaries' businesses or
operations that would render the information in any exhibit attached hereto

updated information with respect to such matter and Lender has expressly
consented in writing thereto.

      7.3 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations and
warranties of Borrowers contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents shall survive the execution, delivery and acceptance thereof by Lender

      business and is on fair and reasonable terms comparable to what would be
      obtained in an arms length transaction, provided, that, the aggregate
      amount of such Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Borrowers as to the
      Borrowers, net of such Indebtedness of the Borrowers to their Subsidiaries

course of and pursuant to the reasonable requirements of such Borrower's or such
Subsidiary's business and upon fair and reasonable terms which are fully
