                                                                   EXHIBIT 10(m)

                         TERMINATION BENEFITS AGREEMENT

            This Termination Benefits Agreement ("Agreement") is made and
entered into as of October 29, 2002, by and between Integra Bank Corporation, an
Indiana corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "Corporation") and Charles
A. Caswell (hereinafter referred to as "Employee").

                               W I T N E S S E T H

            WHEREAS, Employee is an at-will employee of the Corporation and has
been appointed an executive officer of the Corporation; and

            WHEREAS, the Corporation believes that Employee will make valuable
contributions to the productivity and profitability of the Corporation; and

            WHEREAS, the Corporation desires to encourage Employee to continue
to make such contributions and not to seek or accept employment elsewhere; and

            WHEREAS, the Corporation, therefore, desires to assure Employee of
certain benefits in case of any termination or significant redefinition of the
terms of his employment with the Corporation in connection with any Change in
Control of the Corporation;

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual
covenants herein contained and the mutual benefits herein provided, the
Corporation and Employee hereby agree as follows:

            1. The term of this Agreement shall be from the date hereof through
December 31, 2005; provided, however, that such term shall be automatically
extended for an additional year on December 31, 2002, and on December 31 of each
year thereafter unless either party hereto gives written notice to the other
party not to so extend prior to November 30 of the year for which notice is
given, in which case no further automatic extension shall occur and the term of
this Agreement shall end on December 31 two (2) years subsequent to the date of
the latest preceding automatic extension. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a
Change in Control of the Corporation (as defined in Section 2 below) shall occur
prior to the expiration of the original term or any extensions of the term of
this Agreement, then the term of this Agreement shall automatically become a
term of two (2) years commencing on the date of any such Change in Control.

            2. As used in this Agreement, "Change in Control" of the Corporation
means:

            (A) The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the
      meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of
      1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (a "Person") of beneficial ownership
      (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act as in
      effect from time to time) of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of either
      (i) the then
<PAGE>
      outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation or (ii) the combined
      voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Corporation
      entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; provided,
      however, that the following acquisitions shall not constitute an
      acquisition of control: (i) any acquisition directly from the Corporation
      (excluding an acquisition by virtue of the exercise of a conversion
      privilege), (ii) any acquisition by the Corporation, (iii) any acquisition
      by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by
      the Corporation or any corporation controlled by the Corporation, or (iv)
      any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a reorganization, merger or
      consolidation, if, following such reorganization, merger or consolidation,
      the conditions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of subsection (C)
      of this Section 2 are satisfied;

            (B) Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board of
      Directors of the Corporation (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason
      to constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors of the
      Corporation (the "Board"); provided, however, that any individual becoming
      a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for
      election by the Corporation's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at
      least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board
      shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the
      Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual
      whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of either an actual
      or threatened election contest (as such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of
      Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) or other actual or
      threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person
      other than the Board; or

            (C) Approval by the shareholders of the Corporation of a
      reorganization, merger or consolidation, in each case, unless, following
      such reorganization, merger or consolidation, (i) more than sixty percent
      (60%) of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of the
      corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation
      and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of
      such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
      is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or
      substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial
      owners, respectively, of the outstanding Corporation common stock and
      outstanding Corporation voting securities immediately prior to such
      reorganization, merger or consolidation in substantially the same
      proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such reorganization,
      merger or consolidation, of the outstanding Corporation stock and
      outstanding Corporation voting securities, as the case may be, (ii) no
      Person (excluding the Corporation, any employee benefit plan or related
      trust of the Corporation or such corporation resulting from such
      reorganization, merger or consolidation and any Person beneficially
      owning, immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation,
      directly or indirectly, twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the


                                      -2-
<PAGE>
      outstanding Corporation common stock or outstanding voting securities, as
      the case may be) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, twenty-five
      percent (25%) or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of
      common stock of the corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger
      or consolidation or the combined voting power of the then outstanding
      voting securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the
      election of directors and (iii) at least a majority of the members of the
      board of directors of the corporation resulting from such reorganization,
      merger or consolidation were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of
      the execution of the initial agreement providing for such reorganization,
      merger or consolidation; or

            (D) Approval by the shareholders of the Corporation of (i) a
      complete liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation or (ii) the sale or
      other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
      Corporation, other than to a corporation with respect to which following
      such sale or other disposition (a) more than sixty percent (60%) of,
      respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of such
      corporation and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
      securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election
      of directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or
      substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial
      owners, respectively, of the outstanding Corporation common stock and
      outstanding Corporation voting securities immediately prior to such sale
      or other disposition in substantially the same proportion as their
      ownership, immediately prior to such sale or other disposition, of the
      outstanding Corporation common stock and outstanding Corporation voting
      securities, as the case may be, (b) no Person (excluding the Corporation
      and any employee benefit plan or related trust of the Corporation or such
      corporation and any Person beneficially owning, immediately prior to such
      sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, twenty-five percent
      (25%) or more of the outstanding Corporation common stock or outstanding
      Corporation voting securities, as the case may be) beneficially owns,
      directly or indirectly, twenty-five percent (25%) or more of,
      respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of such
      corporation and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
      securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election
      of directors and (c) at least a majority of the members of the board of
      directors of such corporation were members of the Incumbent Board at the
      time of the execution of the initial agreement or action of the Board
      providing for such sale or other disposition of assets of the Corporation.

            3. The Corporation shall provide Employee with the benefits set
forth in Section 6 of this Agreement upon any termination of Employee's
employment by the Corporation following a Change in Control during the term of
this Agreement for any reason except the following:

            (A) Termination by reason of Employee's death.


                                      -3-
<PAGE>
            (B) Termination by reason of Employee's "disability." For purposes
      hereof, "disability" shall be defined as Employee's inability by reason of
      illness or other physical or mental disability to perform the duties
      required by his employment for any consecutive One Hundred Eighty (180)
      day period, provided that notice of any termination by the Corporation
      because of Employee's "disability" shall have been given to Employee prior
      to the resumption by him of the performance of such duties.

            (C) Termination upon Employee reaching his normal retirement date,
      which for purposes of this Agreement shall be deemed to be the end of the
      month during which employee reaches sixty-five (65) years of age.

            (D) Termination for "cause." As used in this Agreement, the term
      "cause" means fraud, dishonesty, theft of corporate assets, or other gross
      misconduct by Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee shall not
      be deemed to have been terminated for cause unless and until there shall
      have been delivered to him a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the
      affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the entire membership of
      the Corporation's Board at a meeting called and held for the purpose
      (after reasonable notice to him and an opportunity for him, together with
      his counsel, to be heard before such Board), finding that, in the good
      faith opinion of such Board, Employee was guilty of conduct constituting
      "cause" and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

            4. The Corporation shall also provide Employee with the benefits set
forth in Section 6 of this Agreement upon any termination of Employee's
employment with the Corporation at Employee's option if any one of the following
events occurs within six (6) months prior to or within two (2) years following a
Change in Control:

            (A) Without Employee's express written consent, the assignment of
      Employee to any duties which, in Employee's reasonable judgment, are
      materially inconsistent with his positions, duties, responsibilities or
      status with the Corporation immediately prior to the earlier of
      termination of employment or the Change in Control or a substantial
      reduction of his duties or responsibilities which, in Employee's
      reasonable opinion, does not represent a promotion from his position,
      duties or responsibilities immediately prior to the earlier of termination
      of employment or the Change in Control.

            (B) A reduction by the Corporation in Employee's salary from the
      level of such salary immediately prior to the earlier of termination of
      employment or the Change in Control or the Corporation's failure to
      increase (within twelve (12) months of Employee's last increase in base
      salary) Employee's base salary after a Change in Control in an amount
      which at least equals, on a percentage basis, the average percentage
      increase in base salary for all executive and senior officers of the
      Corporation effected in the preceding twelve (12) months.


                                      -4-
<PAGE>
            (C) The failure by the Corporation to continue in effect any
      incentive, bonus or other compensation plan in which Employee
      participates, including but not limited to the Corporation's stock option
      plans, unless an equitable arrangement (embodied in an ongoing substitute
      or alternative plan), with which Employee has consented, has been made
      with respect to such plan in connection with the Change in Control, or the
      failure by the Corporation to continue Employee's participation therein,
      or any action by the Corporation which would directly or indirectly
      materially reduce Employee's participation therein.

            (D) The failure by the Corporation to continue to provide Employee
      with benefits substantially similar to those enjoyed by Employee or to
      which Employee was entitled under any of the Corporation's principal
      pension, profit sharing, life insurance, medical, dental, health and
      accident, or disability plans in which Employee was participating
      immediately prior to the earlier of the termination of employment or the
      Change in Control, the taking of any action by the Corporation which would
      directly or indirectly materially reduce any of such benefits or deprive
      Employee of any material fringe benefit enjoyed by Employee or to which
      Employee was entitled immediately prior to the earlier of the termination
      of employment or the Change in Control, or the failure by the Corporation
      to provide Employee with the number of paid vacation and sick leave days
      to which Employee is entitled on the basis of years of service or position
      with the Corporation in accordance with the Corporation's normal vacation
      policy in effect on the date hereof.

            (E) The Corporation's requiring Employee to be based anywhere other
      than the metropolitan area where the Corporation office at which he was
      based immediately prior to the earlier of the termination of employment or
      the Change in Control was located, except for required travel on the
      Corporation's business in accordance with the Corporation's past
      management practices.

            (F) Any failure of the Corporation to obtain the assumption of the
      obligation to perform this Agreement by any successor as contemplated in
      Section 10 hereof.

            (G) Any failure by the Corporation or its shareholders, as the case
      may be, to reappoint or reelect Employee to a corporate office held by him
      immediately prior to the earlier of the termination of employment or the
      Change in Control or his removal from any such office including any seat
      held at such time on the Corporation's Board of Directors.

            (H) The effectiveness of a resignation, tendered at any time, either
      before or after a Change in Control and regardless of whether formally
      characterized as voluntary or otherwise, by Employee of any corporate
      office held by him immediately prior to the Change in Control or of any
      seat held at such time on the Corporation's Board of Directors, at the
      request of the Corporation or


                                      -5-
<PAGE>
      at the request of the person obtaining control of the Corporation in such
      Change in Control.

            (I) Any purported termination of the Employee's employment which is
      not effected pursuant to a Notice of Termination satisfying the
      requirements of Section 5 hereof (and, if applicable, Section 3(D)
      hereof); and for purposes of this Agreement, no such purported termination
      shall be effective.

            (J) Any request by the Corporation that Employee participate in an
      unlawful act or take any action constituting a breach of Employee's
      professional standard of conduct.

            (K) Any breach by the Corporation of any of the provisions of this
      Agreement or any failure by the Corporation to carry out any of its
      obligations hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4 to the contrary, Employee's right to
terminate Employee's employment pursuant to this Section 4 shall not be affected
by Employee's incapacity due to physical or mental illness.

            5. Any termination of Employee's employment with the Corporation as
contemplated by Section 3 hereof (except subsection 3(A) and 3(C)) or by
Employee as contemplated by Section 4 hereof shall be communicated by written
"Notice of Termination" to the other party hereto. Any "Notice of Termination"
given by Employee pursuant to Section 4 or given by the Corporation in
connection with a termination as to which the Corporation believes it is not
obligated to provide Employee with benefits set forth in Section 6 hereof shall
indicate the specific provisions of this Agreement relied upon and shall set
forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a
basis for such termination.

            6. Subject to the conditions and exceptions set forth in Section 3
and Section 4 hereof, the following benefits, less any amounts required to be
withheld therefrom under any applicable federal, state or local income tax,
other tax, or social security laws or similar statutes, shall be paid to
Employee upon any termination of his employment within six (6) months before or
within two (2) years after any Change in Control:

            (A) Within thirty (30) days following such a termination or, if
      later, such a Change in Control, Employee shall be paid, at his
      then-effective salary, for services performed through the date of his
      termination. In addition, any earned but unpaid amount of any bonus or
      incentive payment (which, for purposes of this Agreement, shall mean that
      amount computed in a fashion consistent with the manner in which
      Employee's bonus or incentive plan for the year preceding the year of
      termination was computed, if Employee received a bonus or incentive
      payment during such preceding year in accordance with a plan or program of
      the Corporation, or, if not, then the total bonus or incentive payment
      received by the Employee during such preceding year, in either case
      prorated through the date of


                                      -6-
<PAGE>
      termination) shall be paid to Employee within thirty (30) days following
      the termination of his employment or, if later, such a Change in Control.

            (B) Within thirty (30) days following such a termination, Employee
      shall be paid a lump sum payment of an amount equal to two and nine-tenths
      (2.9) times Employee's "Base Amount." For purposes hereof, Base Amount is
      defined as Employee's average includable salary, bonus, incentive payments
      and similar compensation paid by the Corporation for the five (5) most
      recent taxable years ending before the date on which the Change in Control
      occurs (or such shorter period of time that the Employee has been employed
      by the Corporation). The definition, interpretation and calculation of the
      dollar amount of Base Amount shall be in a manner consistent with and as
      required by the provisions of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of
      1986, as amended ("Code"), and the regulations and rulings of the Internal
      Revenue Service promulgated thereunder. The payments to the Employee under
      this Section 6(B) shall be reduced by the full amount that such payment,
      when added to all other payments or benefits of any kind to the Employee
      by reason of the Change in Control, constitutes an "excess parachute
      payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

            (C) Employee acknowledges and agrees that payment in accordance with
      subsections 6(A), 6(B) and 6(C) shall be deemed to constitute a full
      settlement and discharge of any and all obligations of the Corporation to
      Employee arising out of his employment with the Corporation and the
      termination thereof, except for any vested rights Employee may then have
      under any insurance, pension, supplemental pension, thrift, employee stock
      ownership, or stock option plans sponsored or made available by the
      Corporation.

            7. The Corporation is aware that upon the occurrence of a Change in
Control the Board of Directors or a shareholder of the Corporation may then
cause or attempt to cause the Corporation to refuse to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement, or may cause or attempt to cause the
Corporation to institute, or may institute, litigation seeking to have this
Agreement declared unenforceable, or may take or attempt to take other action to
deny Employee the benefits intended under this Agreement. In these
circumstances, the purpose of this Agreement could be frustrated. It is the
intent of the Corporation that Employee not be required to incur the expenses
associated with the enforcement of his rights under this Agreement by litigation
or other legal action, nor be bound to negotiate any settlement of his rights
hereunder, because the cost and expense of such legal action or settlement would
substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to Employee
hereunder. Accordingly, if following a Change in Control it should appear to
Employee that the Corporation has failed to comply with any of its obligations
under this Agreement or in the event that the Corporation or any other person
takes any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes
any litigation or other legal action designed to deny, diminish or to recover
from Employee the benefits entitled to be provided to the Employee hereunder,
and that Employee has complied with all of his obligations under this Agreement,
the Corporation


                                      -7-
<PAGE>
irrevocably authorizes Employee from time to time to retain counsel of his
choice, at the expense of the Corporation as provided in this Section 7, to
represent Employee in connection with the initiation or defense of any
litigation or other legal action, whether such action is by or against the
Corporation or any director, officer, shareholder, or other person affiliated
with the Corporation, in any jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any existing or prior
attorney-client relationship between the Corporation and such counsel, the
Corporation irrevocably consents to Employee entering into an attorney-client
relationship with such counsel, and in that connection the Corporation and
Employee agree that a confidential relationship shall exist between Employee and
such counsel. The reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected from time to
time by Employee as hereinabove provided shall be paid or reimbursed to Employee
by the Corporation on a regular, periodic basis upon presentation by Employee of
a statement or statements prepared by such counsel in accordance with its
customary practices, up to a maximum aggregate amount of One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($100,000). Any legal expenses incurred by the Corporation by reason of
any dispute between the parties as to enforceability of or the terms contained
in this Agreement as provided by this Section 7, notwithstanding the outcome of
any such dispute, shall be the sole responsibility of the Corporation, and the
Corporation shall not take any action to seek reimbursement from Employee for
such expenses. Notwithstanding any limitation contained in this Section 7 to the
contrary, Employee shall be entitled to payment or reimbursement of legal
expenses in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) if the expenses
were incurred as a result of a dispute under this Agreement in which Employee
obtains a final judgment in his favor from a court of competent jurisdiction or
his claim is settled by the Corporation prior to the rendering of a judgment by
such a court.

            8. Employee is not required to mitigate the amount of benefit
payments to be made by the Corporation pursuant to this Agreement by seeking
other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any benefit payments
provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by Employee
as a result of employment by another employer or which might have been earned by
Employee had Employee sought such employment, after the date of termination of
his employment with the Corporation or otherwise.

            9. In order to induce the Corporation to enter into this Agreement,
Employee hereby agrees as follows:

            (A) He agrees that his employment with the Corporation is terminable
      at will by the Corporation and that this Agreement does not alter that
      relationship in any way.

            (B) He will keep confidential and not improperly divulge for the
      benefit of any other party any of the Corporation's confidential
      information and business secrets including, but not limited to,
      confidential information and business secrets relating to such matters as
      the Corporation's finances and operations. All of the Corporation's
      confidential information and business secrets shall be the sole and
      exclusive property of the Corporation.


                                      -8-
<PAGE>
            (C) For a period of two years after Employee's employment with the
      Corporation ceases, Employee shall not either on his own account or for
      any other person, firm or company solicit or endeavor to cause any
      employee of the Corporation to leave his employment or to induce or
      attempt to induce any such employee to breach any employment agreement
      with the Corporation.

In the event of a breach or threatened breach by Employee of the provisions of
this Section 9, the Corporation shall be entitled to an injunction restraining
Employee from committing or continuing such breach. Nothing herein contained
shall be construed as prohibiting the Corporation from pursuing any other
remedies available to it for such breach or threatened breach including the
recovery of damages from Employee. The covenants of this Section 9 shall run not
only in favor of the Corporation and its successors and assigns, but also in
favor of its subsidiaries and their respective successors and assigns and shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

            10. The Corporation shall require any successor (whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Corporation, by agreement
in form and substance satisfactory to Employee, to expressly assume and agree to
perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the
Corporation would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken
place. Failure of the Corporation to obtain such agreement prior to the
effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and
shall entitle Employee to compensation from the Corporation in the same amount
and on the same terms as Employee would be entitled hereunder if he were to
terminate his employment pursuant to Section 4 hereof, except that for purposes
of implementing the foregoing, the date on which succession becomes effective
shall be deemed the date of termination of Employee's employment with the
Corporation. As used in this Agreement, "Corporation" shall mean the Corporation
as hereinbefore defined and any successor to the business or assets of it as
aforesaid which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section
10 or which otherwise becomes bound by all of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement by operation of law.

            11. Should Employee die while any amounts are payable to him
hereunder, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
Employee's executors, administrators, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees
and all amounts payable hereunder shall be paid in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement to Employee's devisee, legatee or other designee or if there be
no such designee, to his estate.

            12. For purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other
communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be deemed to
have been given when delivered or mailed by United States registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

            If to Employee:

                  Charles A. Caswell
