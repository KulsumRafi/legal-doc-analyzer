<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1. Purpose U.S. Bancorp&#146;s (the &#147;Corporation&#146;s&#148;) 2001 Employee
Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;), has the following purposes: (1)&nbsp;to help
employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, &#147;U.S.
Bancorp&#148;) purchase the Corporation&#146;s stock and benefit from U.S. Bancorp&#146;s
long-term growth; (2)&nbsp;to create common interests between U.S. Bancorp employees
and the Corporation&#146;s shareholders; and (3)&nbsp;to help U.S. Bancorp attract,
retain and motivate experienced, capable employees. The Plan achieves these
goals by granting non-qualified stock options to U.S. Bancorp employees.
Non-qualified stock options do not qualify for favorable tax treatment under
Internal Revenue Code S 422.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;2. Available Shares for Options. The aggregate number of shares
of the Corporation&#146;s Common Stock (&#147;Common Stock&#148;) which may be issued and sold
pursuant to options granted under the Plan shall not exceed 11,600,000 shares,
subject to adjustment or substitution as provided in Section&nbsp;13 of this Plan,
which shares may be either authorized but unissued or treasury shares.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3. Plan Administration. A Committee (the &#147;Committee&#148;) of not
less than three members selected by the Corporation&#146;s Human Resources
Department and responsible to the Compensation Committee of the Corporation&#146;s
Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) shall be responsible for administering the
Plan, including determining all matters relating to the exercise of options.
The Committee members shall serve at the will of the Compensation Committee of
the Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors and shall serve terms of indefinite
duration. The Committee shall have all powers necessary to allow it properly
to carry out its duties under the Plan. The Committee shall have conferred
upon it such other and further specified duties, power, authority and
discretion as are contemplated by the Plan either expressly or by necessary
implication. The Committee may appoint agents, who need not be members of the
Committee, as it deems reasonable and necessary to effectively perform its
duties, and may delegate to such agents such powers and duties, whether
ministerial or discretionary, as the Committee in its sole discretion may deem
expedient or appropriate. The decision of the Committee upon all matters
within the scope of its authority shall be final and conclusive on all persons,
except to the extent otherwise provided by law. In the alternative, any
authority assigned by this Plan to the Committee may be exercised by either of
the Board of Directors of the Corporation or its Compensation Committee.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;4. Eligibility. Options may be granted to any Eligible Employee.
An Eligible Employee is any full or part-time employee who is actively
employed by U.S. Bancorp on the date of an option grant. The Committee&#146;s shall
have final authority to determine an Eligible Employee. An employee who on a
grant date is on an authorized short-term leave of absence from U.S. Bancorp,
including, without limitation, a leave of absence due to a short-term
disability, shall be considered an Eligible Employee for purposes of this plan.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as specifically determined by the Committee, an Eligible Employee
shall not include (i)&nbsp;any person who is employed on a seasonal or temporary
basis; (ii)&nbsp;any employee who is entitled to receive benefits under a long-term
disability plan maintained by U.S. Bancorp and (iii)&nbsp;individuals eligible to
participate in any of the Corporation&#146;s Executive Stock Incentive Plans or in
Piper Jaffray&#146;s annual option plan.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;5. Granting of Options. The Committee may from time to time, in
its discretion and subject to the provisions of the Plan, grant options on a
grant date (the &#147;Grant Date&#148;) to any or all employees who are Eligible
Employees on the Grant Date. The Committee shall have final authority to
determine the number of shares to be covered by employees&#146; options and the
decision of the Committee shall be final.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;6. Option Exercise Price. The exercise price for the shares of
Common Stock covered by options issued pursuant to this Plan shall be the &#147;fair
market value&#148; on the applicable Grant Date as determined by the Committee.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;7. Term of Options. All options shall have a term of ten (10)
years from the applicable Grant Date. In the event an option is not exercised
prior to the expiration of ten years from the applicable Grant Date, the option
shall lapse and all rights of the option holder shall terminate.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;10. Tax Effects of Plan Participation. Employees may be subject
to income, capital gains, and/or other federal, state and/or local taxes as a
result of exercising options issued pursuant to the Plan. Employees may wish
to consult their tax advisor before exercising options issued pursuant to the
Plan.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;11. Nontransferability. No option shall be transferable by an
option holder. During an option holder&#146;s lifetime, the options shall be
exercisable only by the option holder, provided that in the event an option
holder is incapacitated and unable to exercise such option holder&#146;s options,
such option holder&#146;s legal guardian or legal representative whom the Committee
deems appropriate based on all applicable facts and circumstances may exercise
such option holder&#146;s options in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. In

transferable pursuant to the option holder&#146;s will or by the laws of descent and
distribution and may thereafter be exercised by the transferee(s) as provided
in Sections&nbsp;8 and 9. Any purported transfer of any option shall be null and
void except as otherwise provided by this Section&nbsp;11.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;12. No Rights. An option holder shall have no rights or
interests in any option except as set forth in the Plan. The Plan does not
confer upon any person any right with respect to the continuation of employment
by U.S. Bancorp, nor does it limit in any way the right of U.S. Bancorp to
terminate employment at any time. An option holder shall have no rights as a
shareholder of U.S. Bancorp with respect to the shares of Common Stock covered
by options except to the extent that shares are issued to such option holder
upon the due exercise of options.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;13. Adjustment Upon Changes In Capitalization. In the event that
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares of stock or other securities of U.S. Bancorp
or any other corporation, whether through reorganization, recapitalization,
stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, reclassification of the
Common Stock, merger or consolidation, then the option rights (as to the number
and kind of shares and the option exercise price) shall be appropriately
adjusted by the Committee. Comparable adjustments shall be made for each
subsequent such change or exchange of Common Stock or any stock or other
securities into which such Common Stock shall have been changed or exchanged.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;14. Amendment, Modification and Termination of the Plan. The
Board of Directors of the Corporation may terminate, amend or modify the Plan
any time, provided that no amendment, modification or termination of the Plan
shall in any manner adversely affect an option outstanding under the Plan
without the consent of the option holder, or such option holder&#146;s successors as
described in Section11.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;15. Additional Conditions of the Options. If at any time the
Committee shall determine that listing, registration or qualification of the
Common Shares covered by an option pursuant to any securities exchange rule or
under any state or federal law or the consent or the approval of any
governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of or in
connection with the purchase of the shares of Common Stock under the option,
the option may not be exercised unless and until such listing, registration,
qualification, consent or approval shall have been obtained free of any
conditions not acceptable to the Committee. Any person exercising an option
shall make such representations and agreements and furnish such information as
the Committee may request to assure compliance with the foregoing or any other
applicable legal requirements.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;16. Effective Date of the Plan. The Plan shall become effective
on February&nbsp;27, 2001.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;17. Governing Law. This Plan shall be construed under and
governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;18. Change of Control. In the event the Corporation shall engage
in a Change of Control as defined in this Section&nbsp;18, and if the employment of
an Eligible Employee is terminated by the Corporation, immediately following
such Change of Control due to business needs resulting from the Change of
Control and not for documented performance or conduct reasons, consistent with
written policies of the Corporation all such person&#146;s outstanding options
granted under the Plan shall automatically become fully vested and exercisable
as of the date of such termination notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to
the contrary. The surviving corporation or entity shall continue to be bound
by the terms and provisions of the Plan and all unexercised options shall
