who is on a leave of absence approved by his or her Employer) or who ceased

                          Earnings on Account Balances
                          ----------------------------

     Section 6.1. Permitted Investments. Upon his or her election to participate
                  ---------------------
in the Plan, each Participant shall designate, in such manner as may be
prescribed by the Committee, the Permitted Investments in which such
Participant's Account shall be deemed to be invested. Such Participant's Account
shall be deemed to be invested as specified by the Participant either (a) on the
day following the later of (i) the date such Participant makes such designation,
or (ii) the date such credit is made to such Participant's Account, or (b) on
such other dates as may be reasonably determined by the Committee. A Participant
may elect to change his or her deemed investment election as frequently as may
be permitted by the Committee, and in any event at least once each Plan Year;
provided, however, that a Participant shall not be permitted to change a deemed
investment election with respect to any portion of his or her Account deemed
invested in shares of ServiceMaster common stock.

     Section 6.2. Earnings. Each Participant's Account shall be credited with
                  --------
deemed earnings, or reduced by deemed losses, equal to the earnings or losses
that would have been realized or paid if assets in an amount equal to the
balance of such Account were actually invested among the Permitted Investments
selected by the Participant in accordance with Section 6.1. Although
ServiceMaster or an Employer might actually invest its assets according to the
Participant's election, it is not required to do so nor to even set aside any
assets to provide for payments hereunder. ServiceMaster may promulgate separate
accounting and administrative rules to facilitate the deemed investment in a
Permitted Investment.

     Section 6.3. Committee May Disapprove Permitted Investments.
                  ----------------------------------------------
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may disapprove any Permitted
Investment designated by a Participant or deemed to be held in such
Participant's Account. If the disapproved Permitted Investment has been
designated by the Participant but is not then deemed to be held in such
Participant's Account, the Committee shall promptly notify the Participant in
writing of the decision to disapprove the Permitted Investment and shall afford
the Participant an opportunity to designate one or more substitute Permitted


                                       6
<PAGE>

Investments   satisfactory  to  the  Committee.  If  the  disapproved  Permitted
Investment  is deemed to be held in the  Participant's  Account,  the  Committee
shall promptly  notify the  Participant in writing of the decision to disapprove
the Permitted  Investment  and shall afford the  Participant  an  opportunity to
dispose of the  disapproved  Permitted  Investment  and to  reinvest  the deemed
proceeds therefrom in one or more substitute Permitted Investments  satisfactory
to the Committee.  If the Participant  does not submit an election to dispose of
the disapproved Permitted Investment within ten days after notice of disapproval
by the Committee,  the Committee may thereafter treat the disapproved  Permitted
Investment  as having been sold on a date  selected by the  Committee  and shall
make appropriate  charges and credits to the Account.  Neither the Committee nor
the Employer shall have any liability to the  Participant for losses or expenses
allocated to such Account by reason of a decision by the Committee to disapprove
a Permitted Investment.

     Section 6.4. Elections. All elections to be made by a Participant pursuant
                  ---------
to this Article VI shall be made only by such Participant, provided that if such
Participant dies before such Participant's entire Account Balance is
distributed, or if the Committee determines that such Participant is legally
incompetent or otherwise incapable of managing such Participant's own affairs,
the Committee shall have the authority to (a) itself make the elections pursuant
to Section 6.1 on behalf of such Participant, or (b) designate such
Participant's designated Beneficiary, legal representative or some near relative
of such Participant to make the elections pursuant to Section 6.1 on behalf of
such Participant.

     Section 6.5. Actual Investment Not Required. An Employer need not actually
                  ------------------------------
make any Permitted Investment. If an Employer should from time to time make any
investment similar to a Permitted Investment, such investment shall be solely
for the Employer's own account and the Participant shall have no right, title or
interest therein. Accordingly, each Participant is solely an unsecured creditor
of the Employer with respect to his or her Account.

     Section 6.6. Investment Notices. Statements describing the performance of
                  ------------------
the Permitted Investments will be provided to the Participants no less
frequently than semi-annually.

     Section 6.7. Crediting of Deferrals, Contributions and Earnings. The
                  --------------------------------------------------
Committee shall credit all Deferrals to a Participant's Account as soon as
administratively practicable after the date on which the Deferrals would have
been paid to the Participant if the Participant had not made a Deferral election
under Article IV of the Plan. Employer Matching Contributions shall be credited
to a Participant's Account on the date specified by the Board. Earnings and
losses shall be credited to the Participant's Account in accordance with Section
6.2.

     Section 7.1. Establishment of Trust. The Board may, in its sole discretion,
                  ----------------------
establish a grantor trust, as described under Section 671 of the Code, which is
subject to the claims of the general creditors of ServiceMaster, for the purpose
of accumulating assets to provide for the obligations hereunder. The
establishment of such a trust shall not affect each Employer's liability to pay
benefits hereunder except that the Employer's liability shall be offset by any
payments actually made to a Participant under such a trust. In the event such a
trust is established, the amount to be contributed shall be determined by the
Board and the investment of such assets shall be in accordance with the trust
document.

     Section 7.2. Status of Trust. Participants shall have no direct or secured
                  ---------------
claim in any asset of the trust or in specific assets of the Employer or the
ServiceMaster Companies and will have the status of general unsecured creditors
of the Employer for any amounts due under the Plan. Trust assets and income
shall be subject to the claims of ServiceMaster's creditors.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                        Distribution of Account Balances
                        --------------------------------

     Section 8.1. Timing. (a) Payment of Deferral Accounts. Except as otherwise
                  ------
specifically provided herein, the Deferrals credited to a Participant's Deferral
Account for a Plan Year, adjusted by any earnings or losses thereon, shall be
paid, or shall commence to be paid, to such Participant as soon as
administratively practicable after the Valuation Date coincident with, or next
following, the payment date elected by the Participant on such Participant's
Deferral election form submitted to the Committee for such year. The payment
date elected by the Participant may be (i) the date the Participant's employment
with the ServiceMaster Companies terminates or (ii) any other date elected by
the Participant which is more than three years after the last day of the Plan
Year for which the Deferrals are credited to the Participant's Deferral Account
and not later than the date on which the Participant will attain age 70 1/2. The
Participant must submit to the Committee a separate election described in
Section 3.2 for each Plan Year which specifies a deferral amount and payment
date for all amounts credited to such Participant's Deferral Account for such
Plan Year.

                (b) Payment of Employer Matching Contribution Accounts. Except
as otherwise specifically provided herein, the vested portion of the Employer
Matching Contributions credited to a Participant's Employer Matching
Contributions Account for a Plan Year, adjusted by any earnings or losses
thereon, shall be paid, or shall commence to be paid, to such Participant on or
as soon as administratively practicable after the later to occur of (i) the date
on which the Deferrals credited to the Participant's Account for the same Plan
Year are paid or commence to be paid or (ii) the Valuation Date coincident with
or next following the termination of such Participant's employment with the


                                       8
<PAGE>

ServiceMaster Companies. Any amount credited to a Participant's Employer
Matching Contributions Account that is not vested as of the date of such
Participant's termination of employment with the ServiceMaster Companies shall
thereupon be forfeited, and shall not thereafter be reallocated to the Accounts
of any other Participants.

                  (c) Cash-Out of Small Accounts. Notwithstanding the payment
date elected by a Participant, the vested balance of such Participant's Account
shall be paid to such Participant in a lump sum as soon as administratively
practicable after the Valuation Date coincident with, or next following, the
termination of such Participant's employment with the ServiceMaster Companies if
the amount of such vested Account Balance as of such Valuation Date (A) is less
than $25,000 and such Participant's employment terminated prior to January 1,
2003, or (B) is less than $50,000 and such Participant's employment terminated
on or after January 1, 2003. If the vested balance of a Participant's Account
shall be less than $10,000 as of any Valuation Date following the termination of
such Participant's employment with the ServiceMaster Companies, such Account
shall be paid to such Participant in a lump sum as soon as administratively
practicable after such Valuation Date.

                  (d) Delayed Payment Date. Notwithstanding any payment date
elected by a Participant, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, defer the
payment of all or any portion of a Participant's Account to the extent the
Committee determines that the payment of such amount at the time elected by the
Participant would cause the Participant's Employer to be unable to deduct any
portion of the Participant's Compensation as a result of the limitations
prescribed by Section 162(m) of the Code.

     Section 8.2. Manner of Payment. Except as provided in Section 8.1(c), each
                  -----------------
Participant or Beneficiary shall receive payment of the amount credited to the
Participant's Account either in a single lump sum or in annual installments over
a period of not less than two and not more than ten years, as elected by the
Participant upon his or her commencement of participation in the Plan. A
Participant may change a previously elected method of payment by filing a new
election form with the Committee at least one year prior to the date on which
payments are scheduled to be made or to commence. The distribution of a
Participant's Account shall be paid in cash by the Employer of the Participant
or, to the extent the Participant has elected that all or a portion of the
credits to his or her Account be deemed invested in shares of ServiceMaster
common stock, the Participant shall receive such distribution in shares of
ServiceMaster common stock.

     Section 8.3. Hardship Payments. In the event of a Financial Hardship, as
                  -----------------
hereinafter defined, the Participant may file a written request with the
Committee to receive all or any portion of the vested balance of such
Participant's Account in an immediate lump sum payment. A Participant's written
request for such a payment shall describe the circumstances which the
Participant believes justify the payment and an estimate of the amount necessary
to eliminate the Financial Hardship. The Committee will have discretion to grant
or deny any such request. A payment shall be considered on account of "Financial
Hardship" if it is necessary in light of the Participant's immediate and heavy
financial need as described in (A) below and it is necessary to satisfy such
financial need, as described in (B) below.


                                       9
<PAGE>

                  (A) A payment will be on account of immediate and heavy
         financial need only if it is on account of (i) medical expenses
         described in Section 213(d) of the Code incurred by the Participant or
         the Participant's spouse or dependents; (ii) purchase (excluding
         mortgage payments) of a principal residence for the Participant; (iii)
         payment of tuition and related educational fees for the next twelve
         months of post-secondary education for the Participant or the
         Participant's spouse, children or dependents; or (iv) the need to
         prevent the eviction of the Participant from the Participant's
         principal residence or the foreclosure on the mortgage of the
         Participant's principal residence.

                  (B) A payment will be necessary to satisfy the financial need
         described in (A) above only if (i) the payment does not exceed the
         amount necessary to meet such financial need (including amounts
         necessary to pay any federal, state or local income taxes or penalties
         reasonably anticipated to result from the payment); and (ii) the
         Participant has obtained all distributions, other than hardship
         withdrawals, and all nontaxable loans available under all other plans
         maintained by the ServiceMaster Companies.

Any payment from a Participant's Account on account of Financial Hardship shall
be deemed to cancel any Deferral election of the Participant then in effect and,
unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Participant shall be suspended
from making further Deferral elections under the Plan during the remainder of
the Plan Year in which such payment is made and the Plan Year immediately
thereafter.

     Section 8.4. Accelerated Payments. A Participant may at any time, but not
                  --------------------
more than once during any five-year period, elect to receive an immediate lump
sum payment equal to the vested amount or amounts credited to such Participant's
Account for one or more Plan Years, adjusted by earnings or losses thereon,
reduced by a penalty equal to 10% of the amount paid pursuant to such election;
provided, however, that amounts credited to a Participant's Employer Matching
Contributions Account shall not be payable pursuant to any such election made
prior to the termination of the Participant's employment with the ServiceMaster
Companies. The penalty described herein shall be permanently forfeited and shall
not be paid to, or in respect of, the Participant or his or her Beneficiary or
be reallocated to the Accounts of any other Participants. An election to receive
an immediate lump sum payment pursuant to this Section 8.4 shall be deemed to
cancel any Deferral election of the Participant then in effect and, unless
otherwise determined by the Committee, the Participant shall be suspended from
making further Deferral elections under the Plan during the remainder of the
Plan Year in which such payment is made and the Plan Year immediately
thereafter.

     Section 8.5. Distributions to Minor and Incompetent Persons. If a payment
                  ----------------------------------------------
is to be made to a minor or to an individual who, in the opinion of the
Committee, is unable to manage his or her financial affairs by reason of illness
or mental incompetency, such distribution may be made to or for the benefit of
any such individual in such of the following ways as the Committee shall direct:
(a) directly to any such minor individual if, in the opinion of the Committee,
he or she is able to manage his or her financial affairs, (b) to the legal
representative of any such individual, (c) to a custodian under a


                                       10
<PAGE>

Uniform Gifts to Minors Act for any such minor individual, or (d) to some near
relative of any such individual to be used for the latter's benefit. Neither the
Committee nor any Employer shall be required to see to the application by any
third party of any payment made to or for the benefit of a Participant or
Beneficiary pursuant to this Section.

     Section 8.6. Involuntary Distributions. Notwithstanding the foregoing
                  -------------------------
provisions of this Article VIII, the Committee may on its own initiative
authorize an Employer to distribute to any Participant (or to a designated
Beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) all or any portion of the
Participant's Account Balance in the event (i) there is a change in tax law, a
published ruling or similar announcement issued by the Internal Revenue Service,
a regulation issued by the Secretary of Treasury, a decision by a court of
competent jurisdiction involving a Participant or a Beneficiary, or a closing
agreement made under Section 7121 of the Code that is approved by the Internal
Revenue Service and involves a Participant, and the Committee determines that a
Participant has or will recognize income for Federal income tax purposes with
respect to amounts deferred under the Plan prior to the time such amounts would
otherwise be paid to the Participant or (ii) the corporation, entity or division
with which the Participant is employed is sold, divested or liquidated.

     Section 8.7. Designation of Beneficiaries. Each Participant may name any
                  ----------------------------
person (who may be named concurrently, contingently or successively) to whom the
Participant's Account Balance under the Plan is to be paid if the Participant
dies before the Account Balance is fully distributed. Each such Beneficiary
designation will revoke all prior designations by the Participant, shall not
require the consent of any previously named Beneficiary, shall be in a form
prescribed by the Committee and will be effective only when filed with the
Committee during the Participant's lifetime. If a Participant fails to designate
a Beneficiary before such Participant's death, as provided above, or if the
Beneficiary designated by a Participant dies before the date of the
Participant's death or before complete payment of the Participant's Account
Balance, the Committee shall pay the Participant's Account Balance to the
Participant's estate in one lump sum.

     Section 8.8. Inability to Locate Participant or Beneficiary. If the
                  ----------------------------------------------
Committee is unable to make payment of a Participant's Account to such
Participant or his or her Beneficiary because the identity and/or whereabouts of
such person cannot be ascertained notwithstanding the mailing of notice to any
last known address or addresses, then such Participant's Account shall be
forfeited. If the Participant or Beneficiary later makes a claim for a benefit
under the Plan, and that claim for benefit is granted, the amount in the
Participant's Account that was treated as a forfeiture shall be paid to the
Participant or Beneficiary without regard to any subsequent gain or loss.

     Section 8.9. Claims Procedure. (a) Filing of Claim. If any Participant or
                  ----------------
Beneficiary believes he or she is entitled to benefits under the Plan in an
amount greater than those which he or she is receiving or has received, the
Participant or Beneficiary (or his or her duly authorized representative) may
file a claim with a subcommittee designated by the Committee (the "Claim Review
Subcommittee"). Such a claim shall be in writing and state the nature of the
claim, the facts supporting the claim, the amount claimed and the address of the
claimant.


                                       11
<PAGE>

                  (b) Initial Review of Claim. The Claim Review Subcommittee
shall review the claim and, unless special circumstances require an extension of
time, within 90 days after receipt of the claim give written or electronic
notice to the claimant of its decision with respect to the claim. If special
circumstances require an extension of time, the claimant shall be so advised in
writing within the initial 90-day period and in no event shall such an extension
exceed 90 days. The notice of the decision of the Claim Review Subcommittee with
respect to the claim shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by
the claimant and, if the claim is wholly or partially denied, shall set forth
the specific reasons for the denial, specific references to the pertinent Plan
provisions on which the denial is based, a description of any additional
material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an
explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and an explanation
of the appeals procedure under the Plan and the time limits applicable to such
procedure (including a statement of the claimant's right to bring a civil action
under Section 502(a) of ERISA following the final first denial of a claim).

                  (c) Appeal of Claim Denial. The claimant (or his or her duly
authorized representative) may request a review of the denial by filing with the
full Committee a written request for such review within 60 days after notice of
the denial has been received by the claimant. Within the same 60-day period, the
claimant may submit to the Committee written comments, documents, records and
other information relating to the claim. Upon request and free of charge, the
claimant also may have reasonable access to, and copies of, documents, records
and other information relevant to the claim.

                  (d) Review of Claim Denial. If a request for review is so
filed, review of the denial shall be made by the Committee and the claimant
shall be given written or electronic notice of the Committee's final decision
within 60 days after receipt of such request, unless special circumstances
require an extension of time.
  If special circumstances require an extension of time, the claimant shall be
so advised in writing within the initial 60-day period and in no event shall
such an extension exceed 60 days. If the appeal of the claim is wholly or
partially denied, the notice of the Committee's final decision shall include
specific reasons for the decision, specific references to the pertinent Plan
provisions on which the decision is based and a statement that the claimant is
entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and
copies of, all relevant documents, records and information. The notice shall be
written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall notify
the claimant of his or her right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of
ERISA.

Plan from time to time, provided that no such amendment shall reduce the amount

if the Participant is deceased, his or her Beneficiary. The Plan shall be
amended by resolutions duly adopted by the Board or, to the extent the amendment
(i) is required or deemed advisable as a

Participant or, if the Participant is deceased, his or her Beneficiary.

                                   ARTICLE X

                               General Provisions

designated Beneficiary shall sign such documents as ServiceMaster may require in
order to effect the purposes of this subsection.

     Section 10.3. Number and Headings. Wherever any words are used herein in
                   -------------------
