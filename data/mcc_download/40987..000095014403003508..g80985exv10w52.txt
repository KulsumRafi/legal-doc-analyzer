                                  AMENDMENT TO
                              GENUINE PARTS COMPANY
                      DIRECTORS' DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

         This Amendment (the "Amendment") to the Genuine Parts Company
Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan") is made and executed this 14
day of November, 2002.

         Pursuant to a resolution of the Compensation and Nominating Committee
of the Company, in accordance with Section 7.01 of the Plan, the Plan is hereby
amended as follows:

         1.       SECTION  4.05(c) STOCK PAYMENT. One sentence shall be added
at the end of Section 4.05(c), so that Section 4.05(c), as amended, shall read
as follows:

         "If a participant so designates as provided in Section 4.04(i),
         distributions from the Stock Account may be distributed to the
         Participant in the form of Common Stock rather than cash. The shares of
         Common Stock distributable to Directors under the Plan must be
         previously issued and repurchased shares and may not be original issue
         shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum number of shares of
         Common Stock that may be distributed under the Plan shall be 1,000,000,
         and once such limit has been reached, all further distributions from
         Participants' Stock Accounts shall be made only in cash."

         2.       EFFECT OF AMENDMENT. As modified hereby, the provisions of
the Plan, as heretofore amended, shall remain in full force and effect.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Amendment to be duly
executed as of the date first above written.

                                  GENUINE PARTS COMPANY
