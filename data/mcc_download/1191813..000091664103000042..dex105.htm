contracts hereunder) performing the services provided for in this Agreement in connection with the sale of a Property, Owner shall pay to Agent the following: a real estate commission in connection with the sale of a Property in an amount equal to
two percent (2%) of the gross sales price of the Property, if, but only if, the sales price of the Property exceeds the sum of (A) the Company&#146;s cost for the Property (consisting of the original purchase price plus all capitalized costs and
expenditures connected with the Property), without any reduction for depreciation, and (B) ten percent (10%) of such cost. If the sales price of the Property does not equal such amount, Agent shall be entitled only to payment by the Company of its
&#147;direct costs&#148; incurred in marketing such property (where &#147;direct costs&#148; refers to a reasonable allocation of all costs, [including salaries of personnel, overhead and utilities]), allocable to services in marketing such
property. If the two percent (2%) real estate commission is payable in connection with sale of a Property, Agent shall not also be paid the reimbursement of its &#147;direct costs&#148; as described in the preceding sentence. If the person from whom
Owner purchases or to whom Owner sells a Property pays any fee to Agent, such amount shall decrease the amount of Owner&#146;s obligation to Agent. Furthermore, Agent shall not be entitled to any real estate commission in connection with a sale of a
Property by Owner to Agent or any Affiliate of Agent (where &#147;Affiliate&#148; has the meaning specified in the Prospectus of Owner), but Agent will, in such case, be entitled to payment by Owner of its direct costs in such regard. The fees and
expenses provided for herein shall be payable if Owner sells a property, sells shares in Owner, effects a merger of Owner with another entity, or undertakes any other transaction, the purpose or effect of which is, in essence, to dispose of some or
all Properties. In any case other than an actual sale of Properties, Owner and Agent shall in good faith agree upon an allocation of purchase price to each Property which is effectively disposed of. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT
