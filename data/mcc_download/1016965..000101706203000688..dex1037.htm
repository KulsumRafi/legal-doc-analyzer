all of the terms, covenants and conditions set forth in this Lease. Unless otherwise provided herein, any statement of size set forth in this Lease, or that may have been used in calculating rental, is an approximation which the Parties agree is

face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Condition.</b> Lessor shall deliver the Premises to Lessee broom clean and free of debris on the Commencement Date or the Early
Possession Date, whichever first occurs (<b>&#147;Start Date&#148;</b>), and, so long as the required service contracts described in Paragraph 7.1(b) below are obtained by Lessee within thirty (30) days following the Start Date, warrants that the
existing electrical, plumbing, fire sprinkler, lighting, heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems (&#147;HVAC&#148;), loading doors, if any, and all other such elements in the Premises, other than those constructed by Lessee, shall be in
good operating condition on said date and that the structural elements of the roof, bearing walls and foundation of any buildings on the Premises (the<b> &#147;Building&#148;</b>) shall be free of material defects. If a non-compliance with said
warranty exists as of the Start Date, Lessor shall, as Lessor&#146;s sole obligation with respect to such matter, except as otherwise provided in this Lease, promptly after receipt of written notice from Lessee setting forth with specificity the
nature and extent of such noncompliance, rectify same at Lessor&#146;s expense. If, after the Start Date, Lessee does not give Lessor written notice of any noncompliance with this warranty&#160; within: (i) one year as to the surface of the roof and
the structural portions of the roof, foundations and bearing walls, (ii) six (6) months as to the HVACsystems, (iii) thirty (30) days as to the remaining systems and other elements of the Building, correction of such noncompliance shall be the
obligation of Lessee at Lessee&#146;s sole cost and expense.<br> </font> <font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Compliance.</b> Lessor warrants that the
improvements on the Premises comply with all applicable laws, covenants or restrictions of record, building codes, regulations and ordinances (<b>&#147;Applicable Requirements&#148;</b>) in effect on the Start Date. Said warranty does not apply to
the use to which Lessee will put the Premises or to any Alterations or Utility Installations (as defined in Paragraph 7.3(a)) made or to be made by Lessee. NOTE: Lessee is responsible for determining whether or not the zoning is appropriate for
Lessee&#146;s intended use, and acknowledges that past uses of the Premises may no longer be allowed, If the Premises do not comply with said warranty, Lessor shall, except as otherwise provided, promptly after receipt of written notice from Lessee
setting forth with specificity the nature and extent of such noncompliance, rectify the same at Lessor&#146;s expense. If Lessee does not give Lessor written notice of a noncompliance with this warranty within six (6) months following the Start
Date, correction of that noncompliance shall be the obligation of Lessee at Lessee&#146;s sole cost and expense. If the Applicable Requirements are hereafter changed (as opposed to being in existence at the Start Date which is addressed in Paragraph
6.2(a) below) so as to require during the term of this Lease the construction of an addition to or an alteration of the Building, the remediation of any Hazardous Substance, or the reinforcement or other physical modification of the Building

Capital Expenditures are required as a result of the specific and unique use of the Premises by Lessee as compared with uses by tenants in general, Lessee shall be fully responsible for the cost thereof, provided, however that if such Capital
Expenditure is required during the last two (2) years of this Lease and the cost thereof exceeds six (6) months&#146; Base Rent, Lessee may instead terminate this Lease unless Lessor notifies Lessee, in writing, within ten (10) days after receipt of
Lessee&#146;s termination notice that Lessor has elected to pay the difference between the actual cost thereof and the amount equal to six (6) months&#146; Base Rent. If Lessee elects termination, Lessee shall immediately cease the use of the
Premises which requires such Capital Expenditure and deliver to Lessor written notice specifying a termination date at least ninety (90) days thereafter. Such termination date shall, however, in no event be earlier than the last day that Lessee
could legally utilize the Premises without commencing such Capital Expenditure.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> <font size=2
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If such Capital Expenditure is not the result of the specific and unique use of the Premises by Lessee (such as, governmentally mandated seismic modifications), then Lessor and Lessee
shall allocate the obligation to pay for such costs pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 7.1(c); provided, however, that if such Capital Expenditure is required during the last two years of this Lease or if Lessor reasonably determines that it is
not economically feasible to pay its share thereof, Lessor shall have the option to terminate this Lease upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to Lessee unless Lessee notifies Lessor, In writing, within ten (10) days after receipt of
Lessor&#146;s termination notice that Lessee will pay for such Capital Expenditure, If Lessor does not elect to terminate, and fails to tender its share of any such Capital Expenditure, Lessee may advance such funds and deduct same, with interest,
from Rent until Lessor&#146;s share of such costs have been fully paid. If Lessee is unable to finance Lessor&#146;s share, or if the balance of the Rent due and payable for the remainder of this Lease is not sufficient to fully reimburse Lessee on
an offset basis, Lessee shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon thirty (30) days written notice to Lessor.</font> <br> <font size=2
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the above, the provisions concerning Capital Expenditures are intended to
apply only to non-voluntary, unexpected, and new Applicable Requirements. If the Capital Expenditures are instead triggered by Lessee as a result of an actual or proposed change in use, change in intensity of use, or modification to the Premises
then, and in that event, Lessee shall be fully responsible for the cost thereof, and Lessee shall not have any right to terminate this Lease.<br> </font><font size=2
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Acknowledgements.</b>&#160; Lessee acknowledges that: (a) it has been advised by Lessor and/or Brokers to satisfy itself with
respect to the condition of the Premises (including but not limited to the electrical, HVAC and fire sprinkler systems, security, environmental aspects, and compliance with Applicable Requirements), and their suitability for Lessee&#146;s intended
use; (b) Lessee has made such investigation as it deems necessary with reference to such matters and assumes all responsibility therefor as the same relate to its occupancy of the Premises; and (c) neither Lessor, Lessor&#146;s agents, nor any
Broker has made any oral or written representations or warranties with respect to said matters other than as set forth in this Lease.&#160; In addition, Lessor acknowledges that: (a) Broker has made no representations, promises or warranties
concerning Lessee&#146;s ability to honor the Lease or suitability to occupy the Premises; and (b) it is Lessor&#146;s sole responsibility to investigate the financial capability and/or suitability of all proposed tenants.<br> </font> <font size=2
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lessee as Prior Owner/Occupant.</b> The warranties made by Lessor in Paragraph 2 shall be of no force or effect if immediately
prior to the Start Date Lessee was the owner or occupant of the Premises. In such event, Lessee shall be responsible for any necessary corrective work.<br> </font> <font size=2

face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Term.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commencement Date, Expiration Date and Original Term of this Lease are as specified in Paragraph 1.3.<br>
</font><font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Early Possession.</b> If Lessee totally or partially occupies the Premises prior to the Commencement Date, the
obligation to pay Base Rent shall be abated for the period of such early possession. All other terms of this Lease (including, but not limited to, the obligations to pay Real Property Taxes and insurance premiums and to maintain the Premises) shall,
however, be in effect during such period. Any such early possession shall not affect the Expiration Date.<br> </font> <font size=2
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Delay in Possession.</b> Lessor agrees to use its best commercially reasonable efforts to deliver possession of the Premises to
Lessee by the Commencement Date. If, despite said efforts, Lessor is unable to deliver possession as agreed, Lessor shall not be subject to any liability therefor, nor shall such failure affect the validity of this Lease. Lessee shall not, however,
be obligated to pay Rent or perform its other obligations until it receives possession of the Premises.&#160; If possession is not delivered within sixty (60) days after the Commencement Date, Lessee may, at its option, by notice in writing within
ten (10) days after the end of such sixty (60) day period, cancel this Lease, in which event the Parties shall be discharged from all obligations hereunder. If such written notice is not received by Lessor within said ten (10) day period,
Lessee&#146;s right to cancel shall terminate.&#160; Except as otherwise provided, if possession is not tendered to Lessee by the Start Date and Lessee does not terminate this Lease, as aforesaid, any period of rent abatement that Lessee would
otherwise have enjoyed shall run from the date of delivery of possession and continue for a period equal to what Lessee would otherwise have enjoyed under the terms hereof, but minus any days of delay caused by the acts or omissions of Lessee. If
possession of the Premises is not delivered within four (4)months after the Commencement Date, this Lease shall terminate unless other agreements are reached between Lessor and Lessee, in writing.<br> </font><font size=2
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lessee Compliance.</b> Lessor shall not be required to tender possession of the Premises to Lessee until Lessee compiles with its
obligation to provide evidence of insurance (Paragraph 8.5). Pending delivery of such evidence, Lessee shall be required to perform all of its obligations under this Lease from and after the Start Date, including the payment of Rent, notwithstanding
Lessor&#146;s election to withhold possession pending receipt of such evidence of insurance. Further, if Lessee is required to perform any other conditions prior to or concurrent with the Start Date, the Start Date shall occur but Lessor may elect
to withhold possession until such conditions are satisfied.<br> </font> <font size=2 face="Times New Roman"><b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>Rent.<br> </b></font> <font size=2
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rent Defined.</b> All monetary obligations of Lessee to Lessor under the terms of this Lease (except for the Security Deposit) are
deemed to be rent (&#147;Rent&#148;).<br> </font> <font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Payment.</b> Lessee shall cause payment of Rent to be received by
Lessor in lawful money of the United States, without offset or deduction (except as specifically permitted in this Lease), on or before the day on which it is due. Rent for any period during the term hereof which is for less than one (1) full
calendar month shall be prorated based upon the actual number of days of said month. Payment of Rent shall be made to Lessor at its address stated herein or to such other persons or place as Lessor may from time to time designate in writing.
Acceptance of a payment which is less than the amount then due shall not be a waiver of Lessor&#146;s rights to the balance of such Rent, regardless of Lessor&#146;s endorsement of any check so stating.<br> </font><font size=2
face="Times New Roman"><b>5.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Security Deposit.</b> Lessee shall deposit with Lessor upon execution hereof the Security Deposit as security for Lessee&#146;s faithful performance of its obligations
under this Lease. If Lessee fails to pay Rent, or otherwise Defaults under this Lease, Lessor may use, apply or retain all or any portion of said Security Deposit for the payment of any amount due Lessor or to reimburse or compensate Lessor for any
liability, expense, loss or damage which Lessor may suffer or incur by reason thereof.&#160; If Lessor uses or applies all or any portion of said Security Deposit, Lessee shall within ten (10) days after written request therefor deposit monies with
Lessor sufficient to restore said Security Deposit to the full amount required by this Lease. If the Base Rent increases during the term of this Lease, Lessee shall, upon written request from Lessor, deposit additional monies with Lessor so that the
total amount of the Security Deposit shall at all times bear the same proportion to the increased Base Rent as the initial Security Deposit bore to the initial Base Rent. Should the Agreed Use be amended to accommodate a material change in the
business of Lessee or to accommodate a sublessee or assignee, Lessor shall have the right to increase the Security Deposit to the extent necessary, in Lessor&#146;s reasonable judgment, to account for any increased wear and tear that the Premises
may suffer as a result thereof. If a change in control of Lessee occurs during this Lease and following such change the financial condition of Lessee is, in Lessor&#146;s reasonable judgment, significantly reduced, Lessee shall deposit such
additional monies with Lessor as shall be sufficient to cause the Security Deposit to be at a commercially reasonable level based on said change in financial condition. Lessor shall not be required to keep the Security Deposit separate from its
general accounts. Within fourteen (14) days after the expiration or termination of this Lease, if Lessor elects to apply the Security Deposit only to unpaid Rent, and otherwise within thirty (30) days after the Premises have been vacated pursuant to
Paragraph 7.4(c) below, Lessor shall return that portion of the security Deposit not used or applied by Lessor. No part of the Security Deposit shall be considered to be held in trust, to bear interest or to be prepayment for any monies to be paid
by Lessee under this Lease.<br> </font><font size=2 face="Times New Roman"><b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use.<br> </b></font> <font size=2
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Use.</b> Lessee shall use and occupy the Premises only for the Agreed Use, or any other legal use which is reasonably comparable
thereto, and for no other purpose. Lessee shall not use or permit the use of the Premises in a manner that is unlawful, creates damage, waste or a nuisance, or that disturbs owners and/or occupants of, or causes damage to neighboring properties.
Lessor shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any written request for a modification of the Agreed Use, so long as the same will not impair the structural integrity of the improvements on the Premises or the mechanical or electrical
systems therein, is not significantly more burdensome to the Premises. If Lessor elects to withhold consent, Lessor shall within five (5) business days after such request give written notification of same, which notice shall include an explanation
of Lessor&#146;s objections to the change in use.<br> </font> <font size=2 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hazardous Substances.<br> </b></font> <font size=2

Lessor may condition its consent to any Reportable Use upon receiving such additional assurances as Lessor reasonably deems necessary to protect itself, the public, the Premises and/or the environment against damage, contamination, injury and/or
