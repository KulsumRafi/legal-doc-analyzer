currently employed by the Company and has executed an An Amended and Restated Employment Agreement dated March 22, 2002 (the &#147;2002 Agreement&#148;). The Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;) earlier determined that it is in
the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company and seeks to
amend the 2002 Agreement in recognition of the increasingly competitive environment and recent changes in compensation structures for certain executives resulting from amendments to certain remunerative plans of the Company. The Amended and Restated
Graphic Packaging International Corporation Executive Employment Agreement was effective on March 22, 2002 (the &#147;2002 Agreement&#148;). The Board believes that it is imperative to diminish the distraction of the Executive from Company business
because of personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executive&#146;s full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of
Control. This Agreement is intended to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control that will ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied on terms that are
competitive with those of other corporations. This Agreement shall amend and restate in its entirety the 2002 Agreement. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P

amount that after the payment of all taxes (including, without limitation, any interest and penalties on such taxes and the Excise Tax) on the Payment and on the Gross-Up Payment, Executive shall retain an amount equal to the Payment minus all
applicable taxes on the Payment, provided however, that Executive will be entitled to receive a Gross-Up Payment only if the amount of the parachute payments as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code exceeds $50,000 plus 2.99 times the
Executive&#146;s Base Amount as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code, and provided further, that if Executive is not entitled to receive a Gross-Up Payment, the Executive will receive only an amount of the parachute payments that would not
include any excess parachute payments as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code. The intent of the parties is that the Company shall be solely responsible for, and shall pay, any Excise Tax on any Payment and Gross-Up Payment and any income and

Payment as determined pursuant to this Section 10, shall be paid by the Company to the Internal Revenue Service and/or other appropriate taxing authority on Executive&#146;s behalf within five (5) days after receipt of the Accounting Firm&#146;s

failure to disclose or report the Excise Tax on Executive&#146;s federal income tax return will not constitute a substantial understatement of tax or be reasonably likely to result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. Any
determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and Executive in the absence of material mathematical or legal error. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial
