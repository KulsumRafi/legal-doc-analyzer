                        RECONSTITUTED SERVICING AGREEMENT

      THIS RECONSTITUTED SERVICING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), entered into as
of the 1st day of February, 2003, by and between Merrill Lynch Credit
Corporation (the "Seller"), and CENDANT MORTGAGE CORPORATION (the "Company"),
recites and provides as follows:

                                    RECITALS

      WHEREAS, the Seller has conveyed certain mortgage loans (the "Mortgage
Loans") identified on Exhibit B to Merrill Lynch Mortgage Investors, Inc. (the
"Depositor"), which in turn has conveyed the Mortgage Loans to Wells Fargo Bank
Minnesota, National Association, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), pursuant to a trust
agreement dated as of February 1, 2003 (the "Trust Agreement").

      WHEREAS, the Mortgage Loans are currently being serviced by the Company
for the Seller pursuant to the Portfolio Servicing Agreement between the Seller
and the Company as amended by Amendment Agreement No. 1 thereto (as amended, the
"Servicing Agreement"), attached as Exhibit C.

      WHEREAS, the Seller desires that the Company continue to service the
Mortgage Loans, and the Company has agreed to do so.

      WHEREAS, the Seller and the Company agree that the provisions of the
Servicing Agreement, as amended hereby with respect to the Mortgage Loans, shall
continue to apply to the Mortgage Loans, and shall govern the Mortgage Loans for
so long as such Mortgage Loans remain subject to the provisions of the Trust
Agreement.

      WHEREAS, the Seller and the Company intend that the Depositor and the
Trustee are each intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter set
forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Seller and the Company hereby agree as
follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

      1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Agreement,
including Exhibit A hereto and any provisions of the Servicing Agreement
incorporated by reference herein (regardless of whether such terms are defined
in the Servicing Agreement), shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in
the Trust Agreement.

      2. Servicing. The Company agrees, with respect to the Mortgage Loans, to
perform and observe the duties, responsibilities and obligations that are to be
performed and observed under the provisions of the Servicing Agreement, except
as otherwise provided herein and on Exhibit A hereto, and that the provisions of
the Servicing Agreement, as so modified, are and shall be a part of this
Agreement to the same extent as if set forth herein in full.

      3. Termination of Company. The Trustee shall have the same rights as the
Seller to enforce the obligations of the Company under the Servicing Agreement
and the term "Owner" as used in the Servicing Agreement in connection with any
rights of the Owner shall refer to the Trust Fund or, as the context requires,
the Trustee acting in its capacity as agent for the Trust Fund, except as
otherwise specified in Exhibit A hereto. The Trustee shall be entitled to
terminate the rights and obligations of the
<PAGE>
Company under this Agreement upon the failure of the Company to perform any of
its obligations under this Agreement, which failure results in an Event of
Default as provided in the Servicing Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in no event shall the Trustee assume any of the obligations of
the Seller under the Servicing Agreement except as provided in this Agreement or
the Trust Agreement; and in connection with the performance of the Trustee's
duties hereunder, the parties and other signatories hereto agree that the
Trustee shall be entitled to all of the rights, protections and limitations of
liability afforded to the Trustee under the Trust Agreement.

      5. No Representations. Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be
obligated or required to make any representations and warranties regarding the
characteristics of the Mortgage Loans (other than those company representations
and warranties of the Company made in the Servicing Agreement which are hereby
restated as of the Closing Date) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Trust Agreement and issuance of the Certificates issued
pursuant thereto.

1.    Unless otherwise specified herein, for purposes of this Agreement, any
      provisions of the Servicing Agreement, including definitions, relating to
      (i) representations and warranties of the Owner and (ii) the sale and
      purchase of the Mortgage Loans shall be disregarded.

2.    For reporting purposes, a Mortgage Loan is "delinquent" when any
      payment contractually due thereon has not been made by the close of
      business on the Due Date therefor.  Such Mortgage Loan is "30 days
      Delinquent" if such payment has not been received by the close of
      business on the corresponding day of the month immediately succeeding
      the month in which such payment was first due, or, if there is no such
      corresponding day (e.g., as when a 30-day month follows a 31-day month
      in which a payment was due on the 31st day of such month), then on the
      last day of such immediately succeeding month.  Similarly for "60 days
      Delinquent" and the second immediately succeeding month and "90 days
      Delinquent" and the third immediately succeeding month.

3.    A new definition of "Adverse REMIC Event" is hereby added to Article I

            10.01(f) of the Trust Agreement.

      such account as "Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, in
      trust for the registered holders of Merrill Lynch Mortgage Investors Trust
      Series MLCC 2003-A Certificates." The following sentence is added to the
      end of such definition: "The Custodial Funds Account shall be an Eligible
      Account."

5.    A new definition of "Custodial Agreement" is hereby added to Article I
      to read as follows:

            Custodial Agreement shall have the meaning set forth in the Trust

      follows:

            Custodian means Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association,
            any successor in interest or any successor custodian appointed
            pursuant to the Custodial Agreement.

7.    The definitions "Due Period" and "Eligible Account" are hereby added to
      Article I and each shall have the meaning set forth in the Trust
      Agreement.

8.    The definition of "Escrow Account" in Article I is hereby amended to
      entitle such an account as "Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National
      Association in trust for the registered holders of Merrill Lynch Mortgage
      Investors Trust Series MLCC 2003-A Certificates." The following sentence
      is hereby added to the end of such definition: "The Escrow Account shall
      be an Eligible Account."

      amended in its entirety to read as follows:

            certain information with respect to the Mortgage Loans, which
            Mortgage Loan Schedule is attached as Exhibit B to this Agreement.

10.   A new definition of "Opinion of Counsel" is hereby added to Article I
      to read as follows:

            Opinion of Counsel A written opinion of counsel, who may be an
            employee of the Company, that is reasonably acceptable to the
            Trustee and the Depositor provided that any Opinion of Counsel
            relating to (a) qualification of the Mortgage Loans in a REMIC or
            (b) compliance with the REMIC Provisions, must be an opinion of
            counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee and the Depositor, who
            (i) is in fact independent of the Seller, the Company and the
            Depositor of the Mortgage Loans, (ii) does not have any material

            Code, and related provisions, and regulations, including proposed
            regulations and rulings, and administrative pronouncements
            promulgated thereunder, as the foregoing may be in effect from time
            to time.

12.   The definition of "REO Property" in Article I is hereby amended by
      replacing the word "Owner" with "Trustee on behalf of the Trust Fund".

14.   Section 2.01(d) is hereby amended by replacing the word "Owner's" with
      "Depositor's" and by deleting the second and third sentence.

            any material term of any Mortgage Loan (including but not limited to
            the interest rate, the principal balance, the amortization schedule,
            or any other term affecting the amount or timing of payments on the
            Mortgage Loan or the collateral therefor) unless the Company shall
            have provided to the Depositor and the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
            in writing to the effect that such modification, waiver or amendment
            would not cause an Adverse REMIC Event.


                                      A-2
<PAGE>
20.   Section 2.02(a) is amended by adding the following:

            In the event that the Trust Fund acquires any REO Property in
            connection with a default or imminent default on a Mortgage Loan,
            the Company shall dispose of such REO Property not later than the
            end of the third taxable year after the year of its acquisition by
            the Trust Fund unless the Company has applied for and received a
            grant of extension from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect
            that, under the REMIC Provisions and any relevant proposed
            legislation and under applicable state law, the Trust Fund may hold
            REO Property for a longer period without adversely affecting the
            REMIC status of such REMIC or causing the imposition of a federal or
            state tax upon such REMIC. If the Company has received such an
            extension, then the Company shall continue to attempt to sell the
            REO Property for its fair market value for such period longer than
            three years as such extension permits (the "Extended Period"). If
            the Company has not received such an extension and the Company is
            unable to sell the REO Property within the period ending 3 months
            before the end of such third taxable year after its acquisition by
            the Trust Fund or if the Company has received such an extension, and
            the Company is unable to sell the REO Property within the period
            ending three months before the close of the Extended Period, the
            Company shall, before the end of the three year period or the
            Extended Period, as applicable, (i) purchase such REO Property at a
            price equal to the REO Property's fair market value or (ii) auction
            the REO Property to the highest bidder (which may be the Company) in
            an auction reasonably designed to produce a fair price prior to the
            expiration of the three-year period or the Extended Period, as the
            case may be. The Trustee shall sign any document prepared by the
            Company or take any other action reasonably requested by the Company
            which would enable the Company, on behalf of the Trust Fund, to
            request such grant of extension.

            Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no REO
            Property acquired by the Trust Fund shall be rented (or allowed to
            continue to be rented) or otherwise used by or on behalf of the
            Trust Fund in such a manner or pursuant to any terms that would: (i)
            cause such REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property"
            within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code; or (ii)
            subject the Trust Fund to the imposition of any federal income taxes
            on the income earned from such REO Property, including any taxes
            imposed by reason of Sections 860F or 860G(c) of the Code, unless
            the Company has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust Fund
            with respect to the imposition of any such taxes."

21.   Section 2.03 is hereby deleted.

22.   Section 2.04 is hereby amended by replacing the word "Owner" with
      "Depositor and/or Trustee."

23.   Section 2.05(a) is hereby amended by deleting the second sentence
      thereof.

24.   Section 2.08  is hereby replaced with the following:

                  Company Not to Resign. The Company shall neither assign this
            Agreement or the servicing hereunder or delegate its rights or
            duties hereunder or any portion hereof (to other than a third party
            in the case of outsourcing routine tasks such as taxes, insurance
            and property inspection, in which case the Company shall be fully
            liable for such tasks as if the Company performed them itself) nor
            sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
            property or assets without the prior written consent of the Trustee
            and the Depositor, which consent shall be granted or withheld in the
            reasonable discretion of such


                                      A-3
<PAGE>
            parties, provided, however, that (i) the Company may assign its
            rights and obligations hereunder without prior written consent of
            the Trustee and the Depositor to any entity that is directly owned
            or controlled by the Company, and the Company guarantees the
            performance of such entity hereunder (ii) the Company is no longer
            permitted to act as Company under applicable law as evidenced by an
            opinion of counsel or (iii) upon a sale of its servicing rights with
            respect to the Mortgage Loans with the prior written consent of the
            Seller. In the case of item (i) above, the Company shall provide the
            Trustee and the Depositor with a written statement guaranteeing the
            successor entity's performance of the Company's obligations under
            the Agreement.

25.   Section 2.11 is hereby amended by deleting the third sentence and
      replacing the word "Owner" with "Seller" in the last sentence.

26.   Section 2.12 is hereby deleted.

27.   Section 4.16 is hereby added:

            Compliance With Representations and Warranties. Within 60 days of
            the earlier of either discovery by or notice to the Company of any
            breach of a representation or warranty set forth in this Article IV
            which materially and adversely affects the ability of the Company to
            perform its duties and obligations under this Agreement or otherwise
            materially and adversely affects the value of the Mortgage Loans,
            the Mortgaged Property or the priority of the security interest on
            such Mortgaged Property, the Company shall use its best efforts
            promptly to cure such breach in all material respects and, if such
            breach cannot be cured, the Company shall, at the Trustee's option,
            assign the Company's rights and obligations under this Agreement (or
            respecting the affected Mortgage Loans) to a successor Company
            selected by the Depositor with the prior consent and approval of the
            Trustee. Such assignment shall be made in accordance with Section
            13.01.

28.   Section 5.02 is hereby deleted.

29.   Section 6.01 is hereby deleted.

                  (1) On each Portfolio Remittance Date prior to 1:00 p.m. New
            York City time, the Company shall remit to the Trustee (a) all

            the amount of any Principal Prepayment, together with interest
            thereon at the related Net Mortgage Rate to the end of the month in
            which prepayment of the related Mortgage Loan occurs, provided that
            such interest may not be greater that the servicing compensation

            such Portfolio Remittance Date, plus (b) all Monthly Advances, if
            any, which the Company is obligated to remit; provided that the
            Company shall not be required to remit, until the next following
            Portfolio Remittance Date, any amounts attributable to Monthly
            Payments collected but due on a Due Date or Dates subsequent to the

            any amount held in the Custodial Funds Account on account of Monthly
            Payments or portions thereof received in respect of the Mortgage
            Loans due after the related Due Date has been used by the Company in
            discharge of its obligation to make any such Monthly Advance and
            transfer such funds from the Custodial Funds Account to the Trustee.

            replaced by the Company by deposit in the Custodial Funds Account on
            or before any future Portfolio Remittance Date if funds in the
            Custodial Funds Account on such Portfolio Remittance Date shall be

                  Officer's Certificate. By February 28th of each year, or at

            the Company shall execute and deliver an Officer's Certificate
            substantially in the form of Exhibit F attached hereto, signed by
            the senior officer in charge of servicing of the Company or any
            officer to whom that officer reports, to the Trustee and Depositor

41.   Section 13.01 is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

                  Simultaneously with the termination of the Company's
            responsibilities and duties under this Agreement (a) the Trustee
            shall, in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement (i)
            succeed to and assume all of the Company's responsibilities, rights,
            duties and obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) appoint a
            successor meeting the eligibility requirements of the Trust
            Agreement and which shall succeed to all rights and assume all of
            the responsibilities, duties and liabilities of the Company under
            this Agreement with the termination of the Company's
            responsibilities, duties and liabilities under this Agreement. If
            the Trustee shall succeed to and assume the Company's
            responsibilities, rights, duties and obligations under this
            Agreement, such succession shall not be effective prior to 90 days
            after the Trustee's knowledge that the Company shall be terminated
            hereunder. The Company shall not be removed hereunder prior to the
            effectiveness of the assumption of its responsibilities, rights,
            duties and obligations by the successor thereto. Any successor to
            the Company that is not at that time a Company of other Mortgage
            Loans for the Trust Fund shall be subject to the approval of the
            Depositor, the Trustee and each Rating Agency (as such term is
            defined in the Trust Agreement). Unless the successor servicer is at
            that time a servicer of other mortgage loans for the Trust Fund,
            each Rating Agency must deliver to the Trustee a letter to the
            effect that such transfer of servicing will not result in a
            qualification, withdrawal or downgrade of the then-current rating of
            any of the Certificates. In connection with such appointment and
            assumption, the Trustee or the Depositor, as applicable, may make
            such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of
            payments on the Mortgage Loans as it and such successor shall agree;
            provided, however, that no such compensation shall be in excess of
            that permitted the Company under this Agreement. In the event that
            the Company's duties, responsibilities and liabilities under this
            Agreement should be terminated pursuant to the aforementioned
            sections, the Company shall discharge such duties and
            responsibilities during the period from the date it acquires
            knowledge of such termination until the effective date thereof with
            the same degree of diligence and prudence which it is obligated to
            exercise under this Agreement, and shall take no action whatsoever
            that might impair or prejudice the rights or financial condition of
            its successor. The resignation or removal of the Company pursuant to
            the aforementioned sections shall not become effective until a
            successor shall be appointed pursuant to this Section 12.01 and
            shall in no event relieve the Company of the representations and
            warranties made pursuant to Article IV and the remedies available to
            the Trustee under Article VIII, it being understood and agreed that
            the provisions of Article XII, Section 8.01, 10.02, 15.02, 15.04 and
            15.16. shall be applicable to the Company notwithstanding any such
            resignation or termination of the Company, or the termination of
            this Agreement.

                  Within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer
            than 30 days of the appointment of a successor entity, the Company
            shall prepare, execute and deliver to the successor entity any and
            all documents and other instruments, place in such successor's
            possession all Servicing Files, and do or cause to be done all other
            acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of
            such notice of termination. The Company shall cooperate with the
            Trustee and the Depositor, as applicable, and such successor in
            effecting the termination of the Company's responsibilities and
            rights hereunder and the transfer of servicing responsibilities to
            the successor Company, including without limitation, the transfer to
            such successor for administration by it of all cash amounts which
            shall at the time be credited by the Company to the Custodial
            Account or any Escrow Account or thereafter received with respect to
            the Mortgage Loans.

                  Any successor appointed as provided herein shall execute,
            acknowledge and deliver to the Trustee, the Company and the
            Depositor an instrument (i) accepting such appointment, wherein the
            successor shall make the representations and warranties set forth in
            Article IV and (ii) an assumption of the due and punctual
            performance and observance of each covenant and condition to be
            performed and observed by the Company under this Agreement,
            whereupon such successor shall become fully vested with all the
            rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations and
            liabilities of the Company, with like effect as if originally named
            as a party to this Agreement. Any termination or resignation of the
            Company or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.01
            shall not affect any claims that the Depositor or the Trustee may
            have against the Company arising out of the Company's actions or
            failure to act prior to any such termination or resignation.

                  The Company shall deliver within ten (10) Business Days to the
            successor Company the funds in the Custodial Account and Escrow
            Account and all Mortgage Loan Documents and related documents and
            statements held by it hereunder and the Company shall account for
            all funds and shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such
            other things as may reasonably be required to more fully and
            definitively vest in the successor all such rights, powers, duties,
            responsibilities, obligations and liabilities of the Company.

                  Upon a successor's acceptance of appointment as such, the
            Company shall notify the Trustee and Depositor of such appointment
            in accordance with the notice procedures set forth herein.

42.   A new Section 13.02 is hereby added to read as follows:

            Intended Third Party Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding any provision
            herein to the contrary, the parties to this Agreement agree that it
            is appropriate, in furtherance of the intent of such parties as set
            forth herein, that the Depositor and the Trustee receive the benefit
            of the provisions of this Agreement as intended third party
            beneficiaries of this Agreement to the extent of such provisions.
            The Company shall have the same obligations to the Depositor and the
            Trustee as if they were parties to this Agreement, and the Depositor
            and the Trustee shall have the same rights and remedies to enforce
            the provisions of this Agreement as if they were parties to this
            Agreement. The Company shall only take direction from the Depositor
            (if direction by the Depositor is required under this Agreement)
            unless otherwise directed by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
            foregoing, all rights and obligations of the Depositor and the
            Trustee hereunder (other


                                      A-7

            than the right to indemnification) shall terminate upon termination
            of the Trust Agreement and of the Trust Fund pursuant to the Trust
            Agreement.

43.   A new Section 13.03 is hereby added to read as follows:

            Request for Release. When requesting a release of documents from the
            Custodian, the Company shall use the form attached hereto as Exhibit
            E.
