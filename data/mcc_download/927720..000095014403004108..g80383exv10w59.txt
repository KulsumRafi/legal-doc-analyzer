potential responsibility, or information request from any Governmental Authority
arising out of or attributable to): (a) the current or past presence at any part

      Except for Jorgenson Broadcast Brokerage, the fees and expenses of which
shall be borne solely by SELLER, no person has as a result of any agreement
entered into by SELLER any valid claim against any of the parties hereto for a
brokerage commission, finder's fee or other like payment.

this Agreement and the Time Brokerage Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of PURCHASER. This Agreement and the Time
Brokerage Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by PURCHASER and each
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of PURCHASER, enforceable
against it in accordance with its respective terms, except as may be limited by


                                     -12-
<PAGE>
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
affecting creditors' rights generally or general equitable principles.

5.3. EXECUTION AND DELIVERY.

      Neither the execution and delivery by PURCHASER of this Agreement or the
Time Brokerage Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby will: (a) conflict with or result in a breach of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of PURCHASER; (b) subject to the FCC
Order, violate any Law or Order of any court or Governmental Authority; or (c)
violate or conflict with or constitute a default under (or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration under) any material

assignee of the FCC Licenses, and no waivers shall be required by the FCC for

Application and/or initiate a review of the potential effects on competition
and/or diversity of the transaction, or (c) to cause the FCC not to approve the

                        CERTAIN COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

6.1. REGULATORY APPROVALS.

      6.1.1. No later than three (3) Business Days after the date hereof, SELLER
and PURCHASER shall jointly cause to be filed by SELLER's FCC counsel one or
more applications with the FCC requesting its consent to the assignment of the
FCC Licenses from BCR LICENSE SUB to PURCHASER, which applications are attached
hereto at Exhibit A (the "FCC Application"). Each party shall pay its own
expenses in connection with the preparation and prosecution of the FCC
Application and shall share equally any filing fees associated with the FCC
Application.

      6.1.2. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, SELLER and PURCHASER shall each use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly (a) take, or to cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing all things proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (b) obtain from any Governmental Authority or other Person any
actions, non-actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals, permits or
Orders required to be obtained by SELLER, PURCHASER or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with the authorization, execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and the assignment of the FCC Licenses from BCR
LICENSE SUB to PURCHASER; (c) furnish all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law or any
applicable regulations of any Governmental Authority in connection with the

                                     - 14 -
<PAGE>
such filings or applications; (d) avoid the entry of, or have vacated or
terminated, any Order that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing or the
FCC Order, including defending against and opposing any lawsuits or other
proceedings (including any FCC reconsideration or review), whether judicial or
administrative, reviewing or challenging this Agreement, the consummation of the

Licenses from BCR LICENSE SUB to PURCHASER; and (e) execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to assign the FCC Licenses from BCR LICENSE SUB
to PURCHASER or to consummate any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No party to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary delay of
the assignment of the FCC Licenses from BCR LICENSE SUB to PURCHASER or the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby at the behest of any
Governmental Authority or other Person without the consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

      6.1.3. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the
Closing occurs before the FCC Order becomes a Final Order, the terms of Section
6.1.2 shall survive the Closing until the FCC Order becomes a Final Order;
provided, however, that such terms shall only survive as applied to actions
relating to the obtaining of the FCC Order and such FCC Order becoming a Final
Order. No assignment of the FCC Licenses shall occur prior to obtaining the FCC
Order.

6.2. THIRD PARTY CONSENTS AND NOTICES.

      6.2.1. As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, SELLER
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Third Party Consents
and landlord estoppel letters with respect to the Leased Transmitter Sites and
Studio Site, in forms reasonably acceptable to both SELLER and PURCHASER. All
Third Party Consents shall be in form reasonably satisfactory to PURCHASER, and
none shall provide for any increase in cost or other change in terms and
conditions after the Closing which would be materially adverse to PURCHASER.

      6.2.2. If any Third Party Consent has not been obtained prior to Closing,
and prior to Closing an Alternative Arrangement has been obtained with respect
to the Assumed Contract to which such Third Party Consent pertains (in each
case, a "DEFERRED CONTRACT"), then SELLER shall retain, until such time as such
Third Party Consent shall have been obtained by SELLER, all rights to and
liabilities under the Deferred Contract. Until the assignment of the Deferred
Contract, (a) SELLER shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts and
PURCHASER shall cooperate with SELLER to obtain all required consents or
approvals to remove any other impediments to such assignment, and (b) SELLER
shall cooperate with PURCHASER (and PURCHASER shall cooperate with SELLER) in
any lawful arrangement to provide (to the extent permitted without breach of
such Deferred Contract) that PURCHASER shall receive the benefits of such
Deferred Contract after the Closing Date to the same extent,


                                     - 15 -
<PAGE>
and without any additional cost or expense to PURCHASER, as if such Deferred
Contract had been assigned to PURCHASER (such arrangement, an "ALTERNATIVE
ARRANGEMENT"). To the extent that PURCHASER receives such benefits, PURCHASER
shall assume SELLER's Liabilities thereunder arising on or after the Closing
Date with respect to such Alternative Arrangement and PURCHASER shall perform
any such obligations of SELLER arising under such Alternative Arrangement. If,
subsequent to the Closing, SELLER shall obtain all required consents or
approvals required to assign any Deferred Contract, the Deferred Contract for
which consent or approval to assign has been obtained shall at that time be
deemed to be conveyed, granted, bargained, sold, transferred, setover, assigned,
released, delivered and confirmed to PURCHASER and assumed by PURCHASER, without
need of further action by SELLER or of further documentation except for notice
from SELLER to PURCHASER that such consent or approval has been obtained; and
from and after the effective date such Deferred Contract is assigned to
PURCHASER, (i) no party shall have any further liability under the Alternative
Arrangement related thereto, and (ii) the Deferred Contract shall be deemed to
be an Assumed Contract.

      6.2.3. Prior to Closing, SELLER shall provide written notice to third
parties which have entered into material contracts with any of the STATIONS
(other than the Assumed Contracts) regarding (a) the existence of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) that PURCHASER is not assuming
any obligations of SELLER or the STATIONS in respect of the contracts with such
third parties. SELLER shall promptly provide copies of these written notices to
PURCHASER.

6.3. ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

      From the date hereof until the Closing (upon reasonable notice to SELLER),
during normal business hours, SELLER shall, and shall cause its officers,
directors, employees, auditors and agents to, (a) afford the officers, employees
and authorized agents and representatives of PURCHASER reasonable access to the
offices, properties, books and records of SELLER to the extent related to the
Purchased Assets, and (b) furnish to the officers, employees and authorized
agents and representatives of PURCHASER such additional information regarding
the Purchased Assets as PURCHASER may from time to time reasonably request in
order to assist PURCHASER in fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement and
to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that such investigation shall not unreasonably interfere with
any of the businesses or operations of SELLER or any Station.

6.4. CONFIDENTIALITY.

      The terms of the confidentiality agreement dated as of December 19, 2002
(the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT") between SELLER and PURCHASER are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and effect
until the


                                     - 16 -
<PAGE>
Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of
PURCHASER under this Section 6.4 shall terminate; provided, however, that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate only in respect of that portion of the
Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) exclusively
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Purchased
Assets. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and
effect.

6.5. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS.

      SELLER and PURCHASER shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior written
consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided,
however, that a party may, without the prior written consent of the other party,
issue such press release or make such public statement as may be required by Law
or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange to which SELLER or
PURCHASER is a party if it has used all commercially reasonable efforts to
consult with the other party and to obtain such party's consent but has been
unable to do so in a timely manner.

6.6. ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.

      Subject to the terms of the Time Brokerage Agreement and the obligations
of the parties thereunder, during the period from the date hereof to the Closing
Date, unless the prior consent of PURCHASER is first obtained, SELLER shall
cause the STATIONS to not knowingly take any action which would cause the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 not to be satisfied as of
the Closing Date.

6.7. CONTROL OF THE STATION.

      Prior to the Closing, PURCHASER shall not, directly or indirectly,
control, supervise, direct, or attempt to control, supervise, or direct, the
operations of the STATIONS; such operations, including complete control and
supervision of all of the STATIONS programs, employees, and policies, shall be
the sole responsibility of SELLER until the Closing, except as contemplated by
the Time Brokerage Agreement.

6.8. RISK OF LOSS.

      SELLER shall bear the risk of all damage to, loss of or destruction of any
of the Purchased Assets between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date.
If any material portion of the Purchased Assets (other than items that are
obsolete and not necessary for the continued operations of the STATIONS) shall
suffer any material damage or destruction prior to the Closing Date, SELLER
shall promptly notify


                                     - 17 -
<PAGE>
PURCHASER in writing of such damage or destruction, shall promptly take all
necessary steps to restore, repair or replace such assets at SELLER's sole
expense, and shall advise PURCHASER in writing of the estimated cost to complete
such restoration, repair or replacement and all amounts actually paid as of the
date of the estimate. If necessary and provided that SELLER is diligently
pursuing such restoration, repair or replacement, the Closing Date shall be
extended for a period not exceeding ninety (90) days to accomplish such
restoration, repair or replacement. If such restoration, repair or replacement
is not accomplished prior to the Closing Date, as the same may be extended as
provided herein, PURCHASER shall have the right, at its option, to proceed with
the Closing and receive at the Closing the insurance proceeds or an assignment
of the right to receive such insurance proceeds to which SELLER otherwise would
be entitled, whereupon SELLER shall have no further liability to PURCHASER for
such damage, loss or destruction.

6.9. COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES.

      As of January 6, 2003 (the "TBA DATE"), SELLER shall assign the Accounts
Receivables to PURCHASER for collection purposes only, and, within five (5)
Business Days after the TBA Date, SELLER shall furnish to PURCHASER a list of
the Accounts Receivables by accounts and the amounts then owing. PURCHASER
agrees that during the term of the Time Brokerage Agreement and for a period of
one hundred fifty (150) days following the Closing Date (the "COLLECTION
PERIOD"), without any requirement to litigate to collect the Accounts
Receivables, to use its commercially reasonable efforts (with at least the care
and diligence PURCHASER uses to collect its own accounts receivable) to collect
for SELLER the Accounts Receivables and to remit to SELLER on the fifth day
following the last day of each month occurring during the Collection Period (or,
if any such day is a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, on the next Business Day),
collections received by PURCHASER with respect to the Accounts Receivables. With
each remittance, PURCHASER shall furnish a statement of the amounts collected
and the Persons from whom such amounts were collected. PURCHASER shall not make
any referral or compromise of any Accounts Receivables to a collection agency or
attorney for collection and shall not compromise for less than full value any
Account Receivable without the prior written consent of SELLER. Any Account
Receivable not collected by PURCHASER within the Collection Period shall revert
to SELLER. PURCHASER shall reassign, without recourse to PURCHASER, each Account
Receivable and deliver to SELLER, all records relating thereto on the same day
as it remits to SELLER the collections received. All payments in respect of the
Accounts Receivables received during the Collection Period shall be first
applied to the oldest balance then due on the Accounts Receivables unless the
account debtor indicates in writing that payment is to be applied otherwise or
if the payment refers to a specific invoice or is evidenced by a payment amount
that is the exact amount of a later invoice. PURCHASER agrees, upon the
reasonable request of SELLER, to furnish to SELLER periodic reports on the
status of SELLER's Accounts Receivables.
