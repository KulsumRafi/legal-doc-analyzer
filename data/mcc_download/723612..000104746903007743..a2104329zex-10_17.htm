<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exercisability.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Except as otherwise provided herein, Stock Options shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such

exercise provisions, in whole or in part, based on such factors as the Committee may determine. In addition, the Committee may at any time accelerate the exercisability of any Stock Option. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price by certified or bank check or such other instrument as the Corporation may accept. If approved by the Committee,
payment, in full or in part, may also be made in the form of unrestricted Common Stock already owned by the optionee of the same class as the Common Stock subject to the Stock Option (based on the
Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the Stock Option is exercised); </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided,  </I></FONT></P>

the discretion of the Committee, payment for any shares subject to a Stock Option may also be made by delivering a properly executed exercise notice to the Corporation, together with
a copy of the irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Corporation the amount of sale or loan proceeds necessary to pay the purchase price, and, if requested, the amount of any
federal, state, local

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
shares of Common Stock shall be issued until full payment therefor has been made. Except as otherwise provided in Section&nbsp;5(j) below, an optionee shall have all of the rights
of a shareholder of the Corporation holding the class or series of Common Stock that is subject to such Stock Option (including, if applicable, the right to vote the shares and the right to receive
dividends), when the optionee has given written notice of exercise, has paid in full for such shares and, if requested, has given the representation described in Section&nbsp;8(a). </FONT></P>

amended, or the regulations thereunder; or (iii)&nbsp;subject to such conditions as the Committee may prescribe from time to time, and upon written notice provided to the General Counsel of the
Corporation, as a gift to family members of the optionee or trusts for the benefit of family members of the optionee. Except to the extent provided in this Section&nbsp;5(f) or in Sections 5(g),
(h)&nbsp;and (i)&nbsp;below, Stock Options may not be assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or disposed of in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise), shall not be subject to
execution, attachment or similar process, and may be exercised during the lifetime of the holder thereof only by such holder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Termination by Death or Disability.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if an optionee's employment terminates by reason of

(24)&nbsp;months (or such other period as the Committee may specify in the option agreement) from the date of such termination or until the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Option,

Retirement, any Stock Option held by such optionee may thereafter be exercised by the optionee, to the extent it was exercisable at the time of such Retirement, or on such accelerated basis as the
Committee may determine, for a period of twenty-four (24)&nbsp;months (or such other period as the Committee may specify in the option agreement) from the date of such termination of
employment or until the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Option, whichever period is the shorter. Any Stock Option not vested as of the date of such Retirement and not accelerated by action

other than death, Disability or Retirement, any Stock Option held by such optionee, to the extent then exercisable, or on such accelerated basis as the Committee may determine, may be exercised for
the lesser of twelve (12)&nbsp;months from the date of such Termination of Employment or the balance of such Stock Option's term. Any Stock Option not vested as of the date of such Termination of
Employment and not accelerated by action of the Committee shall be cancelled as of the date of such Termination of Employment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
Adoption of the Plan shall not confer upon any employee any right to continued employment, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Corporation or any Affiliate to
terminate the employment of any employee at any time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)
No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the gross income of the participant for federal income tax purposes with respect to any Stock Option under
the Plan, the participant shall pay to the Corporation, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation regarding the payment of, any federal, state, local or foreign taxes of any kind required
by law to be withheld with respect to such amount. Unless otherwise determined by the Corporation, withholding obligations may be settled with Common Stock, including Common Stock that is part of the
Stock Option that gives rise to the withholding requirement. The obligations of the Corporation under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Corporation and its
Affiliates shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due to the participant. The Committee may establish such procedures as it deems
appropriate, including making irrevocable elections, for the settlement of withholding obligations with Common Stock. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)
The Committee shall establish such procedures as it deems appropriate for a participant to designate a beneficiary to whom any amounts payable in the event of the participant's death
are to be paid or by whom any rights of the participant, after the participant's death, may be exercised. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)
In the case of a grant of a Stock Option to any employee of an Affiliate of the Corporation, the Corporation may, if the Committee so directs, issue or transfer the shares of Common
Stock, if any, covered by the Stock Option to the Affiliate, for such lawful consideration as the Committee may specify, upon the condition or understanding that the Affiliate will transfer the shares
of Common Stock to the employee in accordance with the terms of the Stock Option specified by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)
The Plan and all Stock Options made and actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to
principles of conflict of laws. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)
Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, the Board may, without further approval by the shareholders, substitute new options for, or assume, prior options of any
corporation which engages with the Corporation or any of its Affiliates in a transaction to which Section&nbsp;424(a) of the Code would apply (assuming for such purpose that the option assumed or
substituted were an incentive stock option), or any parent or any subsidiary of such corporation. </FONT></P>
