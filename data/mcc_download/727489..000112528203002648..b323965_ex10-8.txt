13. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

    13.1. In the event of a dispute involving the interpretation or application
          of any provision of this Agreement, the parties agree not to commence
          litigation until they have first notified each other of their intent
          to implement the terms of this Section after first having employed
          their best efforts to jointly resolve such dispute. If the parties
          cannot resolve their differences in such fashion within thirty (30)
          days' of either party's receipt of such notice of the intent of the
          other party to implement the terms of this Section, the following
          alternative dispute resolution process (the venue of which shall be
          New York, New York) shall be immediately implemented:

          13.1.1. Upon written request of either party, the dispute will be
                  referred for negotiation to representatives of the parties who
                  have no direct operational responsibility for the matters
                  involved in the dispute and who have authority to resolve the
                  dispute.

          13.1.2. If these representatives have not agreed on a resolution of
                  such dispute within ten (10) Business Days of its referral to
                  them, the dispute shall be promptly submitted to a neutral
                  adviser (the "Adviser") who shall be chosen from the list of
                  arbitrators registered with the American Arbitration
                  Association. The Adviser shall, within fourteen (14) days of
                  the submission, recommend, in writing, a procedure for
                  resolving the dispute and shall specify in such writing
                  whether such procedure shall be binding, non-binding or
                  involve a combination of binding and non-binding procedures.

          13.1.3. If the parties do not mutually agree upon the process
                  recommended by the Adviser within ten (10) Business Days' of
                  their receipt of the Adviser's written recommendation, they
                  shall promptly convene a non-binding hearing (the
                  "Mediation"). The rules for the Mediation will be established
                  by the Adviser, after consultation with the parties.

          13.1.4. If the dispute cannot be resolved, either through the
                  procedure recommended by the Adviser or through the Mediation,
                  within such period as the Adviser shall deem reasonable, the
                  Adviser shall, at the request of either party, certify to the
                  parties that the matter is incapable of resolution.

<PAGE>




          13.1.5. No litigation may be commenced concerning the dispute until
                  the Adviser has certified in writing that the dispute is
                  incapable of resolution, provided that any party may commence
                  litigation (a) on any date after which such litigation could
                  be barred by an applicable statute of limitations; or (b) if
                  litigation is otherwise necessary to prevent irreparable harm
                  to the moving party.

          13.1.6. Each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with
                  the alternative dispute resolution procedures set forth in
                  this Section, except that the parties shall split equally the
                  fees and expenses of the Adviser, including the costs
                  associated with any Mediation, and the fees and expenses of
                  any other person designated by the Adviser to assist the
                  parties.

      13.2. All communications made in connection with the alternative dispute
            resolution procedure set forth in this Section shall be treated as
            communications for the purpose of settlement and as such shall be
            deemed to be confidential and inadmissible in any subsequent
            litigation by virtue of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence,
            as the same may be amended from time to time.

14. USE OF NAME

      14.1. Contractor shall not use the name, trade name, service marks,
            trademarks, trade, dress or logos of the Company (or any of its
            affiliates) in publicity releases, advertising or any other
            publication without the Company's prior written consent.

15. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

      15.1. If this Agreement is subject to the requirements of Executive Order
            8246, Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or the Vietnam
            Era Veterans' Readjustment Act of 1974, Contractor agrees to comply

            accordance therewith.
