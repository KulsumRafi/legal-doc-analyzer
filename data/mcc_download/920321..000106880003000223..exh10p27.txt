                          EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE AGREEMENT


         THIS EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is effective as of the
1st day of June, 2001 (the "Effective Date"), by and between MAIL-WELL, INC., a
Colorado corporation (the "Company"), and               ("Executive").
                                          -------------

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders
to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of Executive,
notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Triggering Event (as
defined herein);

         WHEREAS, the Board believes it is imperative (i) to diminish the
inevitable and significant distractions of Executive and dilution of the time of
Executive, by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a
pending or threatened Triggering Event; (ii) to encourage Executive's full
attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any
threatened or pending Triggering Event; (iii) to provide Executive with
compensation arrangements in the event of a Triggering Event which provide
Executive with financial security, which are competitive with those of other
corporations; (iv) to ensure that following a Triggering Event Executive does
not engage in activities or business pursuits which may threaten or damage the
Company; (v) to retain the services of Executive for a reasonable period of time
following any Triggering Event; and (vi) to obtain a full and complete Release
from Executive should a separation of employment occur in connection with or
subsequent to a Triggering Event; and

         WHEREAS, in order to accomplish the objectives described in the two
immediately preceding recitals, the Board desires to cause the Company to enter
into this Agreement as set forth herein.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the mutual covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
Company and Executive hereby agree as follows:


                                    ARTICLE I

                  ----
Agreement ("Term") shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for
an initial period ending December 31, 2002 and shall continue for additional
12-month periods thereafter unless written notice to the contrary is given by
either party to the other at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then
current term; provided however that if a Triggering Event occurs during the Term
(including any renewal period), the Term shall be for the period commencing on
the Effective Date and ending on the second anniversary of such Triggering
Event.

shall terminate, upon the occurrence of:

                  (a) Notice by Company. Ten (10) days after written notice of
                      -----------------

         herein), to Executive;

         renders Executive unable to perform with reasonable diligence the
         ordinary functions and duties of Executive on a full-time basis in
         accordance with the terms of this Agreement, which inability continues
         for a period of not less than 180 consecutive days.

Any notice of termination given by the Company or a Segment Successor to
Executive under Section 1.2(a) above shall specify whether such termination is
with or without Cause (as defined in Section 1.6 hereof). Any notice of
termination given by Executive to the Company or a Segment Successor under
Section 1.2(b) above shall specify whether such termination is made with or
without Good Reason (as defined in Section 1.5(a) hereof).

                  -----------------------------------------------------------

                      --------------------------
         Agreement, Executive terminates Executive's employment with the Company
         or a Segment Successor, after having provided at least ninety (90) days
         advance written notice, on or after the occurrence of a Triggering
         Event with Good Reason, or if during the Term of this Agreement, the
         Company or a Segment Successor terminates Executive's employment with
         the Company without Cause in anticipation of, on or after the
         occurrence of a Triggering Event, and in lieu of any other severance
         benefits that would otherwise be payable to Executive, the Company or

                      (i)   to the extent not theretofore paid, Executive's
                  base salary in effect at the time of such termination through
                  the date of termination;

                      (ii)  in the case of compensation previously deferred
                  by Executive, all amounts previously deferred (together with
                  any accrued interest thereon) and not yet paid by the Company
                  or Segment Successor; and

                      (iii) all other amounts or benefits owing or accrued

                  the Company or Segment Successor and their respective
                  affiliates.

                  The obligations owing or accrued to, vested in, or earned by
         Executive through the date of termination, including, but not limited
         to, such amounts and benefits specified in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii)
         of section 1.3(a) shall be hereinafter collectively referred to as the

         accordance with the plans, programs or agreements under which the
         Accrued Obligations were earned.

                  In addition, the Company or Segment Successor shall pay

                  one-half][two] times Executive's base salary in effect at
                  the time of such termination (but prior to giving effect
                  to any reduction therein which precipitated such
                  termination), (y) [one][one and one-half][two] times

                  the pro-rata share of Executive's target bonus for the
                  calendar year in which such termination occurred based
                  upon the proportion that the number of complete months in
                  such calendar year up to the date of termination bears to
                  the complete calendar year;

                      (v)   if Executive elects medical or dental coverage
                  under the Company's or Segment Successor's group medical or

                  presentation of reasonable documentation showing prior
                  payment), of an amount equal to the premium paid each month by
                  Executive for COBRA Coverage during the 12 months of such
                  COBRA Coverage (or during such shorter period that COBRA

                  and

                      (vii) assistance to Executive to be provided by a

                  mutually agreeable accounting firm for federal and state
                  income tax planning and federal and state income tax return
                  preparation for Executive for the calendar year in which such
                  termination of employment occurred.

         provide Executive certain additional severance benefits under the

                  (c) Exceptions. Section 1.3(a)(iv)-(vii) shall not apply to
                      ----------
         the termination by the Company of Executive's employment in connection

         herein) if Executive continues employment with, or is offered
         employment by, the Business Segment or the Company in a stock sale or
         the purchaser of the assets of the Business Segment in an asset sale

         1.4      Other  Terminations. If Executive's employment is terminated
                  -------------------
for any reason or circumstance not set forth in Section 1.3, the Company shall
pay to Executive all Accrued Obligations, as defined above, owed to Executive.

         1.5      Good Reason.
                  -----------

                  (a) As used in this Agreement, the term "Good Reason" means:

                      (i)   a substantial diminution in the nature of
                  Executive's authorities, duties, responsibilities or status
                  (including offices, titles, reporting requirements and
                  supervisory functions), from those in effect immediately prior
                  to the Triggering Event. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                  Executive shall not assert as "Good Reason" the sole fact that
                  a portion of Executive's duties and responsibilities directly
                  attributable to a change in the ownership of the Company or a
                  Business Segment, as the case may be, resulting from the
                  Triggering Event has been eliminated (the "Eliminated Duties
                  and Responsibilities"), unless the performance of all or any
                  material portion of the Eliminated Duties and Responsibilities
                  continue to be required;

                      (ii)  the required relocation of Executive's place of
                  employment to a location in excess of thirty-five (35) miles
                  from the Executive's place of employment at the time Executive
                  terminates employment, except for required travel on Company
                  business to an extent substantially equivalent to Executive's
                  business travel obligations immediately prior to the
                  Triggering Event;

                      (iii) any reduction by the Company of Executive's
                  base salary, or a material reduction in Executive's bonus
                  opportunities, profit sharing opportunities, or other
                  incentive opportunities from those in effect immediately prior
                  to the Triggering Event;

                                       4

<PAGE>

                      (iv)   the Company breaches any material provision of
                  this Agreement and such breach is not cured within thirty (30)
                  days after the Company's receipt of notice thereof from
                  Executive;

                      (v)    the failure by the Company to increase
                  Executive's base salary in a manner consistent (both as to
                  frequency and percentage increase) with (A) the Company's
                  practices in effect immediately prior to the Triggering Event
                  with respect to similarly positioned employees or (B) the
                  Company's practices implemented subsequent to the Triggering
                  Event with respect to similarly positioned employees, unless,
                  in either case, such failure is due to the failure by
                  Executive to meet performance standards applicable to
                  similarly positioned employees;

                      (vi)   the failure of the Company to continue in effect
                  Executive's participation in the Company's employee benefit
                  plans, programs, arrangements and policies, at a level
                  substantially equivalent in value to and on a basis consistent
                  with the relative levels of participation of other similarly
                  positioned employees;

                      (vii)  the failure of the Company to obtain from a
                  successor (including a successor to a material portion of the
                  business or assets of the Company) a satisfactory assumption
                  in writing of the Company's obligations under this Agreement;

                      (viii) the failure of the Company to continue to
                  provide Executive with office space, related facilities and
                  support personnel (including, but not limited to,
                  administrative and secretarial assistance) that are both
                  commensurate in all material respects with the Office and
                  Executive's responsibilities to and position with the Company
                  immediately prior to the Change in Control and not materially
                  dissimilar to the office space, related facilities and support
                  personnel provided to other key executive officers of the
                  Company; or

                      (ix)   the Company notifies Executive of the Company's
                  intention not to observe or perform one or more of the
                  obligations of the Company under this Agreement.

                  (b) If, at any time during the Term of this Agreement,
         whether before or after the occurrence of a Triggering Event, Executive
         receives a description from the Company of the nature of Executive's
         authorities, duties, responsibilities, status, salary, bonus and other
         employee benefits, or job location thereafter, and Executive accepts
         such new authorities, duties, responsibilities, status, salary, bonus
         and other employee benefits, or job location ("New Office") with the
         Company without determining that the New Office causes a Good Reason as
         set forth in Section 1.5(a), then for the remaining Term, the New
         Office shall be the authorities, duties, responsibilities, status,
         salary, bonus and other

                                       5

<PAGE>

         employee benefits, or job location to be used by Executive in
         determining whether Good Reason occurs thereafter pursuant to
         Section 1.5(a).

         1.6      Cause. The term "Cause" shall mean (i) willful misconduct by
                  -----
Executive or gross neglect by Executive of Executive's duties as an employee,
officer or director of the Company which continues for more than thirty (30)
days after Executive's receipt of written notice to Executive specifically
identifying the willful misconduct or gross neglect of Executive and directing
Executive to discontinue the same, (ii) the commission by Executive of a crime
constituting a felony, or (iii) the commission by Executive of an act, other
than an act taken in good faith within the course and scope of Executive's
employment, which is directly detrimental to the Company and exposes the Company
to material liability.

         1.7      Triggering Event. As used herein, the term "Triggering Event"
                  ----------------
shall mean the occurrence with respect to the Company of any of the following
events:

         effect on the date hereof, pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the

         ("Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a
         majority thereof, provided that any person becoming a director
         subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for
         election by the Company's stockholders, was approved by a vote of at
         least two-thirds of the directors comprising the remaining members of
         the Incumbent Board (either by a specific vote or by approval of the
         proxy statement of the Company in which such person is named as a
         nominee for director, without objection to such nomination) shall be,
         for purposes of this clause (f), considered as though such person were
         a member of the Incumbent Board; or

                  (g) a recapitalization or other transaction or series of
         related transactions occurs which results in a decrease by 50% or more
         in the aggregate percentage ownership of the then outstanding common
         stock of the Company or 50% or more in the combined voting power of the
         outstanding securities of the Company held by the stockholders of the
         Company immediately prior to giving effect thereto (on a primary basis
         or on a fully diluted basis after giving effect to the exercise of
         stock options and warrants).

         1.8      Additional Triggering Events in Specific Circumstances. In
                  ------------------------------------------------------
addition to those Triggering Events specified in Sections 1.7 above, the
following events shall also be Triggering Events:

                  (a) With respect to an Executive who devotes substantially all
         of his or her time and energy to the management and operation of a
         Business Segment (a "Segment Executive"), the combination of Business
         Segments, the sale of substantially all the capital stock of a Business
         Segment, or the transfer, sale or contribution of more than 50% of the
         Business Segment's Base Revenues (as defined below) shall constitute a
         Triggering Event. For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Business
         Segment" shall be defined as either Mail-Well Envelope, Mail-Well Print
         Group, Mail-Well Label, PrintXcel, or Curtis 1000, as such businesses
         are constituted as of the date hereof.

                  (b) With respect to a Mail-Well Corporate Office Executive who
         does not devote substantially all of their time and energy to the
         management and operation of a single Business Segment, but rather
         divides his or her time and energy among the Business Segments or
         towards other Corporate objectives ("a Corporate Executive").

                      (i)   the sale of any Business Segment or Business
                  Segments in the aggregate constituting more than 50% of the
                  revenues of the Company (excluding discontinued operations) as
                  such revenues were reported in the Company's Annual Report on
                  Form 10(K) for the year ended December 31, 2000 ("Base
                  Revenues") shall constitute a Triggering Event;

                      (ii)  the elimination of the Corporate Executive's
                  corporate department or major corporate function, such as
                  legal, human resources, purchasing, treasury or the like.

         1.9      Legal Fees and Expenses. If Executive shall prevail in any
                  -----------------------
contest by the Company or others contesting the validity or enforcement of, or
liability under, any term or provision of this Agreement, the Company shall pay
any and all reasonable attorney, accounts' and experts' fees and expenses and
court costs, incurred by Executive as a result of any such contest. Otherwise,
each party shall bear his, her or its own expenses in connection with any such
contest.

         1.10     Non-exclusivity of Rights. Except as provided in Section 4.4
                  -------------------------
below, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit Executive's continuing
or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan, program,
arrangement or policy provided by the Company or any of its affiliates and for
which Executive and/or Executive's family may qualify, nor shall anything herein
limit or otherwise affect such rights as Executive and/or Executive's family may
have under any other agreements with the Company or any of its affiliates.
Amounts which are vested benefits or which Executive and/or Executive's family
is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, program, arrangement, or policy
of the Company or any of its affiliates at or subsequent to the date of
termination of Executive's employment under this Agreement shall be payable in
accordance with such plan, program, arrangement or policy.

         1.11     Full Payment; No Mitigation Obligation. The Company's
                  --------------------------------------
obligation to make the payments provided for in sections 1.3(a)(iv)-(vii) in
this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall be
subject to any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right
or action which the Company may have against Executive or others, and is also
contingent upon Executive's execution of the release described in Section 1.12.
In no event shall Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any
other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to Executive under any
of the provisions of this Agreement.

         1.12     Delivery of Release. Within thirty (30) days after termination
                  -------------------
of Executive's employment (other than due to death of Executive) in anticipation
of, on or after the occurrence of a Triggering Event, the Company shall provide
to Executive, or Executive's legal representative, a form of written release,
which form shall be satisfactory to the Company and generally consistent with
the form of release used by the Company prior to the earlier of (a) such
termination of employment, if the Company has terminated Executive's employment
in anticipation of a Triggering Event, or (b) the occurrence of the Triggering
Event. As a condition to the obligation of the Company to make the payments
provided for in this Agreement and otherwise perform its obligations hereunder
to Executive upon termination of Executive's employment (other than due to death
of Executive) Executive, or Executive's legal

                                       8

representative, shall deliver to the Company a written release, substantially in
the form described above and provided to Executive by the Company within such
thirty (30) day period, releasing the Company and its affiliates from any and
all liability related to Executive's employment or the termination thereof,
other than liabilities arising under this Agreement.

         1.13     Stay-on Requirement. In consideration for the agreements of
                  -------------------
the Company hereunder and as a condition for the payments to be made to pursuant
to Section 1.3(a)(iv)-(vii) hereof, Executive agrees that Executive will not
voluntarily terminate his employment with the Company or, in the case of a
Segment Executive, with any Segment Successor with respect to which Executive is
a Segment Executive, prior to or within three months following a Triggering
Event.

         1.14     Mitigation. Executive agrees to do anything reasonably
                  ----------
requested by Company to mitigate the effects of Sections 280G and 4999 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any interest or
penalties incurred by Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise
tax, together with any such interest or penalties, are hereinafter collectively
referred to as the "Excise Tax") by agreeing to a reallocation of the payments
made by the Company pursuant to Section 1.3(b). In addition, at the option of
the Executive, if a reduction in the payments made under Section 1.3(a)(iv), (v)
and (vi) would eliminate some or all of the Excise Taxes, the payment payable
under such Sections will be reduced by the amount that will eliminate the
imposition of such Excise Tax. Executive agrees that any such election shall be
made based on the independent tax advice received by the Executive.

                                   ARTICLE II
                      NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION

         2.1      Non-Competition.
                  ---------------

                  (a) Executive acknowledges that during his employment with the
         Company he has enjoyed a position of trust and confidence that gave him
         complete access to Confidential and Proprietary Information (as defined
         herein), which has value to the Company.

                  (b) Executive acknowledges that his service as Vice President,
         Tax & Treasurer of the Company means that he comes within the statutory
         exception contained in subsection 2(d) of C.R.S. Section 8-2-113, which
         allows for non-competition agreements between employers and executives,
         managers, officers and professional staff. Because of his virtually
         unlimited access to Confidential and Proprietary Information, which is
         of value to the Company, Executive also acknowledges that his
         subsequent employment by a competitor would be more likely than not to
         result in the inevitable disclosure of the trade secrets of the
         Company.

                  (c) Executive accordingly agrees that for the term of this
         Agreement and for a period of two (2) years following his separation
         from employment for any reason which entitles Executive to receive
         payments under Section 1.3(a)(iv)-(vii), Executive shall not

                                       9

         directly or indirectly engage in competition with the Company by
         taking any of the following actions:

                      (i)   Owning, managing, operating, joining, controlling
                  or providing services to (or participating in the ownership,
                  management, operation or control of, other than as a holder of
                  less than 5% of the shares of a public company), aiding or
                  assisting any corporation, association, partnership, limited
                  liability company, proprietorship or other business entity,
                  regardless of form, that at any location in the United States
                  or Canada engages in the business in which the Segment
                  Executive is currently engaged in by the Company or, with
                  respect to a Corporate Executive, the entire company.

                      (ii)  Serving as an employee, agent, consultant,
                  officer, director, advisor, or creditor of any such business
                  entity or enterprise described in (i) above.

                      (iii) Inducing or attempting to induce any customer,
                  supplier or business relation of the Company to cease doing
                  business with the Company or in any other way interfering with
                  the relationship between any customer, supplier or business
                  relation and the Company.

                  (d) The foregoing restrictions shall not apply to employment
         with a Segment Successor that acquires the Business Segment for which
         the Executive is a Segment Executive.

                  (e) Executive acknowledges that the restrictions set forth
         above are reasonable and appropriate to protect the Confidential and
         Proprietary Information of value to the Company, which would be
         inevitably disclosed if he competed, directly or indirectly, as set
         forth above. If however, a court determines that any of the foregoing
         restrictions are unreasonable in duration, scope or area of
         restriction, then Executive and the Company agree that the restrictions
         shall be applied only to the activities and territory, and only for the
         period of time, that the court determines reasonable in light of all
         then-existing circumstances.

         2.2      Non-Solicitation of Employees. The Executive agrees that for
                  -----------------------------
the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years following his
separation from employment for any reason which entitles Executive to receive
payments under Section 1.3(a)(iv)-(vii), Executive shall not directly or
indirectly solicit or recruit, or attempt to solicit or recruit, or hire, any
employee of the Company who is employed by the Company or was employed by the
Company at any time during the last year of the Executive's employment with the
Company.

         2.3      Confidential Information. As used herein, "Confidential and
                  ------------------------
Proprietary Information" means all information of a technical or business nature
such as ideas, discoveries, inventions, improvements, trade secrets, know-how,
manufacturing processes, specifications, writings and other works of authorship,
computer programs, software and data, source codes, financial figures and
reports, marketing plans and data, customer lists and data, business plans or

                                       10

<PAGE>

data which relate to the actual or anticipated business of the Company of any of
its affiliates or their actual or anticipated areas of research and development,
evaluations of, and the use or non-use by Company or any of its affiliates of,
technical or business information in the public domain, forecasts, strategic
plans, arrangements with manufacturers, suppliers, brokers and other third
parties, financing plans, personnel records, customer lists, manuals, records,
information regarding actual or potential customers or suppliers, marketing
plans, present and proposed trade marks, service marks, names, brands and
labels, packaging and advertising plans and data, product formulations,
regulatory plans, programs and data, legal matters, patent and trademark matters
and any proprietary or secret information (whether such information is owned by,
licensed to or otherwise possessed by the Company or any of its affiliates),
whether patentable or not. Executive shall, both during and after Executive's
employment with the Company, protect and maintain the confidential, trade secret
and/or proprietary character of all Confidential and Proprietary Information.
Executive shall not, during or after termination of Executive's employment,
directly or indirectly, use (for Executive or another) or disclose any
Confidential Information, except as may be necessary for the performance of
Executive's duties while in the employ of the Company. Executive shall deliver
promptly to the Company, at the termination of Executive's employment, or at any
other time at the Company's request, without retaining any copies, all documents
and other material in Executive's possession relating, directly or indirectly,
to any Confidential and Proprietary Information. Each of Executive's obligations
in this Section 5.3 shall also apply to the confidential, trade secret and
proprietary information learned or acquired by Executive during Executive's
employment from others with whom the Company or any of its affiliates has a
business relationship.

         2.4      Specific Enforcement; Modification. Executive acknowledges
                  ----------------------------------
that the provisions of Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are reasonable and necessary
for the protection of the Company and that the Company will be irrevocably
damaged if such provisions are not specifically enforced. Accordingly, Executive
agrees that, in addition to any other remedy to which the Company may be
entitled, the Company shall be entitled to seek and obtain injunctive relief
from a court of competent jurisdiction for the purposes of restraining it from
any actual or threatened breach of such provisions, without bond or other
security being required. Should a court of competent jurisdiction declare any of
the covenants set forth in this Article II unenforceable, the court shall be
empowered to modify and reform such covenants so as to provide relief reasonably
necessary to protect the interests of the Company and Executive and to award
injunctive relief, or damages, or both, to which the Company may be entitled.

         2.5      Provisions Not Exclusive. The provisions of Sections 2.1,
                  ------------------------
2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 do not supercede or replace any non-competition,
confidentiality or non-solicitation agreements between Executive and the Company
or any of its affiliates now in effect or entered into in the future.


                                   ARTICLE III
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         3.1      Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
                  -------------
construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Colorado.

         3.2      Assignability. This Agreement is personal to Executive and
                  -------------
without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by
Executive other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive's legal
representatives and heirs. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns including any Segment
Successor that employs Executive following a Triggering Event. The Company shall
require any corporation, entity, individual or other person who is the successor
(whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization,
or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the
Company, and any Segment Successor that employs Executive following a Triggering
Event, to expressly assume and agree to perform, by a written agreement in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Executive, all of the obligations of
the Company under this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term "Company"
shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor (including any
Segment Successor) to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and
agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, written agreement, or
otherwise.

         3.3      Withholding. The Company may withhold from any amounts payable
                  -----------
under this Agreement such federal, state or local taxes as shall be required to
be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.

         3.4      Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement constitutes the
                  ---------------------------
entire agreement and understanding between Executive and the Company and, except
as otherwise expressly provided herein, supersedes any prior agreements or
understandings, whether written or oral, with respect to the subject matter
hereof. This Agreement replaces and supercedes any and all provisions of and
benefits under any other severance agreement or program under which Executive
would otherwise be entitled to severance benefits on or after the occurrence of
a Triggering Event. It is expressly understood that any previously executed
Executive Severance Agreement or Change of Control Agreement or any other
agreement which purports to have change of control or similar provisions in it,
are hereby superceded by this Agreement. Except as may be otherwise provided
herein, this Agreement may not be amended or modified except by subsequent
written agreement executed by both parties hereto.

         3.5      Multiple Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
                  ---------------------
multiple counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one Agreement.

         3.6      Notices. Any notice provided for in this Agreement shall be
                  -------
deemed delivered upon deposit in the United States mails, registered or
certified mail, addressed to the party to whom directed at the addresses set
forth below or at such other addresses as may be substituted therefore by notice
given hereunder. Notice given by any other means must be in writing and shall be

same or any other term or condition of this Agreement.

         3.8      Severability. In the event any provision of this Agreement
                  ------------
is found to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision shall be severable from
this Agreement and shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other
provision of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is capable to

that would render the provision valid, then the provision shall have the
