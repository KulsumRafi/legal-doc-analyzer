Executive's voluntary termination of his employment for death, disability, Good
Reason, Voluntary Resignation or otherwise, it is determined that an Executive
could have been terminated for Cause hereunder, such voluntary termination shall
be recharacterized and treated as a termination for Cause for all purposes
hereunder. Prior to the implementation of such recharacterization, the Company
shall provide the Executive with notice and the reason(s) for the
recharacterization and at least five (5) days to provide a written response to
the Company. Thereafter, the Company may take appropriate legal action to seek

however, such coverage shall not be provided if during such period the Executive
is or becomes ineligible under the provisions of COBRA for continuing coverage

3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and any
Group Disability Plans; and

Executive is expressly entitled following the termination of Executive's

severance, bonus or other payments, perquisites or benefits, including any
further accruals or vesting thereof, to which the Executive might then or, in
the future, be eligible pursuant to this Agreement or any statutory or common
law claim. In order to preserve the parties' respective legal rights in the
event of a dispute, the Executive acknowledges and agrees that in the event the
parties dispute whether the Executive shall be eligible to the payment
hereunder, such payment shall not be deemed to be earned or otherwise vest
hereunder until such time as the dispute is determined by a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise resolved. The foregoing shall not
be deemed to prohibit a court of competent jurisdiction from awarding
prejudgment interest under circumstances in which it may deem it appropriate to
do so.

         5.4      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the
Company has reason to believe that there are circumstances which, if
substantiated, would constitute Cause as defined herein, the Company may suspend
the Executive from employment immediately upon notice for such period of time as
shall be reasonably necessary for the Company to ascertain whether such
circumstances are substantiated. During such suspension, the Executive shall
continue to be paid all compensation and provided all benefits hereunder;
provided, however, that if the Executive has been indicted or otherwise formally
charged by governmental authorities with any felony, the Company may, in its
sole discretion, and without limiting the Company's discretion to terminate the
Executive's employment for Cause (provided it has grounds to do so under the
terms of Paragraph 5.1.3 hereof), suspend the Executive without continuation of
any compensation or benefits hereunder (except health benefits which shall be
continued during the period of suspension), pending final disposition of such
criminal charge(s). Upon receiving notice of any such suspension, the Executive
shall promptly leave the premises of the Company and remain off such premises
until further notice from the Company. In the event the Executive is acquitted
or otherwise exonerated from such charges, the Company shall pay to the
Executive such compensation, with interest, calculated from the date such
compensation was suspended at the prime lending rate in effect on the date the
Company receives notice from the Executive of such acquittal or exoneration, and
provide benefits withheld from the Executive during the period of the

                                       10

<PAGE>

Executive's suspension, if any. The payment of compensation and the provision of
benefits following the Executive's acquittal or exoneration from criminal
charges that resulted in his suspension shall be limited with respect to the
period of up to two (2) years from the date of suspension.

6. Acknowledgements; Confidential Information; Competitive Activities; Non
   Solicitation.

         6.1      The Executive acknowledges as follows:

                  6.1.1    The Company is in the payments industry and provides
such services both nationally and internationally without limitation to any
geographic area.

                  6.1.2    Since the Company would suffer irreparable harm if
the Executive left the Company's employ and solicited employees of the Company
or otherwise interfered with business relationships of the Company, it is
reasonable to protect the Company against such activities by the Executive for a
limited period of time after the Executive leaves the Company.

                  6.1.3    The covenants contained in Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3 and
6.4 below are reasonably necessary for the protection of the Company and are
reasonably limited with respect to the activities they prohibit, their duration,
their geographical scope and their effect on the Executive and the public. The
purpose and effect of the covenants simply are to protect the Company for a
limited period of time from unfair competition by the Executive.

         6.2      For the purposes of this Agreement, all confidential or
proprietary information concerning the business and affairs of the Company,
including, without limitation, all trade secrets, know how and other information
generally retained on a confidential basis by the Company concerning its
designs, software codes and specifications, formulae, processes, inventions and
discoveries, business plans, pricing, product plans and the identities of, and
the nature of the Company's dealings with, its members, suppliers and customers,
whether or not such information shall, in whole or in part, be subject to or
capable of being protected by patent, copyright or trademark laws, shall
constitute "Confidential Information." The Executive acknowledges that he will
from time to time have access to and obtain knowledge of certain Confidential
Information, and that improper use or revelation thereof by the Executive,
during or after the termination of his employment by the Company, could cause
serious injury to the business of the Company. Accordingly, the Executive agrees
that, unless otherwise required by law, he will forever keep secret and
inviolate all Confidential Information which shall have come or shall hereafter
come into his possession, and that he will not use the same for his own private
benefit, or directly or indirectly for the benefit of others, and that he will
not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person. If the Executive
is legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents,

                                       11

<PAGE>

subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the
Confidential Information, he shall provide the Company with prompt prior written
notice of such legal requirement so that the Company may seek a protective order
or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this
section. In any event, the Executive may furnish only that portion of the
Confidential Information which the Executive is advised by legal counsel is
required, and he shall exercise his best efforts to obtain an order or assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information as is
disclosed. Notwithstanding anything contained herein which may be to the
contrary, the term "Confidential Information" does not include any information
which at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to and
known by the public, other than as a result of a disclosure directly or
indirectly by the Executive.

         6.3      In addition to the acknowledgments by the Executive set forth
in Paragraph 6.1 above, the Executive acknowledges that the services provided
for the Company are a significant factor in the creation of valuable, special
and unique assets which are expected to provide the Company with a competitive
advantage. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that during the Term of Employment,
and thereafter for the duration of the Additional Pay Period or the Recalculated
Additional Pay Period, as applicable, or in the event that the Executive is
ineligible for Additional Pay pursuant to Paragraph 5.2.5(d) hereunder, for a
period of twelve (12) months following Executive's date of termination, the
Executive (whether as an employee, officer, director, partner, proprietor,
investor, associate, executive, consultant, adviser or otherwise) will not,
either directly or indirectly, for the Executive or any third party, engage or
invest in any business or activity which is directly or indirectly in
competition with any business or activity engaged in by the Company or business
or activity in which the Company planned or proposed, to the knowledge of the
Executive, to become engaged including, but not limited to, any credit, charge,
chip or debit card business or processor. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, the Executive shall be deemed to be engaged in any business which any
person for whom he shall perform services is engaged. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit the Executive from having a beneficial
ownership interest of less than 3% of the outstanding amount of any class of
securities of any enterprise (but without otherwise participating in the
activities of such enterprise) if such securities are listed on a national
securities exchange or quoted on an inter-dealer quotation system. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company and Executive agree that Executive may perform
services or engage in business or activities for a MasterCard Member, without
violating the provisions of this Paragraph, provided that Executive may not
perform services or engage in business or activities for a MasterCard Member
that is party to a brand dedication agreement with respect to a significant
portion of its card portfolio with VISA USA, VISA International, American
Express, JCB, Discover, Diners Club, Carte Blanche or any other competitor of
the Company, the term of which is two years or more.

         6.4      During the Term of Employment, and thereafter for the duration
of the Additional Pay Period or the Recalculated Additional Pay Period, as
applicable, or in the

                                       12

<PAGE>

event that the Executive is ineligible for Additional Pay pursuant to Paragraph
5.2.5(d) for a period of twelve (12) months following Executive's date of
termination, the Executive shall not himself, or by assisting any other person
to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any other
employee, agent, consultant or representative to leave the service of the
Company for any reason, or (b) induce any member, customer, supplier or other
person with whom the Company engaged in business, or to the knowledge of the
Executive planned or proposed to engage in business, to terminate any commercial
relationship with the Company or cease to accept or issue its products. Nothing
herein contained shall be deemed to prohibit the Executive from hiring any
employee, agent, consultant or representative of the Company who responds to a
general, written solicitation in any form of media directed at the public in
general.

         6.5      Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4
above, the Executive may at his election, reduce the Additional Pay Period to a
period of not less than twelve (12) months by providing written notice to the
Company of such election. In such case, the restrictions contained in Paragraphs
6.3 and 6.4 shall be in effect only for the duration of such reduced Additional
Pay Period and the Company's obligation to continue to provide any further
Additional Pay with respect to any period subsequent to such reduced Additional
Pay Period under the terms of Paragraphs 5.2.5(d) or provide any further
benefits under the terms of Paragraph 5.2.5(e) shall cease. In the event that
the Company determines, in good faith, that the Executive has breached his
obligations under Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3 or 6.4, the Company shall be under no
obligation to provide any further Additional Pay or provide any further benefits
otherwise due under Paragraphs 5.2.5(d) or (e) above, during the remainder of
the Additional Pay Period. In the event of a judicial determination that the
Executive has breached his obligations under Paragraphs 6.2, 6.3 or 6.4, in
addition to any damages or other relief otherwise available to the Company, the
Executive shall be obligated to reimburse the Company for any Additional Pay
previously received from the Company. In addition, following a judicial
determination, the prevailing party shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the
non-prevailing party for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the
prevailing party in connection with the judicial proceeding seeking to enforce
the provisions of Paragraph 6 hereof.

         6.6      For the purposes of this Agreement, the period of restriction
of confidentiality or proprietary information and competition is intended to
limit disclosure and competition by the Executive to the maximum extent
permitted by law. If it shall be finally determined by any court of competent
jurisdiction ruling on this Agreement that the scope or duration of any
limitation contained in this Agreement is too extensive to be legally
enforceable, then the parties hereby agree that the provisions hereof shall be
construed to be confined to such scope or duration (not greater than that
provided for herein) as shall be legally enforceable, and the Executive hereby
consents to the enforcement of such limitations as so modified.

         6.7      The Executive acknowledges that any violation by him of the
provisions of this Paragraph 6 would cause serious and irreparable damage to the
Company. He

                                       13

<PAGE>

further acknowledges that it might not be possible to measure such damage in
money. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, in the event of a breach or
threatened breach by the Executive of the provisions of this Section, the
Company may seek, in addition to any other rights or remedies, including money
damages, an injunction or restraining order, without the need to post any bond
or other security, prohibiting the Executive from doing or continuing to do any
acts constituting such breach or threatened breach.

7. Reimbursement of Business Expense.

                  During the Term of Employment, subject to and in accordance
with the Company's policies with regard to such matters, the Executive is
authorized to incur reasonable business expenses in carrying out his duties and
responsibilities under the Agreement, and the Company shall promptly reimburse
him for all such properly documented business expenses incurred in accordance
with the Company's travel and business expense reimbursement policy in
connection with carrying out the business of the Company.

8. Indemnity.

                  The Company shall indemnify the Executive, to the fullest
extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, for
any acts or omissions taken or made by the Executive during the Term of
Employment, within the scope of his authority under this Agreement.

9. Miscellaneous.

         9.1      This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York without reference to principles of
conflict of laws. Any legal suit, action or proceeding against any party hereto
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be instituted in a federal or
state court in the State of New York, and each party hereto waives any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding and each party hereto irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or proceeding.

         9.2      Upon the Effective Date, this Agreement and the
Change-in-Control Agreement between the Executive and the Company, entered into
simultaneously herewith, shall incorporate the complete understanding and
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede any and all other prior or contemporaneous agreements,
written or oral, between the Executive and the Company or any predecessor
thereof, with respect to such subject matter. No provision hereof may be
modified or waived except by a written instrument duly executed by the Executive
and the Company.

         9.3      The Executive acknowledges that before entering into this
Agreement he has received a reasonable period of time to consider this Agreement
and has had sufficient time and an opportunity to consult with any attorney or
other advisor of his

                                       14

<PAGE>

choice in connection with this Agreement and all matters contained herein, and
that he has been advised to do so if he so chooses. The Executive further
acknowledges that this Agreement and all terms hereof are fair, reasonable and
are not the result of any fraud, duress, coercion, pressure or undue influence
exercised by the Company, that he has approved and entered into this Agreement
and all of the terms hereof on his own free will, and that no promises or
representations have been made to him by any person to induce him to enter into
this Agreement other than the express terms set forth herein.

         9.4      The Company shall be eligible to deduct and withhold from all
compensation payable to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement all amounts
required to be deducted and withheld therefrom pursuant to any present or future
law, regulation or ordinance of the United States of America or any state or
local jurisdiction therein or any foreign taxing jurisdiction.

         9.5      Paragraph headings are included in this Agreement for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of the
text hereof.

         9.6      Any and all notices, demands or other communications to be
given or made hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
fully given or made when personally delivered, or on the third business day
after mailing from within the continental United States by registered mail,
postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

                  If to the Company:

                  MasterCard International Incorporated
                  2000 Purchase Street
                  Purchase, New York 10577

                  Attention: General Counsel

                  If to the Executive: __________

Either party may change the address to which any notices to it shall be sent by
giving to the other party written notice of such change in conformity with the
foregoing.

         9.7      This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
each of which shall constitute an original but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

         9.8      This Agreement may be assigned by the Company to, and shall
inure to the benefit of, any successor to substantially all the assets and
business of the Company as a going concern, whether by merger, consolidation or
purchase of substantially all of the assets of the Company or otherwise,
provided that such successor shall assume the Company's obligations under this
Agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators,
successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.

                                       15

<PAGE>

         9.9      Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
Executive shall not be eligible to receive any duplicative payment or benefit
hereunder, with respect to any payment or benefit received during the
Change-in-Control Payment Period or the Recalculated Change-in-Control Payment
Period provided under the Executive's Change-in-Control Agreement with the
Company. Any payment or benefit to which the Executive may become eligible
hereunder with respect to the Additional Pay Period or the Recalculated
Additional Pay Period, as applicable, shall take into account any payment or
benefits already received by or provided to the Executive during the
Change-in-Control Payment Period or the Recalculated Change-in-Control Payment
Period under the Executive's Change-in-Control Agreement with the Company, such
that the Executive does not receive the same payment or benefit (or any portion
thereof) twice, but instead shall receive under both this Agreement and the
Change-in-Control Agreement combined, only the equivalent of the full payment or
benefit to which he is then eligible under the operative agreement. This
Paragraph 9.9 shall not affect any accelerated vesting to which the Executive
has or may become eligible under this Agreement or the Executive's
Change-in-Control Agreement.

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Company and the Executive has
executed this Agreement to become effective on the Effective Date.
