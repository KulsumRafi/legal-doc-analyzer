all other times.

                "Adjusted LIBO Rate" means, with respect to any Eurocurrency

                                     - 22 -

<PAGE>

requested Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to
have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. Promptly following
receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the
amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

                SECTION 2.04.   Determination of Dollar Amounts; Required
Payments. The Administrative Agent will determine the Dollar Amount of:

                (a)     each Borrowing as of the date three Business Days prior
to the date of such Borrowing or, if applicable, date of conversion/continuation
of such Advance, and

                (b)     all outstanding Credit Events on and as of the last
Business Day of each quarter and on any other Business Day elected by the
Administrative Agent in its discretion or upon instruction by the Required
Lenders.

Each day upon or as of which the Administrative Agent determines Dollar Amounts
as described in the preceding clauses (a) and (b) is herein described as a
"Computation Date" with respect to each Credit Event for which a Dollar Amount
is determined on or as of such day. If at any time the Dollar Amount of the sum
of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Credit Events (calculated,
with respect to those Credit Events denominated in Agreed Currencies other than
Dollars, as of the most recent Computation Date with respect to each such Credit
Event) exceeds the total Commitments for all the Lenders, the Borrower shall
immediately repay Borrowings and cash collateralize LC Disbursements in an
aggregate principal amount sufficient to eliminate any such excess.

                SECTION 2.05.   Reserved.

                SECTION 2.06.   Letters of Credit.

                (a)     General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit denominated
in an Agreed Currency for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to
the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time
during the Availability Period. In the event of any inconsistency between the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form
of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to,
or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of
Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control; provided,
however, if the Issuing Bank is requested to issue Letters of Credit with
respect to a jurisdiction the Issuing Bank deems, in its sole discretion, may at
any time subject it to a New Money Credit Event, the Borrower shall, at the
request of the Issuing Bank, guaranty and indemnify the Issuing Bank against any
and all costs, liabilities and losses resulting from any New Money Credit Event
in a form and substance satisfactory to the Issuing Bank.

                (b)     Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension;
Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the
amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the
Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic
communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing

                                     - 23 -

<PAGE>

Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of
the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice
requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of
Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on
which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c)
of this Section), the Dollar Amount of such Letter of Credit, the Agreed
Currency applicable thereto, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and
such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend
such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall
submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in
connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be
issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to
represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension (i) the Dollar Amount of the sum of the LC Exposure shall
not exceed $15,000,000 and (ii) the total Revolving Credit Exposures shall not
exceed the total Commitments.

                (c)     Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at
or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after
the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any
renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii)
the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.

                (d)     Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit
(or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and
without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the
Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from
the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such
Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate Dollar Amount available to be
drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's
Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not
reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this
Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower
for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of
Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

                (e)     Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that
such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such
LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if
such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such
date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business
Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to
10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such

                                     - 24 -

<PAGE>

notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt;
provided that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth
herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be
financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing in its Dollar Amount and, to the extent
so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged
and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to
make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of
the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in
respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly
following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative
Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in
the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such
Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment
obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to
the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly
following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower
pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such
payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments
pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders
and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender
pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement
(other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans as contemplated above) shall not
constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse such LC Disbursement.

                (f)     Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to
reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and irrespective of

                (i)     any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
        Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein,

                (ii)    any draft or other document presented under a Letter of
        Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any
        statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect,

                (iii)   payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit
        against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
        with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or

                (iv)    any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or
        not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions
        of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
        provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder.
        Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor
        any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility
        by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any
        Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment
        thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the
        preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay
        in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication
        under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document
        required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in

                                     - 25 -

<PAGE>

        interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes
        beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing
        shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the
        Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to
        consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by
        the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the
        Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care
        when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a
        Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto
        expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful
        misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a
        court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to
        have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the
        foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree
        that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to
        be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the
        Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment
        upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation,
        regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to
        accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in
        strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

                (g)     Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall,
promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall
promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank
has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure
to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its
obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any
such LC Disbursement.

                (h)     Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans (or
in the case such LC Disbursement is denominated in an Agreed Currency other than
Dollars, at the rate determined in good faith by the Issuing Bank to represent
the Issuing Bank's cost of overnight or short-term funds in the applicable
Agreed Currency plus the then effective Applicable Rate with respect to
Eurocurrency Revolving Loans); provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse
such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then
Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall
be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and
after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to
the extent of such payment.

                (i)     Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be
replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the
Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the
Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of
any such replacement, (i)

                                     - 26 -

<PAGE>

the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued
thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed
to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor
and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the
replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain
a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it
prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters
of Credit.

                (j)     Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall
occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice
from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of
the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing at least
51% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant
to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the
Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the
benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such
date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation
to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such
deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice
of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the
Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. Such deposit shall be
held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance
of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative
Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right
of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the
investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and
sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk and
expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on
such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall
be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC
Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so
applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of
the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure
representing at least 51% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other
obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to
provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of
an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall
be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of
Default have been cured or waived.

                SECTION 2.07.   Funding of Borrowings.

                (a)     Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it
hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available
funds (i) in the case of each Loan denominated in Dollars, by 12:00 noon, New
York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently
designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders and (ii) in the case
of each Loan denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars, by 12:00
noon, local time, in the city of the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment
Office for such currency and at such Eurocurrency Payment Office for such
currency. If any Borrowing made (or to be made) on or after the Euro
Implementation Date would, but for the provisions of

                                     - 27 -

<PAGE>

this Section 2.07, be capable of being made in either the Euro or in a National
Currency Unit, such Borrowing shall be made in the Euro. The Administrative
Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the
amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained
with the Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by the Borrower in
the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to
finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e)
shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.

                (b)     Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such
Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share
of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made
such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this
Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made
its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent,
then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available
to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds
Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance
with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the
Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such
amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such
Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

                SECTION 2.08.   Interest Elections.

                (a)     Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type
specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency
Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing
to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a
Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as
provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect
to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion
shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such
Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a
separate Borrowing.

                (b)     To make an election pursuant to this Section, the
Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by
the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the
Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such
election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic
Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly
by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest
Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by
the Borrower.

                (c)     Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request
shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

                                     - 28 -

<PAGE>

                (i)     the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
        applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
        different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each
        resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified
        pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each
        resulting Borrowing);

                (ii)    the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
        Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                (iii)   whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
        Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and

                (iv)    if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing,
        the Agreed Currency and Interest Period to be applicable thereto after
        giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by
        the definition of the term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

                (d)     Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

                (e)     If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest
Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing prior to the
end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is
repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period (i) in the case of
a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR
Borrowing and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Currency
other than Dollars, such Borrowing shall automatically continue as a
Eurocurrency Borrowing in the same Agreed Currency with an Interest Period of
one month unless (x) such Eurocurrency Borrowing is or was repaid in accordance
with Section 2.7 or (y) the Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent
an Interest Election Request requesting that, at the end of such Interest
Period, such Eurocurrency Borrowing continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing for the
same or another Interest Period. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof,
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative
Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then,
so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving
Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii)
unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an
ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

                SECTION 2.09.   Termination and Reduction of Commitments.

                (a)     Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall
terminate on the Maturity Date.

                (b)     The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to
time reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the
Commitments shall be in an amount that is

                                     - 29 -

<PAGE>

an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the
Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect
to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans and reimbursement of LC Disbursements
in accordance with Section 2.11, the Dollar Amount of the sum of the Revolving
Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.

                (c)     The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of
any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this
Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice
of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such
notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in
which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments
shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably
among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.

                SECTION 2.10.   Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

                (a)     The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i)
to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid
principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Maturity Date.

                (b)     Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

                (c)     The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in
which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class,
Agreed Currency and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto,
(ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due
and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of
any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the
Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

                (d)     The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                (e)     Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be
evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare,
execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of
such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered
assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the
Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times

                                     - 30 -

<PAGE>

(including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or
more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named
therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its
registered assigns).

                SECTION 2.11.   Prepayment of Loans.

                (a)     The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from
time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to (i) prior
notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section and (ii) the payment of
the funding compensation required by Section 2.16.

                (b)     The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New
York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the
case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New
York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice
shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal
amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid, provided that, if a
notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of
termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice
of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in
accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice
relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the
Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving
Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an
advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2,02.
Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans
included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued
interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.

                SECTION 2.12.   Fees.

                (a)     (i) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee, which shall accrue at the
Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether
used or unused) during the period from and including the date hereof but
excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates; provided that, if such
Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment
terminates, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount
of such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which
its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases
to have any Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in
arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and
on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such
date to occur after the date hereof; provided that any facility fees accruing
after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand.
All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).

                        (ii) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender a utilization fee, which shall accrue at
the rate of 0.125% on the average daily

                                     - 31 -

<PAGE>

Revolving Credit Exposures for such Lender during the period from and including
the date when the total Revolving Credit Exposures for all the Lenders exceeds
50% of the total Commitments for all the Lenders to but excluding the date on
which such Lender's Commitment terminates; provided that, if such Lender
continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates,
then such utilization fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such
Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its
Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to
have any Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued utilization fees shall be payable in
arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and
on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such
date to occur after the date hereof; provided that any utilization fee accruing
after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand.
All utilization fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and
shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day
but excluding the last day).

                (b)     The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable
Rate as interest on Eurocurrency Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of
such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to
unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the
Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's
Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC
Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the
rate of 0.125% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure
(excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements)
during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the
later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there
ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with
respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit
or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees
accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such
last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the
Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the
Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the
Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after
demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis
of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day).

                (c)     The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent,
for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately
agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

                (d)     All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates
due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the
Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case
of facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be
refundable under any circumstances.

                SECTION 2.13.   Interest.

                (a)     The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear
interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

                (b)     The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall
bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for
such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.

                (c)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or
interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower
hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or
otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before
judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of
any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the
preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2%
plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this
Section.

                (d)     Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in
arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of
Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Commitments; provided that (i) interest
accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand,
(ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a
prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability
Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be
payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of
any conversion of any Eurocurrency Revolving Loan prior to the end of the
current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable
on the effective date of such conversion.

                (e)     All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of
a year of 360 days, except that interest (i) computed by reference to the
Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime
Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap
year) and (ii) for Borrowings denominated in British Pounds Sterling shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days, and in each case shall be payable
for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the
last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate
shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

                SECTION 2.14.   Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing:

                (a)     the Administrative Agent determines (which determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as
applicable, for such Interest Period; or

                (b)     the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required
Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such
Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders
(or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such
Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent

                                     - 33 -

<PAGE>

notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such
notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the
conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving
Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective, (ii) if any
Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing
shall be made as an ABR Borrowing; provided that if the circumstances giving
rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of
Borrowings shall be permitted.

                SECTION 2.15.   Increased Costs.

                (a)     If any Change in Law shall:

                (i)     impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
        deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
        the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such
        reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing
        Bank; or

                (ii)    impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London
        interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
        Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or
        participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan (including, without limitation, pursuant to any
conversion of any Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Euro
into a Borrowing denominated in Euro) or to increase the cost to such Lender or
the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of
Credit (including, without limitation, pursuant to any conversion of any
Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Euro into a Borrowing
denominated in Euro) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable
by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder, whether of principal, interest or
otherwise (including, without limitation, pursuant to any conversion of any
Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Euro into a Borrowing
denominated in Euro), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs
incurred or reduction suffered.

                (b)     If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any
Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on
the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters
of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing
Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such
Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company
with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay
to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's
or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

                                     - 34 -

<PAGE>

                (c)     A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting
forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing
Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a)
or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such
certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

                (d)     Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the
Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such
compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a
Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or
reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the
Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that,
if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is
retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to
include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

                SECTION 2.16.   Break Funding Payments. In the event of

                (a)     the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan
other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including
as a result of an Event of Default),

                (b)     the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on
the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto,

                (c)     the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any
Revolving Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto
(regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(b) and is
revoked in accordance therewith), or

                (d)     the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on
the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request
by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower
shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such
event. In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any
Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the
excess, if any, of

                (i)     the amount of interest which would have accrued on the
        principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the
        Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the
        period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current
        Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow,
        convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest
        Period for such Loan), over

                (ii)    the amount of interest which would accrue on such
        principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender
        would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for
        deposits in the relevant currency of a comparable amount and period from
        other banks in the eurocurrency market. A certificate of any Lender
        setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to
        receive

                                     - 35 -

<PAGE>

        pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be
        conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the
        amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt
        thereof.

                SECTION 2.17.   Taxes.

                (a)     Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation
of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction
for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be
required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then

                (i)     the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
        after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
        additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent,
        Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to
        the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,

                (ii)    the Borrower shall make such deductions and

                (iii)   the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
        relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                (b)     In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                (c)     The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor,
for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or
with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower
hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest
and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or
not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount
of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the
Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a
Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                (d)     As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                (e)     Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from
or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable
law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable

                                     - 36 -

<PAGE>

law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

                SECTION 2.18.   Payments Generally: Pro Rata Treatment: Sharing
of Set-offs.

                (a)     The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made
by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC
Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or
otherwise) prior to (i) in the case of payments denominated in Dollars, 12:00
noon, New York City time and (ii) in the case of payments denominated in an
Agreed Currency other than Dollars, 12:00 noon, local time, in the city of the
Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, in each
case on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or
counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the
discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the
next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All
such payments shall be made (i) in the same currency in which the applicable
Credit Event was made (or where such currency has been converted to the Euro, in
the Euro) and (ii) to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park
Avenue, New York, New York or, in the case of a Borrowing denominated in an
Agreed Currency other than Dollars, the Administrative Agent's Eurocurrency
Payment Office, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank as
expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15,
2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The
Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments denominated in the same
currency received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate
recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be
due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended
to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing
interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making
of any Credit Event in any currency other than Dollars, currency control or
exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with
the result that the type of currency in which the Credit Event was made (the
"Original Currency") no longer exists or the Borrower is not able to make
payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such
Original Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in
such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to
the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being
the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrower takes all risks of the
imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations. For purposes of
this Section 2.18(a), the commencement of the third stage of European Economic
and Monetary Union and the occurrence of the Euro Implementation Date shall not
constitute the imposition of currency control or exchange regulations.

                (b)     If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied

                (i)     first, towards payment of interest and fees then due
        hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with
        the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and

                                     - 37 -

<PAGE>

                (ii)    second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC
        Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled
        thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC
        Disbursements then due to such parties.

                (c)     If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off
or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or
resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the
aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements
and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender,
then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at
face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of
all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the
aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective
Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; provided that

                (i)     if any such participations are purchased and all or any
        portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
        participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the
        extent of such recovery, without interest, and

                (ii)    the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed
        to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in
        accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment
        obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
        participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements
        to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any
        Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this
        paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and
        agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law,
        that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing
        arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and
        counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such
        Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
        participation.

                (d)     Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent
may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance
herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the
Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including
the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment
to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation.

<PAGE>

                (e)     If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to
be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b) or 2.18(d),
then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any
contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

                SECTION 2.19.   Mitigation Obligations: Replacement of Lenders.

                (a)     If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15,
or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17,
then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending
office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in
the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment

                (i)     would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
        Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and

                (ii)    would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost
        or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.
        The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses
        incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or
        assignment.

                (b)     If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15,
or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that

                (i)     the Borrower shall have received the prior written
        consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Commitment is being
        assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be
        withheld,

                (ii)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount
        equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC
        Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other
        amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of
        such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the
        Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and

                (iii)   in the case of any such assignment resulting from a
        claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be
        made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a
        reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be
        required to make any such assignment and delegation

                                     - 39 -

<PAGE>

        if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise,
        the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and
        delegation cease to apply.

                SECTION 2.20.   Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a
Lender determines the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by
such Lender, any relevant office, branch, subsidiary or affiliate of such Lender
or any corporation controlling such Lender is increased as a result of a Change,
then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such
Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of
return on the portion of such increased capital which such Lender determines is
attributable to this Agreement, its Loans or its Commitment to make Loans
hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's policies as to capital
adequacy). "Change" means (i) any change after the date of this Agreement in the
Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (ii) any adoption of or change in any other
law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline,
interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the
date of this Agreement which affects the amount of capital required or expected
to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation
controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based
capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the date of this Agreement,
including transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations
promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the
July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory
Practices Entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and
Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any amendments to such
regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.

                SECTION 2.21.   Market Disruption. Notwithstanding the
satisfaction of all conditions referred to in Article II and Article IV with
respect to any Credit Event to be effected in any Agreed Currency other than
Dollars, if (i) there shall occur on or prior to the date of such Credit Event
any change in national or international financial, political or economic
conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls which would in the
reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank (if such Credit
Event is a Letter of Credit) or the Required Lenders make it impracticable for
the Eurocurrency Borrowings or Letters of Credit comprising such Credit Event to
be denominated in the Agreed Currency specified by the Borrower, (ii) such
currency is no longer an Eligible Currency or (iii) an Equivalent Amount of such
currency is not readily calculable, then the Administrative Agent shall
forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower, the Lenders and, if such Credit
Event is a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank, and such Credit Events shall not
be denominated in such Agreed Currency but shall, except as otherwise set forth
in Section 2.07, be made on the date of such Credit Event in Dollars, (a) if
such Credit Event is a Borrowing, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Credit
Event Request or Interest Election Request, as the case may be, as ABR Loans,
unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least one Business Day
before such date that (i) it elects not to borrow on such date or (ii) it elects
to borrow on such date in a different Agreed Currency, as the case may be, in
which the denomination of such Loans would in the opinion of the Administrative
Agent and the Required Lenders be practicable and in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in
the related Credit Event Request or Interest Election Request, as the case may
be or (b) if such Credit Event is a Letter of Credit, in a face amount equal to
the Dollar Amount of the face amount specified in the related request

                                     - 40 -

<PAGE>

or application for such Letter of Credit, unless the Borrower notifies the
Administrative Agent at least one Business Day before such date that (i) it
elects not to request the issuance of such Letter of Credit on such date or (ii)
it elects to have such Letter of Credit issued on such date in a different
Agreed Currency, as the case may be, in which the denomination of such Letter of
Credit would in the opinion of the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and
the Required Lenders be practicable and in face amount equal to the Dollar
Amount of the face amount specified in the related request or application for
such Letter of Credit, as the case may be.

                SECTION 2.22.   Judgment Currency. If for the purposes of
obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the
Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the
"specified currency") into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the
fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used
shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the
Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other
currency at the Administrative Agent's main New York City office on the Business
Day preceding that on which final, non-appealable judgment is given. The
obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the
Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency
other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the
Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as
the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such
Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with
normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such
other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less
than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the
case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest
extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and
notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount
of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any
Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified
currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of
allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under
Section 2.18, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be,
agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

            The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

                SECTION 3.01.   Organization; Powers: Subsidiaries. Each of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all
requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and,
except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to
do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such
qualification is required. Schedule 3.02 hereto identifies each Subsidiary, the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be, the
percentage of issued and outstanding shares of each class of its capital stock
or other

                                     - 41 -

<PAGE>

equity interests owned by the Borrower and the other Subsidiaries and, if such
percentage is not 100% (excluding directors' qualifying shares as required by
law), a description of each class issued and outstanding. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock and other equity interests of each Subsidiary are
validly issued and outstanding and fully paid and nonassessable and all such
shares and other equity interests indicated on Schedule 3.02 as owned by the
Borrower or another Subsidiary are owned, beneficially and of record, by the
Borrower or such Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens, other than Liens
created by the Collateral Documents. There are no outstanding commitments or
other obligations of any Subsidiary to issue, and no options, warrants or other
rights of any Person to acquire, any shares of any class of capital stock or
other equity interests of any Subsidiary.

                SECTION 3.02.   Authorization: Enforceability. The Transactions
are within the Borrower's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate and, if required, stockholder action. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general
principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law.

                SECTION 3.03.   Governmental Approvals: No Conflicts. The
Transactions

                (a)     do not require any consent or approval of, registration
or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such
as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect,

                (b)     will not violate any applicable law or regulation or the
charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority,

                (c)     will not violate or result in a default under any
indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or its assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any
payment to be made by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and

                (d)     will not result in the creation or imposition of any
Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

                SECTION 3.04.   Financial Condition: No Material Adverse Change.

                (a)     The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its
consolidated balance sheet and statements of income, stockholders equity and
cash flows

                (i)     as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000,
        reported on by Arthur Andersen LLP, independent public accountants, and
        (ii) as of and for the fiscal quarter and the portion of the fiscal year
        ended September 30, 2001, certified by its chief financial officer. Such
        financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
        financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the
        Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for such
        periods in accordance with

                                     - 42 -

<PAGE>

        GAAP, subject to yearend audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes
        in the case of the statements referred to in clause (ii) above.

                (b)     Since September 30, 2001, except as otherwise disclosed
by the Borrower in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2001, there
has been no Material Adverse Change.

                SECTION 3.05.   Properties.

                (a)     Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has good title
to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real and personal property material
to its business, except for minor defects in title that do not interfere with
its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such
properties for their intended purposes.

                (b)     Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is
licensed to use, all trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other
intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other
Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                SECTION 3.06.   Litigation, Labor Matters and Environmental
Matters.

                (a)     There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before
any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of
the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse
determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other
than the Disclosed Matters) or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the
Transactions.

                (b)     There are no labor controversies pending against or, to
the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries (i) which could reasonably be expected, individually or
in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) that involve
this Agreement or the Transactions.

                (c)     Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect
to any other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither the
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries

                (i)     has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to
        obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval
        required under any Environmental Law,

                (ii)    has become subject to any Environmental Liability,

                (iii)   has received notice of any claim with respect to any
        Environmental Liability or

                (iv)    knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability.

                                     - 43 -

<PAGE>

                (d)     Since the date of this Agreement, there has been no
change in the status of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, has resulted in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a
Material Adverse Effect.

                SECTION 3.07.   Compliance with Laws and Agreements; No
Burdensome Restrictions. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is in
compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority
applicable to it or its property and all indentures, agreements and other
instruments binding upon it or its property, except where the failure to do so,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is party or
subject to any law, regulation, rule or order, or any obligation under any
agreement or instrument, that has a Material Adverse Effect.

                SECTION 3.08.   Investment and Holding Company Status. Neither
the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment company" as
defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940
or (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

                SECTION 3.09.   Taxes. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports required to
have been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have
been paid by it, except

                (a)     Taxes that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or

                (b)     to the extent that the failure to do so could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                SECTION 3.10.   ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA
Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all
accumulated benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used
for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as
of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts,
exceed by more than $2,500,000 the fair market value of the assets of such Plan,
and the present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded
Plans (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent
financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $2,500,000 the
fair market value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans.

                SECTION 3.11.   Disclosure. The Borrower has disclosed to the
Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which
it or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to it,
that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Information Memorandum nor any of the
other reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished
by or on behalf of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in

                                     - 44 -

<PAGE>

connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder (as
modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contained, when
furnished, any untrue statement of a fact or omitted to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements contained therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading; provided
that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents
only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions
believed to be reasonable at the time of such preparation.

                SECTION 3.12.   No Default. The Borrower is in full compliance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and no Default has occurred and
in continuing.

                SECTION 3.13.   Liens. There are no Liens on any of the real or
personal properties of the Borrower or any Subsidiary except for Liens created
by the Collateral Documents and except as otherwise permitted by Section 6.02.

                SECTION 3.14.   Contingent Obligations. Other than any liability
incident to any litigation, arbitration or proceeding which could not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the Borrower has no material
contingent obligations not provided for or disclosed in the financial statements
referred to in Section 3.04.

                SECTION 3.15.   Regulation U. Margin stock (as defined in
Regulation U) constitutes less than 25% of the value of those assets of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries which are subject to any limitation on sale,
pledge, or other restriction hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                   Conditions

                SECTION 4.01.   Effective Date. The obligations of the Lenders

party has signed a counterpart of the Subsidiary Guaranty.

                (b)     The Administrative Agent shall have received a favorable
written opinion (addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and dated
the Effective Date) of the Chief Legal Officer for the Borrower and the

other matters relating to the Borrower and the Subsidiary

                                     - 45 -

<PAGE>

Guarantors, this Agreement, the Subsidiary Guaranty or the Transactions as the
Required Lenders shall reasonably request.

                (c)     The Administrative Agent shall have received such

Transactions, all in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent
and its counsel.

                (d)     All governmental and third-party approvals necessary in

                (f)     The Administrative Agent shall have received all fees
and other amounts due and payable on or prior to the Effective Date, including,

terminated and cancelled and all Indebtedness outstanding thereunder has been
fully repaid or will be fully repaid with the initial extension of credit

The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the
Effective Date, and such notice shall be conclusive and binding. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and of the Issuing

such conditions are not so satisfied or waived, the Commitments shall terminate
at such time).

                SECTION 4.02.   Each Credit Event. The obligation of each Lender
to make a Loan on the occasion of any Borrowing, and of the Issuing Bank to
issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, is subject to the
satisfaction of the following conditions:

                (a)     The representations and warranties of the Borrower set

such Borrowing or the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such Letter
of Credit, as applicable, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

                                     - 46 -

<PAGE>

Each Borrowing and each issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of a Letter of
Credit shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by the
Borrower on the date thereof as to the matters specified in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section.

                                    ARTICLE V

                              Affirmative Covenants

                Until the Commitments have expired or been terminated and the
principal of and interest on each Loan and all fees payable hereunder shall have
been paid in full and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or terminated and
all LC Disbursements shall have been reimbursed, the Borrower covenants and
agrees with the Lenders that:

                SECTION 5.01.   Financial Statements and Other Information. The
Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender:

                (a)     within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year of the
Borrower, its audited consolidated balance sheet and related statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows as of the end of and for such
year, setting forth in each case in comparative form the figures for the
previous fiscal year, all reported on by Arthur Andersen LLP or other
independent public accountants of recognized national standing (without a "going
concern" or like qualification or exception and without any qualification or
exception as to the scope of such audit) to the effect that such consolidated
financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial
condition and results of operations of the Borrower and its consolidated
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied;

Guaranty (in the case of LeadersOnline) or a guarantee agreement (in the case of
the German Subsidiary), accompanied by legal opinions, resolutions and such
other instruments and documents as are in form and substance acceptable to the
Administrative Agent (provided that, in the event the German Subsidiary is
treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the German

after any Subsidiary becomes a First Tier Foreign Subsidiary, a Pledge Agreement
in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Holders of Secured
Obligations with respect to the lesser of (i) 100% (or 65% if a 100% pledge
would cause disadvantageous tax implications for the Borrower or any Domestic
Subsidiary under Section 956 of the Code) of all of the outstanding Capital
Stock of each First Tier Foreign Subsidiary and (ii) all the outstanding Capital
Stock of each First Tier Foreign Subsidiary then or thereafter owned by one or
more of the Borrower and its Domestic Subsidiaries; provided that no such pledge
of the Capital Stock of a First Tier Foreign Subsidiary shall be required
hereunder to the extent such pledge is prohibited by applicable law or the
Administrative Agent and its counsel reasonably determine that such pledge would
not provide material Collateral for the benefit of the Holders of Secured
Obligations pursuant to legally binding, valid and enforceable Pledge
Agreements. The Borrower further agrees to deliver to the Administrative Agent
all such Pledge Agreements and other Collateral Documents, together with
appropriate corporate resolutions and other documentation (including legal
opinions, the stock certificates representing the Capital Stock subject to such
pledge, stock powers with respect thereto executed in blank, and such other
documents as shall be reasonably requested to perfect the Lien of such pledge)
in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent, and in a manner that the Administrative Agent shall be reasonably
satisfied that it has a first priority perfected pledge of or charge over the
Collateral related thereto.

as are reasonably incidental thereto.

                The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall
have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and
such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing,

any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the
Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders
(or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under
the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and

                (c)     except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative
Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the
failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as
Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent

or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of
the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section
9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless
and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the
Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for
or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into

                (i)     any statement, warranty or representation made in or in
        connection with this Agreement,

                (ii)    the contents of any certificate, report or other
        document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith,

                (iii)   the performance or observance of any of the covenants,
        agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein,

                (iv)    the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or
        genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or
        document,

                (v)     the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article
        IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly
        required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent, or

                (vi)    the perfection or priority of any of the Liens on any of
        the Collateral.

                The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and
shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed
by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person, The
Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not
incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult
with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts.

                The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties
and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

                Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor

                                     - 62 -

<PAGE>

shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted
such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives
notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf
of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent
which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of
any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative
Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor
Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was
acting as Administrative Agent.

                Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder

                Each Lender authorizes the Administrative Agent to enter into
each of the Collateral Documents to which the Administrative Agent is from time
to time a party and to take all action contemplated by such documents. Each
Lender agrees that no Holder of Secured Obligations (other than the
Administrative Agent) shall have the right individually to seek to realize upon
the security granted by any Collateral Document, it being understood and agreed
that such rights and remedies may be exercised solely by the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Holders of Secured Obligations upon the terms of
the Collateral Documents.

                In the event that any Collateral is hereafter pledged by any
Person as collateral security for the Obligations, the Administrative Agent is
hereby authorized to execute and deliver on behalf of the Holders of Secured
Obligations any Loan Documents necessary or appropriate to grant and perfect a
Lien on such Collateral in favor of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the
Holders of Secured Obligations.

                The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent, at its
option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the
Administrative Agent upon any Collateral (i) upon termination of the Commitments
and payment and satisfaction of all of the Obligations at any time arising under
or in respect of this Agreement or the Loan Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby; (ii) as permitted by, but only in accordance
with, the terms of the applicable Loan Document; or (iii) if approved,
authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders, unless such release
is required to be approved by all of the Lenders hereunder. Upon request by the
Administrative Agent at any time, the Lenders will

                                     - 63 -

<PAGE>

confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to release particular
types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Article VIII.

                Upon any sale or transfer of assets constituting Collateral
which is expressly permitted pursuant to the terms of any Loan Document, or
consented to in writing by the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, as
applicable, and upon at least five (5) Business Days' prior written request by
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably
authorized by the Lenders to) execute such documents as may be necessary to
evidence the release of the Liens granted to the Administrative Agent for the
benefit of the Holders of Secured Obligations herein or pursuant hereto upon the
Collateral that was sold or transferred; provided, however, that (i) the
Administrative Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms
which, in the Administrative Agent's opinion, would expose the Administrative
Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than
the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (ii) such release
shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Secured Obligations or
any Liens upon (or obligations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of)
all interests retained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, including (without
limitation) the proceeds of the sale, all of which shall continue to constitute
part of the Collateral.

                SECTION 9.02.   Waivers: Amendments.

                (a)     No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.
No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the
Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the
Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

                (b)     Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be
waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in
writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided
that no such agreement shall

                (i)     increase the Commitment of any Lender without the
        written consent of such Lender,

                (ii)    reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC
        Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees
        payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected
        thereby,

                (iii)   postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal
        amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any
        fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any
        such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any
        Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,

                (iv)    change Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would
        alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the
        written consent of each Lender,

                (v)     change any of the provisions of this Section or the
        definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof
        specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend
        or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any
        consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; provided
        further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect
        the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank
        hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent,
        the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, or

                (vi)    other than pursuant to a transaction permitted by the
        terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, release all or
        substantially all of the Collateral which is subject to the Loan
        Documents.

                (a)     The Borrower shall pay

                (i)     all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
        Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees,
        charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in
        connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for
        herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement or any
        amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether
        or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
        consummated),

                (ii)    all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
        Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or
        extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder
        and

                (iii)   all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
        Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the
        reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the
        Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with
        the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this
        Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in connection
        with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all
        such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring
        or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

                (b)     The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing
Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of

                (i)     the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any
        agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the
        parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the
        consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated
        hereby,

                (ii)    any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds
        therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand
        for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in
        connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of
        such Letter of Credit),

                (iii)   any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous
        Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or
        any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any
        way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or

                (iv)    any actual or prospective claim, litigation,
        investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether
        based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether
        any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity

                                     - 66 -

<PAGE>

        shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
        losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from
        the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

                (c)     To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount
required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank under
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such Lender's
Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank in its capacity as such.

                (d)     To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower
shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any

as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated
hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the
proceeds thereof.

                (e)     All amounts due under this Section shall be payable
promptly not later than fifteen days after written demand therefor.

                SECTION 9.04.   Successors and Assigns.

                (a)     The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that
issues any Letter of Credit), except that the Borrower may not assign or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the
Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any
Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related
Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders)
any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this
Agreement.

                (b)     Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that

                (i)     except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a
        Lender Affiliate, each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
        (and, in the case of an assignment of all or a portion of a Commitment
        or any Lender's obligations in respect of its LC Exposure, the Issuing
        Bank) must give their prior written consent to such assignment (which
        consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided that no such
        consent of the Borrower shall be required at any time a Default has
        occurred and is then continuing,

                                     - 67 -

<PAGE>

                (ii)    except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
        Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of
        the assigning Lender's Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the
        assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the
        date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is
        delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000
        unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise
        consent,

                (iii)   each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment
        of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and
        obligations under this Agreement,

                (iv)    the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver
        to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with
        a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and

                (v)     the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver
        to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; and
        provided further that any consent of the Borrower otherwise required
        under this paragraph shall not be required if an Event of Default under
        clause (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing. Subject
        to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this
        Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment
        and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to
        the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,
        have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and
        the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
        assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
        obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
        Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
        under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but
        shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16,
        2.17 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
        obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
        paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by
        such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
        accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.

                (c)     The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New
York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for
the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment
of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes
of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                (d)     Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's
completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a
Lender hereunder), the processing and

                                     - 68 -

<PAGE>

recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written
consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the
information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective
for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as
provided in this paragraph.

                (e)     Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, sell participants to one or more banks
or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that

                (i)     such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall
        remain unchanged,

                (ii)    such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
        parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and

                (iii)   the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank
        and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with
        such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations
        under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a
        Lender sells such a participant shall provide that such Lender shall
        retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any
        amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
        provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender
        will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
        amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to
        Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f)
        of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be
        entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same
        extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
        assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent
        permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the
        benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such
        Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a
        Lender.

                (f)     A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have
been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made
with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign
Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17
unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant
and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with
Section 2.17(e) as though it were a Lender.

                (g)     Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

                SECTION 9.05.   Survival. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to
this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties
hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any
investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had
notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at
the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any
fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid
or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not
expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and
Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the
Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the

in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

of the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of
whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and
although such obligations may be unmatured, The rights of each Lender under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
setoff) which such Lender may have.
