Ladies and Gentlemen:

        Reference is made to (i) the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 17,
1999, among U.S.I. Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Borrower"), the lenders from time to time party thereto (each a "Lender" and
collectively, the "Lenders"), Credit Lyonnais Cayman Island Branch ("Credit
Lyonnais"), as Administrative Agent and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as successor to The
Chase Manhattan Bank ("JPMorgan"), as Syndication Agent (as amended, modified or
supplemented through the date hereof, the "Credit Agreement") and (ii) the
Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated as of January 31, 2003, among
the Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Syndication Agent
(the "Eighth Amendment"). All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
defined herein shall have the respective meanings provided such terms in the
Credit Agreement.

        By your signature below, you agree to pay the following non-refundable
fees:

Amendment Fee:             An amendment fee, to be earned by and payable to
                           each Lender which approves the Eighth Amendment,
                           equal to 0.50% of the sum of the total outstanding
                           Term Loans and the Revolving Credit Commitment of
                           each such Lender, in each case, as of the effective
                           date of the Eighth

<PAGE>

                           Amendment (the "Eighth Amendment Effective Date"),
                           which amendment fee shall due and payable on the
                           Eighth Amendment Effective Date.

Structuring Fee:           A structuring fee in an amount equal to 0.50% of
                           the sum of the total outstanding Term Loans and the
                           Revolving Credit Commitment, in each case, as of
                           Eighth Amendment Effective Date, which structuring
                           fee shall be earned by and due and payable to
                           JPMorgan on the Eighth Amendment Effective Date.

Refinancing Fee:           A refinancing fee in an amount equal to 0.50% of
                           the sum of the total outstanding Term Loans and the
                           Revolving Credit Commitment, in each case, as of
                           October 1, 2003, which refinancing fee shall be
                           earned by and due and payable to JPMorgan on October
                           1, 2003 if all of the Loans under the Credit
                           Agreement have not been repaid and all of the
                           Commitments thereunder terminated as of such date.

        Furthermore, it is hereby agreed that if by July 31, 2003, the Borrower
retains in writing JPMorgan (or its affiliates), alone or with others, to
structure and arrange a new senior credit facility (the "2003 Senior Credit
Facility"), then the amount of any refinancing fee that is subsequently paid to
JPMorgan pursuant to the caption "Refinancing Fee" in this letter shall be
credited towards any fees otherwise receivable by JPMorgan (or any of its
affiliates) in connection with the 2003 Senior Credit Facility. It is understood
and agreed that this letter shall not constitute or give rise to any obligation
on the part of JPMorgan to participate in the arrangement of, or provide or
commit to provide any financing under, the 2003 Senior Credit Facility.

        Reference is made to the Fee Letter, dated as of March 29, 2002, among
the Borrower, Credit Lyonnais and JPMorgan (the "March 2002 Fee Letter").
JPMorgan hereby waives any right to receive the advisory fee required to be paid
pursuant to the caption "Advisory Fee" in the March 2002 Fee Letter.

        This Fee Letter may not be amended or waived except by an instrument in
writing signed by JPMorgan and you. This Fee Letter shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. This Fee Letter
may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an
original, and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute one agreement.
Delivery of an executed signature page of this Fee Letter by facsimile
transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart
hereof.

        This Fee Letter is delivered to you on the understanding that neither
this Fee Letter nor any of its terms or substance shall be disclosed, directly
or indirectly, to any other person except (a) to your officers, agents and
advisors who are directly involved in the consideration of this matter or (b) as
may be compelled in a judicial or administrative proceeding or as otherwise
required by law (in which case you agree to inform us promptly thereof).
