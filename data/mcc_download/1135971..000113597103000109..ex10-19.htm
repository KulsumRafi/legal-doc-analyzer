<FONT SIZE=3><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Potomac Electric Power Company Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "Pepco plan") was established, effective July 1, 1986, to provide supplemental retirement benefits to key executives of Pepco. The Pepco plan was amended from time to time thereafter. On March 28, 2002, further amendments were authorized to the Pepco plan to recognize the intent to consummate a transaction (the "Merger") by which Pepco and Conectiv would become wholly owned subsidiaries of Pepco Holdings, Inc. (the "Company" or "Pepco Holdings") and, for the near term future, to maintain for the benefit of the executives of Pepco Holdings and its subsidiaries, the level of benefits provided to such executives by their respective employers prior to the merger. Such amendments include  authorization to name Pepco Holdings as the sponsor of the Pepco plan; to change the name of the Pepco plan to reflect the change in plan sponsorship; to amend the section of the plan relating to eligibility to participate; and to delete all references to the Pepco General Retirement Plan, and to replace all such references to Pepco's General Retirement Plan with "the principal defined benefit pension plan of Pepco Holdings or one of its subsidiaries in which the employee participates".  The Pepco plan, as amended, is restated herein and is now known as the Pepco Holdings, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Section 3.1 defines the amount of retirement income which
will be paid to a Participant (who terminated employment on
or after attaining age 59 for any reason other than death)
to supplement other pension benefits. The amount of retirement
benefits payable from this Plan in the Applicable Form of
Benefit shall be the difference, if any, between (i) the
amount of the benefits to which such Participant would
be entitled under the provisions of the Applicable
Defined Benefit Pension Plan, the provisions of the
Executive Performance Supplemental Retirement Plan and the
provisions of the Supplemental Benefit Plan
(expressed in the Applicable Form of Benefit) had the number
of such Participant's years of service used to calculate the
benefits under such plans been increased by the additional
years of constructive service set forth in such Participant's
Participation Agreement, and (ii) the amount of benefits,
if any, to which such Participant is otherwise entitled under
the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan,
the Executive Performance Supplemental Retirement Plan and the
Supplemental Benefit Plan.  Notwithstanding the above, in no
event will a Participant be granted constructive years of
service hereunder which would cause the combination of his
actual years of service credited under the Applicable Defined
Benefit Pension Plan and his constructive years of service
granted hereunder to exceed the lesser of (i) forty (40), or
(ii) the number by which the Participant's then current age
exceeds twenty-five (25).  To the extent that a cost of living
adjustment is made to the benefits payable under the Applicable
Defined Benefit Pension Plan, a comparable and proportionate
adjustment will be made to the benefits payable
hereunder.</FONT></TD>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death Benefits  -
This Section 3.3 defines the amount of death benefits, if any,
which will be paid to the surviving spouse of a Participant
who dies while employed by the Company. In order to receive
death benefits hereunder, a surviving spouse must have been
legally married to the Participant for at least one (1) year
prior to the Participant's death and the sum of the
Participant's actual years of service used to calculate the
benefits under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan
and constructive years of service granted herein must equal
at least ten (10) years. The amount of death benefits payable
from this Plan shall be the difference, if any, between (i) (a) the amount of the death benefits to which such surviving spouse would have been entitled under the provisions of the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan, the provisions of the Executive Performance Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Benefit Plan  (expressed as a single life annuity) had the number of years of service used to calculate the benefits under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan been increased by the additional constructive years of service set forth in such Participant's Participation Agreement, and (b) the amount of the benefits to which such surviving spouse would otherwise be entitled under such plans.<BR>

If within one year of the date or such notice, it is determined by the Committee upon proof submitted by such Participant that he has ceased to so use such information and the Company's loss from such Participant's past and future improper use of such information is likely to be insubstantial in proportion to the future loss of his benefit hereunder, the Committee may reinstate him; and, if payment of his retirement income has stopped, it shall be resumed.

The amount of such lump sum payment shall be computed in two steps. Under the first step, a calculation will be made of the monthly annuity payments to which such Participant would otherwise have been entitled under the provisions of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of the Plan based upon (a) the service performed by the Participant through the date of such termination of employment, plus (b) the additional years of constructive service set forth in such Participant's Participation Agreement (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Aggregate Service") under the assumptions that (i) the Participant was scheduled to commence receipt of benefits under this Plan as of the earliest date on which the Participant could receive benefits under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan that were not subject to the early retirement reduction factor described in such plan determined as if such Participant's years of Vesting Service under the Applicable Defined Benefit Pension Plan equaled his Aggregate Service and (ii) this Plan did not contain any minimum age requirement as to eligibility for receipt of benefits. Under the second step, such monthly annuity payments will be discounted to their present value as of the date of the Participant's termination of employment using the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's immediate payment interest rate in effect on the date of the Participant's termination of employment plus one-half of one percent (1/2%).<BR>
