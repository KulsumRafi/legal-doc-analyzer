Estate Investment Trusts definition published in March&nbsp;1995 after adjustment for straight lining of rents and as applied in accordance with the accounting practices and policies of the Company

and (B)&nbsp;the diluted weighted average number of outstanding common limited partnership units of Mack-Cali Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership of which the Company is the
sole general partner (the "Partnership"), for the applicable period with such calculations being made all before the effect on FFO and diluted common shares/common limited partnership units resulting

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)
In the event that neither of the Financial Tests above is satisfied for the fiscal year of the Company corresponding to the applicable Vesting Date
("Non-Achievement Year"), any Restricted Shares that failed to vest under the annual performance goal criteria on such Date may vest on such Date or on a subsequent Vesting Date provided
the test described below is satisfied (the "Cumulative Test"). The Cumulative Test shall be applied at the end of the Non-Achievement Year or any subsequent fiscal year
("Catch-Up Year") with respect to any Non-Achievement Year </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> a Financial Test was satisfied in a prior fiscal year or is
satisfied in a Catch-Up Year, by applying the aggregate Financial Test percentages and the performance goal requirement on a cumulative basis beginning with the first fiscal year of the
Vesting Period and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>ending</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> with the Non-Achievement Year or the Catch-Up Year, as applicable. In the event the Cumulative Test is
satisfied (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>i.e.,</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> the aggregate increase in FFO or aggregate total return is not less than the minimum percentage required to satisfy the Financial Test
after taking into account the applicable Non-Achievement Year), the Restricted Shares that failed to vest in the Non-Achievement Year shall automatically vest on the Vesting
Date applicable to the Non-Achievement Year or the Catch-Up Year, as the case may be. For example, if vesting occurred in years one (1)&nbsp;and two (2), year three
(3)&nbsp;is a Non-Achievement Year, and the Cumulative Test is met for the Non-Achievement Year (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>i.e.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, either FFO is not less
than twenty-four (24%) percent or the aggregate return is not less than thirty-eight and one-quarter (38.25%) percent) vesting would occur on the Vesting Date applicable to the
Non-Achievement Year. In the event the Cumulative Test is not met in the Non-Achievement Year, one of the Financial Tests is met in year four (4), the Cumulative Test may be
used. Under this scenario, vesting in that portion of the Restricted Stock Award scheduled to vest in year three (3)&nbsp;will occur in year four (4)&nbsp;if either the aggregate FFO is not less
than thirty-two percent (32%) or the aggregate total return is not less than fifty-one percent (51%) at the end of the fourth (4<SUP>th</SUP>) fiscal year. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Rules for Application of the Cumulative Test</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>:
(a)&nbsp;the Cumulative Test will be applied first at the end of any Non-Achievement Year,
(b)&nbsp;it is not necessary for any Catch-Up Year to immediately succeed a Non-Achievement Year in order for the Cumulative Test to be applicable as long as the
Catch-Up Year occurs during the Vesting Period, (c)&nbsp;if two (2)&nbsp;or more Non-Achievement Years have occurred during the Vesting Period and remain
non-vested, in the event that the Cumulative Test is met on a partial basis so that at least one (1)&nbsp;full year's vesting may occur, the Restricted Share Award
granted with respect to the last Non-Achievement Year that has occurred, shall vest first and any excess shall be credited to another Non-Achievement Year and (d)&nbsp;the
Cumulative Test may be met on a partial basis by aggregating percentages in excess of the minimum annual requirement from more than one (1)&nbsp;fiscal year in the Vesting Period. For example, if
vesting occurred in year one (1)&nbsp;and the FFO is sixteen (16%) percent, years two (2)&nbsp;and three (3)&nbsp;are Non-Achievement Years with a loss in year two (2)&nbsp;of two
(2%) percent and year three (3)&nbsp;the FFO is four (4%) percent, the Restricted Shares awarded with respect to year three (3)&nbsp;would vest under the Cumulative Test and two (2%) percent of
the remaining FFO would be available to be used in year two </FONT></P>
