      full recourse to all of the assets of the Pledgor and its partners. The
      Pledgor and its partners agree not to request or permit, in any Insolvency
      or Liquidation Proceeding of the Pledgor, (i) any plan of reorganization,
      or confirmation order with respect thereto, which would include a
      provision that would discharge the partners of Pledgor from their
      obligations to Pledgee under this Section 5 or (ii) any party in interest
      to obtain an injunction that would enjoin or limit the Pledgee's rights
      against the partners of the Pledgee or their assets.

      SECTION 6. Remedies. (a) Subject in all cases to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and an
acceleration of the Loans, the Pledgee may, in its sole discretion, exercise
with respect to the Collateral, in addition to any other rights and remedies
provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of
a secured party under the New York Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable
law, and the Pledgee may also, upon reasonable notice as specified below, sell
the Collateral at public or private sale, at any exchange, broker's board or at
any of the Pledgee's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future
delivery, and at such price and upon such other terms as the Pledgee may in good
faith deem commercially reasonable. The Pledgee or any of its Affiliates may be
the purchaser of the Collateral at any such sale and shall be entitled, for the
purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for
the Collateral, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account
of the purchase price of the Collateral payable by such Person at such sale.
Each purchaser at any such sale shall acquire the property sold absolutely free
from any claim or right on the part of the Pledgor, and the Pledgor hereby
waives (to the fullest extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay
and/or appraisal which it now has or may at any time in the future have under
any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. The Pledgor agrees
that at least fifteen (15) days' notice to the Pledgor of the time and place of
any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall
constitute reasonable notice. The Pledgee will not be obligated to make any sale
regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Pledgee may adjourn any
public or private sale from time to time by announcement of the time and place
fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time
and place to which it was adjourned. The Pledgor


                                       10
<PAGE>

hereby waives any claims against the Pledgee arising by reason of the fact that
the price at which the Collateral may have been sold at such private sale was
less than the price which might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the
Pledgee accepts the first offer received and does not offer the Collateral to
more than one offeree.

      (b) The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral under subsection (a) above
shall be applied in the following manner:

                  i. FIRST, to the payment of all costs and expenses reasonably
            incurred in connection with the sale, collection or other
            realization, including reasonable costs, fees and expenses of the
            Pledgee and its agents and counsel, all other reasonable expenses,
            liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Pledgee in
            connection therewith;

                  ii. SECOND, to the payment, in whole or in part, of the
            Nationwide Indebtedness (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement);

                  iii. THIRD, to the payment, in whole or in part, of the
            Obligations; and

                  iv. FOURTH, the balance, if any, shall be paid to the Pledgor
            or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as
            a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

If the Pledgee or any of its Affiliates is the successful bidder at such sale,
the amount owing to Nationwide must be paid in cash.

      (c) The Pledgee has the right to enforce any and all remedies provided in
this Agreement, successively and concurrently, and such action will not operate
to estop or prevent the Pledgee from pursuing any other remedy which the Pledgee
may have at law or in equity or under any other document.

      (d) THE PLEDGOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY PRIVATE SALE OF THE COLLATERAL MAY
RESULT IN PRICES AND OTHER TERMS LESS FAVORABLE TO THE PLEDGOR THAN IF SUCH SALE
WERE A PUBLIC SALE AND THE PLEDGOR AGREES THAT ANY SUCH PRIVATE SALE SHALL BE
DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE IN A COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE MANNER.

      SECTION 7. Pledgee Appointed Attorney-in-Fact.

      Subject in all cases to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default which is not waived
by the Pledgee and following an acceleration of the Loans, the Pledgor hereby
irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the Pledgee or any of its officers
or designees its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full authority in


                                       11
<PAGE>

the place and stead of the Pledgor and in the name of the Pledgor or otherwise,
from time to time after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event
of Default which is not waived by the Pledgee and following an acceleration of
the Loans, to take any action, to execute any instruments and to exercise any
rights, privileges, elections or power of the Pledgor pertaining or relating to
the Collateral which the Pledgee may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
preserve and enforce its security interest in the Collateral and otherwise to
accomplish the purposes of this Agreement.

      SECTION 8. Pledgee May Perform. If the Pledgor fails to perform any
agreement contained herein other than any agreement set forth in Section 5
hereof, the Pledgee may (but shall not be obligated to) itself perform, or cause
performance of, such agreement; provided, however, that the Pledgee shall first
have provided to the Pledgor five (5) Business Days' prior written notice of the
Pledgee's intention so to act (except in cases of emergency when no such notice
shall be required). Any sums expended by the Pledgee pursuant to this Section 7
shall be added to the Obligations and secured by the Collateral.

      SECTION 9. Amendments, etc. No amendment, waiver or modification of any
provision of this Agreement, nor consent to any departure by the Pledgor
therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing
making specific reference to this Agreement and such amendment, waiver,
modification or consent shall be consented to in one or more writings and signed
by the Pledgor, the Pledgee and Nationwide, and then such amendment, waiver,
modification or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance for the
specific purpose for which given.

      SECTION 10. Continuing Security Interest. This Agreement shall create a
continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall (a) except with respect
to the provisions in Section 5 hereof, remain in full force and effect until the
later of (i) the termination of the Commitment or (ii) the payment in full of
the Obligations, (b) be binding upon the Pledgor and (c) inure to the benefit of
the Pledgee and its successors and assigns. If the Pledgee shall have instituted
any proceeding to enforce any right, power or remedy under this instrument by
foreclosure, sale, entry or otherwise, and such proceeding shall have been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall have been determined adversely
to the Pledgee, then and in every such case, the Pledgor and the Pledgee shall
be restored to their respective former positions and rights hereunder with
respect to the Collateral, and all right, remedies and powers of the Pledgee
shall continue as if no such proceeding had been instituted.

      SECTION 11. Notices. All notices, offers, acceptances, approvals, waivers,
requests, demands and other communication hereunder or under any other Related
Document shall be in writing, shall be addressed as provided below and shall be
considered as properly given (a) if delivered in person, (b) if sent by express
courier service (including Federal Express, Emery, DHL, Airborne Express, and
other similar express delivery services), (c) in the event overnight delivery
services are not readily available, if mailed by United States Postal Service,
postage prepaid, registered or certified with return receipt requested, or (d)
if sent by telecopy and confirmed; provided, that in the case of a notice by
telecopy, the sender shall in addition confirm such notice by writing sent in
the manner specified in clause (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 10. All notices
shall be effective upon receipt by the addressee; provided, however, that if any
notice is tendered to an addressee and the delivery thereof is refused by such
addressee, such notice shall be


                                       12

effective upon such tender. For the purposes of notice, the addresses of the
