indemnification, in which event such right to indemnification shall
expire four years after the discovery of such fraud.

     10.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS.

          (a)  The Employee recognizes that the Employee's position with

scientific or technical information, design, process, procedure, formula
or improvement of the Company or any of its affiliates that is valuable
and not generally known to competitors of the Company and its affiliates.

<PAGE>
prospects, training manuals, product development plans, bidding and
pricing procedures, market strategies, internal performance statistics,
financial data, confidential personnel information concerning employees,
supplier data, operational or administrative plans, policy manuals, and
terms and conditions of contracts and agreements and such similar
information relating to subsidiaries and affiliates of the Company.  The
terms "Trade Secret" and "Confidential Information" shall not apply to
information which is (i) already in the Employee's possession (unless

Confidential Information during his employment, at any time after
termination of his employment and prior to such time as they cease to be
Trade Secrets or Confidential Information through no act of the Employee
in violation of this Paragraph 11.

          (d)  Upon the request of the Company and, in any event, upon
the termination of employment hereunder, the Employee will surrender to
the Company all memoranda, notes, records, drawings, manuals, distributor
lists, or other documents (including all copies thereof) pertaining to
the Company's business, the Employee's employment or the business of the
Company or its affiliates.  The Employee will also leave with the Company
all materials involving any Trade Secrets or Confidential Information.
All such information and materials, whether or not made or developed by
the Employee, shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company or
its affiliates, and the Employee hereby assigns to the Company all of the
Employee's right, title and interest in and to any and all of such
information and materials.

          (e)  If a judicial determination is made that any of the
provisions of this Paragraph 12 constitutes an unreasonable or otherwise
unenforceable restriction against the Employee, the provisions of this
Paragraph 12 shall be rendered void only to the extent that such judicial
determination finds such provisions to be unreasonable or otherwise
unenforceable.  In this regard, the parties hereto hereby agree that any
judicial authority construing this Agreement shall be empowered to sever
any portion of the territory or prohibited business activity from the
coverage of this Paragraph 12 and to apply the provisions of this
Paragraph 12 to the remaining portion of the territory or the remaining
business activities not so severed by such judicial authority.  Moreover,
notwithstanding the fact that any provisions of this Paragraph 12 are
determined not to be specifically enforceable, the Company shall
nevertheless be entitled to recover monetary damages as a result of the
breach of such provision by the Employee.  The time period during which
the prohibitions set forth in this Paragraph 12 shall apply shall be
tolled and suspended as to the Employee for a period equal to the
aggregate quantity of time during which the Employee violates such
prohibitions in any respect.

     11.  SPECIFIC ENFORCEMENT.  The Employee specifically acknowledges
and agrees that the restrictions set forth in Paragraphs 11 and 12 hereof
are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interest of the
Company and its affiliates and that the Company would not have employed
the Employee in the absence of such restrictions.  The Employee further
acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the provisions of
Paragraphs 11 or 12 hereof will result in

                                    3
<PAGE>
irreparable injury to the Company or its affiliates, that the remedy at
law for any violation or threatened violation of such paragraphs will be
inadequate and that in the event of any such breach, the Company or its
affiliates, in addition to any other remedies or damages available at law
or in equity, shall be entitled to temporary injunctive relief before
trial from any court of competent jurisdiction as a matter of course and
to permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual
damages.

     12.  ATTORNEY'S FEES.  In the event that it should become necessary
for any party entitled hereunder to bring suit against any other party to
this Agreement for enforcement of the covenants herein contained, the
parties hereby covenant and agree that the party who is found to be in
violation of said covenants shall also be liable for all reasonable
attorney's fees and costs of court incurred by the other parties hereto.

be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties hereto, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators,
personal representatives, successors and permitted assigns.

contained in this Agreement or in any instrument referred to herein or

invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of
this Agreement or any such other instrument.  If any covenant in this
Agreement, or any part thereof, is held to be unenforceable because of
its duration or its geographic scope, the parties agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to reduce the duration
and/or area of such covenant to the longest duration and to the greatest
geographical scope which is permitted, and, in said reduced form, such
covenant shall then be enforced.  The Employee acknowledges that the
provisions of this Agreement are reasonable and necessary for the
protection of the Company, that the consideration therefor is reasonable
and sufficient, and that the provisions of this Agreement are an
inducement without which the Company would not have entered into this
Agreement.

reorganization, stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other
similar event involving the Company (collectively, the "Registrable
Securities").

     2.   REGISTRATION RIGHTS.  With respect to the Registration Rights,
the parties agree as follows:

          (a)  Subject to Paragraph 2(b), the Company will (i) promptly
give to the Holder written notice of any registration relating to an
Underwritten Public Offering, and (ii) include in such registration (and
related qualification under blue sky laws or other compliance) such of
the Holder's Registrable Securities as are specified in the Holder's
written request or requests, mailed in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement within 30 days after the date of such written notice from the
Company.

          (b)  The right of the Holder to registration pursuant to the
Registration Rights shall be conditioned upon the Holder's participation
in such underwriting, and the inclusion of the Registrable Securities in
the underwriting shall be limited to the extent provided herein.  The
Holder shall (together with the Company) enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter selected for
the Underwritten Public Offering by the Company.  Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, if the managing underwriter determines
that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of the
Registrable Securities to be underwritten, the managing underwriter may
limit some or all of the Registrable Securities that may be included in
the registration and the Underwritten Public Offering as follows: the
number of the Registrable Securities that may be included in the
registration and the Underwritten Public Offering by the Holder shall be
determined by multiplying the number of the shares of the Registrable
Securities of all selling shareholders of the Company which the managing
underwriter is willing to include in such registration and the
Underwritten Public Offering times a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration and the Underwritten Public Offering by the Holder, and the
denominator of which is the total number of the Registrable Securities
which all selling shareholders of the Company have requested to be
included in such registration and the Underwritten Public Offering.  To
facilitate the allocation of shares in accordance with the above
provisions, the Company may round the number of shares allocable to any
such person to the nearest 100 shares.  If the Holder disapproves of the
terms of any such underwriting, it may elect to withdraw therefrom by
written notice to the Company and the managing underwriter, delivered not
less than seven days before the effective date of the Underwritten Public
Offering.  Any of the Registrable Securities excluded or withdrawn from
the Underwritten Public Offering shall be withdrawn from such
registration, and shall not be transferred in a public distribution prior
to 60 days after the effective date of the Registration Statement
relating thereto, or such other shorter period of time as the
underwriters may require.

     3.   REGISTRATION PROCEDURE.  With respect to the Registration
Rights, the following provisions shall apply:

          (a)  The Holder shall be obligated to furnish to the Company
and the underwriters such information regarding the Registrable
Securities and the proposed manner of distribution of the Registrable
Securities as the Company and the underwriters may request in writing and
as shall be required in connection with any registration, qualification
or compliance referred to herein and shall otherwise cooperate with the
Company and the underwriters in connection with such registration,
qualification or compliance.

          (b)  With a view to making available the benefits of certain
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") which may at any time permit the sale of any Restricted Securities
as defined in Rule 144 ("Rule 144") promulgated under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") to the public without
registration, the Company agrees to use its best lawful efforts to:

               (i)  Make and keep public information available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 at all times during which
the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act");

<PAGE>
               (ii) File with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and
other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act (at all times during which the Company is subject to such
reporting requirements); and

               (iii)So long as the Holder owns any Restricted Securities,
to furnish to the Holder upon request a written statement from the
Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144
and with regard to the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at all times
during which the Company is subject to such reporting requirements), a
copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and
such other reports and documents of the Company and other information in
the possession of or reasonably obtainable by the Company as the Holder
may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of
the SEC allowing the Holder to sell any Restricted Securities without
registration.

          (c)  The Company agrees that it will furnish to the Holder such
number of prospectuses meeting the requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of
the Securities Act, offering circulars or other documents incident to any
registration, qualification or compliance referred to herein as provided
or, if not otherwise provided, as the Holder from time to time may
reasonably request.

          (d)  All expenses (except for any underwriting and selling
discounts and commissions and legal fees for the Holder's attorneys) of
any registrations permitted pursuant to this Agreement and of all other
offerings by the Company (including, but not limited to, the expenses of
any qualifications under the blue sky or other state securities laws and
compliance with governmental requirements of preparing and filing any
post-effective amendments required for the lawful distribution of the
Registrable Securities to the public in connection with such
registration, of supplying prospectuses, offering circulars or other
documents) will be paid by the Company.

          (e)  In connection with the preparation and filing of any
Registration Statement under the Securities Act pursuant to this
Agreement, the Company will give the Holder and the Holder's attorneys
and accountants, the opportunity to participate in the preparation of any
Registration Statement, each prospectus included therein or filed with
the SEC, and each amendment thereof or supplement thereto, and will give
each of them such access to its books and records and opportunities to
discuss the business of the Company with its officers and the independent
public accountants who have certified its financial statements as shall
be necessary to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of
the Securities Act.

          (f)  The Company shall notify each Holder of Registrable
Securities covered by a Registration Statement, during the time when a
prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the
prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as then in effect,
includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then
existing.

     4.   BLACKOUT PERIOD.  At any time after the effective date of the
Registration Statement, if the Company gives to the Holder a notice
pursuant to Paragraph 3(f) hereof and stating that the Company requires
the suspension by the Holder of the distribution of any of the
Registrable Securities, then the Holder shall cease distributing the
Registrable Securities for such period of time (the "Blackout Period"),
not to exceed 120 days from the time notice is sent until the Company
informs the Holder that the Blackout Period has been terminated.  Upon
notice by the Company to the Holder of such determination, the Holder
will (a) keep the fact of any such notice strictly confidential, (b)
promptly halt any offer, sale, trading or transfer of any of the
Registrable Securities for the duration of the Blackout Period, and (c)
promptly halt any use, publication, dissemination or distribution of each
prospectus included within the Registration Statement, and any amendment
or supplement thereto by it and any of its affiliates for the duration of
the Blackout Period.

     5.   LOCK-UP.  In connection with any Underwritten Public Offering,
the Holder agrees, if requested, to execute a lock-up letter addressed to
the managing underwriter in customary form agreeing not to sell or
otherwise dispose of the Registrable Securities owned by the Holder
(other than any that may be included in the offering) for a period not
exceeding 180 days.

     6.   DELAY OF REGISTRATION.  No Holder shall have any right to
obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any
registration of the Registrable Securities as the result of any
controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or
implementation of this Agreement.

     7.   INDEMNIFICATION BY THE COMPANY.  In the event of any
registration of the Registrable Securities of the Company under the
Securities Act, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Company
agrees to indemnity and hold harmless the Holder and each other person
who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of the
Registrable Securities against any and all claims, demands, losses,
costs, expenses, obligations, liabilities, joint or several, damages,
recoveries and deficiencies, including interest, penalties and attorneys'
fees (collectively the "Claims"), to which the Holder or any such
underwriter may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise,
insofar as the Claims or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or
threatened, in respect thereto arise out of or are based on any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in
any Registration Statement under which the Holder's Registrable
Securities were registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or
any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the Company
will

<PAGE>
reimburse the Holder and each such underwriter for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any Claim or action or proceeding in respect thereto; provided
that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that
any Claim or action or proceeding in respect thereof or expense arises
out of or is based on an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any such
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment
or supplement in reliance on and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company through an instrument duly executed by the
Holder specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation
thereof.  Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless
of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Holder or any such
underwriter and survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the
Holder.

     8.   INDEMNIFICATION BY THE HOLDER.  The Company may require, as a
condition to including the Registrable Securities in any Registration
Statement filed pursuant to this Agreement, that the Company shall have
received an undertaking satisfactory to it from the Holder, to indemnify
and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth
in Paragraph 7 hereof) the Company, each director and officer of the
Company and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within
the meaning of the Securities Act, with respect to any statement or
alleged statement or alleged statement in or omission or alleged omission
from the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, if such statement or
alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance on
and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company
through an instrument duly executed by the Holder specifically stating
that it is for use in the preparation of the Registration Statement,
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment
or supplement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum liability
hereunder which the Holder shall be required to suffer shall be limited
to the net proceeds to the Holder from the Registrable Securities sold by
the Holder in any such offering.  Such indemnity shall remain in full
force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person and shall
survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Holder.

     9.   NOTICE OF CLAIMS.  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified
party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving
a Claim, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to
be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter
of the commencement of such action, provided that the failure of any
indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
indemnifying party of its obligations under this Agreement except to the
extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure
to give notice.  In case any such action is brought against an
indemnifying party, unless in such indemnified party's reasonable
judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying
parties may exist in respect of a Claim the indemnifying party shall be
entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that
it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified
party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified
party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying
party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or
other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the
defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  No
indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party,
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does
not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant
or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in
respect of a Claim.

     10.  INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS.  The indemnification required by this
Agreement shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during
the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are
received or expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred.

     11.  ASSIGNMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS.  The rights to cause the
Company to register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement may
be assigned by the Holder to a transferee or assignee of such securities
who shall, upon such transfer or assignment, be deemed a Holder under
this Agreement; provided that the Company is furnished with written
notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the
Registrable Securities with respect to which the Registration Rights are
being assigned; provided, further, that such assignment shall be
effective only if immediately following such transfer the further
disposition of such securities by the transferee or assignee is
restricted under the Securities Act and that such transferee or assignee
is either (a) a member of the immediate family or a trust for the benefit
of any Holder that is an individual or (b) a transferee or assignee that
after the transfer or assignment holds all of the Registrable Securities.

     12.  TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.  This Agreement shall terminate
with respect to the Holder when all of the Registrable Securities have
been registered as provided herein.

     13.  ATTORNEY'S FEES.  In the event that it should become necessary

                      REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

     THIS AGREEMENT is entered into as of January 13, 2003, by and
between UNIVERSAL BROADBAND COMMUNICATIONS, INC., a Nevada corporation
(the "Company"), and CARLOS BLANCO (the "Holder").

     WHEREAS, on even date herewith the Company executed and delivered to
the Holder 275,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001
per share (the "Common Stock");

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

     1.   REGISTRATION RIGHTS AVAILABLE.  Pursuant to the terms and
conditions contained herein, the Company agrees to provide the Holder or
any permitted assignee of the Holder (collectively, the "Holder") with
the right to "piggyback" (the "Registration Rights") on a firm commitment
underwritten offering with respect to the Common Stock and any other
securities issued or issuable at any time or from time to time in respect
of the Common Stock as a result of a merger, consolidation,
reorganization, stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other
similar event involving the Company (collectively, the "Registrable
Securities").

     2.   REGISTRATION RIGHTS.  With respect to the Registration Rights,
the parties agree as follows:

          (a)  Subject to Paragraph 2(b), the Company will (i) promptly
give to the Holder written notice of any registration relating to an
Underwritten Public Offering, and (ii) include in such registration (and
related qualification under blue sky laws or other compliance) such of
the Holder's Registrable Securities as are specified in the Holder's
written request or requests, mailed in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement within 30 days after the date of such written notice from the
Company.

          (b)  The right of the Holder to registration pursuant to the
Registration Rights shall be conditioned upon the Holder's participation
in such underwriting, and the inclusion of the Registrable Securities in
the underwriting shall be limited to the extent provided herein.  The
Holder shall (together with the Company) enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter selected for
the Underwritten Public Offering by the Company.  Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, if the managing underwriter determines
that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of the
Registrable Securities to be underwritten, the managing underwriter may
limit some or all of the Registrable Securities that may be included in
the registration and the Underwritten Public Offering as follows: the
number of the Registrable Securities that may be included in the
registration and the Underwritten Public Offering by the Holder shall be
determined by multiplying the number of the shares of the Registrable
Securities of all selling shareholders of the Company which the managing
underwriter is willing to include in such registration and the
Underwritten Public Offering times a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration and the Underwritten Public Offering by the Holder, and the
denominator of which is the total number of the Registrable Securities
which all selling shareholders of the Company have requested to be
included in such registration and the Underwritten Public Offering.  To
facilitate the allocation of shares in accordance with the above
provisions, the Company may round the number of shares allocable to any
such person to the nearest 100 shares.  If the Holder disapproves of the
terms of any such underwriting, it may elect to withdraw therefrom by
written notice to the Company and the managing underwriter, delivered not
less than seven days before the effective date of the Underwritten Public
Offering.  Any of the Registrable Securities excluded or withdrawn from
the Underwritten Public Offering shall be withdrawn from such
registration, and shall not be transferred in a public distribution prior
to 60 days after the effective date of the Registration Statement
relating thereto, or such other shorter period of time as the
underwriters may require.

     3.   REGISTRATION PROCEDURE.  With respect to the Registration
Rights, the following provisions shall apply:

          (a)  The Holder shall be obligated to furnish to the Company
and the underwriters such information regarding the Registrable
Securities and the proposed manner of distribution of the Registrable
Securities as the Company and the underwriters may request in writing and
as shall be required in connection with any registration, qualification
or compliance referred to herein and shall otherwise cooperate with the
Company and the underwriters in connection with such registration,
qualification or compliance.

          (b)  With a view to making available the benefits of certain
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") which may at any time permit the sale of any Restricted Securities
as defined in Rule 144 ("Rule 144") promulgated under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") to the public without
registration, the Company agrees to use its best lawful efforts to:

               (i)  Make and keep public information available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 at all times during which
the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act");

<PAGE>
               (ii) File with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and
other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act (at all times during which the Company is subject to such
reporting requirements); and

               (iii)So long as the Holder owns any Restricted Securities,
to furnish to the Holder upon request a written statement from the
Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144
and with regard to the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at all times
during which the Company is subject to such reporting requirements), a
copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and
such other reports and documents of the Company and other information in
the possession of or reasonably obtainable by the Company as the Holder
may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of
the SEC allowing the Holder to sell any Restricted Securities without
registration.

          (c)  The Company agrees that it will furnish to the Holder such
number of prospectuses meeting the requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of
the Securities Act, offering circulars or other documents incident to any
registration, qualification or compliance referred to herein as provided
or, if not otherwise provided, as the Holder from time to time may
reasonably request.

          (d)  All expenses (except for any underwriting and selling
discounts and commissions and legal fees for the Holder's attorneys) of
any registrations permitted pursuant to this Agreement and of all other
offerings by the Company (including, but not limited to, the expenses of
any qualifications under the blue sky or other state securities laws and
compliance with governmental requirements of preparing and filing any
post-effective amendments required for the lawful distribution of the
Registrable Securities to the public in connection with such
registration, of supplying prospectuses, offering circulars or other
documents) will be paid by the Company.

          (e)  In connection with the preparation and filing of any
Registration Statement under the Securities Act pursuant to this
Agreement, the Company will give the Holder and the Holder's attorneys
and accountants, the opportunity to participate in the preparation of any
Registration Statement, each prospectus included therein or filed with
the SEC, and each amendment thereof or supplement thereto, and will give
each of them such access to its books and records and opportunities to
discuss the business of the Company with its officers and the independent
public accountants who have certified its financial statements as shall
be necessary to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of
the Securities Act.

          (f)  The Company shall notify each Holder of Registrable
Securities covered by a Registration Statement, during the time when a
prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the
prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as then in effect,
includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then
existing.

     4.   BLACKOUT PERIOD.  At any time after the effective date of the
Registration Statement, if the Company gives to the Holder a notice
pursuant to Paragraph 3(f) hereof and stating that the Company requires
the suspension by the Holder of the distribution of any of the
Registrable Securities, then the Holder shall cease distributing the
Registrable Securities for such period of time (the "Blackout Period"),
not to exceed 120 days from the time notice is sent until the Company
informs the Holder that the Blackout Period has been terminated.  Upon
notice by the Company to the Holder of such determination, the Holder
will (a) keep the fact of any such notice strictly confidential, (b)
promptly halt any offer, sale, trading or transfer of any of the
Registrable Securities for the duration of the Blackout Period, and (c)
promptly halt any use, publication, dissemination or distribution of each
prospectus included within the Registration Statement, and any amendment
or supplement thereto by it and any of its affiliates for the duration of
the Blackout Period.

     5.   LOCK-UP.  In connection with any Underwritten Public Offering,
the Holder agrees, if requested, to execute a lock-up letter addressed to
the managing underwriter in customary form agreeing not to sell or
otherwise dispose of the Registrable Securities owned by the Holder
(other than any that may be included in the offering) for a period not
exceeding 180 days.

     6.   DELAY OF REGISTRATION.  No Holder shall have any right to
obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any
registration of the Registrable Securities as the result of any
controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or
implementation of this Agreement.

     7.   INDEMNIFICATION BY THE COMPANY.  In the event of any
registration of the Registrable Securities of the Company under the
Securities Act, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Company
agrees to indemnity and hold harmless the Holder and each other person
who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of the
Registrable Securities against any and all claims, demands, losses,
costs, expenses, obligations, liabilities, joint or several, damages,
recoveries and deficiencies, including interest, penalties and attorneys'
fees (collectively the "Claims"), to which the Holder or any such
underwriter may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise,
insofar as the Claims or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or
threatened, in respect thereto arise out of or are based on any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in
any Registration Statement under which the Holder's Registrable
Securities were registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or
any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the Company
will

<PAGE>
reimburse the Holder and each such underwriter for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any Claim or action or proceeding in respect thereto; provided
that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that
any Claim or action or proceeding in respect thereof or expense arises
out of or is based on an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any such
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment
or supplement in reliance on and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company through an instrument duly executed by the
Holder specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation
thereof.  Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless
of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Holder or any such
underwriter and survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the
Holder.

     8.   INDEMNIFICATION BY THE HOLDER.  The Company may require, as a
condition to including the Registrable Securities in any Registration
Statement filed pursuant to this Agreement, that the Company shall have
received an undertaking satisfactory to it from the Holder, to indemnify
and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth
in Paragraph 7 hereof) the Company, each director and officer of the
Company and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within
the meaning of the Securities Act, with respect to any statement or
alleged statement or alleged statement in or omission or alleged omission
from the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, if such statement or
alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance on
and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company
through an instrument duly executed by the Holder specifically stating
that it is for use in the preparation of the Registration Statement,
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment
or supplement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum liability
hereunder which the Holder shall be required to suffer shall be limited
to the net proceeds to the Holder from the Registrable Securities sold by
the Holder in any such offering.  Such indemnity shall remain in full
force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person and shall
survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Holder.

     9.   NOTICE OF CLAIMS.  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified
party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving
a Claim, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to
be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter
of the commencement of such action, provided that the failure of any
indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
indemnifying party of its obligations under this Agreement except to the
extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure
to give notice.  In case any such action is brought against an
indemnifying party, unless in such indemnified party's reasonable
judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying
parties may exist in respect of a Claim the indemnifying party shall be
entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that
it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified
party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified
party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying
party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or
other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the
defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  No
indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party,
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does
not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant
or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in
respect of a Claim.

     10.  INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS.  The indemnification required by this
Agreement shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during
the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are
received or expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred.

     11.  ASSIGNMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS.  The rights to cause the
Company to register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement may
be assigned by the Holder to a transferee or assignee of such securities
who shall, upon such transfer or assignment, be deemed a Holder under
this Agreement; provided that the Company is furnished with written
notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the
Registrable Securities with respect to which the Registration Rights are
being assigned; provided, further, that such assignment shall be
effective only if immediately following such transfer the further
disposition of such securities by the transferee or assignee is
restricted under the Securities Act and that such transferee or assignee
is either (a) a member of the immediate family or a trust for the benefit
of any Holder that is an individual or (b) a transferee or assignee that
after the transfer or assignment holds all of the Registrable Securities.

     12.  TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.  This Agreement shall terminate
with respect to the Holder when all of the Registrable Securities have
been registered as provided herein.

     13.  ATTORNEY'S FEES.  In the event that it should become necessary

this Agreement for enforcement of the covenants herein contained, the

violation of said covenants shall also be liable for all reasonable
counsel's fees and costs of court incurred by the other parties hereto.

States District Court for Orange County, California, as well as of the

of any such mediation, arbitration, suit, action or proceeding brought in
any such county and any claim that any such mediation, arbitration, suit,
action or proceeding brought in such county has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

     15.  ARBITRATION.  Any controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or validity
thereof, shall be settled by final and binding arbitration in accordance
with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA Rules") in effect as of the effective date of this
Agreement.  The American Arbitration Association shall be responsible for
(a) appointing a sole arbitrator, and (b) administering the case in

Agreement, and whether or not an arbitration proceeding has yet been

orders, preliminary injunctions and other interim measures of relief as

manner such judgments for permanent equitable relief as may be necessary
to prevent harm to a party's interest or as otherwise may be appropriate
following the issuance of arbitral awards pursuant to this Agreement.

<PAGE>
                        NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

     THIS AGREEMENT is made this 13th day of January, 2003, between
UNIVERSAL BROADBAND COMMUNICATIONS, INC., a Nevada corporation (the
"Company"), and CARLOS BLANCO (the "Employee").

     WHEREAS, this Agreement is being entered into pursuant to the
provisions of that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated January 13,
2003 by and between the Company, UNetCommerce, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("UNetCommerce"), Steve Tirella, and the Employee (the "Asset
Purchase Agreement"); and

     WHEREAS, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Employee and
the Company have executed that certain Employment Agreement of even date
herewith (the "Employment Agreement"); and

     WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Employee is a condition precedent to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated in the Asset Purchase Agreement;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the following
mutual covenants and agreements, the parties hereto do hereby agree as
follows:

     1.   PAYMENT TO THE EMPLOYEE.  Contemporaneously with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, and in full and final payment of all
obligations of the Company to the Employee hereunder, there has been
delivered to the Employee 275,000 shares of the Company's common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged by the Employee.

     2.   COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE.  The Employee hereby covenants and
agrees with the Company that during the period which is the longer of two
years, the term of his employment with the Company, or 18 months after
the termination of his employment, for any reason, with or without cause,
the Employee will not, except as expressly permitted hereunder, directly
or indirectly:

          (a)  Operate, develop or own any interest other than the
ownership of less than five percent of the equity securities of a
publicly traded company, in any business which has significant activities
(viewed in relation to the business of the Company or its affiliates), or
has announced intentions to focus significant resources, relating to any
business in which the Company or its affiliates is currently engaged and
the business of building, owning, managing, leasing or operating wireless
carriers or other similar entities (a "Business");

          (b)  Compete with the Company or its affiliates in the
operation or development of any Business within North America (Canada,
Mexico, and the United States of America);

          (c)  Be employed by any business which owns, manages, or
operates a Business;

          (d)  Interfere with, solicit, disrupt or attempt to disrupt any
past, present or prospective relationship, contractual or otherwise,
between the Company or its affiliates, and any customer, client, supplier
or employee of the Company or its affiliates; or

          (e)  Solicit any employee of the Company or its affiliates to
leave their employment with the Company or its subsidiaries or
affiliates, as the case may be, or hire any such employee to work for a
Business.

     The Employee shall not be entitled to circumvent the provisions of
this Agreement by entering into a relationship with a Business as a
consultant, director, adviser, or otherwise, which has the effect of
competing with the Company, its affiliates or subsidiaries.

     This covenant on the part of the Employee shall be construed as an
agreement independent of any other provision of this Agreement and the
existence of any claim or cause of action by the Employee against the
Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not
constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of this covenant.

     3.   REMEDIES FOR BREACH.  If the Employee commits a breach, or
threatens to commit a breach, of any of the provisions of this Agreement,
the Company shall have the following rights and remedies, in addition to
any others, each of which shall be independent of the other and severally
enforceable:

          (a)  The right to have the provisions of this Agreement
specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being
acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach will
cause irreparable injury to the Company and that money damages will not
provide an adequate remedy to the Company; and

<PAGE>
     The right and remedy to require the Employee to account for and pay
over to the Company all compensation, profits, monies, accruals,
increments, or other benefits (the "Benefits") derived or received by the
Employee as a result of any transactions constituting a breach of any of
the provisions of this Agreement, the Employee agreeing to account for
and pay over the Benefits as provided above.

     4.   CONTROLLING AGREEMENT.  In the event of any conflict between
the terms of this Agreement, the Employment Agreement, or the Asset
Purchase Agreement, the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement shall
control.

     5.   ATTORNEY'S FEES.  In the event that it should become necessary
for any party entitled hereunder to bring suit against any other party to
this Agreement for enforcement of the covenants herein contained, the
parties hereby covenant and agree that the party who is found to be in
violation of said covenants shall also be liable for all reasonable
attorney's fees and costs of court incurred by the other parties hereto.

     6.   BENEFIT.  All the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties hereto, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators,
personal representatives, successors and permitted assigns.

     7.   NOTICE.  All notices, requests and other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given
at the time of receipt if delivered by hand or communicated by electronic

provided, however, that if either party shall have designated a different

subsequent notice shall be addressed to such party at the last address so

     8.   CONSTRUCTION.  Words of any gender used in this Agreement shall
be held and construed to include any other gender, and words in the
singular number shall be held to include the plural, and vice versa,
unless the context requires otherwise.  In addition, the pronouns used in
this Agreement shall be understood and construed to apply whether the

     9.   WAIVER.  No course of dealing on the part of any party hereto
or its agents, or any failure or delay by any such party with respect to
exercising any right, power or privilege of such party under this
Agreement or any instrument referred to herein shall operate as a waiver
thereof, and any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or
privilege shall not preclude any later exercise thereof or any exercise
of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder.

this Agreement and the instruments executed or to be executed in
connection herewith, or any of them, shall be cumulative and the exercise
or partial exercise of any such right or remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other right or remedy.

     11.  INVALIDITY.  If a judicial determination is made that any of
the provisions of this Agreement constitutes an unreasonable or otherwise
unenforceable restriction against the Employee, the provisions of this
Agreement shall be rendered void only to the extent that such judicial
determination finds such provisions to be unreasonable or otherwise
unenforceable.  In this regard, the parties hereto hereby agree that any
judicial authority construing this Agreement shall be empowered to sever
any portion of the territory or prohibited business activity from the
coverage of this Agreement and to apply the provisions of this Agreement
to the remaining portion of the territory or the remaining business
activities not so severed by such judicial authority.  Moreover,
notwithstanding the fact that any provisions of this Agreement are
determined not to be specifically enforceable, the Company shall
nevertheless be entitled to recover monetary damages as a result of the
breach of such provision by the Employee.  The time period during which
the prohibitions set forth in this Agreement shall apply shall be tolled
and suspended as to the Employee for a period equal to the aggregate
quantity of time during which the Employee violates such prohibitions in
any respect.

     12.  HEADINGS.  The headings used in this Agreement are for
convenience and reference only and in no way define, limit, simplify or
describe the scope or intent of this Agreement, and in no way effect or
constitute a part of this Agreement.

     13.  MULTIPLE COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all

     This covenant on the part of the Employee shall be construed as an

     5.   ATTORNEY'S FEES.  In the event that it should become necessary
for any party entitled hereunder to bring suit against any other party to
this Agreement for enforcement of the covenants herein contained, the

be held and construed to include any other gender, and words in the
singular number shall be held to include the plural, and vice versa,
unless the context requires otherwise.  In addition, the pronouns used in
this Agreement shall be understood and construed to apply whether the
party referred to is an individual, partnership, joint venture,
corporation or an individual or individuals doing business under a firm
or trade name, and the masculine, feminine and neuter pronouns shall each
include the other and may be used interchangeably with the same meaning.

     9.   WAIVER.  No course of dealing on the part of any party hereto
or its agents, or any failure or delay by any such party with respect to
exercising any right, power or privilege of such party under this
Agreement or any instrument referred to herein shall operate as a waiver
thereof, and any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or
privilege shall not preclude any later exercise thereof or any exercise
of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder.

     11.  INVALIDITY.  If a judicial determination is made that any of
the provisions of this Agreement constitutes an unreasonable or otherwise
unenforceable restriction against the Employee, the provisions of this
Agreement shall be rendered void only to the extent that such judicial
determination finds such provisions to be unreasonable or otherwise
unenforceable.  In this regard, the parties hereto hereby agree that any
judicial authority construing this Agreement shall be empowered to sever
any portion of the territory or prohibited business activity from the
coverage of this Agreement and to apply the provisions of this Agreement
to the remaining portion of the territory or the remaining business
activities not so severed by such judicial authority.  Moreover,
notwithstanding the fact that any provisions of this Agreement are
determined not to be specifically enforceable, the Company shall
nevertheless be entitled to recover monetary damages as a result of the
breach of such provision by the Employee.  The time period during which
the prohibitions set forth in this Agreement shall apply shall be tolled
and suspended as to the Employee for a period equal to the aggregate
quantity of time during which the Employee violates such prohibitions in
any respect.

     12.  HEADINGS.  The headings used in this Agreement are for
convenience and reference only and in no way define, limit, simplify or
describe the scope or intent of this Agreement, and in no way effect or
constitute a part of this Agreement.

     13.  MULTIPLE COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
