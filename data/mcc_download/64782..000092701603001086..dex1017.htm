year (&#147;bonus potential&#148;). The Company evaluates performance giving consideration to a number of criteria, and all criteria will be considered when determining the overall rating for the Executive. If the Executive receives an overall
annual performance rating of &#147;O&#148; (Outstanding) or its then equivalent for a calendar year, management of the Company will recommend to the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (&#147;HRC&#148;) that the Executive receive at
least 100% of his bonus potential for such bonus year and, at the discretion of management, up to 133% of his bonus potential. If the Executive&#146;s overall annual performance rating for such bonus year is less than &#147;O,&#148; management of
the Company will recommend to the HRC a bonus for the Executive for the annual bonus period based upon the same bonus methodology as that used to calculate the bonus potential for other similarly situated Vice Chairs of the Company. It is understood
that the Executive may be paid at the Company&#146;s election up to 25% of his annual bonus in the form of an award of restricted stock, provided however, such restriction is applied to similarly situated Vice Chairs of the Company and with such
awards to be made on no less favorable terms as apply to other Vice Chairs of the Company. The Executive shall receive his bonus award for any year no later than other similarly situated Vice Chairs of the Company receive their bonus awards for such
year. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Long-Term Incentive

plan or program, the &#147;LTIP&#148;) composed of the following three components: (1) Dreyfus Performance Accelerated Restricted Stock (&#147;Dreyfus PARS&#148;); (2) Asset Management Performance Accelerated Restricted Stock (&#147;Asset Management
PARS&#148;); and (3) Mellon Financial Corporation Type I stock options (non-qualified stock options with double re-load rights) (&#147;Options&#148;). The amount of the LTIP award will be reviewed annually. Each award shall be divided equally (based
on net present value) among the three components described immediately above and <U>provided</U>,<U> however</U>, such shares are available and the award is consistent with the LTIP, shall have an aggregate net present value as of the date of award
of $1,687,500 (or such greater amount as the Company may then deem appropriate based on a review to be conducted annually, prior to the date of award, beginning with the award to be made in January of 2004). Net present values shall in all cases be
determined on no less favorable a basis than that which applies to similarly situated Vice Chairs of the Company. Each component and all aspects of any annual long-term incentive award will be subject to the terms of the LTIP and, to the extent not
inconsistent with this Agreement, the required individualized agreement. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%"><FONT
