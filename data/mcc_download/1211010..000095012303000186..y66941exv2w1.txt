referred to above, such firm shall be selected by lot from those independent
public accounting firms of recognized national standing in the United States
that are willing to act and, if there are no such independent public accounting
firms, from the willing independent public accounting firms of recognized
regional standing in the region in which either Buyer or Distribution has its
corporate headquarters (the independent public accounting firm selected


                                       14
<PAGE>
pursuant to the foregoing procedures, the "ACCOUNTING MEDIATOR"). The Accounting
Mediator shall be instructed to resolve the Objections and such resolution shall
be (i) set forth in writing and signed by the Accounting Mediator, (ii)
delivered to Buyer and Distribution as soon as practicable after the Objections
are submitted to the Accounting Mediator but not later than the 30th day after
such submission, (iii) made in accordance with this Agreement and (iv)
conclusive and binding on the Parties on the date of delivery of such
resolution. The Accounting Mediator shall only be authorized on any one issue to
decide in favor of and choose the position of Buyer or Distribution or to decide
upon a compromise position between the ranges presented by Buyer and
Distribution to the Accounting Mediator. The Accounting Mediator shall base its
decision solely upon the presentations of Buyer and Distribution to the
Accounting Mediator at a hearing held before the Accounting Mediator and upon
any materials made available by Buyer and Distribution and not upon independent
review. If the foregoing procedure does not result in the selection of an
Accounting Mediator or if the Accounting Mediator does not or is unwilling to
resolve all of the Objections on or before the expiration of 30 days from the
date of submission of the Objections, either Buyer or Distribution shall be
entitled to apply for arbitration in accordance with the provisions set forth in
Section 10.9.

            (c) AMOUNT. Subject to the limitation imposed by Section 2.9(d), if
the Purchase Price Adjustment as finally determined (whether by agreement of
Buyer and Distribution, lapse of time or resolution of the Objections) is
positive, Buyer shall pay to Distribution the amount of the Purchase Price
Adjustment plus interest from the Closing Date to the date of payment, inclusive
of each such date, at the Reference Rate. If the Purchase Price Adjustment as
finally determined is negative, Distribution shall pay to Buyer the amount of
the Purchase Price Adjustment plus interest for the period and at the rate
described in the preceding sentence.

            (d) LIMITATION. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this
Section 2.9 to the contrary, if the Purchase Price Adjustment (excluding
interest) as calculated pursuant to this Section 2.9, as finally determined, is
less than $500,000 (whether a positive value owed to Distribution or a negative
value owed to Buyer), then no Purchase Price Adjustment shall be paid.

            (e) PAYMENT. Payment of the Purchase Price Adjustment plus accrued
interest shall be made by Buyer or Distribution, as the case may be, to the
other Party in United States Dollars by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the wire transfer address of such other Party on the fifth Business Day
following the date on which the period for Objections has expired or, if any
Objections are asserted, on the fifth Business Day following the date on which
the procedures for resolution of the Objections in this Section 2.9 have been
completed; provided, however, that any portion of the Purchase Price Adjustment
that is not the subject of an Objection shall be paid on the fifth Business Day
following the date on which Distribution presents its Objections to Buyer,
regardless of the pendency of any Objections. The wire transfer address for such
payment shall be designated by Buyer or Distribution as the case may be, by
notice to the other Party on or before the second Business Day prior to the date
for payment set forth above.


                                       15

            (f) EFFECT ON REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Any amount that is
included in preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet and taken into account in
computing the Purchase Price Adjustment shall not form the basis for a claim for
breach of any representation or warranty under this Agreement.

      2.10 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. Buyer and Distribution shall mutually
agree on the allocation of the Purchase Price (which, for purposes of this
Section 2.10, shall include any Assumed Obligations properly treated as
consideration within the meaning of Section 1060 of the Code) among the
Purchased Assets, which shall be mutually adjusted by Buyer and Distribution as
necessary to conform with the principles of Section 1060 of the Code. Buyer and
Distribution shall use reasonable good faith efforts to mutually agree upon such
allocation prior to the Closing Date, but in any event shall mutually agree upon
such allocation within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date. Such
agreed-upon allocation shall be set forth on Schedule 2.10, which shall then
become a part of this Agreement. To the extent a Purchase Price Adjustment
occurs or any indemnification claim is paid, Buyer and Distribution shall use
reasonable good faith efforts to promptly mutually agree upon the appropriate
adjustments to the allocations set forth on Schedule 2.10, and such modified
allocations shall then be the allocations that Buyer and Distribution shall use.
Unless there exists a good faith disagreement about the allocations set forth on
Schedule 2.10, Buyer and Distribution shall report the federal, state and local
income and other Tax consequences of the purchase and sale contemplated hereby
in a manner consistent with such allocation, as modified, and shall not take any
position inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax Return, in any
refund claim, in any Litigation or otherwise.

                                   ARTICLE III
                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF DISTRIBUTION

      3.2 AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABILITY. This Agreement and each Related
Agreement to which Distribution is a party has been duly executed and delivered

enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other Laws of general
application relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity
principles. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and each Related
Agreement to which Distribution is a party and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate proceedings on the part of Distribution.

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, nor the
compliance with or fulfillment of the terms, conditions or provisions hereof or
thereof by Distribution:

                  (i) violates any provision of the Governing Documents of

Contract to which Distribution is a party or by which any of its assets may be

                  (iii) subject to the making of the filings required under the
HSR Act, violates any Law to which Distribution is subject or by which any asset
of Distribution is bound or affected, the result of which would have a Material
Adverse Effect.

            (b) CONSENTS. Other than filings required in compliance with the
provisions of the HSR Act, and such consents, approvals, authorizations,
registrations or filings the failure of which to obtain or make would not have a
Material Adverse Effect, and except as set forth on Schedule 6.3, no consent,
approval or authorization of, or registration or filing with, any Person is
required in connection with the execution or delivery by Distribution of this

                  (viii) any write-offs, write-downs or write-ups of the value

                  (ix) any mortgage or pledge of any material assets of
Distribution, except for Permitted Encumbrances arising in the ordinary course
of business;

                  (x) any creation or assumption of any Debt Obligation for
borrowed money, except for Debt Obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business or pursuant to Contracts disclosed ON Schedule 3.16 or entered into in

negotiable instruments by Distribution in the ordinary course of business; or

                  (xii) any agreement or commitment to do any of the foregoing.

      3.7 TAXES.

            (a) AFFILIATED GROUP. Distribution is a member of an "affiliated
group" (the "AFFILIATED GROUP") within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the
Code, and VNAO is the "common parent" of the Affiliated Group.

            (b) LIABILITIES. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.7(b), each member
of the Affiliated Group, has:

                  (i) duly and timely filed with the appropriate federal, state,
local or other taxing authorities all material Tax Returns for which
Distribution could have liability for Taxes and that were required to be filed
by it, and all such Tax Returns were true, correct and complete in all respects,
and

                  (ii) duly and timely paid all Taxes shown to be due and
payable on such Tax Returns with respect to Distribution.

Any Tax Return or Taxes for which an extension to file or pay has been obtained
will be deemed to be timely if filed and paid (along with any interest or
penalties with respect to such Taxes) by the date provided by any such
extension.

            (c) PAYMENT OR ACCRUAL OF TAXES. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.7(c) and except for Income Taxes, franchise Taxes and payroll Taxes, (i) all
Taxes of Distribution for all Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
and (ii) all Taxes of Distribution for the portion of any Straddle Period ending
on and including the Closing Date (each such year or period or portion thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date, a "PRE-CLOSING PERIOD"), have

                                       19
<PAGE>
been paid or accrued on the Balance Sheet (or will be accrued on the Closing
Date Balance Sheet). For purposes of determining the proper accrual by
Distribution for ad valorem property or similar Taxes for the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date, the Taxes for the
Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date on a daily basis; provided, however, that if
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement result in the reassessment of
the value of any of the Purchased Assets for property Tax purposes, or the
imposition of any property Taxes at a rate which is different than the rate that
would have been imposed if such transactions had not occurred, then (x) the
portion of such property Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
and including the Closing Date shall be determined on a daily basis, using the
assessed value and Tax rate that would have applied had such transactions not
occurred, and (y) the portion of such property Taxes for the portion of such
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date shall be the total property
Taxes for the Straddle Period minus the amount described in clause (x) of this
sentence. For purposes of determining the proper accrual by Distribution of all
Taxes not set forth in the immediately preceding sentence such accrual shall be
based on the deemed closing of Distribution's books as of the Closing Date.

            (d) AUDITS; EXAMINATIONS. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.7(d):

                  (i) (A) no audit or other examination of Taxes is currently
pending with respect to the Affiliated Group which audit or examination would
materially adversely affect the Tax liability of Distribution; and (B) no such
audit or examination has been conducted with respect to which there is any
outstanding Tax liability; and

                  (ii) No member of the Affiliated Group has received any
written notice of any Tax deficiency outstanding, proposed or assessed against
it which Distribution could be held liable; and

                  (iii) as of the Closing Date, no statute of limitations will
remain open as a result of its having been waived or extended with respect to
the payment or collection of Taxes of the Affiliated Group.

            (e) AGREEMENTS. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.7(e), there are no
tax sharing, allocation, indemnification or similar agreements in effect as
between Distribution and any other Person (except for customary agreements to
indemnify lenders or security holders in respect of Taxes).

            (f) CONSOLIDATED RETURNS. Except with respect to the Affiliated
Group or as set forth on Schedule 3.7(f), Distribution has not been included in
any "consolidated," "unitary," "combined" or similar Tax Return provided for
under any Law with respect to Taxes for which Distribution may be liable for any
taxable period for which the statute of limitations has not expired.

            (g) MISCELLANEOUS.

                  (i) Distribution is not a "foreign person" within the meaning
of Section 1445 of the Code; and

                  (ii) Schedule 3.7(g) lists each jurisdiction in which
Distribution is filing Tax Returns.

      3.8 RIGHTS IN ASSETS.

            (a) OWNED REAL PROPERTY. Schedule 3.8(a) sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all real property owned as of the date hereof by Distribution

            (b) LEASES OF REAL PROPERTY. Schedule 3.8(b) sets forth a complete

(collectively, the "LEASED REAL PROPERTY"). Except as set forth on Schedule
3.8(b), Distribution is in possession of the real property covered under each
lease set forth on Schedule 3.8(b) for which it is the lessee. Each lease with

is no office or other facility shared by Distribution and USF or any of USF's
Affiliates.

            (e) ADEQUACY OF ASSETS. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.8(e), the
Purchased Assets constitute all of the assets necessary to operate the Business
after the Closing Date in substantially the same manner as the Business is
presently conducted; provided, however, Distribution makes no representation as
to the adequacy of the working capital of Distribution which is delivered at
Closing.

      3.9 NO PENDING LITIGATION. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.9, no
Litigation is pending or, to Distribution's Knowledge, threatened against
Distribution, with respect to which there is a reasonable likelihood of a Loss
not covered by insurance, which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

"PERMITS") that are required under applicable Laws to entitle it to own or
lease, operate and use its assets and to carry on and conduct the Business as
currently conducted by it, except for any Permit the absence of which would not
have a Material Adverse Effect, and all such Permits are valid and in full force

is in compliance with all Laws applicable to it respecting employment and labor
and employment practices, leased employees, terms and conditions of employment

to the employees of Distribution. There are no strikes, slowdowns or work

Environment S.A. or Vivendi Universal S.A. which benefit employees of
Distribution and none of such plans is subject to ERISA. Except for payroll tax
obligations which may arise upon exercise of certain Vivendi Employee Benefit
Plans, Distribution has no obligations in respect of, or any unfunded
liabilities pursuant to, any Vivendi Employee Benefit Plan.

                  (c) LIABILITIES.

                        (i) No USF Employee Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

                        (ii) Each USF Employee Benefit Plan which is a "group
health plan" (as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(l) of the Code or
Section 607(l) of ERISA) has been administered and operated in substantial
compliance with the applicable requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I
of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA"), and Distribution is not
subject to any liability, including additional contributions, fines, taxes,
penalties or Loss of tax deduction as a result of the administration and
operation of any such USF Employee Benefit Plan. No USF Employee Benefit Plan
which is such a group health plan is a "multiple employer welfare arrangement,"
within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. Each USF Employee Benefit Plan
that is intended to meet the requirements of Section 125 of the Code meets such
requirements in all material respects, and each program of benefits for which
employee contributions are provided pursuant to elections under any USF Employee
Benefit Plan meets the requirements of the Code applicable thereto.

                        (iii) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(c)(iii), no
USF Employee Benefit Plan (whether qualified or non-qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code) provides for post-employment or retiree health, life
insurance and/or other welfare benefits, and Distribution

                                       24
<PAGE>
has no obligation under any USF Employee Benefit Plan to provide any such
benefits to any retired or former employees or active employees following such
employees' retirement or termination of service except as required by COBRA or
any similar state law. Distribution has no unfunded liabilities pursuant to any
USF Employee Benefit Plan that is not intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code.

                        (iv) Distribution has not incurred any liability or
civil penalty under Section 409, 502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA or liability for any
tax or excise tax arising under Chapter 43 or Section 6652 of the Code with
respect to any USF Employee Benefit Plan and no event has occurred and no
condition or circumstance exists that could reasonably be expected to give rise
to any such liability with respect to any USF Employee Benefit Plan.

                        (v) There are no actions, suits or claims pending or,
to Distribution's Knowledge, threatened against or with respect to any USF
Employee Benefit Plan or the assets of any such plan (other than routine claims
for benefits and appeals of denied routine claims), and no civil or criminal
action brought pursuant to the provisions of Title I, Subtitle B, Part 5 of
ERISA is pending or, to Distribution's Knowledge, threatened against
Distribution or, to Distribution's Knowledge, any fiduciary of any USF Employee
Benefit Plan with respect to any USF Employee Benefit Plan. USF has not received
any written notice that any USF Employee Benefit Plan or any fiduciary thereof
is presently the direct or indirect subject of an audit, investigation or
examination by any governmental or quasi-governmental agency.

                        (vi) Except as shown on Schedule 3.13(c)(vi),
Distribution has no liabilities (actual or contingent) with respect to any USF
Employee Benefit Plan.

                  (d) CONTRIBUTIONS. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(d),
(i) USF and Distribution have, in respect of the United States Filter
Corporation Retirement Savings Plan, and (ii) Distribution has in respect to all
other USF Employee Benefit Plans, made full and timely payment of all amounts
required to be paid by it as contributions or premiums.

                  (e) TAX QUALIFICATION. Each USF Employee Benefit Plan intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, as currently in effect, is the
subject of a favorable determination letter issued by the Internal Revenue
Service and the remedial amendment period described in Section 401(b) of the
Code applicable to any amendment of any such USF Employee Benefit Plan adopted
after the date of such letter has not expired. Each trust established in
connection with any USF Employee Benefit Plan which is intended to be exempt
from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, as currently in
effect, is the subject of a favorable determination letter issued by the
Internal Revenue Service and the remedial amendment period described in Section
401(b) of the Code applicable to any amendment of any such USF Employee Benefit
Plan adopted after the date of such letter has not expired. Since the date of
each most recent determination letter referred to in this paragraph (e), no
event has occurred and no condition or circumstance exists that has resulted or
is reasonably likely to result in the revocation of any such determination
letter or that is reasonably likely to adversely affect the qualified status of
any such USF Employee Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such trust.

other Persons who participate in the operation of any USF Employee Benefit Plan
or related trust or funding vehicle, has engaged in any transaction with
respect to any USF Employee Benefit Plan, or breached any applicable fiduciary
responsibilities or obligations under Title I of ERISA that would subject any of
them to a tax, penalty or liability for prohibited transactions or breach of any
obligations under ERISA or the Code or would result in any claim being made
under, by or on behalf of any such USF Employee Benefit Plan by any party with
standing to make such claim.

                  (g) DOCUMENTS. True and complete copies of the United States

most recent IRS determination letter, obtained with respect to such plan, the
trust agreement applicable to such plan, the most recent annual report on Form

reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in facilitating Buyer's completing

any provision of Section 3.12 to the contrary, Distribution is not conveying any
ownership rights to Buyer for, or licensing Buyer to use, any of the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, service names, assumed names, brand names or
Internet domain names of USF or any of its Affiliates, including the rights to
the name "USF," "U.S. Filter," "US Filter," "USFilter," "United States Filter
Corp.," "United States Filter Corporation" or any derivation or variation
thereof or any corporate name which includes any of the foregoing names (all
such names together the "RESERVED NAMES") and after the Closing Buyer shall:

                        (i) promptly (but in no event later than 90 days after
the Closing) destroy all stocks of written, printed or other graphic materials
in its possession or control that use or embody any names or marks of USF or any
of its Affiliates, including the Reserved Names or modify such materials to
remove or cover over any such names or marks; and

                        (ii) promptly (but in no event later than 30 days after
the Closing) remove or cause to be removed any links from any of Distribution's
websites on the World Wide Web to any website maintained by or on behalf of USF

<PAGE>
and cease the use of any metatags utilizing any Reserved Name or any confusingly
similar word or phrase to direct traffic to a website not owned by the owner of
the Reserved Names.

                  (b) CORPORATE NAMES. It is expressly understood and agreed by

obligations under this Section 7.1, Distribution may proceed against it law or
in equity for such damages or other relief as a court may deem appropriate.
Buyer acknowledges that a violation of this Section 7.1 may cause USF and its
Subsidiaries irreparable harm which may not be adequately compensated for by
money damages. Buyer therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or
threatened violation of this Section 7.1, Distribution shall be entitled, in
addition to other remedies that it may have, to a temporary restraining order
and to preliminary and final injunctive relief against Buyer to prevent any
violations of this Section 7.1, without the necessity of posting a bond.

         7.2 TAX MATTERS.

cause to be prepared, executed and timely filed, all Tax Returns with respect to
Retained Taxes.

                        (ii) Buyer shall have the exclusive authority and
obligation to prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed,

with the prior practices and positions of Distribution unless such treatment is
no longer permitted by applicable Law. With respect to any such Tax Return which
includes a Pre-Closing Period for which Distribution may be required to
indemnify Buyer under Article IX as a result of a breach of a representation or
warranty, Buyer shall provide Distribution with a draft copy of such Tax Return
and an opportunity to review and comment on such Tax Return at least thirty (30)
days prior to the date for filing such Tax Return. Distribution shall not be
obligated to provide any indemnification for Taxes with respect to any
Pre-Closing Period if Buyer fails to provide Distribution with such opportunity
to review and comment on a Tax Return prior to its filing to the extent that
Distribution is actually prejudiced with respect thereto. Buyer shall in good
faith take into account such comments in its preparation of such Tax Returns.

                  (b) TAX AUDITS. Distribution shall promptly notify Buyer upon
receipt by Distribution or any of its Affiliates of notice of any pending or
threatened Tax audits, examinations, notices of deficiency or other adjustments,
assessments or redeterminations relating to Assumed Taxes ("ASSUMED TAX
MATTERS"). Buyer shall have responsibility for handling, and shall have the
right to control, contest, resolve and defend against, any Assumed Tax Matters;
provided, however, that with respect to any Assumed Tax Matter for which
Distribution may be required to indemnify Buyer under Article IX as a result of
a breach of a representation or warranty, (A) Buyer shall keep Distribution
informed with respect to the

                                       37
<PAGE>
commencement, status and nature of such Assumed Tax Matter and (B) neither Buyer
nor any of its Affiliates shall agree to any deficiency, adjustment, assessment
or redetermination, or enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any
such Assumed Tax Matter, without the prior written consent of Distribution,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                  (c) POWERS OF ATTORNEY. Distribution shall execute and provide
to Buyer such powers of attorney or other forms of authorization as may be
necessary in order for Buyer to perform its obligations under Sections

                        (i) assist the other Party in preparing any Tax Returns
which such other Party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance
with Section 7.2(a); provided, however, the obligation of USF and its Affiliates
shall only extend to the date which is two (2) years following the date on which
the Tax Returns are due for the relevant Straddle Period;

                        (ii) upon reasonable notice and without undue
interruption to the business of such Party or Distribution, provide access
during normal business hours to the books and records of such Party relating to
the Taxes of Distribution prior to the Closing Date and for the Straddle Period;
and

                        (iii) furnish the other with copies of all
correspondence received from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax
matter or information request with respect to any taxable period for which the
other may have a liability.

                  (e) Distribution shall deliver to Buyer at the Closing a
certificate complying with the Code and Treasury Regulations, in form and
substance satisfactory to Buyer, duly executed and acknowledged, certifying that
the transactions contemplated hereby are exempt from withholding under Section

for, and the amount of, vacation or holiday pay of Affected Employees who are
hired by Buyer, employment of such employees by Distribution or USF or any of
its Subsidiaries as of the conclusion of the Transition Period shall be taken
into account to the same extent as if it had been employment by Buyer. Buyer

                  (j) USF FLEXIBLE BENEFIT PLAN. If the last day of the

deferrals, net of any amounts previously paid out by USF to Affected Employees
with respect to eligible medical and dependent care expenses incurred in the
2002 plan year.

                  (k) USF MANAGEMENT DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN. Effective as of
the day immediately following the last day of the Transition Period, Buyer shall
establish an employee benefit plan for the benefit of those Affected Employees
who participate in the USF Management Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DEFERRED
COMPENSATION PLAN") AS of the last day of the Transition Period pursuant to
which Buyer shall assume the obligations of USF under the Deferred Compensation
Plan as of the last day of the Transition Period with respect to such Affected
Employees and shall establish a rabbi trust (as defined in Internal Revenue
Service Revenue Procedure 92-64, 1992-2 C.B. 422) (the "BUYER RABBI TRUST") to
fund benefits under such plan. As a condition of Buyer's assuming such
obligations, and subject to receipt by USF of the Deferred Compensation Plan
Transfer Amount (as defined below), USF shall cause the trustee of the rabbi
trust established in connection with the USF Deferred Compensation Plan (the
"USF RABBI TRUST") to transfer to the trustee of the Buyer Rabbi Trust assets
equal to Distribution's liability under the Deferred Compensation Plan to such
Affected Employees as of the last day of the Transition Period. USF's obligation
to cause the transfer of such assets shall be subject to the prior receipt by
USF of cash equal to the aggregate amount of all compensation withheld by
Distribution in respect of the Deferred Compensation Plan from such Affected
Employees on or before the last day of the Transition Period that has not been
forwarded to USF (the "DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN TRANSFER AMOUNT"). As of the
last day of the Transition Period, Buyer shall have no liabilities with respect
to the Deferred Compensation Plan except to provide benefits equal to
liabilities assumed by Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.3(k). Buyer acknowledges
that the assets to be transferred from the USF Rabbi Trust to the Buyer's Rabbi
Trust pursuant to this Section 7.3(k) may consist of insurance policies on the
lives of the Affected Employees. To the extent that the cash surrender value of
such insurance policies is less than the obligations assumed by Buyer under this
Section 7.3(k), USF shall pay sufficient additional amounts to the Buyer Rabbi
Trust as are required to make the amount of the assets & transferred equal to
the amount of the obligations assumed. To the extent that the cash surrender

                                       41
<PAGE>
value of such insurance policies is greater than the obligations assumed by
Buyer under this Section 7.3(k) Buyer shall pay to USF such amount as shall be
necessary to make the amount of the assets transferred equal to the amount of
the obligations assumed.

         7.4 MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN. Distribution contributes to the Central
States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (the "CENTRAL STATES FUND").
The parties hereto acknowledge that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement would cause a complete withdrawal by Distribution and the controlled
group (within the meaning of Section 3(14)(A) of ERISA) of which Distribution is
a member (the "DISTRIBUTION CONTROLLED GROUP") from the Central States Fund and
could, therefore, result in the imposition of withdrawal liability against the
Distribution Controlled Group in accordance with Section 4203 of ERISA. The
parties hereby intend to forestall the imposition of withdrawal liability
against the Distribution Controlled Group by complying with Section 4204 of
ERISA, as follows:

                  (i) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall assume an
         obligation to contribute to the Central States Fund with respect to the
         Business for substantially the same number of contribution base units
         (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(l) of ERISA) for which the
         Distribution Controlled Group had an obligation to contribute as of the
         Closing.

                  (ii) Buyer shall provide to the Central States Fund, for a
         period of five plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning
         after the Closing, a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is
         an acceptable surety for purposes of Section 412 of ERISA, or an amount
         held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory
         to the Central States Fund, in an amount equal to the greater of (A)
         the average annual contribution required to be made by the Distribution
         Controlled Group with respect to the Business for the three plan years
         preceding the plan year in which the sale of the assets of the Business
         hereunder occurs, or (B) the annual contribution that the Distribution
         Controlled Group was required to make with respect to the Business for
         the last plan year before the plan year in which the sale of the
         Purchased Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the foregoing bond
         or escrow shall not be required if Buyer can demonstrate to the
         satisfaction of the Central States Fund that the exception to the bond
         or escrow requirement described in Pension Benefit guaranty Corporation
         ("PBGC") Regulation Section 4204.12 or 4204.13 applies and (ii) the
         foregoing bond or escrow shall not be required or may be terminated
         prior to expiration of the five plan year period described above if
         Buyer can obtain a variance from the Central States Fund or the PBGC in
         accordance with PBGC Regulation Section 4204.11.

                  (iii) The bond or escrow described in Section 7.4(ii), if any,
         shall be paid to the Central States Fund if Buyer withdraws from the
         Central States Fund, or fails to make a contribution to the Central
         States Fund when due, at any time during the first five plan years
         beginning after the Closing.

                  (iv) If Buyer withdraws from the Central States Fund in a
         complete withdrawal (within the meaning of Section 4203 of ERISA), or a
         partial withdrawal (within the meaning of Section 4205 of ERISA), with
         respect to the Business during the

                                       42
<PAGE>
         five plan year period described in Section 7.4(ii), each member of the
         Distribution Controlled Group, including USF and Distribution, shall be
         secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability that the Distribution
         Controlled Group would have had with respect to the Central States Fund
         (but for this Section 7.4 and Section 4204 of ERISA) if the withdrawal
         liability of Buyer with respect to the Central States Fund is not paid.
         Accordingly, if Buyer withdraws from the Central States Fund before the
         last day of such five plan year period, and fails to make any
         withdrawal liability payment when due, then Distribution shall pay to
         the Central States Fund an amount equal to the payment which would have
         been due from the Distribution Controlled Group but for this Section
         7.4 and Section 4204 of ERISA.

                  (v) If all, or substantially all, of the Distribution
         Controlled Group's assets are distributed subsequent to the Closing and
         before the end of the five plan year period described in Section
         7.4(ii), or if the Distribution Controlled Group is liquidated during
         such period, then Distribution shall provide a bond or amount in escrow
         equal to the present value of the withdrawal liability the Distribution
         Controlled Group would have had but for this Section 7.4 and Section
         4204 of ERISA. If only a portion of the Distribution Controlled Group's
         assets are distributed during such period, then a bond or escrow shall
         be required, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the PBGC, in
         a manner consistent with the preceding sentence.

                  (vi) The liability of the Party furnishing a bond or escrow
         under this Section 7.4 shall be reduced upon payment of the bond or
         escrow to the Central States Fund, by the amount thereof.

                  (vii) Any withdrawal liability of Buyer with respect to the
         Central States Fund shall be determined as if Buyer had been required
         to contribute to the Central States Fund, in the plan year in which the
         Closing occurs and the four plan years preceding the Closing the amount
         that the Distribution Controlled Group was required to contribute for
         such five plan years.

                  (viii) Buyer shall indemnify USF, Distribution and each member
         of the Distribution Controlled Group, and any Related Party, for any
         losses or expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorney's
         fees and expenses) which USF, Distribution or any member of the
         Distribution Controlled Group may incur (A) as a result of Buyer's
         complete or partial withdrawal from the Central States Fund, including
         any liability pursuant to Section 7.4(iv), or (B) with respect to any
         bond or escrow that may be required pursuant to Section 7.4(v).

                  (ix) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
         the provisions of this Section 7.4 shall survive the Closing.

                  (x) This Section 7.4 shall be interpreted in a manner
         consistent with the intention of the Parties that Section 4204 of ERISA
         shall apply to any withdrawal by the Distribution Controlled Group from
         the Central States Fund that may result from the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties shall cooperate with each
         other to the extent reasonably necessary to effectuate the foregoing
         intent and to Secure

                                       43
<PAGE>
         the acknowledgement by the Central States Fund of the applicability of
         Section 4204 of ERISA to any such withdrawal or the availability of any
         variance or exemption described in PBGC Regulation Sections
         4204.11, 4204.12 or 4204.13.

         7.5 NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT. Neither Buyer, nor Distribution, nor their
respective Affiliates shall, without the written approval of the other Parties
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), make any press release or
other public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except as and to the extent that any such Person shall be so
obligated by Law, in which case the other Parties to this Agreement shall be
advised and the Parties shall use their best efforts to cause a mutually
agreeable release or announcement to be issued; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures necessary to
implement the provisions of this Agreement or to comply with applicable
accounting and disclosure obligations of any Governmental Body or the rules of
any stock exchange (but to the extent practicable, each Party shall be given an
opportunity to provide comment to any such communication or disclosure).

         7.6 EXPENSES. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, each Party will pay all costs and expenses incident to its
negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and to its performance and
compliance with all agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to be
performed or complied with, including the fees, expenses and disbursements of
its counsel, investment banker and independent public accountants and the filing
fees payable in connection with each Party's respective filing required by the
HSR Act (provided, however, that Buyer shall pay (i) all fees and expenses of
accountants in excess of $72,000 for the matters set forth on Schedule 7.6
incurred by USF or Distribution in order to meet the conditions of the
Commitment Letters, and (ii) upon prior notice and approval (which approval will
not be unreasonably withheld) the other incremental fees and expenses of

Distribution or USF in order to meet the conditions of the Commitment Letters).
All transfer taxes, costs and expenses, including the costs of surveys,
environmental studies and title insurance, incurred in connection with the

         7.7 BOOKS AND RECORDS. From and after the Closing Date, each of
Distribution and Buyer shall maintain copies of all books and records retained
by Distribution, on the one hand, or acquired by Buyer as part of the Purchased
Assets, on the other hand, and shall not destroy any of such books and records
for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date without first
allowing the other Party, at such other Party's expense, to make copies of the
same. During that seven year period, Distribution and Buyer shall (i) grant to
the other Party and such other Party's representatives reasonable cooperation,
access and staff assistance at all reasonable times and upon reasonable notice
to all such books and records (including workpapers and correspondence with
taxing authorities) that are not otherwise protected by legal privilege, (ii)
afford the other Party and its representatives the right, at such other Party's
expense, to take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, and (iii)
provide the other Party access to employees, all to the extent reasonably
necessary or appropriate for general business purposes, including the

voluntarily liquidate or dissolve Distribution; and

                  (b) ensure that Distribution shall have funds sufficient to
enable it to pay its debts, obligations and other liabilities, including the
Retained Obligations and its indemnification obligations hereunder, as and when
they become due.

         7.9 POLICY CLAIMS. In the event of a claim with respect to the
Purchased Assets or Assumed Obligations arising from an occurrence on or prior
to the Closing Date for which Buyer believes coverage may be available under a
Policy, Buyer shall provide Distribution with prompt notice of such claim and,
subject to the terms of the applicable Policy, shall be entitled to pursue such
claim under the Policy. USF and Distribution shall use reasonable commercial
efforts (and shall use additional efforts to the extent all costs and expenses
associated with such additional efforts are paid or reimbursed by Buyer) to
cooperate with Buyer in connection with submitting such claim under an
applicable Policy and in pursuing coverage of such claim under such Policy and
USF and Distribution shall promptly remit any insurance proceeds received (net
of any third party expenses incurred) with respect to such claim to Buyer.

         7.10 NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION.

                  (a) AGREEMENT NOT TO COMPETE. Except as provided in Section
7.1(c), USF agrees that during the Non-Compete Period, it shall not, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries (so long as they remain Subsidiaries of USF) not
to, engage in a Prohibited Activity anywhere in the Territory.

                  (b) DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Section 7.10, the
following terms shall have the meaning set forth below:

                  "NON-COMPETE PERIOD" means the period from the Closing Date
                  until twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date.

                  "PROHIBITED ACTIVITY" means the purchase and resale to
                  contractors and end-users of pipes, fittings, valves, meters,
                  hydrants, and other components to build or repair water and
                  wastewater collection and distribution systems.

                  "TERRITORY" means the United States of America.

                  (c) PERMITTED ACTIVITIES. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section 7.10 to the contrary, during the Non-Compete Period the Parties
agree that USF and each

                                       45
<PAGE>
Subsidiary of USF may at any time engage in any or all of the following
activities anywhere in the Territory:

                        (i) directly or indirectly acquire, including by way of
a purchase of assets or securities or by way of merger or consolidation, any
Person or business (such Person or business, an "ACQUIRED BUSINESS") engaged in
any Prohibited Activity, if less than fifteen percent (15%) of the consolidated
gross revenues of such Acquired Business during the last completed fiscal year
of such Acquired Business prior to such acquisition were derived from any
Prohibited Activity. USF or any Subsidiary of USF may conduct such Prohibited
Activity through such Acquired Business without limitation or restriction and
without regard to the provisions of this Agreement;

                        (ii) directly or indirectly acquire, including by way of
a purchase of assets or securities or by way of merger or consolidation, any
Acquired Business even if fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated
gross revenues of such Acquired Business during the last completed fiscal year
of such Acquired Business prior to such acquisition were derived from any
Prohibited Activity; provided that, in such event, USF shall use (or cause the
Subsidiary of USF that acquired such Acquired Business to use) its commercially
reasonable efforts during the Non-Compete Period to dispose (in whole or in
part) of all or some business units of such Acquired Business that is then
engaged in such Prohibited Activity as soon as practicable after the
consummation of such acquisition, so that less than fifteen percent (15%) of the
consolidated gross revenues of such Acquired Business during the fiscal year of
such Acquired Business in which such acquisition occurred and thereafter during
the Non-Compete Period will be derived from such Prohibited Activity;

                        (iii) form, join, enter into or participate in any
partnerships, joint ventures, consortia and other relationships (including,
without limitation, as a subcontractor to, or pursuant to a subcontract with, a
provider engaged in any Prohibited Activity) which engage in any Prohibited
Activity, so long as the goods or services contributed by USF or any of its
Subsidiaries to any such partnership, joint venture, consortium or other
relationship do not require USF or any such Subsidiary to directly engage in
such Prohibited Activity;

                        (iv) perform under the terms of any contract or bid
proposal entered into or made in the ordinary course of business by USF or its
Subsidiaries on or prior to the date of this Agreement; and

                        (v) purchase and resale of pipes, fittings, valves,
meters, hydrants, and other components in connection with or ancillary to the
design, construction, erection, installation, repair, rehabilitation, operation
or maintenance by USF of municipal, industrial or commercial water or wastewater
collection, treatment, distribution or disposal equipment, facilities or
systems.

                  (d) REMEDY. If USF or any of its Subsidiaries violates any of
their obligations under this Section 7.10, Buyer and any of its Affiliates may
proceed against any of them in law or in equity for such damages or other relief
as a court may deem appropriate. USF acknowledges that a violation of this
Section 7.10 may cause Buyer or any of its Affiliates irreparable harm which may
not be adequately compensated for by money damages. USF

                                       46
<PAGE>
therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or threatened violation of this
Section 7.10, Buyer and any of its Affiliates shall be entitled, in addition to
other remedies that they may have, to a temporary restraining order and to
preliminary and final injunctive relief against USF and any of its Subsidiaries
to prevent any violations of this Section 7.10.

                  (e) NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. For a period of twenty-four
(24) months after the Closing Date, USF and its Subsidiaries will not, directly
or indirectly, (i) induce or attempt to induce any employee listed on Schedule
7.10 to leave the employ of Buyer, or (ii) employ or otherwise engage as an
employee, independent contractor or otherwise, any employee listed on Schedule
7.10.

         7.11 AMERICAN EXPRESS. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to effectuate a transfer or replacement prior to the Closing Date of the
American Express credit cards held by Affected Employees from the existing USF
or Distribution account to an account of Buyer. If Buyer is unable to complete
such transfer or replacement prior to the Closing Date Buyer shall continue to
use commercially reasonable efforts to complete such transfer or replacement as
promptly as possible. Following Closing and prior to the EARLIER of December 31,
2002 and the date of the completed transfer or replacement, USF shall permit the
Affected Employees to continue to use the existing American Express cards,
provided that Buyer shall reimburse USF for all amounts attributable to charges
made by Affected Employees made following the Closing Date. Buyer will indemnify
and hold harmless USF and Distribution from any and all Losses suffered by USF
or Distribution relating to such charges and related fees on such American
Express cards for periods following the Closing Date.

         8.3 TERMINATION.

                  (a) TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement may be terminated
at any time prior to the Closing by: (i) mutual consent of Buyer and
Distribution; (ii) Buyer, if any of the conditions specified in Section 8.1
hereof shall not have been fulfilled by March 31, 2003 and shall not have been
waived by Buyer; (iii) Distribution, if any of the conditions specified in
Section 8.2 hereof shall not have been fulfilled by March 31, 2003 and shall not

Governmental Body shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree or
ruling or taken any other nonappealable final action having the effect of
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transfer of the
Purchased Assets and assumption of the Assumed Obligations. If this Agreement is
validly terminated pursuant to this Section 8.3(a), this Agreement will
thereafter be null and

                                       49
<PAGE>
void, and there will be no liability or obligation on the part of USF,
Distribution or Buyer (or any Related Parties of any of them) except as provided
in Section 8.3(b) or Section 8.3(c) and except that Section 7.5 and Section 7.6

                  (b) REMEDIES. In the event of termination of this Agreement
pursuant to clause (i) or clause (iv) of the preceding Section 8.3(a), no Party
shall be liable to another Party for any breach hereof. In the event of
termination of this Agreement by either Buyer or Distribution pursuant to clause
(ii) or (iii) of the preceding Section 8.3(a), Distribution and USF, on a joint
and several basis, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall be
liable to the other for any breach hereof by such Party, which breach led to
such termination. Subject to the limitations in Section 9.4, Buyer and
Distribution shall be entitled to seek any remedy to which such Party may be
entitled at law or in equity in the event of such termination, which remedies
shall include injunctive relief and specific performance.

                  (c) LIMITATIONS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that this Agreement is terminated by one Party pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii)
of the first sentence of subsection (a) solely as a result of a failure by
another Party to satisfy a condition set forth in Article VIII, which condition
did not constitute a representation or warranty or a covenant of such other
Party and which failure could not have been reasonably anticipated by such other
Party and was beyond the reasonable control of such other Party, then no Party
shall have any remedy against the other Parties in connection with such
termination.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

any Indemnified Party (as hereinafter defined) under this Section 9.1
thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) any such representation or
warranty as to which a claim relating thereto is asserted in writing (which
states with specificity the basis therefor) in accordance with Section 9.3
during such survival period shall, with respect only to such claim, continue in
force and effect beyond such survival period pending resolution of such claim,
(b) the representations and warranties of Distribution set forth in Sections 3.3
shall survive forever, (c) the representations and warranties of Distribution
set forth in Section 3.7 shall survive until the expiration of the relevant
statute of limitations, (d) the representations and warranties of Distribution
set forth in Section 3.14 shall survive until the third anniversary of the
Closing Date; (e) the representations and warranties of USF set forth in Section
4.4 shall survive forever, and (f) the representations and warranties of Buyer
set forth in Section 5.5 shall survive forever.

         9.2 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION. If the transactions contemplated hereby
occur at the Closing, subject to the provisions of Section 9.1:

                  (a) INDEMNIFICATION BY USF AND DISTRIBUTION. USF and
Distribution each hereby agree, from and after the Closing, to jointly and
severally indemnify and hold harmless

                                       50
<PAGE>
the Buyer Indemnified Parties against any Recoverable Losses that such Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall actually incur, to the extent that such Recoverable
Losses (or claims, actions, suits or proceedings in respect thereof and any
appeals therefrom ("PROCEEDINGS")):

                        (i) arise out of any breach of any representation or
warranty made in Article III or Article IV;

                        (ii) arise out of any failure to perform any covenant
made herein by USF or Distribution; and

                        (iii) arise from or related to Retained Obligations.

                  (b)   INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER. Buyer hereby agrees, from and
after the Closing, to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties
against any Recoverable Losses that such Seller Indemnified Parties shall
actually incur, to the extent that such Recoverable Losses (or Proceedings in
respect thereof):

                        (i) arise out of any breach of any representation or
warranty made in Article V;

                        (ii) arise out of any failure to perform any covenant
made herein by Buyer; and

                        (iii) arise from or related to Assumed Obligations;
provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required to indemnify the Seller
Indemnified Parties for any Assumed Taxes for which USF is required to indemnify
Buyer as a result of a breach of Section 3.7.

                  (c) LIMITATIONS

                        (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Sections
9.2(a) and 9.2(b), an Indemnifying Party shall not have any liability to an
Indemnified Party under Section 9.2(a)(i) or Section 9.2(b)(i) unless and until
the aggregate amount of all Recoverable Losses incurred by such Indemnified
Party exceeds 1% of the Purchase Price as adjusted by any Purchase Price
Adjustment (the "ADJUSTED PURCHASE PRICE"), in which event only the amount in
excess of 1% of the Adjusted Purchase Price shall be recoverable; and the
aggregate liability of an Indemnifying Party under Section 9.2(a)(i) or under
Section 9.2(b)(i) shall not exceed 10% of the Adjusted Purchase Price; provided,
however, that the limitations set forth in this sentence shall not apply with
respect to USF's and Distribution's liability to the Buyer Indemnified Parties
for breaches of Section 3.3 or Section 4.4, shall not apply with respect to
Buyer's liability to the Seller Indemnified Parties for breach of Section 5.5 or
Section 5.6, and for the avoidance of doubt shall not apply to the liability of
Buyer or Distribution, as applicable, to pay the amount of the Purchase Price
Adjustment pursuant to the terms of Section 2.5 hereof and any amounts paid with
respect to the matters addressed in this proviso shall not be included in
determining whether the limitations in this sentence (the 1% and 10%
calculations) have been reached. All indemnity payments made under this Article
IX shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price. For the purposes of
determining the amount of Losses incurred by an Indemnified Party in accordance
with this Article IX, such Losses shall be offset by the amount of any Income
Tax

                                       51
<PAGE>
benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. For the
avoidance of doubt, the limitations set forth in this paragraph shall not apply
to indemnification under clauses (ii) or (iii) of Section 9.2(a) or clause (ii)
or (iii) of Section 9.2(b).

                        (ii) USF and Distribution shall not be liable for any
Losses resulting from a breach of any of the representations, warranties and
covenants set forth in Article III or Article IV of this Agreement or any of the
covenants set forth in Article VII of this Agreement to the extent that:

                           (1) the liability for such breach occurs or is
                  increased as a result of the adoption or imposition of any Law
                  not in force at the date of this Agreement or as a result of
                  any retroactive increase in rates of taxation imposed after
                  the Closing Date;

                           (2) the Losses would not have arisen but for a change
                  in accounting policy or practice of the Buyer after the
                  Closing; or

                           (3) Buyer has failed to first use commercially
                  reasonable efforts to recover any Losses from insurers under
                  any Policies or other third parties with respect to any
                  contractual rights to indemnification, reimbursement, offset
                  or recovery against such third parties existing as of the
                  Closing Date. Any amounts (net of enforcement costs and
                  deductibles) received from such insurers or such other third
                  parties shall reduce the amount of Losses for purposes of
                  determining the amount of USF's and Distribution's indemnity
                  obligation under this Article IX. If received after an
                  indemnification payment has been made by USF or Distribution
                  under this Article IX, any amounts recovered from insurers or
                  other third parties shall be paid to the Indemnifying Party up
                  to the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party, plus interest on
                  such amount, calculated at the Reference Rate, from the date
                  paid by the Indemnifying Party to the date of payment to the
                  Indemnifying Party, inclusive; provided, however, that under
                  no circumstances shall the Buyer Indemnified Parties be
                  required to pay the Indemnifying Party an amount which exceeds
                  the amount recovered from the insurer or third party, as the
                  case may be. At the time of receiving an indemnification
                  payment from USF or Distribution, Buyer shall assign to USF
                  its right to any available remedy against insurers under any
                  Policies or against third parties in each case, with respect
                  to the claim for which an indemnification payment has been
                  made and up to the amount of such indemnification payment.

                  (d) WAIVER OF CONDITIONS. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, to the extent that Distribution or Buyer waives in
writing satisfaction of one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1
or Section 8.2, which conditions were not satisfied due to the occurrence of one
or more events, conditions or circumstances that was specifically disclosed in
writing (including by inclusion on a Schedule hereto) to Distribution or Buyer,
respectively, prior to the Closing, the disclosing Party shall not be liable for
any losses resulting from such matter or matters to the extent so disclosed.

                  (e) INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER. Notwithstanding any term in this
Agreement to the contrary, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, Buyer hereby
agrees, from and after the

                                       52
<PAGE>
Closing, to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties against
any Losses incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties to the extent that such
Losses arise out of or are based upon the ownership of the Purchased Assets and
operation of the Business from and after the Closing Date where the events
giving rise to the Losses first arise or occur on or after the Closing Date.
This indemnification shall be in addition to the indemnification provisions
provided in Section 9.2(b) and shall not be subject to the thresholds,
deductibles and other limitations set forth in Section 9.2(c).

         9.3 PROCEDURES.

                  (a) NOTICE OF CLAIM. Promptly after receipt by a Buyer
Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party (AN "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") under
SECTION 9.2 of Notice of a Recoverable Loss or the commencement of any
Proceeding with respect to which it believes it is entitled to be indemnified
under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall, if a claim in respect thereto
is to be made against USF or Distribution, on the one hand, or Buyer on the
other hand (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") under this Article, notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of the commencement thereof; provided however,
that the omission to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability that the Indemnifying Party may have to
the Indemnified Party to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is not
prejudiced by such omission.

                  (b) SETTLEMENT: COMPROMISE. An Indemnifying Party will not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), settle or compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened Proceeding
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release
of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Proceeding. An
Indemnified Party will not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect to any pending or threatened Proceeding.

                  (c) PROCEDURE. If a Proceeding shall be brought against an
Indemnified Party and it shall notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in
accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 9.3, the Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled to assume the legal defense thereof. The Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in
the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall
have been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or
(iii) the named parties to any such Proceeding (including any impleaded parties)
include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and the
Indemnified Party shall have been advised by such counsel that there is a
conflict for counsel in representing both the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party. In any such case, the Indemnifying Party shall not, in
connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related
actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or
circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate
firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for the Indemnified Party.
Except as aforesaid,

                                       53
<PAGE>
after notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume the defense of such claim or such action, the Indemnifying
Patty shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Section for any
attorneys' fees or other expenses (except reasonable costs of investigation)
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof. To the extent of any inconsistency between the provisions of this
Section 9.3(c) and Section 7.2(b), the provisions of Section 7.2(b) shall
control with respect to matters covered by Section 7.2(b).

                  (d) RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES. In the case of an alleged
Recoverable Loss which is disputed by the Indemnifying Party, the Parties shall
attempt in good faith to resolve their differences for a period of 60 days and,
if the Parties are unable to resolve their differences within such period, the
Indemnified Party may submit the matter to judicial proceedings (unless an
alternate dispute resolution procedure is specified in this Agreement with
respect to such dispute).

         9.4 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. Except to the extent any damages are
actually paid to a third party, no Party shall be liable to any other Party for
claims for punitive, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including
damages for loss of profits, loss of use or revenue, or losses by reason of cost
of capital, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, regardless of whether a claim is based on contract, tort
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), strict liability, violation of any applicable deceptive
trade practices act or similar Law or any other legal or equitable principle,
and each Party releases the other Parties from liability for any such damages;
provided, however, that the foregoing provisions shall not prevent Buyer from
seeking damages based upon a multiple of EBITDA of Distribution in the event of
a breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.5. No
Party shall be entitled to rescission of this Agreement as a result of breach of
any other Party's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements, or for
any other matter set forth herein.

         9.5 SOLE REMEDY. Except as provided in Section 7.1(c), from and after
the Closing the provisions of this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of each Party for claims for monetary damages arising from or related to
(i) any breach of a Party's representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement, (ii) any breach of a Party's covenants or other agreements contained
in this Agreement, or (iii) any other matters relating to this Agreement other
than claims for fraud. The Buyer Indemnified Parties and Seller Indemnified
Parties are the only Persons entitled to exercise any remedy provided by this
Article IX.

                                    ARTICLE X
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         10.1 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Distribution shall, at any time and from time
to time on and after the Closing Date, upon request by Buyer and without further
consideration, take or cause to be taken such actions and execute, acknowledge
and deliver, or cause to be executed, acknowledged and delivered, such
instruments, documents, transfers and conveyances as may be required for the
conveying, transferring, assigning and delivering of the Purchased Assets to
Buyer. Effective as of the Closing, Distribution and USF hereby constitute and
appoint the

                                       54
<PAGE>
Buyer and its successors and assigns the true and lawful attorney of
Distribution with full power of substitution, in the name of the Buyer or the
name of Distribution and/or USF, on behalf of and for the benefit of the Buyer
solely (a) to collect all Purchased Assets, (b) to endorse, without recourse,
checks, notes and other instruments in connection with the Business and
attributable to the Purchased Assets and (c) to do all such reasonable acts and
things with respect to the Purchased Assets as the Buyer may deem advisable,
subject to the consent of Distribution, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Distribution and USF agree that the foregoing powers are coupled with
an interest and shall be irrevocable by Distribution and USF directly or
indirectly by the dissolution of Distribution or USF or in any other manner. The
Buyer shall retain for its own account any amounts collected pursuant to the
foregoing powers and Distribution and USF shall promptly pay to the Buyer any
amounts received by Distribution and USF after the Closing with respect to the
Purchased Assets. Buyer shall hold USF and Distribution harmless from and
against any Losses resulting from Buyer's exercise of the power granted in this
Section. For the avoidance of doubt, USF and Distribution shall not be deemed to
have a Loss solely as a result of Buyer's collection or endorsement of any
Purchased Asset or for actions taken by Buyer in connection with the Purchased
Assets to the extent consented to by Distribution.

         10.2 NOTICES. All notices and other communications given or made
pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
duly given or made (i) the second Business Day after the date of mailing, if
delivered by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid; (ii) upon delivery,
if sent by hand delivery; (iii) upon delivery, if sent by prepaid courier, with
a record of receipt; or (iv) the next day after the date of dispatch, if sent by

courier), to the Patties at the following addresses:

conformity with the foregoing.

         10.3 ASSIGNMENT: GOVERNMENT LAW.

                  (a) ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement and all the rights and powers
granted hereby shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective permitted successors and assigns. This Agreement and the rights,
interests and obligations hereunder may not be assigned by a Party without the
written consent of the other Parties; provided, however, that Buyer may, without
the prior written consent of Distribution and USF, assign any of its rights and
interests to (i) any lender OR financial institution providing financing for the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) any third-party who subsequently
purchases substantially all of the then existing assets of the Business in a
single transaction (or series of related transactions); provided, however, that
Buyer must promptly notify Distribution of such assignment; and provided,
further, no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder. A
merger or sale of stock of Buyer shall not be deemed to be an assignment by
operation of law. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 10.3(a)
shall be null and void.

                                       56
<PAGE>
                  (b) GOVERNING  LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to
its conflict of laws doctrines.

                  (c) CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably acknowledges and consents that any legal action or
proceeding brought with respect to any of the obligations arising under or
relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the courts of the State
of Delaware, or if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, as the Party bringing such action
or proceeding may elect, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits to
and accepts with regard to any such action or proceeding, for itself and in
respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts. Each Party hereby further irrevocably waives any claim that
any such courts lack jurisdiction over such Party, and agrees not to plead or
claim, in any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby brought in any of the aforesaid courts, that
any such court lacks jurisdiction over such Party. Each Party irrevocably
consents to the service of process in any such action or proceeding by the
mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to
such Party, at its address for notices set forth in Section 10.2 of this
Agreement, such service to become effective ten (10) days after such mailing.
Each Party hereby irrevocably waives any objection to such service of process
and further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any action or
proceeding commenced hereunder or under any other documents contemplated hereby
that service of process was in any way invalid or ineffective. Subject to
Section 10.3(d) of this Agreement, the foregoing shall not limit the rights of a
Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. The foregoing
consents to jurisdiction shall not constitute general consents to service of
process for any purpose except as provided above and shall not be deemed to
confer rights on any Person other than the Parties to this Agreement.

                  (d) WAIVERS. Each of the Parties hereby waives any right it
may have under the laws of any jurisdiction to commence by publication any legal
action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives the
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any
of the courts referred to in Section 10.3(c) of this Agreement and hereby
further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim that any such court
is not a convenient forum for any such suit, action or proceeding.

                  (e) ENFORCEMENT. The Parties agree that any judgment obtained
by a Party or its permitted successors or assigns in any action, suit or
proceeding referred to above may, in the discretion of such Party (or its
permitted successors or assigns), be enforced in any jurisdiction, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law.

                  (f) DEEMED ACCEPTANCE. Each Related Party of Buyer or
Distribution, as the case may be, seeking the benefit of Article IX of this
Agreement shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the provisions of this
Section 10.3 as a condition to obtaining any benefits under Article IX as if
such Person was one of the Parties named herein.

                                       57
<PAGE>
         10.4 AMENDMENT AND WAIVER. To be effective, any amendment or waiver
under this Agreement must be in writing and be signed by the Party against whom
enforcement of the same is sought. Neither the failure of a Party to exercise
any right, power or remedy provided under this Agreement or to insist upon
compliance by the other Parties with its obligations hereunder, nor any custom
or practice of the Parties at variance with the terms hereof shall constitute a
waiver by such Party of its right to exercise any such right, power or remedy or
to demand such compliance.

         10.5 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement,
the confidentiality agreement entered into by the Parties in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Related Agreements and the Schedules and
Exhibits set forth all of the promises, covenants, agreements, conditions and
undertakings between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and
supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements and understandings,
negotiations, inducements or conditions, express or implied, oral or written.
This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties
any rights or remedies hereunder, except the provisions of ARTICLE IX to the
extent they relate to Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties
and except as provided in Section 10.3.

         10.6 NATURE OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Buyer acknowledges
that (i) neither Distribution, USF nor any of their Affiliates has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, beyond those expressly given in
this Agreement, including as to the accuracy or completeness of any memoranda,
charts, summaries or schedules relating to Distribution or the Business and
previously made available to Buyer or any of its Affiliates by Distribution, USF
or any of their Affiliates or any other information (including the Confidential
Memorandum prepared by Goldman, Sachs & Co. with respect to Distribution) which
is not included in this Agreement or the Schedules hereto and (ii) neither
Distribution, USF nor any of their Affiliates will have or be subject to any
Liability to Buyer or any of its Affiliates resulting from the distribution of
any such information to, or use of any such information by, Buyer or any of its
Affiliates.

         10.7 SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced under any rule of Law in any particular respect or under any
particular circumstances, such term or provision shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect in all other respects and under all other circumstances,
and all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to a Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent
possible.

         10.8 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be deemed one and the same instrument.

         10.9 PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT ARBITRATION. If(i) an Objection is not
Resolved as set forth in Section 2.9(b) or (ii) if the Parties dispute the
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement as it Relates to the
determination of the Closing Date Working Capital pursuant to the terms of
Section 2.9, and a Party applies for arbitration pursuant to this Section 10.9,
the Objection or disagreement will be resolved, or the disputed provision will
be interpreted, by binding arbitration; provided, that the foregoing shall not
preclude equitable or other judicial relief to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement or to preserve the status quo pending resolution of such Objection,
disagreement or disputed provision. Subject to the provisions of this Section,
Distribution and Buyer will agree upon the rules of the arbitration prior to the
arbitration and based upon the nature of the Objection or the dispute. To the
extent that the Parties cannot agree on the rules of the arbitration, then the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA in effect on the date hereof as modified
by this Agreement, will apply. As a minimum set of rules in the arbitration, the
Parties agree as follows:

                  (a) The arbitration will be held before a single arbitrator
appointed jointly by the Parties or, failing agreement on the arbitrator within
ten (10) days after delivery of a notice of intention to arbitrate, by the AAA
in Chicago, Illinois. The arbitration will be held in Chicago, Illinois.

                  (b) The Party initiating arbitration will deliver to the other
Party notice of its intention to arbitrate. The notice will contain a statement
setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of the Objection or the provision
of the Agreement in dispute, the amount involved, if any, and the remedy sought.
The other Parties will file an answering statement within ten (10) days of the
notice which will contain a statement setting forth in reasonable detail each
other Party's responses to the Objection or the provision of the Agreement in
dispute. If no answer is given by the other Parties within the stated time, the
Objection or disagreement will be assumed to be denied. Failure by the other
Parties to provide an answer will not operate to delay the arbitration.

                  (c) Unless the Parties to the arbitration agree otherwise, no
discovery will take place except as provided in this subsection. Not less than
forty-five (45) days before the date of the hearing, each Party shall provide to
the other Parties, copies of all exhibits, affidavits and other evidence it
intends to submit at the hearing, along with the identification of any witnesses
to be called and a summary of anticipated testimony. Based on a review of the
information provided, and not less than thirty (30) days before the date of the
hearing, each Party will provide to the other Party, copies of any additional
exhibits, affidavits and other evidence it intends to submit at the hearing,
along with the identification of any additional witnesses to be called and a
summary of anticipated testimony. The arbitrator will be authorized to resolve
any disputes concerning the exchange of information.

                  (d) The arbitration hearing will take place over no more than
five (5) Business Days, beginning not more than ninety (90) days after the date
of the notice of arbitration.

                  (e) The arbitrator will deliver his or her decision in writing
within ten (10) Business Days after the completion of the arbitration hearing.

                                       59
<PAGE>
                  (f) The arbitrator will specify the basis for his or her
decision, the resolution of the Objection or dispute and a breakdown of any
amounts awarded, if any, and the basis of any other remedy. The arbitrator's
decision will be considered a final and binding resolution of the Objection or
dispute, will not be subject to appeal and may be entered as an order in any
court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. Each Party agrees to
submit to the jurisdiction of any such court for purposes of the enforcement of
any such order. With respect to matters subject to arbitration pursuant to this
Section 10.9, no Party will sue the other Parties except for enforcement of the
arbitrator's decision if the other Parties are not performing in accordance with
the arbitrator's decision. The provisions of this Agreement will be binding on
the arbitrator.

                  (g) Any arbitration proceeding hereunder will be conducted on
a confidential basis. The arbitrator's discretion to fashion remedies hereunder
will be no broader than the legal and equitable remedies available to a court.
The costs and fees of the arbitration, but not the preparation and attorneys'
fees of the other Parties, shall be borne by the non-prevailing Party, provided
that Buyer and Distribution shall each pay one half of any fees and expenses
required by the AAA in advance of the rendering of an award, and if one Party
fails to pay its share of such fees and expenses, the other Party may pay the
same and shall be entitled to have such amount entered with interest as part of
the award in the event the paying Party is the prevailing Party.

         The Closing Date Balance Sheet will be prepared in conformity with the
terms of this Schedule 1.1A.

         1. The Closing Date Balance Sheet will be prepared in accordance with
GAAP, applied on a consistent basis and using the same accounting policies,
principles, methodologies and practices as were used in preparing the Financial
Statements (except that the Closing Date Balance Sheet will not include certain
footnotes required to comply with the requirements of GAAP), including:
calculation of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, dead stock and
estimates of inventory shrinkage; calculation of allowance for doubtful
accounts; estimates of useful lives and residual values; accruals for vacation,
management and employee bonus awards, and insurance deductibles (including
workers' compensation); all other management estimates and assumptions relating
to the reporting of assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet; and recognition
of revenue and expense items.

         2. All account balances related to intercompany payables or
receivables (amounts owed by or to Distribution to or from USF and its
Subsidiaries), however denominated, will be eliminated by adjustments to
stockholders' equity of Distribution, except for amounts owed by or to USF and
its Subsidiaries in respect of the sale and purchase of goods and/or services in
the ordinary course of business.

         3. Liabilities related to Retained Taxes will be excluded from the
Closing Date Balance Sheet.

         4. The Closing Date Balance Sheet will not reflect any pushdown of
goodwill resulting from the acquisition of United States Filter Corporation by
Vivendi, S.A.

         5. The Closing Date Balance Sheet will not include any assessment of
 non-current asset impairment not already considered and recorded in the Balance
 Sheet.

         6. The Closing Date Balance Sheet will not include any increases in
 the carrying value of assets from the Balance Sheet Date other than those
 arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business.

         7. All asset sales and transfers referred to in Schedule 3.6 and
Schedule 5.5 will be effected through an adjustment to stockholders' equity.

         8. The Closing Date Balance Sheet will reflect only those transactions
and developments which took place since the Balance Sheet Date.

                                   LITIGATION

1.  S.D. Hentges & Sons. Inc. v. U.S. Filter Distribution Group, Inc., filed
    08/20/01
Claimant:             S.D. Hentges & Sons, Inc.
Amount in dispute:    $754,054
Summary:              Contract case arising out of allegedly defective pipe used
                      by Plaintiff in construction. Diamond Plastics
                      manufactured the pipe and Distribution distributed the
                      pipe to plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges breach of contract
                      and breach of express and implied warranties by
                      Distribution. Distribution has filed an answer. A
                      counterclaim and third party complaint against Diamond
                      Plastics have also been filed by Distribution. Diamond
                      Plastics filed its answer and a Motion for Summary
                      Judgment. All motions are pending.

2.  Archer-Western Contractors. Ltd. v. U.S. Filter Distribution Group, Inc.,
    filed 06/20/01
Claimant:             Archer-Western Contractors, Ltd.
Amount in dispute:    $3,000,000
Summary:              Contracts case. Plaintiff filed a Complaint in California
                      state court alleging that Distribution supplied it with
                      defective PVC pipe on the Otay Water District project.
                      Plaintiff was the general contractor on the project, which
                      has experienced leaks in the piping system. Plaintiff
                      alleges that it has thus far spent over $3,000,000 to
                      replace the allegedly defective pipe. Distribution's
                      tender to the pipe manufacturer and third party defendant,
                      J-M Manufacturing, was rejected, although J-M is presently
                      cooperating with the defense and entered a joint defense
                      agreement with Distribution. Distribution and J-M have
                      jointly retained experts. Inspection of damaged pipe is
                      ongoing. Early indications are that the alleged defects
                      were the result of installation errors by Archer-Western.

3.  U.S. Filter Distribution Group, Inc. v. Boulder Excavating, Inc., et al.,
    filed 09/10/01
Claimant:             Distribution
Amount in dispute:    $248,000
Summary:              This action is a collection suit arising out of a
                      contract/credit agreement dated December 9, 1985 relating
                      to the Virgin Valley Water District 24" Water Line
                      Improvement Project wherein Distribution agreed to provide
                      certain materials to defendant Boulder Excavating on
                      credit. On about October 25, 2001, defendants tiled a
                      counterclaim against Distribution alleging that
                      Distribution did not provide materials manufactured by
                      Mueller and Singer as agreed upon in their contract and
                      therefore, Distribution breached the contract allegedly
                      causing more than $400,000 in damages to defendant
                      Boulder. Currently, Distribution is awaiting proposed
                      budget and a status letter from defense counsel. The
                      counterclaim appears to be frivolous. Distribution has
                      served the


                                     Page 29
<PAGE>
                      bonding company. Therefore, defendant's solvency should
                      not be a concern. Plaintiffs counsel has filed a motion to
                      withdraw for non-payment of fees.

4.  Foster Utilities. Inc. v. US. Filter Distribution Grout. Inc., filed
    08/09102
Claimant:             Foster Utilities, Inc.
Amount in dispute:    $652,482
Summary:              Voidable preference claim in Bankruptcy Court. A North
                      Carolina-based customer of Distribution, which is now in
                      Chapter 11 bankruptcy, claims that Distribution received
                      voidable preference payments totaling $652.482.39 within
                      90 days of the filing of the Bankruptcy Petition.
                      Distribution has two promising defenses: (1) a partial
                      "new value" defense totaling at least $400,000. based on
                      new goods and services provided to plaintiff after the
                      alleged preferential payments; and (2) a potential
                      complete defense based on the fact that Distribution
                      reframed from exercising lien or bonding rights in its
                      continuing dealings with plaintiff. Distribution's Answer
                      is due September 23, 2002.

6.  Estate of William D. Parker v. USF Distributing. Harrier Construction.
    Steven Calder. et al.
Claimant:             Estate of William D. Parker
Amount in dispute:    $1,000,000
Summary:              Wrongful death action in U.S. District Court, Fresno, CA
                      alleging Distribution negligently loaded pipe onto a
                      truck. Plaintiff decedent was killed attempting to unload
                      the pipe after transporting it to Utah. Plaintiffs estate
                      seeks recovery in the amount of $1.0 million. Distribution
                      has not yet been served, but has been advised by counsel
                      that service is imminent. Liability is very questionable.
                      Defense counsel plans to tender the defense of this matter
                      to RAM Trucking. General liability insurance is fully
                      defending without reservation, and defense is fully funded
                      by carrier. Distribution has a $250,000 indemnity
                      deductible.

7.  Resources Companies. Distribution received a letter dated April 4, 2002 from
a competing distributor in the Chicago, Illinois area who alleged Distribution
was engaged in anticompetitive activities. Counsel for Distribution reviewed the
allegations and concluded that


                                     Page 30
<PAGE>
there were no violations, and subsequently rejected Resource Companies' claims
by letter dated April 16,2002.

8.  Detroit Water Team. Distribution was notified by letter dated June 20, 2002
of a potential future subrogation claim arising out of the failure of an
underground water pipe manufactured by CLOW Water Systems Co. and supplied by
Distribution to the Detroit Water Team ("DWT"). Detroit Water Team's expert has
conceded that the pipe distributed by Distribution Group was not the cause of
damage. This matter will likely be terminated in the near future as to
Distribution, without any defense counsel costs or liability for Distribution.

                              ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

A.   COMPLIANCE:

         1.   Denver. Colorado. ENSR Phase I site assessment report dated April
              2002 noted the following regulatory issues which have been
              resolved as set forth below:

              a.   Fluorescent bulbs, which contain mercury vapor, were being
                   disposed of in the trash dumpster inconsistent with
                   Colorado's Universal Waste Regulations (1007 CCR Section
                   273.13(e)).  Used bulbs are now being stored and disposed
                   of in compliance with applicable regulations.

              b.   Trucks were being washed with caustic cleaners and the waste
                   water from these cleanings was being allowed to discharge
                   into the city street and enter the storm water collection
                   system, without appropriate safeguards and a Colorado NPDES
                   minimal discharge permit (Regulation 61, Colorado Permit
                   System Regulations). Facility has discontinued the practice,
                   eliminating the need to secure a permit.

         2.   McAllen. Texas. ENSR Phase I site assessment report dated April
              2002 noted the following regulatory issues which have been
              resolved as set forth below:

              a.   Outside sandblasting operations require registration and
                   written site approval pursuant to the Texas Natural Resources
                   Conservation Commission Exemptions from Permitting Chapter
                   106, Subchapter T. The Facility has filed for an exemption
                   with the TNRCC (with no response expected or required back
                   from the TNRCC).

              b.   Written site approval is required for outside painting under
                   the TNRCC Exemptions from Permitting Chapter 06, Subchapter
                   S, Surface Coating. The Facility has filed for an exemption
                   with the TNRCC (with no response expected or required back
                   from the TNRCC).

              c.   A Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit is
                   required for the oil/water separator discharge to the ground.
                   The Facility has rerouted discharge to the City's sewer
                   system and received written notice from the City that no
                   permit to discharge into the City's sewer system is required.

B.   CLAIMS:

         No disclosure made.



C.   PERMITS:

         No disclosure made.

E.   STORAGE TANKS:
         No disclosure made.

F.   LISTED PROPERTIES (ON THE NATIONAL PRIORITIES LIST):
         No disclosure made.

G.   HAZARDOUS MATERIALS:

1. Thomasville, Georgia. A letter loom the Georgia Department of Natural
Resources dated September 5, 2000 was received concluding that no further action
is required for contamination resulting from release from underground storage
tanks, which were removed prior to 1990.

2. Olathe, Kansas. ENSR Phase I Site Assessment Report dated April 2002 noted
the presence of an on-site septic system, in use at the facility since the
construction date of the facility in the early 1980s. Prior to 1998, pipe
fabrication was conducted in the warehouse building; this generated waste
toluene. Two floor drains in the warehouse reportedly discharge into the septic
system, although there is no evidence to indicate that any releases have
actually taken place.

H.   REQUIRED NOTICE OR CONSENT:
         No disclosure made.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


The Stockholder
United States Filter Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of U.S. Filter
Distribution Group, Inc. and subsidiary (the Group), a wholly owned subsidiary
of United States Filter Corporation, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
related consolidated statements of income and net consolidated equity, and cash
flows for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and for the nine month
period ended December 31, 1999. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Group's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of U.S. Filter
Distribution Group, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000 and the nine month period ended December 31, 1999 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                           December 31, 2001 and 2000


(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices

     (a)  Description of Business

          U.S. Filter Distribution Group, Inc. ("USFDG") is a wholly owned
          subsidiary of United States Filter Corporation ("US Filter"). US
          Filter is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vivendi Environment
          ("Vivendi"). USFDG is a wholesale distributor of water and sewer
          construction materials including pipe, valves, fittings, hydrants, and
          water meters. USFDG has 137 locations operating in 35 states.
          Principal customers served are in the contractor and municipal
          markets.

     (b) Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

          The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements
          of USFDG and its wholly owned subsidiary, United States Filter
          Receivables Corporation ("USFRC"), collectively (the "Group"). USFRC
          was incorporated in 2001 in the state of Delaware. All significant
          intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
          consolidation.

          The Group's consolidated financial statements include the assets,
          liabilities, and goodwill resulting from US Filter's acquisition that
          created the Group as well as the Group's subsequent acquisitions. The
          Group's consolidated financial statements do not include any purchase
          accounting adjustments that may have resulted from the 1999
          acquisition of US Filter by Vivendi.

     (c)  Cash Equivalents

          For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Group considers all
          highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
          less to be cash equivalents.

     (d)  Inventories

          Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
          determined using the weighted average method for all inventories.

     (e)  Property and Equipment

          Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on property
          and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the
          estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

                <Table>
                <S>                                        <C>
                Buildings and improvements                   5 to 30 years
                Office furniture, fixtures and equipment       3 to 5 years
                Transportation equipment                      1 to 5 years
                Machinery and equipment                           5 years
                </Table>

Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                           December 31, 2001 and 2000


(f)  Goodwill

     Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of
     net assets acquired, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the
     expected periods to be benefited, generally 40 years. The Group assesses
     the recoverability of this intangible asset by determining whether the
     amortization of the asset balance over its remaining life can be recovered
     through undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired operation.
     The amount of asset impairment, if any, is measured based on projected
     discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the
     Group's average cost of funds. The assessment of the recoverability of the
     assets will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not
     achieved.


(g)  Other Assets

     Other assets consist principally of cash surrender value of life insurance
     contracts, net of policy loans.

(h)  Advertising

     Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs amounted to
     $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December
     31, 2001 and 2000 and for the nine-month period ended December 31, 1999,
     respectively.

(i)  Income Taxes

     Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
     consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
     carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
     tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax
     assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
     apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
     are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
     and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
     period that includes the enactment date. The Group files as part of US
     Filter's consolidated Federal income tax return. US Filter has implemented
     certain tax planning strategies and the related impact is not reflected in
     these separate financial statements of the Group. For the purpose of the
     consolidated financial statements presented herein, the Group provided for
     income taxes as if it were a separate filing taxable entity.

(j)  Use of Estimates

     Management of the Group has made a number of estimates and assumptions
     relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
     contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these consolidated financial
     statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
     the United States of America. Actual results could differ from those
     estimates.

                           December 31, 2001 and 2000


(k)  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF

     The Group accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions
     of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, Accounting
     for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be
     Disposed Of. This Statement requires that long-lived assets and certain
     identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or
     changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
     not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is
     measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net
     cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are
     considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by
     the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair
     value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
     the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

(l)  REVENUE RECOGNITION

     The Group recognizes revenue on sales when products are shipped and the
     customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss.

     Shipping and handling costs incurred are included as a component of cost of
     goods sold.

(m)  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
     No. 141, Business Combinations, ("SFAS No. 141") and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill
     and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS No. 142"). SFAS No. 141 requires that
     the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations.
     SFAS No. 141 specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a
     business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately
     from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 will require that goodwill and intangible
     assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead
     tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions
     of SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with
     estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful
     lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in
     accordance with SFAS No. 121 and subsequently, SFAS No. 144, Accounting for
     the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ("SFAS No. 144") after its
     adoption.

     The Group adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141 as of July 1, 2001, and
     SFAS No. 142 is effective January 1, 2002. Goodwill and intangible assets
     acquired in business combinations completed before July 1, 2001 continued
     to be amortized and tested for impairment prior to the full adoption of
     SFAS No. 142.



                                       7                             (Continued)

                                 AND SUBSIDIARY

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                           December 31, 2001 and 2000


Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Group is required to evaluate its existing
intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in purchase business
combinations, and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform
with the new classification criteria in SFAS No. 141 for recognition separate
from goodwill. The Group will be required to reassess the useful lives and
residual values of all intangible assets acquired, and make any necessary
amortization period adjustments after adoption. If an intangible asset is
identified as having an indefinite useful life, the Group will be required to
test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 142. Impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the
fair value of an intangible asset with an indefinite life. Any impairment loss
will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle.

In connection with SFAS No. 142's transitional goodwill impairment evaluation,
the Statement requires the Group to perform an assessment of whether there is an
indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption. To accomplish
this, the Group must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying
value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including
the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of
January 1, 2002. The Group will then have up to six months from January 1, 2002
to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the
carrying amount of the reporting unit. To the extent the carrying amount of a
reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an indication
exists that the reporting unit goodwill may  be impaired and the Group must
perform the second step of the transitional impairment test. The second step is
required to be completed as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the
year of adoption. In the second step, the Group must compare the implied fair
value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting
unit goodwill, both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption. The
implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the
reporting unit to all of the assets (recognized and unrecognized) and
liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price
allocation, in accordance with SFAS No. 141. The residual fair value after this
allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Any
transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle in the Group's statement of income.

As of the date of adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Group expects to have
unamortized goodwill in the amount of $64.3 million and unamortized identifiable
intangible assets in the amount of $0.6 million, all of which will be subject to
the transition provisions of SFAS No. 142. Amortization expense related to
goodwill was $1.8 million, $1.8 million and $1.4 million for the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, and for the nine months ended December 31, 1999,
respectively. Because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting
SFAS No. 141 and No. 142, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the
impact of adopting the Statements on the Group's consolidated financial
statements at the date of this report, including whether it will be required to
recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle.


                                                                     (Continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                           December 31, 2001 and 2000



          In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 which addresses financial
          accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
          assets. This Statement requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for
          impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
          the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability
          of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the
          carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be
          generated by an asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its
          estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the
          amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair
          value of the asset. SFAS No. 144 requires companies to separately
          report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a
          component of an entity that either has been disposed of (by sale,
          abandonment, or in a distribution to owners) or is classified as held
          for sale. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the
          carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. The Group is
          required to adopt SFAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002.

     (n)  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

          Financial instruments of the Group consist primarily of cash and cash
          equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
          liabilities. The carrying amounts of such instruments are considered
          to be representative of their respective fair values due to the short
          maturity of these instruments.


(2) ALLOCATIONS AND OTHER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     (a)  CASH MANAGEMENT

          The Group participates in US Filter's centralized cash management
          system and, as such, the Group's cash funding requirements including
          interest and tax obligations have been met by US Filter and cash
          received by the Group is transferred to US Filter on a daily basis.


     (b)  ALLOCATIONS


          The consolidated statements of income include all direct costs of the
          Group as well as certain corporate costs directly identified with the
          Group and allocated to the Group by US Filter. Allocated costs include
          general liability insurance, worker's compensation insurance, 401(k)
          plan matching expense, employee health and dental insurance, legal
          fees and other costs. These costs are allocated to the Group based on
          information specifically identified with the activities of the Group
          and are settled through intercompany transactions. In the opinion of
          management, these allocations have been made on a basis which is
          believed to be reasonable for the Group as it operates within the
          structure of a larger parent organization. However, the allocations

(3)  ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

     On April 1, 1999, the Group acquired the assets and liabilities of Utility
     Supply Limited and Utility Supply, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of
     $6.1 million. This amount was paid by US Filter on the Group's behalf.
     These acquisitions were accounted for by the purchase method, and
     accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired
     based upon their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. These
     allocations of purchase price resulted in approximately $5.2 million of
     goodwill, which is being amortized over 40 years. The fair values of the
     assets acquired, including goodwill, and liabilities assumed were
     approximately $10.4 million and $4.4 million, respectively.

     On May 31, 2001, the Group acquired the assets and liabilities of North
     American Pipe Corporation (NAPCO) for an aggregate purchase price of $2.7
     million. This amount was paid by US Filter on the Group's behalf. This
     acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method, and accordingly, the
     purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired based upon their
     estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The allocation of
     purchase price resulted in approximately $0.4 million of goodwill acquired,
     which is being amortized over 40 years. The fair values of the assets
     acquired, including goodwill acquired, and liabilities assumed were
     approximately $2.9 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

     On January 1, 2001, the Group sold a portion of the assets and liabilities
     of its FIFE division for an aggregate sale price of $3.7 million. This
     amount was collected by US Filter on the Group's behalf. The carrying
     values of the assets divested, including goodwill, and liabilities disposed
     were approximately $4.1 million and $.4 million, respectively.

     As these acquisitions are not material to the Group's consolidated
     financial statements, no pro forma results of operations information are
     presented.

(5)  LEASES

     The Group has certain noncancelable operating leases, primarily for
     transportation equipment and office space. These leases generally contain
     automatic renewal options until terminated by either party and require the
     Group to pay all executory costs such as maintenance and insurance. Rental
     expense for operating leases (except those with lease terms of a month or
     less that were not renewed) was $7.4 million, $7.1 million, and $6.4
     million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and for the nine
     month period ended December 31, 1999, respectively.

     Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases (with
     initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year) as of December 31,
     2001 are (in thousands):

      In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management
      considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
      the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of
      deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable
      income during the periods in which those temporary differences become
      deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax
      liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies
      in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable
      income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which
      the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more
      likely than not the Group will realize the benefits of these deductible
      differences. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable,
      however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable
      income during the carryforward period are reduced.

      On April 23, 1999, Vivendi acquired US Filter. On this date, the Group
      recognized approximately $15.2 million in compensation expense associated
      with settlement of outstanding stock options of US Filter held by certain
      employees of the Group.

(9)   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

      The Group is involved in various other claims and legal actions arising in
      the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the
      ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse
      effect on the Group's consolidated financial position, results of
      operations or liquidity.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                           December 31, 2001 and 2000


(10) BUSINESS AND CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

     The Group has a broad customer base, which minimizes the Group's exposure
     to any particular market or customer. The diverse base takes form (1)
     geographically, (2) by customer type, and (3) business source. First,
     operations are geographically resistant to localized economic fluctuations
     since the Group derives less that 18% of its net sales from any one
     particular geographic region. Secondly, accounts are divided between public
     works/residential contractors, industrial contractors, and municipal
     accounts. Each of these sectors is affected by different macroeconomic
     variables, which provides a cushion to adverse conditions in one particular
     market. In 2001, public works/residential contractors accounted for 78% of
     net sales, industrial contractors 4% of net sales, and municipal accounts
     18% of net sales. No single customer account within these categories
     accounted for more than 1.0% of the Group's net sales. Third, net sales is
     almost evenly divided between public works sales (49.7%) and private
     construction sales (50.3%). While housing starts are traditionally
     understood as a highly variable driver of private construction, a slowdown
     in that industry will be buffered by stable municipal/public reconstruction
     and repairs and may also be mitigated by favorable financing terms that
     typically accompany an economic slowdown.

(11) ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION

     Based upon a securitization agreement entered into on December 19, 2001,
     U.S. Filter Distribution Group, Inc. can sell its eligible trade
     receivables on an ongoing basis to a qualified special purpose entity
     (QSPE). Pursuant to an agreement with a securitization company
     (Securitization Facility), QSPE, in turn, can sell such receivables to the
     securitization company on an ongoing basis, which could yield proceeds of
     up to $170 million subject to meeting certain availability requirements
     under a borrowing base formula and other limitations. The Securitization
     Facility expires on December 19, 2004 unless terminated earlier as provided
     in the securitization agreement.

     Under the Securitization Facility, the receivables are sold at a discount
     with a portion of the receivables retained and pledged to the QSPE. As of
     December 31, 2001, approximately $140 million was outstanding under the
     Securitization Facility, the proceeds of which were received by US Filter.
     Accordingly, this amount has been reduced from trade accounts receivable
     and reflected within net activity with US Filter on the accompanying
     consolidated statements of income and net consolidated equity. Included in
     accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at
     December 31, 2001 is $15.8 million of retained interest in receivables sold
     to the QSPE. The loss on sale incurred in connection with the
     Securitization Facility for the year ended December 31, 2001 was
     approximately $0.5 million included in selling, general, and administrative
     expenses.

(12) SUBSEQUENT EVENT

     On March 29, 2002, the Group acquired substantially all of the assets and
     certain liabilities of Utility Piping Systems, Inc. for an aggregate
     purchase price of $18.1 million, subject to post-closing purchase price
     adjustments as stated in the Asset Purchase Agreement. This amount was paid
     by US Filter on the Group's behalf.

RE: Waterpro Supplies Corp
    ACCOUNT NO. 8398150-0108
    CONTROL GROUP NO. 8152004

Dear Mr. Walker:

In response to your request for information, I have enclosed an Estimated
Withdrawal Liability Worksheet and Computer Report for the above referenced
Employer. The calculation yields a liability of $28,224.15 based upon a 2002
withdrawal date.

For purposes of withdrawal liability, ERISA Section 4001(b) defines the term
employer to include all trades or business, whether or not incorporated, which
are under common control within the meaning of the applicable sections of the
Internal Revenue Code.

The enclosed estimate is based upon contribution amounts listed in the
enclosed Computer Report. It may not include all contribution accounts of any
controlled group of trades or businesses of which Waterpro Supplies Corp, is a
member. If Waterpro Supplies Corp is a member of a controlled group employer
which includes other entities that have made contributions to the Fund, the
enclosed estimate may grossly understate the Employer's potential withdrawal
liability. If there are additional contribution amounts which should be
included or if there are any other omissions or errors, please let us know in
writing and we will gladly correct our records and provide you with a revised
estimate.
