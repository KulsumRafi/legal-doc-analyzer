INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT
Board of Directors and Stockholder
Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp.

We have examined management's assertion, included in the
accompanying Management's Assertion Concerning Compliance with
Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp.'s Minimum Servicing
Standards, that Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp.
(WMMSC) complied with the minimum servicing standards in its role
as Master Servicer as of and for the year ended December 31,
2002. Such assertions were examined relating to those series of
certificates included in the attached Exhibit 1.  Management is
responsible for WMMSC's compliance with those minimum servicing
standards. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assertion about WMMSC's compliance based on our
examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation
standards established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants and, accordingly, included examining, on a
test basis, evidence about WMMSC's compliance with its minimum
servicing standards and performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  Series of
certificates subject to such procedures were selected using
sampling methods, and accordingly, we make no representations that
our examination procedures were performed on a specific series of
certificates as listed in the attached Exhibit I. We believe that
our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on WMMSC's
compliance with its minimum servicing standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that WMMSC complied with
the aforementioned minimum servicing standards as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2002, is fairly stated, in all material
respects.
