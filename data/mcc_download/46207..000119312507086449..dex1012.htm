purposes of this Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. 1990 Nonemployee Director Stock Plan are to provide participating directors with additional incentives to improve the Company&#146;s performance by increasing the level of stock owned by such

as compensation to Nonemployee Directors. As amended and restated herein, this Plan incorporates all amendments effective on or before May&nbsp;1, 2002, including provisions formerly memorialized in the Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. 1999
