                            STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT


     STOCK  PURCHASE  AGREEMENT,  dated March 7, 2003,  by and  between  HEADWAY
CORPORATE RESOURCES,  INC., a Delaware  corporation (the "Seller");  and WHITNEY
GROUP, LLC, a New York limited liability company (the "Purchaser").

                             W I T N E S S E T H:
                             - - - - - - - - - -

     WHEREAS,  the Seller owns (1) 12,000 ordinary shares (the "Tyzack  Shares")
of Tyzack Holdings  Limited,  a corporation  organized under the laws of England
and Wales  ("Tyzack");  (2) 10,000 common  shares (the "Whitney  Shares") of The
Whitney Group (Asia)  Limited (HK), a  corporation  organized  under the laws of
Hong Kong  ("Whitney  Asia");  (3) all of  membership  interests  (the  "Whitney
Interests")  of  Whitney  Partners  LLC, a Delaware  limited  liability  company
("Whitney LLC"); and (4) 2,500 shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share
(or such membership interests into which such shares are exchanged, the "Carlyle
Shares" and  collectively  with the Tyzack Shares,  the Whitney Shares,  and the
Whitney Interests,  the "Shares") of Carlyle Group Ltd., an Illinois corporation
(or such corporation's  successor,  "Carlyle" and together with Tyzack,  Whitney
Asia, and Whitney LLC, the "Companies" and each a "Company");

     WHEREAS,  the Companies  are engaged in the executive  search and placement
business throughout the United States, Europe and Asia (the "Business");

     WHEREAS,  the Shares  constitute all the issued and  outstanding  shares of
capital  stock (or  membership  interests,  in the case of  Whitney  LLC) of the
Companies; and

     WHEREAS,  the Purchaser wishes to purchase from Seller and Seller wishes to
sell to Purchaser all of the Shares;

     NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

                                   Article I
                         PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES

     Section 1.1.Transfer of Shares on the Closing Date. On the Closing Date (as
defined in Article  II),  the Seller shall sell,  convey,  assign,  transfer and
deliver the Shares to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase the Shares
from the  Seller,  free and  clear of all  claims,  liens,  security  interests,
charges,  or  encumbrances  (collectively,  "Liens")  created by or through  the
Seller,  except (i) the Lien in favor of the Seller (or any permitted assignees)
in accordance  with Section 1.4 and (ii) any  restrictions  on transfer  imposed
under  federal or applicable  state  securities  laws. On the Closing Date,  the
Seller shall (1) endorse the certificates  evidencing all Shares  represented by
certificates in the name of the Purchaser,  (2) affix any necessary  documentary
or stock  transfer  stamps  to such  certificates,  (3)  execute  any  documents
reasonably  necessary  to effect the  transfer  of any Shares not  evidenced  by
certificates  and (4) deliver such  certificates  and transfer  documents to the
Purchaser  to  consummate  the  purchase and sale  contemplated  hereby.  On the

                                       1

<PAGE>

Closing  Date,  the  Purchaser  shall  deliver  such  certificates  and transfer
documents  to  Salans in  accordance  with an  Escrow  Agreement  in the form of
Exhibit A hereto  (the  "Escrow  Agreement"),  to be held by  Salans,  as escrow
agent, on behalf of the Seller and the Purchaser as contemplated by Section 1.4.

     Section 1.2.Purchase Price. As full consideration for the sale, conveyance,
transfer, assignment and delivery to the Purchaser of the Shares:

     (a) The Purchaser shall on the Closing Date deliver to the Seller a Secured
Promissory  Note in the form of  Exhibit  B hereto  (the  "Note"),  whereby  the
Purchaser  shall  agree to pay to the  Seller  the  amount  of  $2,000,000  plus
interest as specified  therein  which shall begin  accruing as of the  Effective
Date (as defined in Section 1.2(b)).

     (b) The Purchaser shall pay the Seller an amount (the  "Earnout")  equal to
five percent (5%) of the  Companies'  Gross  Revenues (as defined  below) of the
Business and such other  businesses as are  hereafter  acquired by the Purchaser
(collectively, the "Earnout Business") during the period beginning on January 1,
2003 (the "Effective Date") and ending on the fifth anniversary of the Effective
Date (the  "Earnout  Period").  With  respect  to payment  of the  Earnout,  the
following provisions shall apply:

          (i) "Gross  Revenues"  of the  Companies  shall mean the  consolidated
     gross revenues of the Earnout  Business and shall be computed in accordance
     with United States generally  accepted  accounting  principles applied in a
     manner  consistent  with  the  Seller's  preparation  of  its  consolidated
     financial  statements  as of the Effective  Date less selling  concessions,
     rebates,  and credits, if not already excluded (each in a manner consistent
     with Seller's past practice with respect to the Business). If the Purchaser
     or any of the Companies is acquired by another  business entity (whether by
     merger, sale of assets, sale of equity interests or otherwise), then "Gross
     Revenues" shall continue to refer only to the gross revenues resulting from
     the Earnout  Business  as  conducted  by the  Purchaser  and the  Companies
     immediately prior to such acquisition.

          (ii) Such payments shall be made in U.S. dollars on a quarterly basis,
     within five business days after final determination (pursuant to paragraphs
     (iii) and (iv) below) of the Statement relating to such quarter.

          (iii) Within 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter ending after
     the Effective  Date,  Purchaser  shall  deliver to Seller a statement  (the
     "Statement"),  certified by the chief  executive  officer and the principal
     financial  officer of Purchaser,  setting  forth the Gross  Revenues of the
     Companies in reasonable  detail (but without  specifically  identifying the
     Companies'  clients)  during such quarter (or, in the case of the Statement
     for the first fiscal  quarter  ending after the Effective  Date,  the Gross
     Revenues of the Companies  from the Effective  Date through the end of such
     quarter) and, in addition to each quarterly Statement, within 60 days after
     the end of each fiscal  year ending  after the  Effective  Date,  Purchaser
     shall deliver to Seller a report (the  "Report")  certified by  Purchaser's
     independent  auditors,  whereby  such  auditors  (1) confirm that the Gross
     Revenues set forth in the  Statements  for such fiscal year were  correctly
     computed  in  accordance  with this  Agreement  or (2) set forth  their own
     calculations of Gross  Revenues.  The Seller shall have a period of 20 days
     to review the Statement or the Report (as  applicable) and to either accept
     the  contents of the  Statement or Report (as  applicable)  or to deliver a

                                       2

<PAGE>

     notice of objection to the Purchaser, which notice shall state the Seller's
     objections  in reasonable  detail.  A failure to deliver any such notice of
     objection by the Seller  within such 20-day period shall be deemed to be an
     acceptance of the Statement or Report,  as applicable;  provided,  however,
     any such deemed  acceptance  shall not limit Seller's  ability to deliver a
     notice of  objection  to a  Statement  if the Report for the fiscal year in
     which such Statement was given  contradicts  such Statement (such notice of
     objection shall be delivered by Seller within the applicable  20-day period
     for Seller to deliver a notice of objection to such Report).  If the Seller
     delivers a notice of objection  within the applicable  20-day period,  then
     for a period of 30 days thereafter,  the Purchaser and the Seller shall use
     good faith  efforts to resolve the  objections  set forth  therein.  To the
     extent that such  objections are so resolved,  the Statement or the Report,
     as the case may be, will be accordingly  confirmed or modified, as the case
     may be; any such modifications  shall,  absent manifest error, be final and
     binding on the parties hereto.

          (iv) Any  objections  that are not so resolved shall be submitted to a
     mutually  acceptable   independent   accounting  firm  (an  "Arbiter")  for
     resolution. The Arbiter shall be instructed to deliver to the Purchaser and
     the Seller, as promptly as is reasonably practicable,  but in no event more
     than thirty (30) days after its retention, a written notification as to its
     resolution  of such  objections,  and if  required  by such  resolution,  a
     revised Statement that reflects such resolution.  In resolving any disputed
     item,  the  Arbiter  may not assign a value to such item  greater  than the
     greatest  value for such  item  claimed  by  either  party or less then the
     lowest value for such item claimed by either  party.  Each of the Purchaser
     and the Seller shall cooperate with the Arbiter in making its determination
     and such  determination  shall be  conclusive  and  binding on the  parties
     absent manifest error.  The fees and expenses of the Arbiter shall be borne
     equally by the Purchaser and the Seller.

          (v) After the Closing Date and until the earlier of (x) the date as of
     which all payment  obligations  under Section 1.2 are indefeasibly  paid in
     full  (whether  upon  expiration  of the  Earnout  Period or by  prepayment
     thereof pursuant to Section 1.3) and all payment obligations under the Note
     are indefeasibly paid in full by the Purchaser or (y) the fifth anniversary
     of the  Closing  Date (such time  period  ending on the earlier to occur of
     clause (x) or clause (y) is hereinafter referred to as the "Term"), and for
     three years  thereafter (or for such longer period as ----- may be required
     by law),  the  Purchaser  shall  maintain  complete  and correct  financial
     records, books, and other information, including other information required
     by law to be maintained by Purchaser (collectively "Records") in connection
     with the operations of the -------  Earnout  Business  sufficient to enable
     Seller to verify the  Purchaser's  compliance  with this Section 1.2 and to
     enable Seller to review the  Purchaser's  calculation  of the Earnout.  The
     Seller  (and  its  representatives)  shall  have  the  right  to make  such
     inspections and reviews of the Records as may be reasonably  necessary from
     time to time to verify Purchaser's  Earnout  calculations and the Statement
     and  the  Seller  (and  its  representatives)   shall  have  the  right  to
     communicate  directly  with the  independent  auditors of the Purchaser and
     each of the Companies.  Such review and inspection  shall take place at the
     Purchaser's  principal  executive  offices  located  in New  York  City (or

                                       3

<PAGE>

     wherever located if Purchaser's  principal  executive offices are hereafter
     moved)  during normal  business  hours upon at least five (5) business days
     advance  written notice to the Purchaser.  The Seller may cause the Records
     to be audited at the Seller's expense upon reasonable written notice to the
     Purchaser.  Unless there is a Default (as defined in Section  1.4(b)) or at
     any time after a five percent (5%)  discrepancy is found,  such audit right
     of Seller  shall not be  exercised by Seller more than once in any 12-month
     period.

          (vi) Subject to the  provisions  of Section 8.7, the  Purchaser  shall
     have the right to offset  against any Earnout  payments to which  Seller is
     entitled  any Losses (as  defined in Section  8.3) for which  Purchaser  is
     entitled to indemnification from the Seller.

     (c) The  Purchaser  shall on the  Closing  Date issue to the Seller  common
membership  interests  of the  Purchaser  equal to 15% of the  Applicable  Share
Amount (as defined  below).  For purposes of this Section 1.2(c) the "Applicable
Share Amount" means (i) all of the  Purchaser's  outstanding  common  membership
interests  under the  Purchaser's  Operating  Agreement on the Closing Date less
(ii) the common  membership  interests of the Purchaser  issued to Richard Stein
less (iii) the common  membership  interests of the Purchaser held by Max DeZara
(the "DeZara Shares"), but only in the event that the DeZara Shares are returned
to the Purchaser (pursuant to Mr. DeZara's employment  agreement amendment) as a
result of the Purchaser's failure to enter into the Caryle Disposition Agreement
(as  defined in  paragraph  4 of Exhibit J) (it being  understood  that upon the
occurrence of such event, the Seller agrees that the number of common membership
interests of the Purchaser issued to it pursuant to this Section 1.2(c) shall be
reduced accordingly without further action or consent by the parties hereto).

     Section 1.3 Prepayment.

     (a) On or at any time prior to the third anniversary of the Effective Date,
the Purchaser may, in lieu of then remaining  Earnout  payment  obligations  and
payment  obligations  under the Note,  pay to the  Seller an amount in cash (the
"Payoff  Amount") equal to (a) the sum of (i) $5,000,000 plus (ii) the amount of
any then  accrued and unpaid  interest on the Note  through such date of payment
less (b) the sum of all amounts actually paid to the Seller through such date of
payment  in  respect  of  the  Earnout  and  principal   under  the  Note.  Upon
indefeasible  receipt of the Payoff Amount, the Seller shall (i) cause Salans to
deliver to the  Purchaser the  certificates  and transfer  documents  held by it
pursuant to the last sentence of Section 1.1, and (ii) promptly  return the Note
to the Purchaser for cancellation.  Thereafter,  the Purchaser shall be under no
further  obligation  to  continue  paying the  Earnout and shall have no further
obligations under the Note and the Term shall expire.

     (b) If on or at any time prior to the third  anniversary  of the  Effective
Date a Sales Transaction (as defined below) shall occur, the Purchaser shall pay
the Payoff  Amount to the Seller.  For purposes of this Section  1.3(b) a "Sales
Transaction"   shall  mean  any  of  the   following,   (i)  Gary  S.  Goldstein
("Goldstein") (and/or his "Permitted  Transferees" as defined on the date hereof
in the  Purchaser's  Operating  Agreement a copy of which is attached  hereto as
Exhibit L) shall fail to own (both  beneficially  and of record) and control 25%
of the membership  interests of Purchaser with voting rights to elect members to
the Purchaser's  Board of Managers,  or other voting interests of the Purchaser,
as such  percentage  may be diluted  for  issuances  of  "Incentive  Shares" (as
defined in Purchaser's  Operating  Agreement)  under the  Purchaser's  Operating

                                       4

<PAGE>

Agreement,  issuances of  membership  interests  in  connection  with  permitted
acquisitions  by the  Purchaser  and  issuances  to third  parties in  permitted
capital raising transactions,  (ii) the Purchaser sells all or substantially all
of its  assets  in one  transaction  or a series of  transactions,  or (iii) the
Purchaser enters into a merger,  consolidation or other combination in which the
majority of the voting  interests of the  surviving  entity are not owned by the
owners of a  majority  of the  voting  interests  of the  Purchaser  immediately
preceding such merger, consolidation or other combination.

     (c) If the Purchaser desires to enter into a transaction or take any action
that would otherwise  result in a Default,  so long as the payment of the Payoff
Amount  occurs  contemporaneously  with the closing of such  transaction  or the
taking of such action, no Default shall be deemed to have occurred.

     Section 1.4 Grant of Security Interest; Default.

     (a) To secure the full and punctual  performance of the  obligations of the
Purchaser and the  Companies  under the Note and with respect to the Earnout and
the Third Avenue Lease  Obligations  (as defined in Section 4.4)  (collectively,
the  "Purchaser  Obligations"),  the  Purchaser  hereby  grants to the  Seller a
continuing  security  interest  in all of the  Shares  and all other  assets and
property of the  Purchaser,  whether real or personal or tangible or intangible,
including,  without  limitation,  all  accounts,  goods,  fixtures,   inventory,
equipment,  chattel paper, documents,  instruments,  and general intangibles (as
such terms are defined in the New York  Uniform  Commercial  Code),  whether now
owned or hereafter  acquired,  and all  proceeds  therefrom  (collectively,  the
"Collateral").   Notwithstanding   the  foregoing,   if  the  Purchaser  obtains
"Permitted  A/R  Financing"  (as such term is defined in Exhibit  J), the Seller
shall,  upon request by the Purchaser,  subordinate its security interest in any
accounts  receivable to be pledged as security for the Permitted A/R  Financing,
and shall execute and deliver such  documents as the  Purchaser  may  reasonably
request  to  confirm  and  give  effect  to such  subordination.  The  Purchaser
represents,  warrants and confirms that such security interest in the Collateral
constitutes a valid,  first priority security interest in the Collateral.  Until
the Purchaser and the Companies shall have performed all their obligations under
the Note and  Section  1.2 (or  Section  1.3, as the case may be), so long as no
Default  (as defined  below)  shall occur and be  continuing,  the  certificates
evidencing the Shares and transfer  documents  described in the last sentence of
Section  1.1 shall  continue  to be held by Salans on behalf of the  Seller,  as
secured  party,  pursuant to the Escrow  Agreement;  provided that so long as no
Default shall occur and be continuing,  the Purchaser may exercise all rights as
record and beneficial  owner of the Shares (other than  transferring or pledging
the Shares or any rights therein).

     (b) During the  Obligation  Period (as defined in Section  1.4(e)  hereof),
each of the following events will constitute a "Default":

          (i)  The  commencement  of a  voluntary  case  or  proceeding  by  the
     Purchaser or any of the Companies  (other than Tyzack) under any applicable
     bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization  or other similar law or any other
     case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent or the consent
     to the entry of a decree or order for relief by the Purchaser or any of the
     Companies  (other than Tyzack) in an involuntary  case or proceeding  under
     any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization or other similar law
     or to the  commencement  of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding
     against the Purchaser or any of the Companies  (other than Tyzack),  or the
     filing, by the Purchaser or any of the Companies (other than Tyzack),  of a

                                       5

<PAGE>

     petition  or answer  or  consent  seeking  reorganization  or relief  under
     applicable  law, or the consent by the  Purchaser  or any of the  Companies
     (other than Tyzack) to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of
     or  taking  possession  by a  custodian,  receiver,  liquidator,  assignee,
     trustee,  sequestrator  or similar  official of the Purchaser or any of the
     Companies  (other than Tyzack) or any substantial  part of their respective
     property,  or the making by the  Purchaser or any of the  Companies  (other
     than  Tyzack)  of an  assignment  for  the  benefit  of  creditors,  or the
     admitting in writing by the Purchaser or any of the  Companies  (other than
     Tyzack) of an inability  to pay its debts  generally as they become due, or
     the taking of corporate  action by the  Purchaser  or any of the  Companies
     (other than Tyzack) in furtherance of any such action,  or any receiver and
     manager shall  otherwise be appointed in respect of the Purchaser or any of
     the  Companies  (other  than  Tyzack)  or any  substantial  part  of  their
     respective  property  pursuant to any contract,  agreement or instrument to
     which the  Purchaser or any of the Companies  (other than  Tyzack),  as the
     case may be, is a party;

          (ii) A court of  competent  jurisdiction  shall  enter (A) a decree or
     order for relief in respect of the Purchaser or any of the Companies (other
     than Tyzack) in an  involuntary  case or  proceeding  under any  applicable
     bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree
     or order  adjudging  the  Purchaser  or any of the  Companies  (other  than
     Tyzack) a bankrupt or insolvent,  or approving as properly filed a petition
     seeking  reorganization,  arrangement,  adjustment or  composition of or in
     respect of the Purchaser or any of the Companies  (other than Tyzack) under
     any  applicable  law, or  appointing  a  custodian,  receiver,  liquidator,
     assignee, trustee,  sequestrator or other similar official of the Purchaser
     or any of the Companies  (other than Tyzack) or of any substantial  part of
     their respective property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of the
     affairs of the Purchaser or any of the Companies  (other than Tyzack),  and
     any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order shall
     continue unstayed, undismissed, unvacated or undischarged and in effect for
     a period of 60 consecutive days;

          (iii) The failure by the Purchaser or any of the Companies to pay when
     due any  amount  hereunder,  including,  without  limitation,  a  quarterly
     payment of the Earnout,  a payment under the Note, or payment of the Payoff
     Amount pursuant to Section 1.3(b),  which failure shall not have been cured
     within five business  days after written  notice of such failure shall have
     been delivered to the Purchaser;

          (iv) The failure by the  Purchaser,  Goldstein or any of the Companies
     to perform or observe any of the terms,  covenants or agreements applicable
     to it or him and  contained  either in Article VII of this  Agreement or in
     Exhibit J hereto,  which  violation (if curable)  shall not have been cured
     within 30 days after the occurrence thereof;

          (v) A judgment or order for the payment of money in excess of $100,000
     (and not covered by insurance)  shall be rendered  against the Purchaser or
     any of the Companies and such judgment or order shall continue  unsatisfied
     and unstayed for a period of 30 consecutive days;

          (vi) The  failure by the  Purchaser  to pay when due any Third  Avenue
     Lease Obligation if the Purchaser has previously failed to pay when due any
     Third Avenue  Lease  Obligation  in the six months  prior to such  failure;
     provided  that such failure is not the result of a good faith  dispute with
     respect to such Third  Avenue Lease  Obligation  and  Purchaser  placed the
     amount of the disputed Third Avenue Lease Obligation into an escrow with an
     appropriate third party pending resolution of such dispute;

          (vii) The Purchaser or any of the Companies  fails to pay in full when
     due (whether at stated  maturity,  by acceleration or otherwise) all or any
     portion  of any  principal  of or  interest  on or any  amount  payable  in
     connection with any of their  respective debts or indebtedness or otherwise
     defaults  or  breaches  any  obligations  with  respect  to  such  debt  or
     indebtedness,  as a result  of which any such  debt or  indebtedness  in an
     amount equal to or greater than  $150,000 is declared to be due and payable
     prior to the stated maturity thereof; or

          (viii) A Change of  Control  (as  defined  herein)  shall  occur.  For
     purposes of this Section  1.4(b)(viii),  a "Change of Control" means any of
     the following, (A) Goldstein (and/or his "Permitted Transferees" as defined
     on the date hereof in the Purchaser's  Operating  Agreement)  shall fail to
     own (both  beneficially  and of record) and  control 25% of the  membership
     interests  of  Purchaser  with  voting  rights  to  elect  members  to  the
     Purchaser's Board of Managers,  or other voting interests of the Purchaser,
     as such  percentage may be diluted for issuances of Incentive  Shares under
     the Purchaser's  Operating Agreement,  issuances of membership interests in
     connection  with permitted  acquisitions  by the Purchaser and issuances to
     third  parties in permitted  capital  raising  transactions,  (B) Goldstein
     shall no longer be a member of the Board of Managers of the Purchaser,  (C)
     Goldstein  shall no longer be employed  by the  Purchaser  whether  through
     Goldstein's  resignation  or his  termination  for  cause by the  Purchaser
     pursuant  to  Goldstein's  Employment  Agreement  or  otherwise,   (D)  the
     Purchaser sells all or  substantially  all of its assets in one transaction
     or a series of  transactions,  or (E) the  Purchaser  enters into a merger,
     consolidation  or other  combination  in which the  majority  of the voting
     interests of the surviving entity are not owned by the owners of a majority
     of the voting interests of the Purchaser immediately preceding such merger,
     consolidation or other combination.

     Upon the  occurrence  of a Default under  subsections  (i) and (ii) of this
Section 1.4(b),  without any action by or notice from the Seller,  the principal
and interest under the Note and all other amounts  accrued and unpaid under this
Agreement shall be immediately due and payable, whereupon all such principal and
interest  and all such other  amounts  shall become and be  immediately  due and
payable,  without  presentment,  demand,  protest, or notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby  expressly  waived by the  Purchaser.  Upon the occurrence of a
Default under  subsections  (iii)  through and including  (viii) of this Section
1.4(b),  the Seller shall have the right to declare the  principal  and interest
under the Note and all other  amounts  accrued and unpaid under this  Agreement,
immediately  due and payable,  whereupon all such principal and interest and all
such other  amounts  shall become and be  immediately  due and payable,  without
presentment,  demand,  protest,  or notice of any kind,  all of which are hereby
expressly waived by the Purchaser.  Upon the occurrence of any Default;  (A) the
Seller  shall  have the  right to  appoint a  majority  of the  managers  of the
Purchaser (in accordance with Section 4.15, Seller shall receive proxies to vote

                                       7

<PAGE>

the  membership  interests  of  Purchaser  necessary  to elect a majority of the
managers of Purchaser with such proxy becoming  exercisable  upon the occurrence
of a Default); (B) the Seller may: (1) prepare for sale, advertise for sale, and
sell (in the manner  provided  for herein)  the  Collateral  and shall  (without
limiting  any of the  provisions  of this  Section 1.4) have all the rights with
respect thereto of a secured party under the New York Uniform  Commercial  Code,
or  (2)  dispose  of  the  Collateral  by  way  of  one  or  more  contracts  or
transactions, for cash or on terms, in such manner and at such places (including
the Seller's premises) as is commercially  reasonable under the New York Uniform
Commercial  Code,  and  apply any  proceeds  to the  obligations  owing to it in
whatever manner or order the Seller deems appropriate. The Seller may credit bid
and purchase at any public sale. Any deficiency that exists after disposition of
the  Collateral  provided above will be paid  immediately by the Purchaser.  The
Seller is hereby granted a license or other right to use,  without  charge,  the
Companies'  labels,  patents,  copyrights,  rights  of use of  any  name,  trade
secrets, trade names, trademarks,  service marks, and advertising matter, or any
property of a similar nature, in completing production of, advertising for sale,
and selling the Collateral and, in connection with the Seller's  exercise of its
rights under this Section 1.4, the Companies'  rights under all licenses and all
franchise agreements shall inure to the Seller's benefit.

     If all or a portion of the  principal  of, or interest  on, the Note or any
other amount payable under the Note or this Agreement  shall not be paid in full
when due,  such  overdue  amount  shall  bear  interest  (but if such  amount is
interest on the Note,  only to the extent  permitted by applicable law) from and
including  the date when such amount became due to but not including the date on
which such amount shall be paid in full at a rate per annum equal to 5% plus the
interest rate  applicable to such amount pursuant to the Note or this Agreement,
if any.  Interest  on amounts in default  shall be payable  from time to time on
demand given by the Seller.

     (c) Alternatively  (and in lieu of any other remedies and relief that would
be available to the Seller,  whether under this Agreement,  at law, in equity or
otherwise),  upon a  Default  occurring  prior to the first  anniversary  of the
Closing  Date,  the Seller may, at its sole option,  cause Salans to release the
Shares to it in  accordance  with the Escrow  Agreement,  endorse  the Shares to
itself and  continue  to hold the Shares as sole  record and  beneficial  holder
thereof free and clear of any claims of  Purchaser,  in which case the Purchaser
shall be released from any obligation to continue  making any payments under the
Note or the Earnout. The Purchaser agrees that given the unknown future value of
the Earnout,  it would be impossible to determine the precise  amount of damages
the Seller would suffer as a result of a Default within the first year after the
Closing Date, and that the remedy in this paragraph (c) therefore  constitutes a
reasonable approximation of such damages.

     (d) Effective  only upon the  occurrence  and during the  continuance  of a
Default,  the Purchaser hereby  irrevocably  appoints the Seller (and any of the
Seller's designated  officers,  or employees) as the true and lawful attorney of
the Purchaser and the Companies (as  applicable) to: (A) endorse the Purchaser's
name on the  certificates  evidencing  the  Shares;  (B)  sign  the  name of the
Purchaser or any of the Companies on any documents relating to the sale or other
disposition of the Shares; or (C) dispose of the Shares.  The appointment of the
Seller as the  attorney-in-fact of the Purchaser and the Companies as aforesaid,

                                       8

<PAGE>

being coupled with an interest,  is irrevocable  until all of the obligations of
the Purchaser hereunder and under the Note have been fully paid and performed.

     (e)  Upon  the  indefeasible  payment  in  full  in  cash  of  all  payment
obligations  under the Note and the  Earnout  (whether  upon  expiration  of the
Earnout Period or prepayment thereof pursuant to Section 1.3) and the payment in
full in cash of the Security  Deposit (as defined in Section 9.10  hereof),  the
security  interest  created  by this  Section  1.4  shall  terminate;  provided,
however,  that if for any reason the  Seller is  required  to return any part of
such payment to the Purchaser (whether as a result of a court order, pursuant to
a  fraudulent  conveyance  statute  or  rule,  in  a  bankruptcy  proceeding  or
otherwise),  then the  security  interest  created  by this  Section  1.4  shall
retroactively  remain in effect and the Purchaser  shall  immediately  take such
actions  as may be  necessary  to  return  the  Shares  and  transfer  documents
contemplated  by the last  sentence  of  Section  1.1 to the  Seller  to hold as
provided herein.  Such period of time as the (x) Note remains  outstanding,  (y)
the Purchaser has outstanding  obligations to make Earnout payments  pursuant to
Section 1.2(b),  and (z) the Purchaser has not paid the Security Deposit,  shall
be referred to herein as the "Obligation Period".

     (f) For avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that the occurrence
of a Default  or the  exercise  by the  Seller of any of its  rights  under this
Section 1.4 (including  without  limitation  the remedy  provided for in Section
1.4(c)) shall not relieve  Goldstein of his obligations  under Sections 7.3, 7.5
or 7.6 hereof or under the  non-competition  agreement  to be  delivered  by him
pursuant to Section 4.7 hereof;  provided that such obligations  shall remain in
effect only for so long as any material portion of the Business  continues to be
conducted  by any  Company,  the  Seller or any  successor  in  interest  to the
Business,  as the case may be, and the Seller (or the  successor  in interest to
the  Business,  as  applicable)  is not in  payment  default  under  Goldstein's
employment contract as then in effect; and provided, further, that if the Seller
(or the  successor  in  interest  to the  Business,  as  applicable)  terminates
Goldstein's  employment  (other  than for  "cause",  as defined  in  Goldstein's
employment  contract as then in effect),  the  obligations  of  Goldstein  under
Section  7.3 shall  only  remain in effect  for a period of up to twelve  months
after the date of such  termination  and only so long as  Goldstein is receiving
severance payments equal to at least 80% of his average annual  compensation for
the three years prior to the date of such termination (in computing such average
annual compensation any Goldstein Additional  Compensation  Payments (as defined
in paragraph 3 of Exhibit J) payments and Goldstein 2003 Advances (as defined in
paragraph 3 of Exhibit J) shall not be included as compensation).

     (g)  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary in this  Agreement,  it is
understood  and  agreed  that the  Seller's  security  interest  created by this
Section 1.4 shall terminate upon the expiration of the Obligation  Period and is
subject to the liens and security interest of the Lenders (as defined in Section
3.6) under that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April
17, 2002 (as amended,  supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (the
"Credit Agreement")),  and all of the Seller's contractual rights,  remedies and
privileges  hereunder  may be  assigned  at any time by the Seller to any of the
Lenders  and that,  in the case of such an  assignment,  such  Lender or Lenders
shall have all the rights of the Seller under this Agreement, including, without
limitation,  under Section 1.4, as though such Lender or Lenders were the Seller
itself.

                                     CLOSING

     The  closing of the  purchase  and sale of the  Shares  shall take place at
10:00 a.m.  on  Thursday,  March 7, 2003,  at the  offices of Salans,  620 Fifth
Avenue,  New York, New York 10020,  or at such other time, date and place as the

the Purchaser shall execute and deliver the Note to the Seller and the Purchaser
shall deliver to the Seller a Receipt and  Confirmation in the form of Exhibit C
hereto.

                                  Article III

                CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE PURCHASER

     The  obligations  of the  Purchaser  under  Article  I are  subject  to the
satisfaction, on or before the Closing Date, of the following conditions, any of
which may be waived in whole or in part by the Purchaser in its sole discretion:

     Section 3.1.Due Performance. The Seller shall have in all material respects
performed and complied with all agreements  and  conditions  required under this
Agreement  to be  performed  or  complied  with by it on or prior to the Closing
Date.

     Section 3.2.Accuracy of Representations and Warranties. All representations
and warranties of the Seller set forth in Article V of this  Agreement  shall be
true  and  correct  on and as of the  Closing  Date as if made on and as of such
date.

     Section  3.3.Certificate.  The Purchaser  shall have received a certificate
from the Seller  executed by its  President  to the effect set forth in Sections
3.1 and 3.2.

     Section  3.4.Transfer  of  Assets.  To the  extent  that the  Seller or any
subsidiary  of the  Seller  other  than  one of the  Companies  (or one of their
respective  subsidiaries)  owns or holds any of the assets set forth on Schedule
3.4 hereto (the "Business  Assets"),  such assets shall have been transferred to
one or more of the Companies. The terms of the agreement or instrument effecting
such transfer shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser and its counsel.

     Section 3.5.Working Capital Adjustment.

     (a)  The  Companies'  consolidated  Net  Working  Capital  (as  hereinafter
defined)  shall be  calculated  as of the  Effective  Date. In the event the Net
Working  Capital is less than  $1,000,000,  the Seller shall  contribute  to the
Companies an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $1,000,000 or (ii) an amount that
is necessary to raise the Net Working  Capital (as  calculated  on the Effective
Date) to $1,000,000 (such amount may include, among other things, the assumption
by Seller of Third Avenue Lease Obligations or obligations,  including,  without
limitation,  payment  obligations  of Purchaser  arising in connection  with the
performance,  by  Seller,  of the  Transition  Services  set forth on  Exhibit K

                                       10

<PAGE>

attached  hereto  where such amount  shall be so provided to  Purchaser  as such
payment obligation becomes due in accordance with this Agreement); provided that
the contribution of intercompany  loans (other than New  Intercompany  Debt) due
Seller  and/or any of its  subsidiaries  to the capital of any of the  Companies
shall not be deemed or  construed  as an addition to Net  Working  Capital;  and
provided,  further,  that if the Seller  increases  the Net  Working  Capital by
assumption  of a portion of the Third Avenue Lease  Obligations,  and the Seller
then  disposes of the Third Avenue Lease (in  accordance  with Section 9.4) in a
manner such that the Seller shall not have  actually paid the Third Avenue Lease
Obligations  so  assumed  by it, the Seller  shall  promptly  contribute  to the
Purchaser an amount equal to the unpaid Third Avenue Lease  Obligations that had
been so  assumed  by the  Seller.  In the  event  the Net  Working  Capital  (as
calculated on the Effective  Date) is in excess of  $1,000,000,  Seller shall be
entitled  to retain  such assets of the  Companies  (subject to the  Purchaser's
consent as to the assets so  retained)  having an  aggregate  fair market  value
equal to the amount of the Net Working  Capital in excess of  $1,000,000  or, at
the  Seller's  option (or if the  Purchaser  and the Seller  cannot agree on the
assets to be retained), the Purchaser shall pay such excess amount to the Seller
in cash within 30 days after the Closing Date.

     For  purposes of this Section 3.5,  "Net Working  Capital"  means (1) cash,
cash equivalents,  accounts receivable,  deposits and prepaid expenses minus (2)
total current  liabilities.  Each of the foregoing  elements in determining  net
working capital shall be calculated in accordance  with United States  generally
accepted accounting  principles applied in a manner consistent with the Seller's
preparation of its consolidated  financial  statements as of the Effective Date.
The  evidence  of  such  amount  of Net  Working  Capital  shall  be  reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser and its counsel. Schedule 3.5 attached hereto sets
forth an estimate  of Net Working  Capital  items and a  reasonable  description
thereof.  In  computing  Net Working  Capital,  any expenses , payables or other
liabilities  of the Companies  paid by the Seller since January 1, 2003 shall be
offset against any collected accounts  receivable or other cash of the Companies
retained by the Seller since January 1, 2003. The amount of required Net Working
Capital  shall be increased by the amount,  if any, (the "Excess Swept Cash") by
which the sum of such  collected  accounts  receivable  and such  retained  cash
exceeds the sum of such expenses, payables or other liabilities of the Companies
paid by the Seller  since  January 1, 2003 where  Seller  shall be  required  to
contribute the Excess Swept Cash to the Companies in cash at the Closing. In the
event  that  the sum of such  expenses,  payables  or other  liabilities  of the
Companies  paid by the  Seller  since  January 1, 2003  exceeds  the sum of such
collected  accounts  receivable and such retained cash, such excess shall reduce
the amount of required  Net Working  Capital by an amount  equal to such excess.
The Purchaser and the Seller agree that any such  adjustments to the Net Working
Capital  shall be made  within  thirty  (30) days after the  Closing  Date.  The
Purchaser and the Seller shall have had the  opportunity to review the financial
statements documenting the existence of the Net Working Capital.

     Section 3.6.Consents and Governmental  Approvals.  The Purchaser shall have
received any material consents of third parties, and any authorizations, orders,
grants,   consents,   permits  and   approvals  of  all  relevant   governmental
authorities,  required in connection with the  consummation of the  transactions
contemplated under this Agreement  (including without limitation the transfer of
the Business Assets to the Companies  contemplated by Section 3.4),  without the
imposition  of any  materially  burdensome  conditions  or  restrictions,  which
consents  shall  continue  to be in full force and effect on the  Closing  Date.

                                       11

<PAGE>

Without  limiting the foregoing,  (a) the required lenders (the "Lenders") under
the Credit Agreement and the required sub-debt holders (the "Sub-Debt  Holders")
of the Seller each shall have consented to the transactions  contemplated hereby
and the Companies shall have no continuing  obligations to the Lenders under the
Credit  Agreement and the other agreements and documents  contemplated  thereby,
and/or to the Sub-Debt Holders;  (b) the Lenders shall have released their Liens
on the  Shares  and  released  their  Liens on all  property  of the  Companies,
including, without limitation, the Business Assets; and (c) Seller shall provide
to  Purchaser  such  documents  and  written  evidence of the  satisfaction  and
discharge   in   favor  of  the   Companies   of   indebtedness   ("Satisfaction
Indebtedness")  due the  Lenders  and the  Sub-Debt  Holder and  evidence of the
events  described  in Section  3.6(a) and Section  3.6(b)  above  ("Indebtedness
Release Documents")  (including,  without limitation,  an acknowledgment of such
release,   an  appropriate   satisfaction  and  discharge  and  UCC-3  financing
statements) reasonably requested by Purchaser and its counsel.

     Section 3.7.Release. Seller and certain related parties shall have executed
and  delivered a Release of Claims in favor of  Goldstein,  the  Purchaser,  the
Companies and certain related parties, in the form of Exhibit D-1 hereto.

     Section 3.8.No Claims. No claim, action, suit,  investigation or proceeding
shall be pending or threatened  against any of the parties  which,  if adversely
determined,  would  (a)  prevent  or  hinder  consummation  of the  transactions
contemplated  by  this  Agreement  or  (b)  materially   adversely   affect  the
Purchaser's  rights with  respect to the Shares  after the  Closing  Date or the
ability of the  Purchaser  and the  Companies to operate the Business  after the
Closing Date.

     Section  3.9.Resolutions,  Etc. The Purchaser shall have received,  in form
and substance  reasonably  satisfactory  to it, (i) copies of  resolutions  duly
adopted by the Seller's Board of Directors  authorizing the Seller's  execution,
delivery  and  performance  of  this  Agreement  and  the  consummation  of  the
transactions contemplated hereby and the contribution to capital of each Company
of any intercompany  debt due from such Company to Seller or a subsidiary of the
Seller other than a Company certified by the Secretary of Seller.

     Section 3.10 Escrow  Agreement.  All parties to the Escrow Agreement (other
than the Purchaser) shall have executed and delivered the Escrow Agreement.

     Section 3.11 Legal Opinion. The Purchaser shall have received from Salans a
legal opinion in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E.

     Section 3.12 Good Standing Certificate.  The Seller shall have delivered to
the Purchaser a certificate of good standing from the  appropriate  authority in
the jurisdiction of the Seller's organization.

sort, including,  without limitation,  the payment of forty percent (40%) of the
rent relating to the lease (the "Third Avenue Lease") of office space located at
850 Third  Avenue,  New York,  New York (the "Third  Avenue Lease  Obligations")
(subject to the application of Section 3.5 or 8.2(d) hereof),  such  liabilities
shall have been  transferred  to and assumed by the Companies and, to the extent
reasonably practicable,  Seller shall have been released therefrom. The terms of
the agreement  effecting such transfer shall be reasonably  satisfactory  to the
Seller and its counsel.  The  Purchaser  shall have  executed  and  delivered an

state  or  foreign  securities  laws.  The  Purchaser  further  understands  and
acknowledges  that the  Shares  may not be  transferred  or resold  without  (i)
registration  under the Act and any applicable state or foreign securities laws,
or  (ii)  an  exemption  from  the  registration  requirements  of the  Act  and

not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public
offering thereof.

     Section 6.8.Solvency.  After giving effect to the transactions contemplated
by this  Agreement,  as of the Effective Date and as of the Closing Date (i) the
fair salable value of the Purchaser's assets at a fair valuation will exceed the
indebtedness  and liabilities  (contingent or otherwise) of the Purchaser,  (ii)
the present fair salable  value of the assets of the  Purchaser  will be greater
than the amount  that will be  required  to pay the  probable  liability  of the

matured,  (iii) the Purchaser is able to pay its indebtedness and liabilities as
they become  absolute and matured,  (iv) the  Purchaser  does not intend to, and
does not believe that it will,  incur  indebtedness  or  liabilities  beyond its
ability to pay such  indebtedness  and  liabilities as they become  absolute and
matured, and (v) the Purchaser is not engaged in a business or transaction,  and
is not about to engage in a  business  or  transaction,  the  result of which is
reasonably likely to result in the Purchaser having unreasonably small capital.

     Section 6.9.First Year Budget. The First Year Budget accurately  represents
the   Purchaser's   reasonable   expectations   and  forecasts  of  revenue  and
expenditures to be received or incurred, as applicable, in the operations of the
Companies  during  the  2003  calendar  year;   provided  that,   although  such
expectations and forecasts are based on assumptions which the Purchaser believes
are  reasonable,  there  can  be no  assurance  that  the  actual  revenues  and
expenditures will not vary  substantially and materially from those set forth in
the First Year Budget.

subsidiaries  not to),  directly or  indirectly,  divulge or  communicate to any
third party, or use for its own benefit, any trade secrets,  methods,  know-how,
customer lists, data or other proprietary information, whether or not patentable
or copyrightable, insofar as such information either specifically relates to the
products or services offered by, or the operation of the Business of, any of the
Companies or was originated or developed in connection therewith;  provided that
the foregoing  obligations  shall not apply to any information  that is or shall
hereafter become part of public or industry  knowledge or literature (other than
as a result of the Seller's  actions  following  the Closing  Date),  or that is
required  to be  disclosed  by order  of any  court or  governmental  agency  of
competent jurisdiction.

     (b) After the Closing Date,  the  Purchaser  shall not, and shall cause the
Companies to not,  directly or  indirectly,  divulge or communicate to any third
party,  or use for  its or  their  own  benefit,  any  trade  secrets,  methods,
know-how, customer lists, data or other proprietary information,  whether or not
patentable or  copyrightable,  insofar as such information  either  specifically
relates to the products or services offered by, or the operation of the business
of, the Seller or was originated or developed in connection therewith;  provided
that the foregoing  obligations  shall not apply to any  information  that is or
shall hereafter become part of public or industry knowledge or literature (other
than  as a  result  of the  actions  of any  Purchaser  or any of the  Companies
following the Closing Date), or that is required to be disclosed by order of any
court or governmental agency of competent jurisdiction.

     Section 7.5 Restrictions Reasonable; Injunctive Relief.

     (a) The Seller acknowledges that the restrictions imposed on it by Sections
7.1 and 7.4(a) are  reasonable  (including  without  limitation  as to duration,
territory and scope) and are  necessary for the  protection of the Purchaser and
the Companies' Business. Goldstein acknowledges that the restrictions imposed on
him by Section 7.3 are reasonable  (including without limitation as to duration,
territory  and scope) and are necessary for the Seller to enjoy the full benefit
of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement;  Goldstein further confirms
that such restrictions will not prevent him from earning a living. The Purchaser
acknowledges that the restrictions imposed upon it and the Companies by Sections
7.2 and 7.4(b) are  reasonable  (including  without  limitation  as to duration,
territory  and scope)  and are  necessary  for the  protection  of the  Seller's
business.

     (b) Because no party hereto would have an adequate remedy at law to protect
its interests from any breach of the provisions of Sections 7.1 through 7.4, the
Purchaser,  on the one  hand,  and the  Seller,  on the  other  hand,  shall  be
entitled,  in the event of such a breach or threatened  breach by the Seller, on
the one hand, or the  Purchaser or  Goldstein,  on the other hand, to injunctive
relief in addition to such other  remedies and relief that would be available to

                                       23

<PAGE>

the Purchaser or the Seller,  as the case may be. In the event of such a breach,
in  addition  to any other  remedies,  the  Seller  and the  Purchaser  shall be
entitled to receive from such breaching party payment of, or reimbursement  for,
their  reasonable  attorneys'  fees and  disbursements  incurred in successfully
enforcing any such  provision.  The provisions of this Article VII shall survive
the Closing Date.

     Section  7.6  Goldstein  agrees  to use any and  all  Goldstein  Additional
Compensation Payments and Goldstein 2003 Advances to make payments in respect of
the scheduled  maturity of any third party debt of Goldstein  existing as of the
Closing Date.

Agreement  were not  fair,  from a  financial  point of  view,  to the  Seller's
stockholders or creditors; and

to exist on or prior to the  Effective  Date,  would  constitute a breach of any
representation or warranty of the Seller contained in this Agreement.

defend and hold  harmless  the Seller and its  officers,  directors,  employees,
agents,  shareholders,  successors  and  assigns  from and against any Losses in

Purchaser  contained in this  Agreement  (subject,  in the case of a breach of a
representation or warranty, to the limitation set forth in Section 8.6);

     (b)  any  and  all  Taxes  attributable  to  the  operations  of any of the
Companies following the Effective Date;

                                       24

     (e) any obligations arising out of the operation of the Companies' Business
after  the  Effective  Date,  including  without  limitation  bonuses,   salary,

respect of periods  prior to the  Effective  Date and unpaid as of the Effective
Date).

     Section 8.3 Definitions.  For purposes of this Article VIII: "Losses" means
any loss,  liability,  damage or  expense  suffered  or  incurred  by a party in
connection with the matters described in Section 8.1 or Section 8.2,  including,
without  limitation,  assessments,  fines,  penalties,  judgments,  settlements,
costs,  reasonable  attorneys'  fees  and  reasonable  disbursements  and  other
reasonable  out of pocket  expenses  of the party  incident  to any matter as to
which the party is entitled to  indemnification  under either such  Section,  or
incident to any allegations or claims which, if true,  would give rise to Losses
subject to  indemnification  hereunder,  or incident to the  enforcement  by the
party of its rights and remedies under this Article VIII.

     Section 8.4 Procedure.

     (a) Any party (or parties) entitled to  indemnification  under this Article
VIII (the "party to be indemnified") shall give notice to the party (or parties)
from whom  indemnification is sought (the  "indemnifying  party") as promptly as
practicable of (i) the allegation by it of any breach or failure  referred to in
Section 8.1(a),  Section 8.1(c) or Section 8.2(a), as applicable,  setting forth
to the extent known the amount of indemnification  claimed;  (ii) the incurrence
of any Taxes  referred to in Section  8.1(b) or Section  8.2(b) or any liability
under Sections 8.2(d) or 8.2(e),  as applicable;  or (iii) the allegation by any
third  party of the  existence  of any matter or state of facts  referred  to in
Section  8.1(d),  Section  8.1(e),  Section  8.2(c),  Section  8.2(d) or Section
8.2(e),  as applicable;  provided that the rights of the party to be indemnified
shall not be affected by any delay in providing such notice except to the extent
that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced thereby.

     (b) Upon  receipt of a notice as  provided  in  paragraph  (a)  above,  the
indemnifying  party shall have 30 days in which to dispute the claim asserted by
sending  written  notice  thereof  to the party to be  indemnified  (a  "Dispute
Notice").  The indemnifying party shall not be entitled to dispute a claim based
on a final judgment or order of a court of competent jurisdiction. If no Dispute
Notice is received prior to the expiration of the 30-day period, the party to be
indemnified  shall be  entitled  to  receive  full  payment of the amount of the
claim,  subject  to the  limitations  set forth in  Sections  8.5 and 8.6.  If a
Dispute Notice is received  prior to the  expiration of the 30-day  period,  the
party to be indemnified and the indemnifying party shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve the  dispute.  If the party to be  indemnified  and the  indemnifying
party are unable to resolve  the  dispute  within 30 days of the  receipt of the
Dispute Notice, the dispute shall be submitted to arbitration.  Such arbitration
shall be conducted according to the applicable rules of the American Arbitration
Association  and  shall  take  place  in New  York,  New  York  before  a single
arbitrator,  who  shall  be  designated  by  party  to be  indemnified  and  the

                                       25

<PAGE>

indemnifying  party or, if they are  unable  to agree  within 10 days  after the
dispute is submitted to arbitration,  by the American  Arbitration  Association.
The  decision  of the  arbitrator  shall be final and  binding  upon the parties
hereto.

     (c)  With  respect  to any  claim,  demand,  action,  suit,  proceeding  or
investigation involving Taxes referred to in Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.2(b) or
the matters  set forth in Section  8.1(d),  Section  8.1(e),  Section  8.2(c) or
Section  8.2(e),  the  indemnifying  party  shall have the right to control  the
defense of any such claim with counsel reasonably  acceptable to the party to be
indemnified at the cost and expense of the indemnifying  party. No settlement of
any such claim or payment in connection with any such  settlement  shall be made
unless (1) the settlement  contains an unconditional  release of the party to be
indemnified and specifically  provides that the party to be indemnified does not
admit to any wrongdoing or (2) the party to be indemnified  shall have consented
to such settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     (d) The  party to be  indemnified  to make  available  to the  indemnifying
party, upon reasonable  notice,  all records in such party's  possession and all
personnel  with  knowledge  relating  to a matter for which  indemnification  is
claimed by the party to be indemnified;  provided that access to personnel shall
not  materially  interfere  with the  ability of such  personnel  to conduct the
business of the party to be indemnified.

     Section  8.5  Limitations  on  Indemnification.  Neither  party  shall have
liability for indemnification of any Losses under this Article VIII in excess of
$3,500,000;  provided that the foregoing  limitation  shall not apply (i) in the
event of fraud or  willful  misconduct  by the  indemnifying  party  and (ii) to
Losses incurred in connection with (A) intentionally  knowing breaches of any of
the representations or warranties of a party to this Agreement,  (B) intentional
breaches of any covenant of any party to this  Agreement,  and/or (C) the breach
of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.6.

     Section 8.6 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations
and warranties  made by the parties in this Agreement shall survive for a period
of one year after the Closing  Date,  other than (a) the  representation  of the
Seller in Section 5.6, which shall survive for a period of three years after the
Closing  Date and (b) the  representation  of the Seller in Section  5.4 and the
representations  of the  Purchaser in Sections 6.4 and 6.6,  which shall survive
indefinitely.

     Section 8.7 Right of Offset.

     (a) At its option, Purchaser shall have the right to offset, against either
any Earnout  payment  obligations or any  obligations to make payments under the
Note (or a  combination  thereof),  any Losses  suffered by the  Purchaser  with
respect to which Seller is required to provide indemnification  pursuant to this
Article VIII. It is understood  that this right of offset is for the convenience
of the Purchaser  and is not the  Purchaser's  exclusive  remedy with respect to
Losses suffered by it.

     (b) If the Purchaser  believes it has suffered Losses and desires to offset
all or a portion of such Losses against its obligations to pay the Earnout or to
make payments  under the Note,  the Purchaser  shall so notify the Seller in the

                                       26

<PAGE>

notice to be delivered to the Seller pursuant to Section  8.4(a).  If the Seller
shall not have delivered a Dispute Notice  pursuant to Section 8.4(b) within the
time  period  prescribed  therein,  the  Purchaser  may so offset such Losses in
accordance with the notice so delivered to the Seller.  If the Seller delivers a
Dispute  Notice with respect to such  Losses,  then the  Purchaser  shall not be
relieved of its  obligation to pay sums due under the Earnout or pursuant to the
Note (and shall make all such payments to the Seller) until the dispute relating
to such  Losses  shall have been  finally  resolved in the manner  specified  in
Section  8.4(b).   Upon  such  adjudication,   resolution  or  other  conclusive
determination  of the amount (if any) of Losses in dispute,  the  Purchaser  may
thereafter  offset  any  such  Losses  as  so  finally  determined  against  its
obligations under the Earnout or the Note.

Companies  not to issue or sell any  shares  of stock,  convertible  securities,
convertible  debt,  options,  warrants  or other  rights to  purchase or acquire
shares of stock or convertible securities,  without the prior written consent of
the Seller, which may be withheld in Seller's sole discretion.

     Section  9.2.Budgets and Cash Restrictions.  During the Term, the Purchaser

may terminate such services by giving written notice to the Seller at least five

     Section 9.4.Third Avenue Lease.

     (a) Without  limiting  the  obligation  of the  Purchaser  to pay the Third
Avenue Lease  Obligations  (as may be limited by Section 3.5 above),  the Seller
may, but is not required to, surrender, assign or otherwise dispose of the Third
Avenue Lease in any transaction that either (i) eliminates or materially reduces
any obligations of the Seller thereunder or (ii) in which an entity satisfactory
to the Seller assumes all or substantially  all obligations  thereunder.  In any
such event,  the Purchaser  shall, and shall cause the Companies to, execute and
deliver any  documents  reasonably  required to effect such  transfer  and shall
vacate the  premises  leased  under the Third  Avenue Lease within 90 days after
receipt of written  notice to such  effect from the Seller.  Upon  vacating  the
premises  leased  under the Third  Avenue  Lease after such 90-day  period,  the
Purchaser  shall be relieved of its  obligations  to pay the Third  Avenue Lease
Obligations.  The Purchaser shall not assign the Third Avenue Lease  Obligations
or  sublease,  or  otherwise  permit any other person to use, any portion of the
premises leased under the Third Avenue Lease. The Seller and the Purchaser agree
to share evenly all net consideration  and/or net remuneration  after payment of

<PAGE>

costs in  accordance  with this Section  9.4,  from the  landlord,  a new tenant
and/or  subtenant to Seller,  Purchaser,  and/or the Companies in respect of the
Third Avenue  Lease  whether the result of "key money" or  otherwise;  provided,
however,  that all  consideration  and/or  remuneration  received  in respect of
assets on the books of the Purchaser or any of the Companies, whether furniture,
fixtures,  art work or otherwise,  shall be retained in full by the Purchaser or
any of the Companies,  as the case may be. The Seller and the Purchaser agree to
share evenly in any costs  associated  with disposing of the Third Avenue Lease,
including without limitation  brokers' fees. Seller shall have the sole right to
select any  broker.  Purchaser  agrees to take all  actions,  including  without
limitation executing all documents and instruments, necessary in connection with
any such disposition of the Third Avenue Lease.

     (b)  Promptly  on the Closing  Date,  Purchaser  agrees to provide  written
notice to Citigate that payments in respect of Citigate's sublease shall be made
directly to Seller and Purchaser further agrees that it shall forward,  or cause
the  Companies  to  forward,  to Seller any  payments  made by  Citigate  to the
Purchaser or the Companies after the Closing Date.

required by applicable securities laws or the rules and regulations of any stock
exchange, by court order or as otherwise required by law.

     Section  9.6.Intercompany  Debt. Any  intercompany  debt owed by any of the
Companies  to the Seller  prior to January 1, 2003 shall be  contributed  to the
capital of such Company and any  intercompany  debt owed by the Seller to any of
the Companies  shall be contributed to the capital of the Seller.  To the extent
that any  intercompany  debt has been provided by Seller to any of the Companies
from and  after  January  1, 2003  ("New  Intercompany  Debt")  it shall  remain
outstanding  and not be  cancelled  by the Seller and shall be  included  in the
calculation of Net Working  Capital.  The Purchaser shall cause New Intercompany
Debt in excess of any amount of such New  Intercompany  Debt  necessary to raise
Net Working Capital to $1,000,000 pursuant to Section 3.5 to be repaid to Seller
within 60 days after the Closing Date.

     Section 9.7.Accounts Receivable. The Seller shall promptly turn over to the
Purchaser  any amounts paid to Seller in respect of the accounts  receivable  of
the Business on or after the Closing Date.

     Section 9.8.Tax Matters.

the aggregate  purchase price among the Tyzak Shares,  the Whitney  Shares,  the
Carlyle  Shares and the Whitney  Interests  (and,  as to that  allocated  to the
Whitney Interests, among the various assets of Whitney LLC) in a manner required
by  applicable  tax laws and agreed upon,  in writing,  by Seller and  Purchaser
within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date (the "Allocation"). The Purchaser
and the Seller agree to update the Allocation in a reasonable  manner to reflect
payments  made by the  Purchaser to the Seller  pursuant to the Earnout (and any
adjustments to the purchase price hereunder). The Allocation shall be binding on
the Purchaser, the Companies and the Seller for all purposes, including, without
limitation,  financial  and tax  reporting  purposes,  and  each of  Seller  and
Purchaser  agrees to timely file Internal  Revenue  Service Form 8594 consistent

                                       28

<PAGE>

with such Allocation.  In tax years subsequent to the tax year that includes the
Closing Date,  the Seller and the  Purchaser  shall file  supplemental  Internal
Revenue  Service  Forms 8594 to reflect  payments  made by the  Purchaser to the
Seller pursuant to the Earnout.

     (a) Returns for Periods  Through the Closing  Date.  Seller  shall,  to the
extent  required  or  provided  by law,  include  the  income  of the  Companies
(including  any deferred  income  triggered  into income by Treasury  Regulation
ss.1.1502-13 and Treasury  Regulation  ss.1.1502-14 and any excess loss accounts
taken into  income  under  Treasury  Regulation  ss.1.1502-19)  on the  Seller's
consolidated federal income Tax Returns for all periods through the Closing Date

days of a written request  therefor,  the Companies will furnish Tax information
to Seller for inclusion in Seller's federal  consolidated  income Tax Return for
the period which  includes the Closing Date in  accordance  with the  Companies'
past custom and practice. Seller shall take no new position on such returns that
relate to the Companies or the  Purchaser  that would  materially  and adversely
affect the Companies or the Purchaser  after the Closing Date. The income of the
Companies will be apportioned to the period up to and including the Closing Date
and the period after the Closing  Date by closing the books of the  Companies as
of the end of the Closing  Date.  The Seller  shall retain all refunds for Taxes
relating to pre-Closing tax periods.

     (b) Cooperation.  At Seller's request,  the Purchaser will cause any of the
Companies  to join with the  Seller  in filing  any  necessary  elections  under
Treasury Regulation ss.1.1502-20(g).

     Section  9.9.Observer  Rights.  During the Term,  the Seller shall have the
right to designate an observer to the board of directors of each Company and the
board of managers of the Purchaser.  The Purchaser  shall,  and shall cause each
Company to, take such corporate or other actions as are reasonably  necessary to
give effect to the preceding sentence. Each observer so designated by the Seller
shall be entitled to  participate  in all  meetings of the board of directors or
board of  managers,  and any  committees  thereof,  of the  Company  and/or  the
Purchaser to which such observer was designated.

     Section 9.10 Third  Avenue  Lease  Obligation  Security  Deposit.  Upon the
latest to occur of (1) the indefeasible payment in full and in cash of the Note,
(2) the  indefeasible  payment in full and in cash of the payments in respect of
the Earnout,  and (3) the indefeasible payment in full and in cash of the Payoff
Amount,  Purchaser  shall furnish Seller with a security  deposit (the "Security
Deposit") in support of the then remaining Third Avenue Lease  Obligations in an
amount equal to: the product of (a) forty  percent  (40%)  multiplied by (b) the
then current  monthly rental rate  multiplied by (c) one-third (1/3) of the then
remaining  monthly  lease  payments  due under the  Third  Avenue  Lease up to a
maximum of 36 monthly  payments.  Seller shall hold the  Security  Deposit in an
interest  bearing  escrow  account  for  the  benefit  of  Purchaser  such  as a
subtenant/tenant  of a portion of the Third Avenue Lease premises.  The Security
Deposit  shall  not be deemed  pre-paid  rent and shall be held in escrow by the
Seller  pursuant to an escrow  arrangement  the terms of which shall be mutually
satisfactory to both the Seller and the Purchaser.

unenforceability.  In this  regard,  the parties  agree that the  provisions  of
Section 7, including,  without limitation, the scope of the territorial and time
restrictions,   are  reasonable  and  necessary  to  protect  and  preserve  the
legitimate  interests of the Purchaser  and the Seller,  as  applicable.  If the
provisions of Section 7 are held by a court of competent  jurisdiction  to be in
any respect  unreasonable,  then such court may reduce the  territory or time to

                                       32

which they pertain or otherwise  modify such provisions to the extent  necessary

Agreement.  The Purchaser  acknowledges that, after giving effect to the release
