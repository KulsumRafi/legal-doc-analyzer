<P>Restrictions on Resale</P>

<P>Union Planters has filed registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register the shares of common stock offered by Union Planters under the plan.  If a participant in the plan is not an "affiliate" of Union Planters, he or she may resell shares of Union Planters common stock acquired under the Plan without restriction.

<P>All of the options that may be granted under the plan will be nonstatutory stock options.  Under present federal income tax regulations, there will be no federal income tax consequences to either Union Planters or the participant upon the grant of a non-discounted nonstatutory stock option ("NSO").  However, the participant will realize ordinary income on the exercise of such an NSO in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the stock acquired upon the exercise of such option over the exercise price, and Union Planters will receive a corresponding deduction (subject to the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code).  The gain or loss realized upon the subsequent disposition by the participant of the stock will constitute a capital gain or loss, which will be long-term or short-term depending on how long such shares were held.</P>
