                          LIMITED FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT

     THIS LIMITED  FORBEARANCE  AGREEMENT  (this  "Agreement") is made as of the
14th day of October,  2002, by and among DANZER INDUSTRIES,  INC., a corporation
organized and existing under the laws of the State of Maryland (the "Borrower");
OBSIDIAN ENTERPRISES,  INC., a corporation organized and existing under the laws
of the State of New York (the "Guarantor");  (the Borrower and the Guarantor are
herein  collectively  referred  to as  the  "Obligors"  and  individually  as an
"Obligor");  and BANK OF AMERICA,  N.A.,  a national  banking  association  (the
"Lender").

                                    RECITALS

     A. The Borrower  applied to the Lender for  revolving  loans,  advances and
other financial  accommodations  under the provisions of a certain Business Loan
Agreement  (Asset  Based)  dated August 15, 2001 by and between the Borrower and
the Lender (as amended, restated, supplemented and modified at any time and from
time to time, the "Financing Agreement"). Under and subject to the provisions of
the  Financing  Agreement,  the Lender agreed to make loans  (collectively,  the
"Revolving  Credit Loans" and each  individually,  a "Revolving Credit Loan") to
the Borrower  under a revolving  credit  facility  (the  "Revolving  Loan") in a
principal  amount  not  to  exceed,  in  the  aggregate,   One  Million  Dollars
($1,000,000).  The  Revolving  Credit  Loans are  evidenced  by, and repaid with
interest in accordance with, the terms and conditions of that certain Promissory
Note dated August 15, 2001, from the Borrower, as maker, payable to the order of
the Lender in the maximum  principal  amount of the Revolving  Loan (as amended,
restated,  supplemented  and  modified  at any time and from  time to time,  the
"Revolving Credit Note").

     B. The  Borrower  applied  to the  Lender  for a term loan in the  original
principal  amount of One Million  Dollars  ($1,000,000)  (the "Term  Loan";  the
Revolving  Credit  Loans and the Term  Loan are  herein  sometimes  collectively
referred  to as the  "Loans").  The Term Loan is  evidenced  by, and repaid with
interest in accordance  with, the terms and  conditions of a certain  Promissory
Note dated August 15, 2001 from the Borrower,  as maker, payable to the order of
the  Lender in the  original  principal  amount  of the Term  Loan (as  amended,
restated, supplemented and modified at any time and from time to time, the "Term
Note";  the  Revolving  Credit  Note and the  Term  Note  are  sometimes  herein
sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Notes").

     C. The "Indebtedness" (as defined in the Financing  Agreement),  including,
without  limitation,  the Loans,  are  secured by,  among  other  things (i) the
"Collateral",  as defined in a certain Security  Agreement dated August 15, 2001
executed by the Borrower  for the benefit of the Lender (as  amended,  restated,
supplemented  and  modified  at any time and from  time to time,  the  "Security
Agreement"),  (ii)  the  "Property"  as  defined  in a  certain  Deed of  Trust,
Assignment and Security Agreement dated August 15, 2001 executed by the Borrower
in favor of PRLAP, Inc., as trustee,  for the benefit of the Lender (as amended,
restated, supplemented and modified at any time and from time to time, the "Deed
of Trust") (iii) a certain  Commercial  Guaranty  dated August 15, 2001 from the
Guarantor to the Lender (as amended, restated,  supplemented and modified at any
time and from time to time, the "Guaranty") and (iv) various Uniform  Commercial
Code  Financing   Statements   filed  with  the  Maryland  State  Department  of
Assessments and Taxation and in the land records of Washington County,  Maryland
listing the Borrower as debtor.
<PAGE>

     D. The Lender  advised the  Borrower  and the  Guarantor  of the  following
material defaults under the Financing Agreement, the Guaranty, the Loans and the
other Financing Documents (as hereinafter  defined):  (a) the Borrower's and the
Guarantor's  failure to pay the outstanding  principal  balance plus all accrued
and unpaid  interest upon maturity as provided in the Financing  Agreement,  the
Revolving Credit Note and the Guaranty, (b) the Borrower's failure to maintain a
Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Financing  Agreement) of at least
1.25:1.0 as required by the terms of the Financing  Agreement (the "Debt Service
Covenant") and (c) accrued and unpaid late charges (the "Late Fees") as provided
for in the Financing  Documents in the aggregate  sum of  Thirty-Three  Thousand
Dollars ($33,000) ((a), (b) and (c) above collectively referred to herein as the
"Existing Defaults").

     E.  The  Lender  has  agreed,   subject  to  the  terms,   conditions   and
understandings  expressed in this Agreement,  to refrain and forbear temporarily
from  exercising  and  enforcing  any of its remedies  against any or all of the
Obligors  with  respect to the  Indebtedness  relating  to the Loans,  under the
Financing Agreement, the Notes, the Deed of Trust, the Guaranty and under any of
the other  "Related  Documents"  (as  defined in the  Financing  Agreement;  the
Financing Agreement,  the Notes, the Security Agreement,  the Deed of Trust, the
Guaranty,  the Related  Documents and any and all other documents  evidencing or
securing  the  Loans are  collectively  referred  to  herein  as the  "Financing
Documents"),  or under  applicable  laws for a period  commencing on the date of
this  Agreement  and  ending  on, and  including,  the  earlier of the date of a
"Forbearance Default" under the terms of this Agreement (as hereinafter defined)
or  March  31,  2003  (such  earlier  date  being  referred  to  herein  as  the
"Forbearance  Termination  Date") in order to allow the Obligors the opportunity
to obtain alternate  financing;  provided that, among other things, the Obligors
execute and deliver this Agreement.

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the premises and for other good and
valuable  consideration,   the  receipt  and  sufficiency  of  which  is  hereby
acknowledged, the Lender and the Obligors hereby agree as follows:

                                   AGREEMENTS

     1.  Forbearance.  Subject  to  the  terms,  conditions  and  understandings
contained  in  this  Agreement,  and  for so  long as  there  does  not  exist a
Forbearance  Default,  the Lender  hereby  agrees to: (a)  refrain  and  forbear
temporarily  from  exercising  and enforcing  its rights and remedies  under the
Financing  Agreement,  under the Notes, under the Security Agreement,  under the
Deed of Trust, under the Guaranty,  under any of the other Financing  Documents,
or under applicable laws with respect to the Existing Defaults. Lender's limited
forbearance  agreements  contained in the  foregoing  sentence of this Section 1
shall be effective  commencing on the date of this  Agreement and ending on, and
including the  Forbearance  Termination  Date (the  "Forbearance  Period").  The
Lender  shall have no  obligation  to refrain and  forbear  from  exercising  or
enforcing any of its rights or remedies during the Forbearance  Period or at any
time  thereafter upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Forbearance
Default.
<PAGE>

     2. Interest Rate During Forbearance.  Subject to the terms,  conditions and
understandings  contained in this  Agreement,  and for so long as there does not
exist a  Forbearance  Default  and  notwithstanding  anything  in the  Financing
Agreement,  the Notes,  the Guaranty or any of the other Financing  Documents to
the  contrary,  commencing  on October  1, 2002 and  continuing  throughout  the
Forbearance  Period, the accrued but unpaid principal balance of the Loans shall
bear  interest at the Prime Rate (as  hereinafter  defined),  plus three hundred
(300) basis points per annum (the  "Forbearance  Rate").  The "Prime Rate" means
the floating and fluctuating per annum prime commercial lending rate of interest
of the Lender,  as  established  and  declared by the Lender at any time or from
time to time. The Prime Rate shall be adjusted automatically, without notice, as
of the effective date of any change in such prime  commercial  lending rate. The
Prime Rate does not necessarily represent the lowest rate of interest charged by
the Lender to  borrowers.  The Prime Rate shall be computed on a 360/365  basis;
that is, by multiplying the ratio of the annual interest rate over a year of 360
days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance,  multiplied by the actual
number days the principal  balance is outstanding.  Nothing in this Agreement or
otherwise  shall be deemed to waive,  modify or alter the  provisions  regarding
interest  after  default  set  forth in the  Revolving  Credit  Note or the term
"Default  Rate"  as  defined  in the Term  Note  (collectively,  the  "Financing
Document  Default  Rates").  Such  Financing  Document  Default  Rates  shall be
applicable,  at  Lender's  option  in its sole  discretion,  upon a  Forbearance
Default.

     3. Repayments During Forbearance. Notwithstanding anything in the Financing
Agreement,  the Notes,  the Guaranty or any of the other Financing  Documents to
the contrary,  subject to the terms, conditions and understandings  contained in
this Agreement,  and for so long as there does not exist a Forbearance  Default,
the Obligor  shall make payments on the Loans during the  Forbearance  Period as
follows:

     (a)  Borrower  will pay  regular  monthly  payments  of accrued  and unpaid
interest  on the  Revolving  Credit  Loans at the  Forbearance  Rate,  beginning
October 31, 2002,  with all subsequent  interest  payments to be due on the last
day of each successive month thereafter.

     (b)  Borrower  shall  repay  the  principal  amount  of the  Term  Loan  in
consecutive  monthly  installments  of principal in the amount of Five  Thousand
Five  Hundred   Fifty-Five  Dollars  ($5,555)  plus  interest  payments  on  the
outstanding  principal  balance at the Forbearance Rate beginning on October 31,
2002 and continuing on the last day of each successive month thereafter.

     (c)  Notwithstanding  any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,  the
unpaid  principal  balance,  all  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  and all  other
Indebtedness,  if not sooner paid, shall be paid on the Forbearance  Termination
Date.

     4. Advances  During  Forbearance  Period.  Notwithstanding  anything in the
Financing  Agreement,  the Notes,  the  Guaranty  or any of the other  Financing
Documents  to the  contrary  the Lender and the  Obligors  agree that the Lender
shall have no further obligation or commitment to make or to consider making any
additional  Revolving  Credit Loans,  provided,  however,  that,  subject to the
terms, conditions and understandings contained in this Agreement, the Lender may
make Revolving Credit Loans during the Forbearance Period in its sole,  absolute
and complete discretion and such Revolving Loans shall be fully secured pursuant
to the Financing  Documents by the Collateral and the Property.  Nothing in this
Section 4, this  Agreement,  the  Financing  Agreement  or any of the  Financing
Documents  shall be construed as a binding  commitment to make Revolving  Credit
Loans during the  Forbearance  Period and the Lender shall have no obligation to
make Revolving Credit Loans after a Forbearance  Default. If, at any time during
the  Forbearance  Period or  otherwise,  the aggregate  principal  amount of the
outstanding  Revolving  Credit Loans shall exceed the "Borrowing  Base" (as that
term is defined in the Financing  Agreement),  Borrower shall immediately pay to
Lender an amount  equal to the  difference  between  the  outstanding  principal
balance of the Revolving Credit Loans and the Borrowing Base.

     5. Collateral  Reporting During Forbearance,  Appraisal.  Concurrently with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Borrower shall execute and deliver
to Lender such  schedules  relating to the Borrowing Base as Lender may require,
including, but not limited to schedules of Accounts (as defined in the Financing
Agreement),  Accounts aging,  Inventory (as defined in the Financing Agreement),
Eligible Accounts (as defined in the Financing Agreement) and Eligible Inventory
(as defined in the Financing  Agreement) in form and substance  satisfactory  to
Lender in its sole discretion. Supplemental schedules shall be delivered monthly
within ten (10) days from month end.  The Lender  will have the  Collateral  (as
defined in the Security  Agreement)  and the Property (as defined in the Deed of
Trust)  appraised by an appraiser  acceptable to the Lender.  The Borrower shall
pay to the  Lender the  reasonable  costs  incurred  by Lender  pursuant  to the
appraisal upon Lender's demand.

     6.  Acceleration  of  the  Indebtedness.  Notwithstanding  anything  in the
Financing  Documents to the  contrary,  the entire  amount of the  Indebtedness,
including, without limitation, the Term Loan, is hereby accelerated and, subject
to the terms of this Agreement, is immediately due and payable in full.

     7. Waiver of Late Fees. Notwithstanding anything in the financing documents
to the contrary, the Lender hereby waives the Late Fees, provided, however, that
such waiver  shall be a waiver  only with  respect to the Late Fees to which the
waiver  relates  and  shall  in no  way  impair  the  rights  of  Lender  or the
obligations  of the  Borrower  to the  Lender in any other  respect at any other
time.

     8.  Waiver  of  Debt  Service  Covenant.  Notwithstanding  anything  in the
financing  documents to the contrary,  the Lender  hereby waives the  Borrower's
past  non-compliance  with the Debt Service Covenant.  The Lender further Agrees
that the Financing  Agreement and the other  Financing  Documents are amended to
delete  all   references   to  the  Debt   Service   Covenant  and  that  future
non-compliance  by the Borrower with the Debt Service  Covenant  shall not be an
Event of Default under the Financing Agreement,  the Financing Documents or this
Agreement,  provided,  however, that such waiver and amendment shall be a waiver
and amendment only with respect to the Debt Service Covenant to which the waiver
and  amendment  relates  and shall in no way  impair the rights of Lender or the
obligations  of the  Borrower  to the  Lender in any other  respect at any other
time.

     9.  Conditions  Precedent to Lender's  Forbearance and Waiver of Late Fees.
The  agreements of the Lender under this  Agreement are subject to the following
terms and conditions, time being of the essence:

     (a) The  Borrower  shall  pay the  Lender  a  forbearance  fee of  Nineteen
Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($19,500) (the "Forbearance  Fee"), which is fully
earned  upon the date of this  Agreement.  Nine  Thousand  Seven  Hundred  Fifty
Dollars  ($9,750)  of the  Forbearance  Fee shall due and payable on the date of
this  Agreement  and the  remaining  Nine  Thousand  Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars
($9,750)  of the  Forbearance  Fee is due  and  payable  on the  earlier  of the
Forbearance  Termination  Date  or  the  occurrence  of a  Forbearance  Default,
provided,  however, that if the Indebtedness is paid in full prior to earlier of
the occurrence of a Forbearance  Default or the  Forbearance  Termination  Date,
then the Lender  hereby  agrees to waive the second  $9,750  installment  of the
Forbearance Fee.

     (b) At the time this  Agreement  is executed,  the  Obligors  shall pay all
accrued  and unpaid  interest,  fees,  and  expenses  incurred by Lender and its
agents, including, but not limited to all reasonable attorneys' fees of Lender's
counsel.

     (c) At the time this Agreement is executed, the Obligors will reimburse the
Lender Seven Hundred  Sixty-Eight  Dollars and  Twenty-Five  Cents ($768.25) for

     (d) At the time this  Agreement is executed,  the  Borrower  shall  provide
Lender with: (i) a financial  statement and compliance  certificate  pursuant to
the  Financing  Agreement  for  the  period  ending  August  31,  2002,  (ii)  a
depreciation  schedule on its fixed assets  listing the date of  acquisition  of
each  asset,  cost of each asset,  depreciation  taken on each asset and the net
book  value  of  each  asset,   (iii)  a  schedule  listing  all  of  Borrower's
indebtedness,  including the amount, terms and conditions of all indebtedness of
Borrower to Guarantor (iv) the executed schedules relating to the Borrowing Base
as provided in Section 5 of this  Agreement and the Financing  Agreement and (v)
an open work order summary.  Each of (i), (ii),  (iii), (iv) and (v) above shall
be in form and substance satisfactory to Lender in its sole discretion.

severally,  for  itself,  himself  or  herself  and for its,  his or her  heirs,
personal   representatives,   successors  and  assigns,   hereby   acknowledges,

     without  limitation,  unpaid  attorneys' fees and expenses  incurred by the
     Lender  in  connection   with  the  collection   and   enforcement  of  the
     Indebtedness.  The Obligors each  acknowledge and agree that interest shall
     continue to accrue on the unpaid  principal  balance of the Indebtedness at
     either the  Financing  Documents  Default  Rate or the  Forbearance  Rates,
     pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Financing Documents.

     (b) Each of the Obligors is a corporation duly organized, validly existing,
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and
each has the corporate  power to own its properties and to carry on its business
as now being conducted, and each is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each  jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or

qualification necessary.

     (c) Each of the Obligors has full  corporate  power and  authority to enter
into this  Agreement  and to incur and perform  all  obligations  and  covenants

Indebtedness  pursuant to the Existing  Defaults.  The Obligors each acknowledge
and agree that the Existing  Defaults  constitute  material  defaults  under the
Financing Documents and that the Existing Defaults have not been, are not hereby
and shall not be deemed,  waived by the Lender,  expressly,  impliedly,  through
course of conduct  or  otherwise.  The  agreement  of the Lender to refrain  and
forbear  from  exercising  any rights  and  remedies  by reason of any  existing
default or any future  default shall not  constitute a waiver of, consent to, or
condoning of, any existing or future default.

     (e) All understandings,  representations, warranties and recitals contained
or expressed in this Agreement,  the Financing Agreement, the Notes, the Deed of
Trust,  the  Guaranty  and the other  Financing  Documents  are and remain true,
accurate,  complete  and correct in all  respects;  and, no such  understanding,
representation,  warranty  or  recital  fails or  omits  to  state or  otherwise
disclose  any   material   fact  or   information   necessary  to  prevent  such
understanding,  representation,  warranty or recital from being misleading.  The
Obligors acknowledge and agree that the Lender has been induced in part to enter

accuracy,  and completeness of all understandings,  representations,  warranties
and recitals contained in this Agreement,  the Financing  Agreement,  the Notes,
the Deed of Trust, the Guaranty and the other Financing Documents.  The recitals
are deemed to be part of this  Agreement.  There is no fact known to any Obligor
or which should be known to any Obligor which the Obligors have not disclosed to
the Lender in writing on or prior to the date of this  Agreement  which would or
could materially and adversely affect the understandings of the Lender expressed
in this Agreement or any  representation,  warranty or recital contained in this
Agreement,  the Financing Agreement,  the Notes, the Deed of Trust, the Guaranty
and the other Financing Documents. The Obligors hereby issue, ratify and confirm
the  representations,  warranties  and  covenants  contained  in  the  Financing
Agreement,  the Notes,  the Deed of Trust,  the Guaranty and the other Financing
Documents,  as amended  hereby.  The Borrower  agrees that this Agreement is not
intended  to and shall not cause a  novation  with  respect to any or all of the
obligations contained in the Financing Agreement,  the Notes, the Deed of Trust,
the Guaranty and the other Financing Documents.

     (f) Each of the  Financing  Documents  continues  in full  force and effect
notwithstanding  the  execution  and  delivery  of this  Agreement.  Each of the
Obligors hereby reissues,  ratifies and confirms the enforceability and validity
of all Financing  Documents to which it is a party and agree that this Agreement
and each of the  Financing  Documents  constitute  the legal,  valid and binding
obligations of each of the Obligors to the extent such Obligor is party thereto,
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. In addition, the Obligors
each  acknowledge  and agree that  neither the  execution  and  delivery of this
Agreement nor any of the terms, provisions, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement shall in any manner release,  impair,  lessen,  modify,  waive or
otherwise  affect the liability and  obligations of the Obligors under the terms
of the Financing  Documents.  The Obligors  acknowledge and confirm the Lender's
duly perfected  first priority  security  interest to and against the Collateral
and the Lender's rights and first priority  security interest as to the Property
pursuant to the Deed of Trust and financing statements.

     (g) The  Lender  has  acted in good  faith  and has  conducted  itself in a
commercially reasonable manner in its relationships with each of the Obligors in
connection  with  this  Agreement  and  in  connection   with  the  Loans,   the
Indebtedness and the Financing  Documents,  the Obligors each hereby waiving and
releasing any claims to the contrary. The Obligors have no defenses, affirmative
or otherwise,  rights of setoff,  rights of recoupment,  claims,  counterclaims,
actions or causes of action of any kind or nature whatsoever  against the Lender
or  any  past,  present  or  future  agent,   attorney,   legal  representative,
predecessor in interest,  affiliate,  successor,  assign, employee,  director or
officer  of  the  Lender  (collectively,   the  "Lender  Group"),   directly  or
indirectly,  arising out of, based upon, or in any manner  connected  with,  any
transaction,  event, circumstance,  action, failure to act, or occurrence of any
sort or type,  whether known or unknown,  which  occurred,  existed,  was taken,
permitted,  or begun prior to the  execution  of this  Agreement  and  occurred,
existed,  was taken,  permitted or begun in accordance with,  pursuant to, or by
virtue of the  Indebtedness  or any of the terms or  conditions of the Financing
Documents,  or which directly or indirectly  relate to or arise out of or in any
manner are connected with the Indebtedness or any of the Financing Documents; to
the extent any such defenses, affirmative or otherwise, rights of setoff, rights
of  recoupment,  claims,  counterclaims,  actions  or causes of action  exist or
existed, such defenses,  rights,  claims,  counterclaims,  actions and causes of
action are hereby forever waived,  discharged and released.  The Obligors hereby
acknowledge  and agree that the execution of this  Agreement by the Lender shall
not constitute an  acknowledgment of or admission by the Lender or any member of
the Lender Group of the  existence of any claims or of liability  for any matter
or  precedent  upon which any claim or liability  may be asserted.  The Obligors
further  acknowledge  and agree  that,  to the extent any such claims may exist,
they are of a  speculative  nature so as to be incapable of objective  valuation
and that,  in any event,  the value to each of the Obligors of the covenants and
obligations of the Lender  contained in this  Agreement and the other  documents
executed and  delivered in  connection  with this  Agreement  substantially  and
materially  exceeds  any and all value of any kind or nature  whatsoever  of any
such claims.  The Obligors  further  acknowledge and agree that Lender is not in
any way responsible or liable for the previous,  current or future  condition or
deterioration of the business  operations  and/or financial  condition of any of
the Obligors and that the Lender has not breached any agreement or commitment to
loan money or otherwise make financial  accommodations available to the Borrower
or to fund any operations of the Borrower at any time.

Group from and of any and all claims that the Lender or any of the Lender  Group
is in any  way  responsible  for  the  past,  current  or  future  condition  or
deterioration of the business  operations  and/or financial  condition of any of
the  Obligors,  and from and of any and all claims that the Lender or any of the
Lender  Group  breached  any  agreement  to loan money or make  other  financial
accommodations  available  to the  Borrower  or to fund  any  operations  of the
Borrower at any time.  The Obligors each further  hereby  jointly and severally,
knowingly and voluntarily  forever release,  acquit and discharge the Lender and
the  Lender  Group,  from  and of any and all  other  claims,  damages,  losses,
actions, counterclaims,  suits, judgments, obligations,  liabilities,  defenses,
affirmative defenses,  setoffs, and demands of any kind or nature whatsoever, in
law or in equity,  whether  presently known or unknown,  which any or all of the
Obligors may have had, now have, or which they can, shall or may have for, upon,
or by reason of any matter,  course or thing whatsoever relating to, arising out
of,  based  upon,  or in any manner  connected  with,  any  transaction,  event,
circumstance, action, failure to act, or occurrence of any sort or type, whether
known or unknown,  which  occurred,  existed,  was taken,  permitted,  begun, or
otherwise related or connected to or with any or all of the  Indebtedness,  this
Agreement, any or all of the Financing Documents,  and/or any direct or indirect
action or omission of the Lender  and/or any of the Lender  Group.  The Obligors
further  agree that from and after the date hereof,  they will not assert to any
person or entity that any deterioration of the business  operations or financial
condition of any of the Obligors was caused by any breach or wrongful act of the
Lender  or any of the  Lender  Group.  (k) If the  Guarantor  is or  becomes  an
"insider"  as  defined  from time to time in Section  101 of the  United  States
Bankruptcy Code,  U.S.C.  Title 11 (the  "Bankruptcy  Code") with respect to any
other Obligor,  then each such Guarantor  irrevocably and absolutely  waives any
and all rights of subrogation, contribution,  indemnification,  reimbursement or
any similar right against such Obligor in connection with the  Indebtedness  and
the transactions contemplated herein, whether such rights arise under an express
or implied  contract  or by  operation  of law,  it being the  intention  of the
parties  that the  Guarantor  shall not be deemed a  "creditor",  as  defined in
Section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code, of any Obligor in the event any such Obligor
becomes a debtor in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code.

     (b) If any recital, representation or warranty made herein, in any document
executed and delivered in connection  herewith,  or in any report,  certificate,
financial statement or other instrument or document previously, now or hereafter
furnished  by or on  behalf  of any of the  Obligors  in  connection  with  this
Agreement or any other document  executed and delivered in connection  with this
Agreement,  shall  prove to have been false,  incomplete  or  misleading  in any
respect on the date as of which it was made.

     (c) The occurrence of a default under any of the Financing  Documents other

     (d) If any of the Obligors commences, institutes or otherwise intervenes in

the Lender  shall have the right to exercise  and enforce any and all rights and
remedies  available  to the  Lender  under  this  Agreement,  under  any and all
documents  executed and delivered in connection with this  Agreement,  under any
and all Financing  Documents,  and under  applicable  laws to the same extent as
though this Agreement had never been  executed,  without regard to any notice or
cure period  contained  in any of the  foregoing or  otherwise  available  under
applicable  laws.  All rights and  remedies  available  to the Lender under this
Agreement,  under any documents  executed and delivered in connection  with this
Agreement,  under any and all of the Financing  Documents,  and under applicable
laws,  may be asserted,  enforced and exercised  concurrently,  cumulatively  or

Indebtedness have been indefeasibly paid in full.

     14. Expenses.  The Lender shall be entitled to obtain at the expense of the
Obligors,  such  appraisals,  reports,  record  searches,  and  legal  and other
opinions  and  advice as the Lender  may from time to time deem  necessary  with
respect to any or all of Obligors  and/or any or all collateral and security now
or hereafter  securing any of the  Indebtedness.  The Obligors agree jointly and
severally to pay all costs,  fees and expenses of the Lender in connection  with
the preparation,  execution and delivery of this Agreement and any and all other
documents executed and delivered in connection with this Agreement and all other
costs, fees and expenses,  incurred by, or on behalf of the Lender in connection
with the enforcement,  preservation,  or collection of the  Indebtedness  and/or
this Agreement, including, without limitation,  attorneys fees and expenses, and

AND POWER MAY BE EXERCISED ON ONE OR MORE  OCCASIONS  FROM TIME TO TIME,  IN THE

     16.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  THE  OBLIGORS  AND THE LENDER EACH HEREBY WAIVE

THIS  AGREEMENT,  (B) ANY OF THE DOCUMENTS  EXECUTED AND DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT,  (C) ANY OF THE INDEBTEDNESS,  AND (D) ANY OF THE FINANCING

TRIAL BY JURY OF ALL CLAIMS AGAINST ALL PARTIES TO SUCH ACTIONS OR  PROCEEDINGS,
INCLUDING CLAIMS AGAINST PARTIES WHO ARE NOT PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT.

NULLIFY  ITS  EFFECT.  THE  OBLIGORS  FURTHER  REPRESENT  THAT  THEY  HAVE  BEEN
REPRESENTED IN THE SIGNING OF THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE MAKING OF THIS WAIVER BY
INDEPENDENT  LEGAL COUNSEL,  SELECTED OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL, AND THAT THEY HAVE

     17. RELIEF FROM THE AUTOMATIC  STAY. THE BORROWER HEREBY  ACKNOWLEDGES  AND
AGREES  THAT THE  LENDER HAS  AGREED TO ENTER  INTO THIS  AGREEMENT  IN ORDER TO
PERMIT THE BORROWER AN  OPPORTUNITY TO REPAY AND SATISFY THE  INDEBTEDNESS  IN A
MUTUALLY  ACCEPTABLE,  CONSENSUAL  MANNER,  RATHER  THAN  THROUGH  THE  LENDER'S
EXERCISE  AND  ENFORCEMENT  OF ITS  RIGHTS  AND  REMEDIES  UNDER  THE  FINANCING
AGREEMENT,  THE FINANCING  DOCUMENTS AND APPLICABLE  LAWS. THE BORROWER  FURTHER
ACKNOWLEDGES  AND AGREES  THAT  BECAUSE OF THE  EXISTING  DEFAULTS  UNDER AND IN
CONNECTION  WITH THE  INDEBTEDNESS,  THE LENDER  WOULD  OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED TO
EXERCISE  IMMEDIATELY ANY AND ALL SUCH RIGHTS AND REMEDIES IF THE LENDER DID NOT
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.  THE BORROWER  FURTHER  ACKNOWLEDGES  AND AGREES THAT
ALTHOUGH THE LENDER'S  INTEREST IN ITS  COLLATERAL AND SECURITY IS NOT PRESENTLY
BEING  ADEQUATELY  PROTECTED,  THE  LENDER  HAS BEEN  INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT  IN  RELIANCE  UPON THE  UNDERSTANDING  THAT IN THE EVENT  THE  LENDER
EXERCISES ANY OF ITS RIGHTS OR REMEDIES UNDER THE FINANCING AGREEMENT AND/OR ANY
OR ALL OF THE  FINANCING  DOCUMENTS  AND/OR UNDER ANY  APPLICABLE  LAWS UPON THE
OCCURRENCE OF A FORBEARANCE DEFAULT, THE BORROWER WILL COOPERATE WITH THE LENDER
IN THE  LENDER'S  EFFORTS  TO  EXERCISE  ANY AND ALL SUCH  RIGHTS  AND  REMEDIES
AVAILABLE TO THE LENDER.  ACCORDINGLY,  IF THE BORROWER BECOMES THE SUBJECT OF A
BANKRUPTCY  CASE, THE BORROWER  CONSENTS TO ALLOW THE LENDER TO EXERCISE ANY AND
ALL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES  AVAILABLE TO THE LENDER WITH RESPECT TO ITS  COLLATERAL
AND SECURITY.  THE BORROWER  HEREBY CONSENTS TO ANY MOTION FILED BY OR ON BEHALF
OF THE LENDER FOR RELIEF FROM THE AUTOMATIC STAY UNDER SECTION 362 OF THE UNITED
STATES BANKRUPTCY CODE. THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY  AUTHORIZES AND EMPOWERS
THE LENDER TO FILE THIS CONSENT WITH THE  BANKRUPTCY  COURT  PRESIDING  OVER ANY
SUCH BANKRUPTCY CASE OF THE BORROWER,  AND FURTHER AGREES NOT TO OPPOSE ANY SUCH
MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM THE  AUTOMATIC  STAY FILED BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE LENDER.
FINALLY, THE BORROWER CONSENTS AND AGREES THAT NONE OF THE COLLATERAL (INCLUDING
ANY  CASH OR  NON-CASH  PROCEEDS  THEREOF)  MAY BE USED  TO PAY  ANY  ACTUAL  OR
ESTIMATED  FEES  INCURRED BY OR ESTIMATED  TO BE INCURRED BY THE  BORROWER  WITH
RESPECT TO ANY FILED OR PROPOSED  BANKRUPTCY  CASE IN WHICH THE  BORROWER IS THE
SUBJECT.
