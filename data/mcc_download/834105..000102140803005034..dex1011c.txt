                                   ADDENDUM TO
                                THE COLUMBIA BANK
                           DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

This Addendum authorized by the Board of Directors of The Columbia Bank pursuant
to Section 9.1 of The Columbia Bank Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), is
effective January 1, 2003.

     Section 4.4 of the Plan is hereby amended as follows with respect to the
calculation of (Executive's) benefit under the Plan:

               Section 4.4 Payments After Death. If the Participant dies while
          in the active service of the Company or an Affiliate, the Company
          shall pay to the Participant's beneficiary a benefit equal to the
          greater of (A) the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account balance
          at the date of death and (B) the lesser of (i) $1,505,000, (ii) a sum
          equal to five (5) times the sum of the Participant's annual base
          salary at the date of death (or, if higher, annual base salary for the
          calendar year in which the Participant received the highest annual
          base salary) plus the average of the bonuses paid to the Participant
          over the three years ending with the date of death (including years in
          which no bonus was awarded), or, if base salary is not determined at
          date of death and is instead determined as the annual base salary for
          the calendar year in which the Participant received the highest annual
          base salary, the average of the bonuses paid to the Participant for
          such calendar year and for the two previous calendar years (including
          years in which no bonus was awarded), or (iii) the projected benefit
          that would have been payable under this Plan upon the Participant's
          attainment of age sixty-five (65) based on the Participant's Deferred
          Compensation Account balance at the date of death and the assumption
          (a) that deferrals, and Company Matching Contributions thereon, would
          continue until the Participant's attainment of age sixty-five (65) at
          the rate in effect at the Participant's death and (b) that earnings
          would be credited on the Participant's Accounts until the
          Participant's attainment of age sixty-five (65) at The Columbia Bank's
          prime rate as of December 15 of the year preceding the Participant's
          death. If the Participant dies while not in the active service of the
          Company or an Affiliate and death occurs within twenty-four (24)
          months after the date of a termination or resignation described in
          paragraph 5.2(a) of the Participant's Employment Agreement with the
          Company dated as of February 26, 1996, as amended by First Amendment
          effective December 16, 1997 and Second Amendment effective April 30,
          2002, or within twelve (12) months after the date of a resignation
          described in paragraph 5.2(b) of such Employment Agreement, (in either
          case regardless of any termination of such Employment Agreement) the
          Company shall pay to the Participant's beneficiary a benefit equal to
          the greater of the amount described in (A) above or the amount
          described in (B) above, provided that the amount described in B(iii)
          above shall be calculated using the Participant's Deferred
          Compensation Account balance at the date of the

          Participant's termination or resignation or the Deferred Compensation
          Account balance at the date of the Participant's death. The Company
          shall pay the benefit to the Beneficiary in the same form as it would
          have been paid to the Participant had the Participant's Termination
          occurred on the date of death, commencing on the first day of the
          month following the Participant's death. If the Participant dies after
          benefit payments have commenced under this Plan but before receiving
          all such payments, the Company shall pay the remaining benefits to the
          Participant's Beneficiary at the same time and in the same amounts
          they would have been paid to the Participant had the Participant
          survived.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has duly executed this Addendum to evidence
its assumption to the obligations thereunder.
