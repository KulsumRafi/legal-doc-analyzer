required to assign and transfer the following are obtained, Sellers shall assign
and transfer to Buyers all of Sellers' right, title and interest in and to, and
Buyers shall take assignment of all of the following: (a) all of the remaining
Contracts related to the Business to which one or more Sellers is a party,
excluding Contracts that comprise Excluded Assets, but including all of the
remaining Contracts with customers of the Business (collectively, with the First
Stage Customer Contracts, the "Customer Contracts") and all of the other
remaining Contracts listed on Schedule

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

2.2 (collectively, including the Customer Contracts, with the First Stage
Purchased Contracts, the "Purchased Contracts"); (b) all of the remaining
Permits of Sellers related to the Business set forth on Schedule 2.2 which are
transferable, excluding Permits that comprise Excluded Assets, but including the
remaining Permits listed on Schedule 2.2 (collectively, with the First Stage
Purchased Permits, the "Purchased Permits"; and together with the Purchased
Contracts, the "Purchased Contracts and Permits"); and (c) the remaining
Communications Licenses of Sellers related to the Business that are
transferable, excluding Communications Licenses that comprise Excluded Assets
(collectively, with the "First Stage Transferred Communications Licenses", the
"Transferred Communications Licenses").

          2.3  Excluded Assets

     Notwithstanding Sections 2.1 and 2.2, Sellers shall not sell or transfer,
assign, convey or deliver, and Buyers shall not assume or acquire any interest
in, any Assets, Contracts, Permits or Communications Licenses that are listed on
Schedule 2.3 (the "Excluded Assets").

          2.4  Purchase Price

               (a)  (i)   On or before fifteen (15) days before the First Stage
Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver to Buyers a statement (the "Preliminary
Working Capital Statement"), setting forth the Working Capital as of the close
of business on the last day of the immediately preceding month. The Preliminary
Working Capital Statement shall be prepared by the Sellers in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

                    (ii)  During the ten (10) day period following Buyers'
     receipt of the Preliminary Working Capital Statement, Sellers shall provide
     access to the Business Records and Business Employees and provide Buyers'
     independent accountants with such access, upon reasonable prior notice and
     during normal business hours, to the work papers of Sellers as is
     reasonably necessary to verify the calculation of the Working Capital. The
     Preliminary Working Capital Statement shall be final and shall be accepted
     by and be binding on the parties on the tenth (10th) day following delivery
     thereof unless Buyers give written notice to Sellers of its disagreement
     with the Preliminary Working Capital Statement (such notice, a "Preliminary
     Disagreement Notice") prior to such date. Any Preliminary Disagreement
     Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so
     asserted. If a Preliminary Disagreement Notice is received by Sellers on or
     prior to such date, then the Preliminary Working Capital Statement (as
     revised in accordance with clause (iii) below) shall become final and
     binding upon each Seller and each Buyer on the date Sellers and Buyers
     resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters
     specified in such Preliminary Disagreement Notice.

                    (iii) During the two (2) day period following delivery of a
     Preliminary Disagreement Notice, Sellers and Buyers shall seek in good
     faith to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with
     respect to the matters set forth in such Preliminary Disagreement Notice.
     If any disagreement included in the Preliminary Disagreement Notice is not
     resolved in writing within such two (2) day period, the amount of the
     Working Capital shall be equal to the amount that was not the subject of
     the Preliminary Disagreement Notice plus any additional amount that Sellers
     and Buyers

                                      -16-

<PAGE>

     have mutually agreed upon (as set forth in the Preliminary Working Capital
     Statement and adjusted, if necessary pursuant to this Section 2.4(a), the
     "Preliminary Working Capital").

               (b)  In consideration of the sale, transfer, assignment,
conveyance and delivery by Sellers of the Business and the Acquired Assets,
Buyers shall (i) (A) pay Ninety-Two Million Four Hundred Forty Thousand U.S.
Dollars ($92,440,000) in cash to Sellers at the First Stage Closing Date which
amount shall be either (1) increased by an amount, if any, by which the
Preliminary Working Capital is greater than $0 or (2) reduced by an amount, if
any, by which Preliminary Working Capital is less than $0 (the amount in the
preceding clause (1) or clause (2), whichever is applicable, the "Preliminary
Adjustment Amount"), (B) place the Escrow Amount (Second Stage Closing) in an
interest bearing escrow account in which it will be held pursuant to the terms
of the Escrow Agreement (Second Stage Closing) to support Buyers' obligation to
pay the amount Buyers' are obligated to pay at the Second Stage Closing, (C)
place the Escrow Amount (Working Capital/Indemnity) in an interest bearing
escrow account in which it will be held pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement (Working Capital/Indemnity) to support Sellers' obligations to pay any
amount required to be paid by Sellers under Section 2.4(g) regarding the
difference between Closing Working Capital and Preliminary Working Capital and
Sellers' indemnification obligations in accordance with Article 8, (D) place the
Escrow Amount (Cranberry Adjustment) in an interest bearing account in which it
will be held pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement (Cranberry
Adjustment) to support Sellers' obligation to pay amounts, if any, required to
be paid by Sellers under Section 2.4(g) regarding the Cranberry Plan Adjustment
Amount, and (E) place the Escrow Amount (Closing Adjustment Receivables) in an
interest bearing account in which it will be held pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement (Closing Adjustment Receivables) to support Sellers' obligation
to pay amounts, if any, required to be paid by Sellers under Section 2.4(h) and
(ii) assume the First Stage Assumed Liabilities. The amount in Section
2.4(b)(i)(A), as adjusted by the Preliminary Adjustment Amount plus the Escrow
Amount (Working Capital/Indemnity), the Escrow Amount (Cranberry Adjustment) and
the Escrow Amount (Closing Adjustment Receivables) (the three such escrow
amounts in the preceding clauses (C), (D) and (E) referred to herein
collectively as the "Total Escrow Amount") constitutes the "Initial Purchase
Price".

               (c)  All payments of the Purchase Price, except for the Total
Escrow Amount, shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to
an account designated by Sellers in written instructions to be delivered to
Buyers on or prior to the payment date.

               (d)  Within thirty (30) days after the First Stage Closing Date,
Sellers shall deliver to Buyers a statement (the "Closing Working Capital
Statement"), setting forth the Working Capital as of the close of business on
the First Stage Closing Date (the "Closing Working Capital") and a Cranberry
Plan Adjustment Statement (the "Cranberry Plan Adjustment Statement") setting
forth the Cranberry Plan Adjustment Amount. The Closing Working Capital
Statement and the Cranberry Plan Adjustment Statement shall be referred
collectively to as the "Adjustment Statements". The Adjustment Statements shall
be prepared by the Sellers, and the Sellers' independent accountants shall
provide an attestation thereof, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
The Cranberry Plan Adjustment Statement shall apply the principles

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

and will be calculated consistently with the model Cranberry Plan Adjustment
Statements attached as Annex I to Exhibit A hereto.

               (e)  During the thirty (30) day period following Buyers' receipt
of the Adjustment Statements, Sellers shall provide access to the Business
Records and Business Employees and shall cause Sellers' independent accountants
to provide Buyers' independent accountants with such access, upon reasonable
prior notice and during normal business hours, to the work papers of Sellers'
independent accountants as is reasonably necessary to verify the calculation of
the Closing Working Capital and the Cranberry Plan Adjustment Amount. The
Adjustment Statements shall be final and shall be accepted by and be binding on
the parties on the thirtieth (30th) day following delivery thereof unless Buyers
give written notice to Sellers of their disagreement with the Adjustment
Statements (such notice, a "Closing Disagreement Notice") prior to such date.
Any Closing Disagreement Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of
any disagreement so asserted. If a Closing Disagreement Notice is received by
Sellers on or prior to such date, then the Adjustment Statements (as revised in
accordance with Section 2.4(f)) shall become final and binding upon each Seller
and each Buyer, on the earlier of (1) the date Sellers and Buyers resolve in
writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in such
Closing Disagreement Notice and (2) the date that a nationally or regionally
recognized independent accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Sellers and
Buyers (the "Accounting Firm") delivers to the Sellers and Buyers its written
determination of all disputed matters submitted to it pursuant to Section 2.4(f)
(the "Accounting Firm Determination").

               (f)  During the thirty (30) day period following delivery of a
Closing Disagreement Notice, Sellers and Buyers shall seek in good faith to
resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect to the
matters set forth in such Closing Disagreement Notice. If any disagreement
included in the Closing Disagreement Notice is not resolved in writing within
such thirty (30) day period, Sellers and Buyers shall submit to the Accounting
Firm for review and determination of any and all matters which remain in
dispute. The scope of the Accounting Firm's review shall be limited to only
those matters which have not been resolved in writing within such thirty (30)
day period. Sellers and Buyers shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the
Accounting Firm to deliver the Accounting Firm Determination within thirty (30)
days of the receipt of such submission. Sellers and Buyers agree that the
Accounting Firm Determination shall be final and binding on the parties and that
judgment may be entered upon the Accounting Firm Determination in any court
having jurisdiction over the party against which such Determination is to be
enforced. The Accounting Firm Determination shall be accompanied by a
certificate of the Accounting Firm that it reached the Accounting Firm
Determination in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.4. The cost
incurred in connection with the Accounting Firm Determination (including the
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and of any enforcement of the
Accounting Firm Determination) pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be borne by
Buyers and Sellers in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved
by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an
aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute
and shall be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the Accounting Firm
Determination is rendered on the merits of the matter submitted.

               (g)  The Initial Purchase Price shall be (i) increased by the
amount, if any, by which the Closing Working Capital, as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.4, exceeds the Preliminary Working Capital, and (ii)
decreased by (x) the amount of any Cranberry Plan Adjustment Amount, as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.4, and (y) the amount, if any, by which
the Closing Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.4,
is less than the Preliminary Working Capital (the Initial Purchase Price as so
increased or decreased shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Adjusted CWC
Purchase Price"). Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Working
Capital and the Cranberry Plan Adjustment Amount have been finally determined in
accordance with this Section 2.4, (I) if the Closing Working Capital is in
excess of the Preliminary Working Capital, Buyers shall pay to Sellers an amount
equal to such excess, together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal
to the rate of interest from time to time publicly announced by Citibank, N.A.,
in its New York office as its prime or base rate (the "Prime Rate"), calculated
on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over 365 from the date of
delivery of the Closing Working Capital Statement pursuant to Section 2.4(d) to
the date of payment, (II) if the Closing Working Capital is less than the
Preliminary Working Capital, Buyers shall receive from the Escrow Amount
(Working Capital/Indemnity) pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (Working
Capital/Indemnity), and from Sellers to the extent such Escrow Amount (Working
Capital/Indemnity) is insufficient, an amount equal to such deficit, together
with interest thereon at the Prime Rate, calculated on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over 365 from the date of delivery of the Closing Working
Capital Statement pursuant to Section 2.4(d) to the date of payment and (III) if
there is a Cranberry Plan Adjustment Amount owing from Sellers to Buyers, Buyers
shall receive from the Escrow Amount (Cranberry Adjustment) pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement (Cranberry Adjustment) and, to the extent the Escrow Amount
(Cranberry Adjustment) is insufficient, at Buyers' election, from Sellers or
from any remaining Escrow Amount (Working Capital/Indemnity), an amount equal to
the Cranberry Plan Adjustment Amount, together with interest thereon calculated
as set forth in the preceding clause; and any remaining funds in the Escrow
Amount (Cranberry Adjustment) shall be returned to Sellers pursuant to the terms
of the Escrow Agreement (Cranberry Adjustment). Payments in respect of this
Section 2.4 shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an
account that is designated by the party entitled to payment at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the date of payment.

               (h)  (i) Within one-hundred twenty (120) days after the First
Stage Closing, Buyers shall provide to Sellers a statement showing all of the
Adjustment Receivables that were included in Current Assets or Current
Liabilities on the Closing Working Capital Statement (collectively, the "Closing
Adjustment Receivables"), and stating the amount of the Closing Adjustment
Receivables that have been collected by Buyers and by Sellers (and remitted to
and received by Buyers, or credits have been issued to Buyers) as of ninety (90)
days after the First Stage Closing Date (collectively, the "Collected Closing
Adjustment Receivables I"). Buyers shall collect the Closing Adjustment
Receivables in the ordinary course of business and according to the past
practices of the Business. Buyers shall deliver monthly financial information
detailing the collections (and any dispute credits issued) described herein.

                          a.  In the event the Closing Adjustment Receivables
are in excess of the Collected Closing Adjustment Receivables I and such excess
is less than the

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

Escrow Amount (Closing Adjustment Receivables), Seller shall not at that time be
obligated to pay to Buyers the amount of such excess.

                          b.  In the event there is an excess of Closing
Adjustment Receivables over the Collected Closing Adjustment Receivables I and
such excess is also in excess of the Escrow Amount (Closing Adjustment
Receivables), Sellers shall pay to Buyers an amount of the excess of the Closing
Adjustment Receivables over the Collected Closing Adjustment Receivables I (up
to the maximum amount of the Closing Adjustment Receivables Pool), within five
(5) Business Days. In the event Sellers do not make such payment, Buyers shall
be entitled to withdraw such payment from the Escrow Amount (Closing Adjustment
Receivables), and Sellers shall continue to be liable for the amount, if any, of
such required payment in excess of the Escrow Amount (Closing Adjustment
Receivables), as well as interest on the amount of the Escrow Amount (Closing
Adjustment Receivables) so withdrawn and any such excess at the Prime Rate.

     (ii) Within one-hundred eighty (180) days after the First Stage Closing,
Buyers shall provide to Sellers a statement showing all of the Closing
Adjustment Receivables, and stating the amount of the Closing Adjustment
Receivables that have been collected by Buyers and by Sellers (and remitted to
and received by Buyers) as of one-hundred fifty (150) days after the First Stage
Closing Date (collectively, the "Collected Closing Adjustment Receivables II").
In the event the Closing Adjustment Receivables are in excess of the Collected
Closing Adjustment Receivables II, Sellers and Buyers shall effect a true-up
that results in the receipt by Buyers, in the aggregate, pursuant to Section
2.4(h)(i) and (ii) of an amount equal to such excess (up to the maximum amount
of the Closing Adjustment Receivables Pool) plus any interest payable by Sellers
under Section 2.4(h)(i)(b), (x) with any additional amount that is to be paid by
Sellers to Buyers to come first from the Escrow Amount (Closing Adjustment
Receivables) and, to the extent the Escrow Amount (Closing Adjustment
Receivables) is insufficient, then from the Sellers, in each case within five
(5) Business Days and (y) any repayment to be made by Buyers to Sellers to be
within five (5) Business Days (it being understood and agreed that any such
repayment shall not exceed the payment received by Buyers under Section
2.4(h)(i)(b)).

     (iii) Illustrations of the operation at this Section 2.4(h) are shown in
Schedule 2.4(h)(iii).

               (i)   The term "Working Capital" shall mean Current Assets minus
Current Liabilities. The term "Current Assets" means, with respect to the
Business, Receivables less reserves and allowances for Receivables determined in
accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as consistently applied
with historical methods, inventory, materials and supplies and prepaid expenses
which accrue or will accrue to the benefit of Buyers, vendor and real estate
deposits and costs incurred and not billed related to reimbursable projects for
Governmental Bodies, and the term "Current Liabilities" means accounts
payable-trade, accrued cost of service, accrued liabilities, short and long term
capital lease liabilities, advance billings and customer deposits, accrued
vacation liability as required in Section 5.4(f) and minority interest, in each
case with respect to the Business and calculated in accordance with the
principles applied in calculating the Working Capital for the Business as of
December 31, 2002, attached hereto as Schedule 2.4(i) and with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (except as otherwise provided on Schedule
2.4(i)). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Working
Capital shall not include any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities.

               (j)  At the Second Stage Closing, the Escrow Amount (Second Stage
Closing) shall be released to Sellers pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (Second
Stage Closing) and the sum of the Adjusted CWC Purchase Price and such Escrow
Amount shall constitute the "Purchase Price".

          2.5  Assumed Liabilities

               (a)  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions in this
Agreement, at and as of the First Stage Closing Date, Sellers shall assign, and
Buyers shall assume and agree to honor, pay and discharge when due, all of the
following liabilities and obligations of Sellers: (i) the obligations under the
First Stage Purchased Contracts, First Stage Purchased Permits and the First
Stage Transferred Communications Licenses, to the extent arising out of, or
resulting from, facts, events and circumstances occurring, or which accrue,
after the First Stage Closing Date (other than due to any failure to comply or
breach of any of Sellers or any of their Affiliates, whether before, on or after
the First Stage Closing Date); (ii) all liabilities reflected on the balance
sheet of the Business on the First Stage Closing Date that are included as
Current Liabilities in the calculation of Working Capital; provided that to the
extent Sellers fail to make any payment provided for in Section 2.4(g)(II) the
amount equal to the amount of any such deficiency shall not be assumed by Buyers
as an Assumed Liability; (iii) all Circuit Commitments to the extent arising out
of, or resulting from, facts, events and circumstances occurring, or which
accrue, after the First Stage Closing Date (other than due to any failure to
comply or breach of any of Sellers or any of their Affiliates, whether before,
on or after the First Stage Closing Date); and (iv) those liabilities and
obligations listed on Schedule 2.5(a), in each case except any Excluded
Liabilities (collectively, the "First Stage Assumed Liabilities"); provided,
that with respect to First Stage Purchased Contracts, First Stage Purchased
Permits and First Stage Transferred Communications Licenses that are conveyed
pursuant to the last sentence of Section 2.2(a), such items will constitute
First Stage Assumed Liabilities as of the applicable conveyance date(s).

               (b)  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions in this
Agreement, at and as of (a) the Second Stage Closing Date, Sellers shall assign,
and Buyers shall assume and agree to honor, pay and discharge when due, all of
the following liabilities and obligations of Sellers: the obligations under the
Second Stage Purchased Contracts, Second Stage Purchased Permits and the Second
Stage Transferred Communications Licenses, to the extent arising out of, or
resulting from, facts, events and circumstances occurring, or which accrue,
after the Second Stage Closing Date (other than due to any failure to comply or
breach of any of Sellers or any of their Affiliates, whether before, on or after
the Second Stage Closing Date), in each case except any Excluded Liabilities
(collectively, the "Second Stage Assumed Liabilities" and, collectively with the
First Stage Assumed Liabilities, the "Assumed Liabilities").

               (c)  The Assumed Liabilities shall not include any liabilities or
obligations of Sellers which are not described in Sections 2.5(a) and (b),
including without limitation those liabilities and obligations that are listed
on Schedule 2.5(c) (the "Excluded Liabilities"), it being understood that the
Second Stage Assumed Liabilities shall constitute Excluded Liabilities until the
occurrence of the Second Stage Closing.

          2.6  No Offset

     Except for the determinations of Purchase Price set forth in Section 2.4,
Buyers' and Sellers' obligations under Sections 2.4 and 2.5 shall not be subject
to offset or reduction for any reason, including by reason of any actual or
alleged breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement or any of the Collateral Agreements or any right or alleged right to
indemnification hereunder or thereunder.

          2.7  Further Assurances; Further Conveyances and Assumptions; Consent
of Third Parties

               (a)  Subject to the specific terms and conditions hereof, Sellers
and Buyers agree to use reasonable best efforts to take all actions and to do
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Sellers will from time to time subsequent to the applicable
Staged Closing Date, at Buyers' request and assistance as necessary, execute and
deliver such other instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer and take
such other actions as Buyers may reasonably request in order more effectively to
convey, assign, transfer to and vest in Buyers the Acquired Assets, subject to
any restrictions under applicable Law. Buyers and Sellers will work together
from the date of this Agreement to and following the applicable Staged Closing
Date to transfer electronic data and records and accounting and personnel
information related to the Business and similar information that are being
transferred in connection with the Business and the Acquired Assets. Buyers will
from time to time subsequent to the applicable Staged Closing Dates, at Sellers'
request, execute and deliver such other instruments of conveyance, assignment
and transfer and take such other actions as Sellers may reasonably request in
order more effectively to accomplish the assumption of the related Assumed
Liabilities.

               (b)  Anything in this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements to
the contrary notwithstanding, neither this Agreement nor the Collateral
Agreements shall constitute an attempt or agreement to sell, assign, sublease,
sublicense or assume any Acquired Asset, including without limitation, any
Contract, Permit or Communications License or Business Record or any claim or
right or any benefit or obligation thereunder or resulting therefrom, if a sale,
assignment, sublease, sublicense or assumption thereof would violate any Law or
Order or, without the Consent of a Third Party thereto or a Governmental Body,
would constitute a breach or violation of such Acquired Asset and if such a
Consent is not obtained at or prior to the applicable Staged Closing Date.
(Notwithstanding the prior sentence, Sellers' representations and warranties,
covenants and agreements regarding Acquired Assets shall include any Assets
(other than Excluded Assets), Contracts or Permits or Communications Licenses
that would constitute Acquired Assets but for the fact that a Consent is
required to sell, assign, sublease, sublicense, or assume such Assets, Contracts
or Permits or Communications Licenses.) Sellers shall use reasonable best
efforts, and Buyers shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers, to obtain such
prior Consents and to resolve the impediments to the sale, assignment, sublease,
sublicense or assumption required by this Agreement or the Collateral
Agreements; provided, that Sellers shall not be required to pay any fees or make
any other concessions to any Person in order to obtain any Consents other than
those listed on Schedule 3.3(b) in response to Sections 3.3(b)(ii) and (iii). In
the event any such Consents are not obtained on or prior to the applicable
Staged Closing Date, Sellers shall continue to use reasonable best efforts to
obtain any such Consents

                                      -22-

<PAGE>

after the applicable Staged Closing Date, and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate
with Buyers (at Buyers' request) in any lawful and economically feasible
arrangement to provide that Buyer shall receive the interest of Sellers in the
benefits under any such Asset, Contract or Permit which require Consent to sell,
assign, sublease, sublicense, or assume such Asset, Contract or Permit,
including performance by Sellers, as agent, if economically feasible; provided,
that Buyers shall undertake to pay or satisfy the corresponding liabilities for
the enjoyment of such benefit to the extent Buyers would have been responsible
therefor hereunder if such Consent had been obtained; provided, further that
Sellers shall not be required to pay any fees or make any other concessions to
any Person in order to obtain any Consents other than those listed on Schedule
3.3(b) in response to Sections 3.3(b) (ii) and (iii). Upon the receipt of any
such Consent(s) after the applicable Staged Closing Date, the relevant Asset(s),
Contract(s) and/or Permit(s) and/or Communications License(s) shall constitute
Acquired Assets. During such time as the parties are attempting to obtain
Consents to assignment or assumption of any Contracts hereunder following the
applicable Staged Closing Date (including, any Contract that required a Consent
of a court for Sellers to perform services or receive compensation under the
Contract), if, and to the extent that, Buyers are unable to provide services
under any such Contract (including, by virtue of the fact that a court does not
provide its Consent to Sellers ceasing to perform services under the Contract or
otherwise), Sellers may, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
continue to do so, if they so elect, and receive their customary fees and
expenses thereunder, or if Sellers are unable to do so for any reason (and
Buyers are not able for any reason to perform the work being performed by the
Seller), Sellers may terminate or withdraw from the Contract where necessary to
avoid material Losses (unless Buyers agree to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Sellers under Section 8.2(c)).

          2.8  Delivery of Guaranties

     Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (i)
Buyers' Parent is executing and delivering a guaranty to Sellers, the form of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Buyers' Parent Guaranty"), and (ii)
Sellers' Parent is executing and delivering to Buyers a guaranty, the form of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Sellers' Parent Guaranty").

     3.   Representations and Warranties of Sellers

     Sellers hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to Buyers as
follows:

          3.1  Organization and Qualification

Seller or any stockholder or other securityholder of any Seller or any
Affiliates of any Seller) are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance by each Seller of this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements to
which it will be a party or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

               (b)  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.2, this Agreement has
been, and each Collateral Agreement to which Sellers will be a party will be, on
or prior to First Stage Closing Date, duly and validly executed and delivered by
each Seller, as applicable. Assuming due execution by Buyers, this Agreement is,
and each Collateral Agreement to which Sellers will be a party, when duly
executed and delivered by each applicable Seller, will be, valid and legally
binding obligations of each applicable Seller, enforceable against each
applicable Seller in accordance with their respective terms, except as such
agreements may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws and equitable principles
relating to or affecting or qualifying the rights of creditors generally and

               (a)  Sellers have obtained all necessary registrations,
certifications and other regulatory authorizations from the appropriate state
and local Governmental Bodies (collectively, the "State Licenses"), including
State PUCs, and hold all licenses, permits, certificates, franchises,
registrations and other authorizations issued by the Federal Communications
Commission (collectively, the "FCC Licenses"), that are required for the conduct
of the Business as currently conducted, and for the holding of the Acquired
Assets, except where the failure to hold such State Licenses or FCC Licenses
(collectively, the "Communications Licenses") would not reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect. All of the Communications Licenses are
set forth in Schedule 3.5(a) hereto.

               (b)  Other than Communications Licenses that are immaterial, each
of the Communications Licenses was duly issued (to Sellers' Knowledge) and is
valid and in full force and effect and each of the Communications Licenses has
not been modified, canceled, revoked, or conditioned in any adverse manner other
than in a manner that is immaterial.

               (c)  Each holder of a Communications License is set forth in
Schedule 3.5(c) and has operated in all material respects in compliance with all
terms thereof. Each holder of a Communications License is in all material
respects in compliance with, and its businesses have operated in all material
respects in compliance with, the Communications Act, as applicable, and with any
other applicable Laws and Orders, and has filed all registrations and reports
and paid all required fees, including any renewal applications, required by the
Communications Act and any applicable Laws and Orders. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (i) there is no
pending or, to Sellers' Knowledge, threatened Action by or before the FCC or any
State PUC to revoke, cancel, suspend, modify or refuse to renew any of the
Communications Licenses, and (ii) except as set forth in Schedule 3.5(c), there
is not now any issued, outstanding or, to Sellers' Knowledge, threatened notice
by the FCC or any State PUC of any violation or complaint against Sellers with

reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, no event has
occurred that permits the revocation or termination of any of the Communications
Licenses or the imposition of any restriction thereon.

               (e)  Sellers hold (i) all valid and effective Permits, leases,
Communications Licenses, Easements, rights of way, licenses and other Consents,
whether issued by a Governmental Body or otherwise, necessary to retain in
place, operate and use the Owned Portion as currently conducted, (ii) all valid
and effective IRUs and other agreements, or any other Consents necessary to
retain in place, operate and use the IRU Portion as currently conducted, and
(iii) all material Permits that are required for them to own, lease or operate
their Assets and to carry on the Business as currently conducted, except as set
forth on Schedule 3.5(e). Sellers are in compliance in all material respects
with each Permit identified on Schedule 3.5(e), and no Action is pending or, to
Sellers' Knowledge, threatened to revoke or limit any such Permit. Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.5(e), Sellers have received no notice of and have no
Knowledge of any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to
cause a

                                      -26-

<PAGE>

material impairment of their rights to retain, operate and/or use the Owned
Portion or the IRU Portion.

all Laws and Orders applicable to the Business or the Acquired Assets.

               (b)  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.6(b), no Order that names
a Seller and is related to the Business or the Acquired Assets is in effect and
that imposes a material obligation on the ongoing conduct of the Business
(including the operation of the Network). Except as set forth on Schedule
3.6(b), Sellers have not entered into any agreement to settle or compromise any
Action pending or threatened against them which has involved any obligation
other than the payment of money or for which Sellers have any continuing
obligation. Except for individual Actions having an amount in controversy, and
which could not reasonably result in a Loss of, greater than $200,000, and
except as set forth on Schedule 3.6(b), there are no Actions pending (to
Sellers' Knowledge with respect to investigations of Governmental Bodies) or, to
Sellers' Knowledge, threatened, against or affecting Sellers or any of their
officers, directors, employees, agents or stockholders in their capacity as
such, in each case with respect to the Business or the Acquired Assets, and to
Sellers' Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances which may give rise to
any of the foregoing.

               (c)  There are no Actions pending (to Sellers' Knowledge with
respect to investigations of Government Bodies) or, to Sellers' Knowledge,
threatened by or against Sellers with respect to this Agreement or any of the
Collateral Agreements, or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, and Sellers have no reason to believe there is a valid basis
for any such Action.

          3.7  Business Employees; Employee Benefits

               (a)  Schedule 3.7(a) contains a list of the position held and
aggregate annual compensation for Sellers' last fiscal year and date of hire
with respect to each Business Employee (which list shall be updated as of the
First Stage Closing Date and no update is deemed to be an inaccuracy if in
compliance with Section 5.2).

               (b)  Schedule 3.7(b) contains a list of all Benefit Plans (which
list shall be updated as of the First Stage Closing Date and no update is deemed

the Buyers true and complete copies of all plan documents and benefit schedules,
or if none exist, a summary of the material terms thereof.

               (c)  Each Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with
its terms, except for any failures so to administer any Benefit Plan that would
not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect with respect
to the Business. Sellers and all Benefit Plans are in [material] compliance with
the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code

                                      -27-

<PAGE>

and all other applicable Laws and Orders and the terms of all applicable
collective bargaining agreements, except for any failures to be in such
compliance that would not individually or in the aggregate have a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to the Business.

               (d)  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.7(d), no Seller sponsors,
maintains or contributes to any Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of
ERISA and no Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section
3(37) of ERISA). No Benefit Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA has been
terminated and all contributions to any such plan which are due have been paid.

               (e)  Sellers are in [material] compliance with all Federal,
state, local and foreign requirements regarding employment, except for any
failures to comply that would not individually or in the aggregate have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Business. No Seller is a party to
any collective bargaining or other labor union contract applicable to persons
employed by any Seller in the United States and as of the date of this Agreement
no such collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by any Seller. There
is no (i) strike against or otherwise affecting any Seller pending, or to
Seller's Knowledge, threatened; or (ii) work stoppage or other labor dispute
against or otherwise affecting any Seller pending or, to Sellers' Knowledge,
threatened, which may materially interfere with the respective business
activities of any Seller with respect to the Business. To Sellers' Knowledge,
within the last three (3) years, no Seller or any of their respective
representatives or employees has committed any unfair labor practice in
connection with the operation of the respective businesses of Sellers, and there
is no action, charge or complaint against any Seller by the National Labor
Relations Board or any comparable Governmental Body pending or, to Sellers'
Knowledge, threatened in writing.

               (f)  (i)   No employee of any Seller will be entitled to any
additional benefits or any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
benefits under any Benefit Plan or otherwise (other than acceleration of vesting
of options in accordance with their terms) as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) no amount payable, or economic benefit
provided, by any Seller (including any acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any benefit (other than acceleration of vesting of options in
accordance with their terms)) could be considered an "excess parachute payment"
under Section 280G of the Code and (iii) no person is entitled to receive any
additional payment from any Seller or any other person in the event that the
excise tax of Section 4999 of the Code is imposed on such person, in each case
except where such additional benefits or payments or acceleration (other than
acceleration of vesting of options in accordance with their terms), would not
individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
the Business.

               (g)  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.7(g), no Seller has
implemented any plant closing or layoff of employees that could implicate the
Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act of 1988, as amended ("WARN"),
or any similar state or local Law, within the last 90 days.

                        (xiii)  enter into any Employment Agreement or other
         Contract of any kind with any director, officer or employee of any
         Seller or any of the respective Affiliates of such individuals, or with
         any Affiliate of any Seller, which, in each case, is related to the
         Business or would be an Assumed Liability;

                        (xiv)   enter into any Contract pursuant to which any
         Seller grants or is granted any license or sublicense or other right to
         use any of the Acquired Assets;

                        (xv)    other than in the ordinary course of business
         and consistent with past practice, incur any obligation or enter into,
         amend or modify any Contract or arrangement, which is related to the
         Business or would be an Assumed Liability, that either (i) requires a
         payment by any party in excess of, or a series of payments which in the
         aggregate exceed, $500,000 or provides for the delivery of goods or
         performance of services, or any combination thereof, having a value in
         excess of $500,000 and (ii) has a term, or requires the performance of
         any obligations by Seller over a period, in excess of one (1) year;

                        (xvi)   enter into any material Contract with a sales

         foregoing.

                  (c)   without limiting the generality of clause (a), until the
First Stage Closing Date, except as set forth on Schedule 5.2, each Seller shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to:

                        (i)     maintain all Communications Licenses and Permits
         that are required for and material to the conduct of the Business as
         currently conducted and for the holding of the Acquired Assets.

                                      -42-

<PAGE>

                        (ii)    maintain their books, accounts and records in
         the usual, regular and ordinary manner, and on a basis consistent with
         the Financial Statements and past practices, and

                        (iii)   duly comply in all material respects with all
         Laws and Orders applicable to Sellers or as may be required for the
         valid and effective transfer and assignment of the Acquired Assets.

                  (d)   Sellers shall continue to carry their existing
"occurrence" liability insurance applicable to periods up to the Second Staged
Closing Date and shall not allow any breach, default, termination or
cancellation of such insurance policies or agreements to occur or exist.

Any Contract or other obligation which is related to the Business and would be
an Assumed Liability which requires the prior written consent of Buyers pursuant
to Section 5.2(b) and which is entered into or incurred with the prior written
consent of Buyers shall be included in the Acquired Assets and shall constitute
an Assumed Liability, and the Schedules to this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been updated to include any such Contract or obligation. Any Contract or
other obligation entered into or incurred in violation of Section 5.2(b) shall
not be included in the Acquired Assets, shall constitute an Excluded Liability,
and shall not be included on any of the Schedules to this Agreement.

           5.3    Taxes

                  (a)   Sellers and Buyers acknowledge and agree that (i)
Sellers will be responsible for and will perform all applicable Tax withholding,
payment and reporting duties with respect to any wages and other compensation
and benefits paid or provided by Sellers to any Business Employee for a taxable
period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the First Stage Closing Date,
and (ii) Buyers will be responsible for and will perform all Tax withholding,
payment and reporting duties with respect to any wages and other compensation
and benefits paid or provided by Buyers or any of their Affiliates to any
Transferred Employee after the First Staged Closing Date.

                  (b)   Buyers and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to agree upon an allocation of the Purchase Price (and the amount of
Assumed Liabilities that are liabilities for Federal income tax purposes) among
the Acquired Assets (the "Allocation"), consistent with the principles to be
mutually agreed between Sellers and Buyers and set forth in Schedule 5.3(b) on
or prior to the first Stage Closing Date and Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder, within a reasonable amount of time following
the Staged Closing Dates. Buyers shall provide a proposed Allocation to Sellers
within sixty (60) days following the Staged Closing Dates. Sellers shall propose
any changes to the Allocation within thirty (30) days thereafter, together with
a reasonably detailed explanation of the reasons therefor. Buyers and Sellers
will negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputed items. If Buyers and
Sellers are unable to agree on the Allocation within thirty (30) days following
delivery of Sellers' proposed changes, then Buyers and Sellers shall be
permitted to use their respective Allocations.

                                      -43-

<PAGE>

                  (c)   If Buyers and Sellers are able to agree to an
Allocation, (i) each Seller and Buyer shall timely file IRS Form 8594 and all
other Federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns in accordance with the
Allocation, as adjusted pursuant to Section 5.3(b) and (ii) neither Sellers nor
Buyers nor any of their respective Affiliates or representatives shall take any
position on any Tax Return that is inconsistent with the Allocation. Sellers and
Buyers agree to promptly provide the other party with any additional information
as so adjusted required to complete Form 8594.

                  (d)   Buyers and Sellers shall cooperate fully with respect to
all Tax matters and shall keep each other promptly apprised of any Tax audit or
other controversy that may affect the other or reasonably could be expected to
result in an indemnification obligation hereunder.

                  (e)   Each of Buyers and Sellers shall pay fifty percent (50%)
of all sales, transfer, value added (to the extent not creditable) or similar
Taxes and all recording and filing fees and other similar costs that may be
imposed, assessed or payable by reason of the sales, transfers, leases, rentals,
licenses, assignments and assumption of liabilities, if any, required for
performance under this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements. Buyers and
Sellers shall cooperate in timely making and filing all filings, Tax Returns,
reports and forms as may be required with respect to any Taxes described in the
preceding sentence. Buyers and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to avail themselves of any available exemptions or other opportunities to reduce
or eliminate any such Taxes or fees. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
Sellers shall be responsible for income and capital gains Taxes or franchise or
other Taxes based on overall gross or net income of Sellers from the sale of the
Acquired Assets ("Income Taxes").

                  (f)   Liability of Sellers for real, personal and intangible
property Taxes for the 2003 tax year including the Staged Closing Dates shall be
equal to the amount of such property Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such period that
precede the First Stage Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire period. Liability for the remainder of such Taxes shall be
borne by Buyers. Sellers shall pay all such amounts to the taxing authority when
due and shall provide to Buyers proof of such payment and a schedule setting out
in reasonable detail the amount of Buyers' liability. Buyers shall promptly pay
to Sellers the amount of their liability as determined in this Section 5.3(f)
within five (5) days of Sellers' payment and notice thereof. Sellers and Buyers
shall cooperate with respect to any protest or audit proceedings, and shall
share the costs of such proceedings in proportion to the fraction determined in
the first sentence of this Section 5.3(f). Neither Sellers nor Buyers shall
settle any such proceeding without the prior written consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                  (g)   Sellers shall deliver to Buyers at the First Stage
Closing Date a certification of non-foreign status as described in Section
1.1445-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.

           5.4    Employees and Employee Benefits

                  (a)   Sellers shall provide Buyers with an update to Schedule
3.7(a) immediately prior to the First Stage Closing Date. Unless otherwise
agreed in writing prior to the First Stage Closing Date, Buyers shall make
offers of employment to all of the Business Employees of Sellers as of the First
Stage Closing Date, provided that Sellers shall comply with the covenant set
forth in Section 5.15(b). Business Employees who accept such offer of
employment, as of the effective date of their employment with Buyers or one of
its Affiliates (the "Transfer Date"), shall be referred to as "Transferred
Employees." All liabilities, costs and Actions related to Business Employees who
do not accept such offers of employment shall be Excluded Liabilities hereunder.
Each offer of employment shall provide for a base salary no less than their base
salary as an employee of Sellers as of the First Stage Closing Date and health,
welfare, retirement and severance benefits as shall be applicable to comparable
Buyers' employees generally; provided, however, that any Transferred Employee
who is a Key Employee shall receive base salary and health, welfare, retirement
and severance benefits (other than any defined benefit plans) that are, taken as
a whole, substantially equivalent to that currently enjoyed by such Transferred
Employee as an employee of Sellers.

                  (b)   To the extent permitted by law, Buyers' benefit plans
and policies, including vacation, floating holidays, retirement, severance and
welfare plans, shall recognize, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate all service with Sellers that was recognized by Sellers for a
similar purpose under a corresponding Benefit Plan. Nothing in this paragraph
(b) shall require the Buyers to provide duplicate benefits to any Transferred
Employee.

                  (c)   Except as specifically provided in this Section 5.4: (i)
no Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall adopt, become a sponsoring employer of,
or have any obligations under or with respect to the Benefit Plans, and Sellers
shall be responsible for any and all liabilities which have arisen or may arise
under or in connection with any Benefit Plan; and (ii) Sellers shall be
responsible for any and all liabilities relating to or arising out of the
employment of any Business Employee by Sellers before the First Stage Closing
Date.

                  (d)   Buyers shall be responsible for all liabilities, costs
and Actions to the extent arising out of, or resulting from, facts, events and
circumstances occurring, or which accrue, after the First Stage Closing Date
(other than due to any failure to comply or breach of any Sellers or any of
their Affiliates, whether before, on or after the First Stage Closing Date)
related to (i) the Transferred Employees, and (ii) the Business Employees with
respect to whom Buyers have not extended an offer as required under Section
5.4(a) and whose employment with Sellers terminates within two (2) months after
the First Stage Closing Date (other than due to any failure or breach of any
Sellers or any of its Affiliates, whether before, on or after the First Stage
Closing Date). Sellers shall provide within three (3) months after the First
Stage Closing Date written reconciliation of any amount owed with respect to
such Transferred Employees and Business Employees, from and after the First
Stage Closing Date, including without limitation: (A) claims for the type of
benefits described in Section 3(1) of ERISA (whether or not covered by ERISA but
in no event to include such claims with respect to Business Employees to whom
offers have not been extended, in accordance with the terms hereof, who are on
long term disability) and for workers compensation, in each case that are
incurred by or with respect to any Transferred Employee on or after his or her
Transfer Date, and (B) claims relating to severance,

                                      -45-

<PAGE>

redundancy and similar pay, salary continuation, and similar obligations
(collectively, "Severance Pay") relating to the termination or alleged
termination of employment of any Business Employee described in clause (ii) of
this Section 5.4(d) with Sellers, whether arising under a Benefit Plan, an
Employment Agreement or other agreement, in each case only with respect to those
which have been disclosed to Buyers on Schedule 3.7(b), with an individual
Business Employee, or applicable Law. Buyers shall indemnify and hold harmless
Sellers from: (i) all COBRA Coverage and related Losses attributable to
"qualifying events" with respect to any Business Employees described in clause
(ii) of this Section 5.4(d) and his or her beneficiaries and dependents that
occur on or after the First Stage Closing Date (other than due to any failure to
comply or breach of any of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, whether
before, on or after the First Stage Closing) and (ii) all liabilities, costs,
claims and Actions arising under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act ("WARN") with respect to any Business Employees described in
clause (ii) of this Section 5.4(d) because of the failure of Buyers or their
Affiliates to extend offers of employment to Business Employees as required by
Section 5.4(a) (other than due to any failure to comply or breach of any of the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates, whether before, on or after the First Stage
Closing).

                  (e)   Buyers shall provide Sellers with information concerning
the employment status of Transferred Employees, including any date of
termination from Buyers and its Affiliates, so as to enable Sellers to
administer its Benefit Plans with respect to such Transferred Employees. Such
information shall be provided from time to time in such form (including any
electronic media) as reasonably requested by Sellers.

                  (f)   Buyers shall credit each Transferred Employee with
vacation accrued but not used through his or her Transfer Date.

           5.5    Regulatory Compliance

                  (a)   Sellers and Buyers shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable, including to: (i) obtain from Governmental
Bodies any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or
orders required to (A) be obtained or made by Sellers or Buyers or any of their
Affiliates to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B)
avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental Body (including those in
connection with the HSR Act and antitrust and competition Laws of any other
applicable jurisdiction) in connection with the authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and to permit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and (ii) promptly
make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions,
with respect to this Agreement required under (A) the HSR Act and antitrust and
competition Laws of any other applicable jurisdiction, in each case, to the
extent required by applicable Law, (B) the Communications Act or (C) any other
applicable Law. Sellers and Buyers shall cooperate with each other in connection
with the making of all filings referenced in the preceding sentence. Sellers and
Buyers shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with its performance
under this Section 5.5, except the filing fees in connection with any required
filings or

                                      -46-

<PAGE>

submissions under the HSR Act shall be apportioned fifty percent (50%) to
Sellers and fifty percent (50%) to Buyers.

                  (b)   Without limiting the foregoing, Buyers and Sellers
shall:

                        (i)    promptly provide to the Federal Trade Commission
         or Department of Justice, as the case may be, such information as may
         reasonably and legally be requested by the Federal Trade Commission or
         Department of Justice, as the case may be, and shall cause their
         respective officers and employees to respond to any reasonable and
         legal information or other requests from the Federal Trade Commission
         or Department of Justice, as the case may be (including complying with
         requests for in-person meetings), in connection with the review by the
         Federal Trade Commission or Department of Justice, as the case may be,
         of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and

                        (ii)   promptly submit to the FCC, any State PUCs,
         regulatory agencies or similar Governmental Bodies as required by
         applicable Law and all other applicable Governmental Bodies all
         applications, notices and other filings necessary to consummate the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Collateral
         Agreements, including those indicated on Schedule 3.3(b) and Schedule
         4.3(b) and obtain any other Consents necessary to consummate the
         transactions contemplated hereby.

           5.6    Certain Provisions Relating to the Transfer

                  (a)   In the event that record or beneficial ownership or

as may reasonably be instructed by Sellers.

                  (b)   In the event that record or beneficial ownership or
possession of any Acquired Asset or any Assumed Liability has not been

Liability, and pending such transfer to Buyers, Sellers shall hold such Acquired
Asset or Assumed Liability and provide to Buyers all of the benefits and
liabilities associated with the ownership and operation of such Acquired Asset
or Assumed Liability and, accordingly, Sellers shall cause such Acquired Asset

representation or warranty of Sellers contained in this Agreement or any
Collateral Agreement (A) which does not contain materiality, Material Adverse
Effect or any other materiality qualifier, if made on or as of the date of such
event or the date of the First Stage Closing Date, untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect or (B) which does contain a materiality, Material Adverse
Effect or other materiality qualifier, if made on and as of the date of such
event or the First Stage Closing Date, untrue or inaccurate in any respect
(each, a "Sellers' R&W Breach"), or (ii) any failure of Sellers to comply with
or satisfy (X) in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement
contained in this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement which does not contain

in this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement which does contain materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or any other materiality qualifier to be complied with
or satisfied by Sellers hereunder or thereunder on or prior to the First Stage

                  (b)   Buyers will promptly provide written notice to Sellers
of (i) any event known to Buyers which has rendered or reasonably could be
expected to render any representation or warranty of Buyers contained in this
Agreement or any Collateral Agreement (A) which does not contain materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or any other materiality qualifier, if made on or as of

                  (c)   The parties acknowledge and agree that if the Buyers
have been given notice of any Sellers' R&W Breach(es) and/or Sellers' Covenant
Failure(s) in accordance with Section 5.7(a) and Buyers proceed with the First
Stage Closing when Buyers have the right not to proceed to Closing under Section
7.2(a), then Buyers shall not be deemed to have waived such Breach(es) and
Failure(s), and Buyers and their related Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to be indemnified pursuant to Section 8.2 relating to such Breach(es) and/or
Failure(s) to the extent solely of the Losses up to Five Million U.S. Dollars
($5,000,000). The disclosure by Sellers of any Sellers' R&W Breach(es) and/or
Sellers' Covenant Failure(s) shall not limit any right of Buyers to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with Article 9, nor shall such notice constitute an
admission by Sellers that any such Breach(es) and/or Failure(s) constitute or
give rise to a Material Adverse Effect, failure of a condition in Article 7 or
right to terminate in accordance with Article 9.

                                      -48-

<PAGE>

                  (d)   The parties acknowledge and agree that if the Sellers
have been given notice of any Buyers' R&W Breach(es) and/or Buyers' Covenant
Failure(s) in accordance with Section 5.7(b) and Sellers proceed with the First
Stage Closing, Sellers shall not be deemed to have waived such Breach(es) or
Failure(s), and Sellers and their related Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to be indemnified pursuant to Section 8.2 hereof relating to such Breach(es)
and/or Failure(s) to the extent solely of the Losses up to Five Million U.S.
Dollars ($5,000,000). The disclosure by Buyers of any Buyers' R&W Breach(es)
and/or Buyers' Covenant Failure(s) shall not limit any right of Sellers to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Article 9, nor shall such notice
constitute an admission by Buyers that any such Breach(es) and/or Failure(s)
constitute or give rise to a Material Adverse Effect, failure of a condition in
Article 7 or right to terminate in accordance with Article 9.

                  (e)   Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyers, on the other hand,
will promptly give notice to the other upon becoming aware that any Action is
pending or threatened by or before any Governmental Body, in each case with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Collateral
Agreement. Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyers, on the other hand, (i) will
cooperate in connection with the prosecution, investigation or defense of any
such Action, (ii) will supply promptly all information reasonably and legally
requested by the other, by any such Governmental Body or by any party to any
such Action and (iii) will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such
Action to be determined as promptly as practicable and in a manner which does

           5.8    Covenant Not to Compete; No Solicitation and No Hiring

       Sellers covenant and agree that for a period of thirty-six (36) months
following the First Stage Closing Date, except as required or permitted by the
Collateral Agreements listed in Sections 5.11(c) and 5.11(e) hereof, none of the
Sellers or their subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly (and Sellers will
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Affiliates
not to), (i) engage in, control, advise, manage, serve as a director, officer,
or employee of, act as a consultant to, receive any economic benefit from (other
than any economic benefit from the C III LLC Agreement) or exert any influence
upon, any business which conducts the same activities as those conducted by the
Business (individually and collectively "Compete"), except the delivery of
products and services to the Buyers under the Collateral Agreements and the
conduct of the Retained Business, within the continental United States (the
"Territory"); or (ii) solicit, divert or attempt to solicit or divert any party
who is, was, or was solicited to become, a customer or supplier of the Business
at any time prior to the Second Stage Closing Date, except solely the attempted
solicitation or solicitation of any such customer or supplier to become a
customer or supplier of a business that does not Compete with the Business,
except the delivery of products and services to the Buyers under the Collateral
Agreements and the conduct of the Retained Business, within the Territory. For a
period of thirty-six (36) months following the Second Stage Closing Date,
neither Sellers nor their respective Affiliates (other than any directors,
officers or employees of Sellers provided not in their capacity as such) shall
directly or indirectly solicit for employment or hire as an employee or
consultant, any of the Transferred Employees or other employees of Buyers or its
Affiliates engaged in the Business unless such employee's employment is earlier
terminated by Buyers. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the

                                      -49-

<PAGE>

covenant in this Section nor the Sellers' Parent's Non-Competition and
Confidentiality Agreement shall prohibit Sellers' Parent or its Affiliates from
continuing to conduct their respective businesses described on Schedule 5.8. For
a period of twelve (12) months following the Second Stage Closing Date, Buyers
and their Affiliates shall not directly or indirectly solicit for employment or
hire as an employee or consultant, any employee (other than a Transferred
Employee) who works for Sellers or their respective Affiliates unless such
employee's employment is earlier terminated by Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5.8 shall not
prevent Buyers or Sellers (or any of their respective Affiliates or any Person
acting on their behalf) from conducting general searches for employees by use of
advertisements or the media that are not directly targeted at the employees of
the other party.

           5.9    Confidentiality

       Except for confidential information related to or otherwise contained in
the Excluded Assets (other than any Excluded Assets that comprise Business
Records) including Intellectual Property not being sold, but being licensed to
Buyers, for a period of four (4) years after the Second Stage Closing Date,
Sellers will not, and Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
their respective Affiliates not to, use for its or their own benefit or divulge
or convey to any Third Party, any Confidential Information (as hereinafter
defined) relating to the Business, provided that Sellers shall be entitled to
provide copies of this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements to the lenders
under the Credit Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, Sellers shall not be
deemed to have violated this Section 5.9 if any Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates receives a request to disclose all or any part of the
Confidential Information under the terms of a subpoena, civil investigative
demand or order issued by a Governmental Body, and such Seller or such
Affiliate, to the extent not inconsistent with such request and to the extent
time reasonably allows: (a) notifies Buyers of the existence, terms and
circumstances surrounding such request; (b) consults with Buyers on the
advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request;

such Affiliate is legally obligated to disclose and to exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that

this Section 5.9, "Confidential Information" consists of all information,

information to enter the public domain.

Liabilities; and

                  (b)   Buyers shall provide Sellers with access to all
information that constitutes a part of the Acquired Assets and shall otherwise
cooperate with Sellers (including by the provision of a reasonable amount of the

                  (c)   One or more Sellers and/or their Affiliates have a
dispute under the ELI Contract (the "ELI Dispute") which, among other things,

Replacement Fibers") for use with the Corvis ON platform on the same route.

huts or similar items obtained by one or more Sellers in connection with the
dispute with El Paso Global Networks.

organizational documents to change their corporate or company name to a name
that does not include the word "Broadwing" or any name intended or likely to be
confused or associated with any Broadwing Name prior to or on the First Stage
Closing Date, and shall make commercially reasonable efforts to cause the

their Affiliates, a license to use, the Broadwing Name.

         document containing any reference to the Broadwing Name shall be
         printed, ordered or produced for use by any Seller or any of its

         Affiliates to, use its reasonable efforts to ensure that, as soon as
         reasonably practicable but in no event later than sixty (60) days

Persons, including without limitation, any amendment, supplement or other
modification to any BCI or Seller Guaranty. In the event Buyers' Parent has not

sole discretion, not to accept such terms, Buyers and Sellers shall undertake
good faith negotiations to attempt to reach agreement on mutually acceptable
terms for such Collateral Agreements. Any election or failure to reach mutual
agreement pursuant to this Section 5.24 will not be grounds for the failure of a
condition under Section 7.3(b).

           5.25   BTS Employees.

       On or before the First Stage Closing Date, the Broadwing Technology
Services, Inc. employees set forth on Schedule 5.25 shall be transferred to the

                  (a)   Sellers, jointly and severally, on the one side, and

indemnify, defend and hold harmless, the "Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the other party hereto and their Affiliates and any
employee, representative, agent, director, officer, partner, member or
principal, as applicable, or assign of such party and their Affiliates (each, an
"Indemnified Party") from and against any and all Actions, whether by a third
party against an Indemnified Party or by one party against another party
(collectively, "Claims") related to or arising out of or resulting from,
liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including

                                      -63-

<PAGE>

reasonable attorneys', accountants' and experts' fees and costs, and costs and
expenses of establishing entitlement to indemnification) (collectively,
"Losses") incurred by any Indemnified Party related to, or arising out of or
resulting from (i) any breach of or any inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty of the Indemnifying Party contained in this Agreement or any Collateral
Agreement when made or as of the applicable Staged Closing Date (or as of such
different date or period specified for such representation or warranty) as
though such representation or warranty were made at the applicable Staged
Closing Date (or at such different date or period specified for such
representation or warranty) (and for purposes of determining liability under
this Section 8.2, after removing any reference to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect or any other materiality qualifiers contained in such
representations and warranties other than such of the foregoing that are
underlined, provided that when an underlined reference to the word "material" or
"materiality" also appears in brackets, the applicable representations and
warranties should not be read for purposes of this Agreement (other than the
proceeding portion of this sentence) as though such terms were therein) or (ii)
the breach by the Indemnifying Party of any covenant or agreement of such party
contained in this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement.

                  (b)   Sellers further agree jointly and severally to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyers and any other Indemnified Party of
Buyers from and against any Losses incurred by such party arising out of,
resulting from, or relating to (i) any of the Excluded Assets (including the
Retained Business) or Excluded Liabilities (including those related to the
Retained Business), (ii) any matters identified on Schedule 8.2(b), (iii) any
matters identified on Schedule 3.6(a) or (b), (iv) any Taxes of Sellers (except

Section 10.2) and (v) any failure of Sellers to comply with the provisions of
any bulk transfer laws which may be applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Collateral Agreements.

                  (c)   Buyers further agree to jointly and severally indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Sellers and any other Indemnified Party of Sellers from
and against any Losses incurred by such party arising out of, resulting from, or
relating to: (i) any of the First Stage Assumed Liabilities after the First
Stage Closing and the Second Stage Assumed Liabilities after the Second Stage
Closing; (ii) any claim, demand or liability for the Taxes for which Buyers are
responsible pursuant to Section 5.3; (iii) any other liability or obligation
with respect to the conduct of the Business transferred on the First Stage
Closing Date after such Closing Date and with respect to the conduct of the
Business transferred after the First Stage Closing, to the extent arising out
of, or resulting from, facts, events or circumstances occurring, or which

hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish
such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith, except that nothing herein shall permit

                                      -64-

<PAGE>

Sellers, or require Buyers as a condition to obtaining indemnification, to seek
to collect back sales or use Tax from clients or customers of the Business.

                  (e)   The indemnification obligations of each party hereto
under this Article 8 shall inure to the benefit of the Affiliates of the other
party and the employees, representatives, agents, directors, officers, partners,
members and principals, as applicable, of the other party hereto and their
Affiliates on the same terms as are applicable to such other party.

                  (f)   Sellers' and Buyers' respective liability for all Claims
under Section 8.2(a)(i) shall be subject to the following limitations:

                        (i)    neither the Sellers nor Buyers, respectively,
         shall have any liability for any Losses arising from such Claims unless
         the aggregate of all Losses for which the Sellers or Buyers,
         respectively, would, but for this provision, be liable exceeds on a
         cumulative basis an amount equal to Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars
         ($500,000) (the "Threshold"), provided, that in the event that such
         Losses of Sellers or Buyers, as applicable, on a cumulative basis
         exceed the Threshold, the liability shall be from the first dollar of
         Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Threshold shall not apply
         (i) to Claims or Losses with respect to the Title and Authorization
         Warranties, Tax Warranties and the representations and warranties
         contained in Sections 3.13 and 4.6, or (ii) when Buyers have the right
         not to proceed to Closing under Section 7.2(a) but proceed to Closing
         under Section 5.7(c);

                        (ii)   the Sellers' or Buyers' respective aggregate
         liability for all Losses arising from such Claims (other than any such
         Claims with respect to the Title and Authorization Warranties, the Tax
         Warranties and the representations and warranties in Sections 3.13 and
         4.6) shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase Price (the
         "General Cap");

                        (iii)  the Sellers' or Buyers' respective aggregate
         liability with respect to their respective Title and Authorization
         Warranties shall not exceed the Purchase Price (the "Overall Cap"), and
         the Sellers' or Buyers' respective aggregate liability under the
         preceding clause (ii) and this clause (iii) shall not exceed the
         Overall Cap;

                        (iv)   Sellers' or Buyers' respective liability for Tax
         Warranties and the representations and warranties contained in Sections
         3.13 and 4.6 shall not be subject to the General Cap or the Overall
         Cap; and

                        (v)    in no event shall Sellers be obligated
         to indemnify Buyers or any other Person with respect to any Loss to the
         extent that a specific accrual or reserve for the amount of such Loss
         was included in the calculation of the Closing Working Capital. No
         Indemnified Party may make a claim for indemnification under Section
         8.2(a)(i) for breach by the Indemnifying Party of a particular
         representation or warranty after the expiration of the survival period
         specified in Section 8.1.

                                      -65-

<PAGE>

                  (g)   The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is
provided under this Article 8 shall be net of any amounts recovered or
recoverable by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to
such Loss.

                  (h)   Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Collateral
Agreements (other than the Security Agreement) to the contrary, none of the
parties hereto or thereto shall be liable to the other, whether in contract,
tort or otherwise, for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential,
punitive or exemplary or other similar type of damages whatsoever, which in any
way arise out of, relate to, or are a consequence of, its performance or
nonperformance hereunder or the Collateral Agreements (other than through
fraud), including loss of profits, business interruptions and claims of
customers, except to the extent to which a Third Party Claim against an
Indemnified Party includes such damages.

                  (i)   Each party further acknowledges and agrees that, should
the First Stage Closing occur, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all claims relating to this Agreement, the Collateral Agreements, the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Business and its assets, liabilities and
business (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud;
provided that inaccuracies of representations or warranties (whether or not
accurate facts were knowable by inquiry including title searches or otherwise)
shall not be construed to be fraud, absent intent to deceive) shall be pursuant
to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article 8. In furtherance of
the foregoing, except as set forth in the preceding sentence, each party hereby
waives and releases, from and after the First Stage Closing Date, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action
arising from, fraud, subject to the proviso set forth above in this Section
8.2(i)) it may have against the other party and its Affiliates arising under or
based upon any Federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article 8) arising out of or related to this Agreement and the
Collateral Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section
8.2(i) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit any party's right
to seek specific performance or other equitable relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction of its rights and remedies hereunder or in any Collateral
Agreement, in accordance with Section 10.11.

            8.3   General Procedures for Indemnification

                  (a)   Procedures Relating to Indemnification. In order for the
Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this
Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a Claim made by any Person
against the Indemnified Party (each, a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified
Party must notify the Indemnifying Party in writing, and in reasonable detail,
of the Third Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by such
Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim; provided, that the
failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice in the manner specified above
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article 8
except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnified Party shall have been
materially prejudiced thereby.

       If the Indemnifying Party does not object in writing to such
indemnification claim within thirty (30) days of the Indemnifying Party's
knowledge of its receipt of notice thereof, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to recover promptly from the Indemnifying Party the amount

                                      -66-

<PAGE>

of such claim, and no later objection by the Indemnifying Party shall be
permitted. If the Indemnifying Party agrees that it has an indemnification
obligation but objects that it is obligated to pay only a lesser amount, the
Indemnified Party shall nevertheless be entitled to recover promptly from the
Indemnifying Party the lesser amount, without prejudice to the Indemnified
Party's claim for the difference.

       If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and
to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party
which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Should the
Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof unless the Indemnified Party reasonably determines in its
judgment that representation by the Indemnifying Party's counsel of both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest, then such Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel to
represent or defend it in any such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party
shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of one such separate counsel. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its
own expense (subject to the preceding sentence), separate from the counsel
employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the Indemnifying
Party shall control such defense. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period
during which the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense thereof
(other than during the period prior to the time the Indemnified Party shall have
given notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). All attorneys' fees
and expenses shall count towards the indemnity limit specified in Section
8.2(f).

                  (b)   If the Indemnifying Party so elects to assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim, all of the Indemnified Parties shall
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense or prosecution
thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying
Party's request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Any settlement
or compromise made or caused to be made by the Indemnified Party (which is
permitted if the Indemnifying Party has declined to assume the defense thereof)
or the Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, of a Third Party Claim referred
to in this paragraph shall also be binding upon the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, in the same manner as if a final judgment
or decree had been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the amount of
such settlement or compromise; provided, that no such settlement by the
Indemnifying Party shall be binding upon the Indemnified Party without its prior
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed with
respect to proposed settlements whereby the Indemnified Party is held harmless
with respect to all Losses and no other material obligation is imposed upon the
Indemnified Party (provided that in the event a Third Party Claim is subject to
the General Cap or the Overall Cap (each, a "Cap"), the Indemnified Party need
only be held harmless up to the amount of the remaining balance of the
applicable Cap); and provided, further that where a Third Party Claim is subject
to a Cap and the proposed settlement involves Losses in excess of such Cap (and
does

                                      -67-

<PAGE>

not impose any other material obligation on the Indemnified Party) either the
Indemnified Party shall accept the proposed settlement or agree to assume the
defense thereof and hold harmless the Indemnifying Party for all Losses over the
lesser of the amount of the proposed settlement or the remaining balance of the
applicable Cap.

                  (c)   Each Seller and Buyers shall make commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Claim or other liability with respect to
which one party is obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder.

            10.3  Entire Agreement

       The agreement of Sellers and Buyers, which is comprised of this
Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the documents referred to
herein and therein, including the Collateral Agreements, sets forth the entire
agreement and understanding between the parties and supersedes any prior
agreement or understanding, written or oral, relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement.

            10.4  Jurisdiction, Service of Process

       Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the (a) Supreme Court of the
State of New York, New York County and (b) United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out
of or relating to this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements (and agrees not
to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in such
courts), and further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by U.S. registered mail to its respective address set forth in Section
10.1 will be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding
brought against it in any such court. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Collateral
Agreements in the courts of the State of New York or the United States of
America located in the City of New York and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum.

            10.5  Governing Law

       This Agreement and the Collateral Agreements will be construed in
accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of New York
applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State
without regard to conflicts of laws principles thereof.

            10.6  Waiver

       The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement and the
Collateral Agreements are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure
nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under
this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a
waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of
any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise
of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, (a) no claim or right arising
out of this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements can be discharged by one
party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right
unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by
a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given
and will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure or noncompliance; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party
will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of
the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or
demand as provided in this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements.

            10.7   No Oral Modification

       Neither this Agreement nor any Collateral Agreement may not be amended
except by a written agreement executed by the party to be charged with the
amendment. Any attempted amendment in violation of this Section 10.7 will be
void ab initio.

            10.8   Assignments, Successors

       No party may assign any of its rights under this Agreement or any
Collateral Agreements without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto or thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers may assign this
Agreement or rights and obligations of Buyers hereunder, in each case in whole
or part, to any Affiliate of Buyers and to any successor to all or substantially
all of the Business (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or
otherwise), provided that Buyers shall remain liable for all of their
obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement and the Collateral Agreements will apply to, be binding in all
respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns
of the parties.

            10.9   Severability

       If any provision of this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements is held
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements will remain in full
force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements
held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force
and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

            10.10  Captions

       The Article, section and paragraph captions herein and the table of

            10.11  Specific Performance

       Each party recognizes and affirms that in the event of breach by him or
it of any of the provisions of Sections 5.8, 5.9, or 5.17 money damages would be
inadequate and the other parties would have no adequate remedy at law.

addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor, to enforce
their respective rights and the breaching party's obligations under Sections
5.8, 5.9 or 5.17 not only by an action or actions for damages, but also by an
action or actions for specific performance, injunction and/or other equitable
relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations (whether anticipatory,
continuing or future) of the provisions of Sections 5.8, 5.9 or 5.17. If a bond
is required to be posted in order for any party to secure an injunction, the
parties agree that such bond need not exceed the sum of $1,000.
