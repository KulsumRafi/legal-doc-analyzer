demand and with or without process of law and the right to sell and dispose of the same and distribute the proceeds according to law. The parties hereto agree that any requirement of reasonable notice
shall be met if Beneficiary sends such notice to Trustor at least ten days prior to the date of sale, disposition or other event giving rise to the required notice, and that the proceeds of any

reasonable attorneys' fees and other legal expenses incurred, and then to payment of the other obligations. The parties hereto further agree that any sale of the Personal Property held
contemporaneously with any sale of the Land or other Property and upon the same notice as required in the Nevada Uniform Commercial Code shall be deemed to be a public sale conducted in a commercially
reasonable manner. With respect to the Personal Property that has become so attached to the real property covered hereby that an interest therein arises under the real property law of the State of
Nevada, this Deed of Trust shall also constitute a financing statement and a fixture filing under NRS &sect;&nbsp;104.9502. </FONT></P>

preceding sentence, Trustor shall not seek to reject the Ground Lease and shall comply with the demand provided for in clause&nbsp;(i) of the preceding sentence within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after
the notice shall have been given, subject to the performance by Beneficiary of the covenant provided for in clause&nbsp;(ii) of the preceding sentence. Effective upon the entry of an order for

applicable Gaming Laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Personal Property may, at the sole and absolute option of Beneficiary, (i)&nbsp;be sold hereunder, (ii)&nbsp;be sold
pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of Nevada, or (iii)&nbsp;be dealt with by Beneficiary in any other manner provided by statute, law or equity. Without limiting the foregoing,
Beneficiary may require Trustor to assemble the Personal Property and make it available to Beneficiary at a place to be designated by Beneficiary. At any time after the occurrence of a Default or an
Event of Default, Beneficiary shall be the attorney-in-fact of Trustor with respect to any and all matters pertaining to the Property with full power and authority to give
instructions with respect to the collection and remittance
of payments, to endorse checks, to enforce the rights and remedies of Trustor, and to execute on behalf of Trustor and in Trustor's name any instruction, agreement or other writing required therefor.
This power shall be irrevocable and deemed to be a power coupled with an interest. Beneficiary may, in its sole discretion, appoint Trustee as the agent of Beneficiary for the purpose of disposition
of the Personal Property in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code. Trustor acknowledges and agrees that a disposition of the Personal Property in accordance with Beneficiary's rights and
remedies in respect to real property as hereinabove provided is a commercially reasonable disposition thereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;At
any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default, Beneficiary may, to the full extent permitted by law, including any applicable Gaming Law, in addition to all
other rights and remedies, forthwith after any such Event of Default, enter upon and take possession of the Property, complete any buildings or other improvements under construction, construct new
improvements and make modifications to and/or demolish any of the foregoing. In connection therewith Beneficiary shall have the power to file any and all notices and obtain any and all necessary
permits and licenses, including, but not limited to, the filing of notices of completion and the obtaining of certificates of occupancy. Beneficiary shall also have the right but not the obligation to
receive all of the rents, issues and profits of the Property, overdue, due or to become due, and to apply the same, after payment of all necessary charges and expenses, including attorneys' fees, on
account of the indebtedness secured hereby. Beneficiary may do any and all of the foregoing in its own name or in the name of Trustor and Trustor hereby irrevocably appoints Beneficiary as its
attorney-in-fact for such purposes. Beneficiary may also, at any time after such default, apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a receiver and
Trustor agrees that such appointment shall be made upon a prima facie showing of a claimed Event of Default without reference to any offsets or defenses against such Event of Default and without
regard to whether any portion of the Property is in danger of being lost, removed, injured or destroyed or of waste, whether income from the Property is in danger of being lost or whether the Property
is or may become insufficient to discharge the obligations secured by this Deed of Trust. Such receiver shall have all the rights and powers provided Beneficiary pursuant to this section or otherwise
provided hereunder or by law. Said receiver may borrow monies and issue certificates therefor. Said certificates shall be a lien on the Property subordinate only to this Deed of Trust and the Leases;
provided, however, that should any of said certificates be acquired by Beneficiary the amount thereof shall constitute additional indebtedness secured hereby. Such receiver may lease all or any
portion of the Property on such terms and for such a term (which may extend beyond the terms of such receiver's appointment and/or, if Beneficiary so consents, sale of the Property hereunder) as such
receiver may deem appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion. The entering upon and taking possession of the Property pursuant to this section and the collection of the rents, issues and profits
therefrom shall not cure or waive any Event of Default or notice thereof hereunder or invalidate any act of Beneficiary pursuant thereto. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Should
default be made by Trustor in payment or performance of any indebtedness or other obligation or agreement secured hereby and/or in performance of any agreement
herein, or should an Event of Default otherwise occur hereunder, Beneficiary may, subject to NRS &sect; 107.080, declare all sums secured hereby immediately due by delivery to Trustee of a
written notice of breach and election to sell (which notice Trustee shall cause to be recorded and mailed as required by law). </FONT></P>

sold, but without covenant or warranty, express or implied. Beneficiary and Trustee may bid and purchase at such sale. To the extent of the indebtedness secured hereby, Beneficiary need not bid for
cash at any sale of all or any portion of the Property pursuant hereto, but the amount of any successful bid by Beneficiary shall be applied in reduction of said indebtedness. Trustor hereby agrees,

right of Beneficiary to execute and deliver to Trustee, as above provided, other notices of breach and election to sell, nor otherwise affect any term, covenant or condition hereof or under any
