                          [LETTERHEAD OF ACE LIMITED]

October 29, 2001

Mr. Evan Greenberg

Dear Evan,

Further to our recent discussions, please now find attached the main elements of
compensation relative to our offer of employment to you as Chief Executive
Reinsurance Operations and Vice Chairman ACE Limited, subject to the formality
of obtaining a Bermuda work permit.

You will in addition, participate in all the benefit plans enjoyed by our senior
executive group, which includes an executive medical program as well as
financial and tax planning.

For the sake of clarity, I should also point out that ACE is required to deduct
Government Payroll Tax on compensation, which, in your case will amount to
approximately $10,000. All other local taxes are absorbed by the Company. As you
would expect, ACE withholds income tax from US citizens and complies with all US
reporting obligations.

Our Long Term Incentive program anticipates annual awards and the level of
options follows advice from William Mercer & Co. regarding the Black Scholes
value which presently ranges between 40% and 45% of the face value of stock
reflecting the historic volatility of the Company's share price.

Evan, I sincerely hope that you will find our offer attractive and feel certain
that your capabilities will add significantly to ACE development. I shall really
look forward to working with you again in this very dynamic environment.

Yours sincerely,

Brian Duperreault
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
