                (1) "ADP-Glucose Receptor," USSN 60/234,025, filed September 20,
                2000 (UC Case No. 2001-001) and (2) "Discovery of the KiSS
                Receptor" (UC Case No. 2002-240-1). The term of the exclusive
                option agreement, UC Control No. 2000-11-0134, under which

                Agreements expired on October 30, 2002.

        (2)     Pursuant to the rights granted in the exclusive option
                agreement, UC Control No. 2000-11-0134, NeoGene entered into two
                Drug PfinderTM Agreements with Pfizer with respect to
                "ADP-Glucose Receptor" and "KiSS Receptor".

                above defined Regent's Patent Rights and Regents has no further
                obligations to NeoGene regarding the above defined Regent's
                Patent Rights.

        (4)     Regents, NeoGene and Pfizer desire that the Drug PfinderTM
                Agreements continue, and Pfizer and Regents are in a position to

        Agreement:

        (1)     NeoGene confirms that NeoGene has no further rights in the above

                and requests that Regents be the successor party to NeoGene in
                the Drug PfinderTM Agreements. Further, NeoGene specifically
                waives any claims and rights against Pfizer that it now has or
                may have had in the future in connection with the Drug PfinderTM
                Agreements.

        (2)     The Regents agrees to be bound by terms and conditions contained
                in the Drug PfinderTM Agreements as if Regents were the original
