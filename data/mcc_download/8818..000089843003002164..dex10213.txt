Agreement, the right of the Employee voluntarily to terminate his employment
with the Company or a Subsidiary.

ARTICLE III - PERIOD OF EXERCISABILITY

3.1      Commencement of Exercisability

         (a) The Option will vest (become available for exercise) nine years and
         nine months from the date the Option was granted. However, if certain
         conditions are met, the Option will become eligible for accelerated or
         early vesting three years from the date the Option was granted or on
         subsequent anniversary dates thereafter.

                  Such early or accelerated vesting will occur provided that the
         Company's return on total capital as reported in the annual report to
         shareholders (or other report) for the most recently completed fiscal
         year equals or exceeds the sixty-seventh (67%) percentile of the return
         on total capital for the peer group companies (as listed in the
         Company's proxy statement) for such third year (the performance test).
         (For example, the performance test for accelerated vesting for options
         granted in December 2002 will be based on the return on total capital
         for 2005).

                  To facilitate the peer group performance comparison needed to
         determine whether option vesting is accelerated, the figures for peer
         group companies return on total capital will be based upon the
         twelve-month performance for each company in the peer group closest to
         the Company's fiscal year end, using the most recent publicly available
         financial information for such companies.

                  If the Company meets the performance test described above, all
         prior non-vested Options eligible for accelerated vesting will become
         available for exercise as soon as possible following the Committee's
         certifications of the Company's performance as compared to the
         performance of the peer group companies.

                  If the Company fails to meet the performance test described
         above, all prior non-vested Options eligible for accelerated vesting
         will be subject to a similar performance test following the end of the
         next fiscal year. The test for accelerated vesting of Options will
         continue to "roll" in the manner described above until the Company
         passes the performance test, until nine years and nine months have
         elapsed from the date of grant, or until such Options otherwise vest as
         described herein.

                  Alternatively, Options, granted to employees as participants
         in the Long Term Incentive Plan, who (i) retire under the Company's
         retirement plan within sixty (60) days of the date of Termination of
         Employment, (ii) have worked for the Company for ten (10) or more
         years, and (iii) have a combination of age and service with the Company
         of seventy five (75) or more, will vest as of the date of Termination
         of Employment, provided that the Company has met the performance test
         (as described above) for the fiscal year ending prior to the employee's
         retirement.

         (b) No portion of the Option which is an unexercisable installment
         under Subsection (a) above at Termination of Employment shall
         thereafter become exercisable, unless otherwise determined by the
         Committee in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

         (c) Notwithstanding Subsections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b) above, upon a Change
         of Control, all Option installments not yet exercisable shall become
         immediately exercisable.

                                        3

<PAGE>

3.2      Term of Option

         The Option will expire and will not be exercisable after the tenth
(10th) anniversary of the date the Option was granted. Such date shall be the
Option's Expiration Date.

3.3      Exercise of Option after Termination of Employment

         This Option is exercisable by the Employee only while he is employed by
the Company or a Subsidiary, subject to the following exceptions (or as
authorized by the Committee):

         (a) If the Employee dies while the Option, or any portion thereof, is
         exercisable under the terms of this Agreement, the Employee's
         Beneficiary may exercise such rights, subject to the limitation in
         Subsection 3.1(b). The Option must be exercised within twelve (12)
         months after the Employee's death, and the Committee may in its
         discretion extend the Expiration Date of the Option to accommodate such
         exercise.

         (b) If the Employee's employment is terminated due to his permanent and
         total disability, as defined in Section 22(c)(3) of the Code, the
         Employee may exercise the Option, subject to the limitation in
         Subsection 3.1(b), within thirty-six (36) months after Termination
         of Employment, but not later than the Option's Expiration Date.

         (c) If the Employee's employment is terminated due to his retirement,
         the Employee may exercise the Option, subject to the limitation of
         Subsection 3.1(b), within sixty (60) months after Termination of
         Employment, but not later than the Option's Expiration Date.

         (d) If the Employee's employment is terminated other than for good
         cause or the reasons set forth in Subsections (a) through (c) above,
         the Employee may exercise the Option, subject to the limitations of
         Subsection 3.1(b), within six (6) months after Termination of
         Employment, but not later than the Option's Expiration Date.

          Such early or accelerated vesting will occur provided that the
     Company's return on total capital as reported in the annual report to
     shareholders (or other report) for the most recently completed fiscal year
     equals or exceeds the sixty-seventh (67%) percentile of the return on total
     capital for the peer group companies (as listed in the Company's proxy
     statement) for such third year (the performance test). (For example, the
     performance test for accelerated vesting for options granted in December
     2002 will be based on the return on total capital for 2005).

          To facilitate the peer group performance comparison needed to
     determine whether option vesting is accelerated, the figures for peer group
     companies return on total capital will be based upon the twelve-month
     performance for each company in the peer group closest to the Company's
     fiscal year end, using the most recent publicly available financial
     information for such companies.

          If the Company meets the performance test described above, all prior
     non-vested Options eligible for accelerated vesting will become available
     for exercise as soon as possible following the Committee's certifications
     of the Company's performance as compared to the performance of the peer
     group companies.

          If the Company fails to meet the performance test described above, all
     prior non-vested Options eligible for accelerated vesting will be subject
     to a similar performance test following the end of the next fiscal year.
     The test for accelerated vesting of Options will continue to "roll" in the
     manner described above until the Company passes the performance test, until
     nine years and nine months have elapsed from the date of grant, or until
     such Options otherwise vest as described herein.

          Alternatively, Options, granted to employees as participants in the
     Long Term Incentive Plan, who (i) retire under the Company's retirement
     plan within sixty (60) days of the date of Termination of Employment, (ii)
     have worked for the Company for ten (10) or more years, and (iii) have a
     combination of age and service with the Company of seventy five (75) or
     more, will vest as of the date of Termination of Employment, provided that
     the Company has met the performance test (as described above) for the
     fiscal year ending prior to the employee's retirement.

     (b) No portion of the Option which is an unexercisable installment under
     Subsection (a) above at Termination of Employment shall thereafter become
     exercisable, unless otherwise determined by the Committee in accordance
     with the terms of the Plan.

     (c) Notwithstanding Subsections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b) above, upon a Change of
     Control, all Option installments not yet exercisable shall become
     immediately exercisable.

3.2  Term of Option
     --------------

     The Option will expire and will not be exercisable after the tenth (10th)
anniversary of the date the Option was granted. Such date shall be the Option's
Expiration Date.

3.3  Exercise of Option after Termination of Employment
     --------------------------------------------------


                                       3

     This Option is exercisable by the Employee only while he is employed by the
Company or a Subsidiary, subject to the following exceptions:

     (a) If the Employee dies while the Option, or any portion thereof, is
     exercisable under the terms of this Agreement, the Employee's Beneficiary
     may exercise such rights, subject to the limitation in Subsection 3.1(b).
     The Option must be exercised within twelve (12) months after the Employee's
     death, and the Committee may in its discretion extend the Expiration Date
     of the Option to accommodate such exercise.

     (b) If the Employee's employment is terminated due to his permanent and
     total disability, as defined in Section 22(c)(3) of the Code, the Employee
     may exercise the Option, subject to the limitation in Subsection 3.1(b),
     within thirty-six (36) months after Termination of Employment, but not
     later than the Option's Expiration Date.

     (c) If the Employee's employment is terminated due to his retirement, the
     Employee may exercise the Option, subject to the limitation of Subsection
     3.1(b), to the full term of the Option, but not later than the Option's
     Expiration Date.

     (d) If the Employee's employment is terminated other than for good cause or
     the reasons set forth in Subsections (a) through (c) above, the Employee
     may exercise the Option, subject to the limitations of Subsection 3.1(b),
     within six (6) months after Termination of Employment, but not later than
     the Option's Expiration Date.
