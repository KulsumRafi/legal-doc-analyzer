when the Executive's undivided attention and commitment to the needs of the Company would be particularly important; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Executive desires to devote the Executive's time and energy for the benefit of the Company and its stockholders and not to be distracted as a result of a Change in Control. </FONT></P>

the Executive receives the Notice of Termination for Cause. The Executive shall be given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard at the Board Meeting for Cause. The Executive's Termination

directors, stating that in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in the Notice of Termination for Cause, and that conduct constitutes Cause under this

the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall
be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with
respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereon) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the

accounting firms (commonly referred to, as of the date hereof, as a Big Four firm) designated by the Executive and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) (the
"Accounting Firm"), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within fifteen (15)&nbsp;business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that
there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group affecting
the change of control, the Executive shall designate another Big Four accounting firm (subject to the approval of the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) to make the
determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.
Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five (5)&nbsp;days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's
determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the
time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made
("Underpayment") consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;(c) of this Section&nbsp;6 and the
Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly
