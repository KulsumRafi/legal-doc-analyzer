has heretofore established the Alabama National BanCorporation 1999 Long Term Incentive Plan (herein referred to as the &#147;Plan&#148;); and</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><b><font
SIZE=2>WHEREAS</font></b><font size=2>, the Board of Directors of the Company now desires to amend the Plan as permitted by Section 11 of the Plan.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><b><font SIZE=2>NOW,
THEREFORE, </font></b><font size=2>the Plan is hereby amended as described below:</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:6pt;'><font size=2>1.</font><font size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font
size=2>Section 6(d) of the Plan shall be amended by deleting the existing language in its entirety and inserting in lieu thereof the following:</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0.36in; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:6pt;'><font
size=2>(d)</font><font size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><u><font size=2>Method of Exercise</font></u><font size=2>. Stock Options may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the option period, by giving written
notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number of shares to be purchased, accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price, in cash, by check or such other instrument as may be acceptable to the Committee. As determined by the
Committee, in its sole discretion, at or after grant, payment in full or in part may also be made:</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:0.72in; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:6pt;'><font size=2>(i)</font><font
size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font size=2>in the form of unrestricted Stock owned by the optionee or, in the case of the exercise of a Non-Qualified Stock Option, Restricted Stock subject to an award hereunder may be used
for payment (based, in each case, on the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date the option is exercised, as determined by the Committee). If payment of the option exercise price of a Non-Qualified Stock Option is made in whole or in part with
shares of Restricted Stock the shares received upon the exercise of such Stock Option shall be restricted or deferred, as the case may be, in accordance with the original term of the Restricted Stock award in question, except that the Committee may
direct that such restrictions or deferral provisions shall apply only to the number of such shares equal to the number of shares of Restricted Stock surrendered upon the exercise of such option. No shares of unrestricted Stock shall be issued until
full payment therefor has been made. An optionee shall have the rights to dividends or other rights of a stockholder with respect to shares subject to the Stock Option when the optionee has given written notice of exercise and has paid in full for
such shares;</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:0pt;'><font size=2>&nbsp;</font></p> <br><p style='margin-bottom:0pt;text-align:left'><font
