<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change
in Control" means any of the following: (i)&nbsp;50% or more of the voting power or stock or other equity interest in the subject Person is hereafter acquired

merger or consolidation own more than 50% of both the equity interests and voting power of the surviving entity immediately following the merger or consolidation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Controlled

Subsidiary" means any Person with respect to which more than 50% of both the stock or other equity interest and the voting power is owned by the subject

currently known to VLPS. However, as an additional obligation (and not in lieu of any other obligation of Buyer), all Seller Confidential Information (as defined below) relating to or obtained from
Seller or its Affiliates shall be held in confidence by Buyer and each Buyer Authorized Designee to at least as great an extent and in at least the same manner as Buyer protects its own confidential
or proprietary information but using no less than reasonable care. Except as otherwise required by law, neither Buyer nor any Buyer Authorized Designee shall disclose, publish, release, transfer or
otherwise make available Seller Confidential Information in any form to, or for the use or benefit of, any person or entity without Seller's prior written consent during the Term and for a period of
three years thereafter. "Seller Confidential Information" for purposes of this Section&nbsp;14(a) means all proprietary information (whether or not specifically labeled or identified as
confidential), in any form or medium, that is disclosed by Seller or its agents or representatives to Buyer or any Buyer Authorized Designee in the performance of this Supply Agreement that relates to
the business, products, services, research or development of Seller, its suppliers, distributors or customers. Seller Confidential Information includes the following: (i)&nbsp;internal business
information (including information relating to strategic and staffing plans and practices, marketing, promotional and sales plans, practices and programs, training practices and programs, cost, rate
and pricing structures and accounting and business methods); (ii)&nbsp;identities of, individual requirements of, specific contractual arrangements with, and information about, suppliers,
distributors and customers and their confidential information, (iii)&nbsp;trade secrets, trade dress, ideas, inventions, designs, developments, devices, methods, processes and systems (whether or
not patentable or copyrighted and whether or not reduced to practice or fixed in a tangible medium), and (iv)&nbsp;the specific terms and conditions of this Supply Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller Confidential Information shall not include any information (i)&nbsp;that is publicly available other than through the disclosure by Buyer or the Buyer Authorized Designee,
(ii)&nbsp;that was previously known to Buyer or the Buyer Authorized Designee free of any obligation to keep it confidential, excluding any such information that GTG purchased from VLPS pursuant to

form or medium, that is disclosed by Buyer or its agents or representatives to Seller in the performance of this Supply Agreement that relates to the business, products, services, research or
development of Buyer, its suppliers, distributors or customers. Buyer Confidential
Information includes the following: (i)&nbsp;internal business information (including information relating to strategic and staffing plans and practices, marketing, promotional and sales plans,

Buyer without an obligation of non-disclosure, or (iv)&nbsp;that was purchased by GTG pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement or which otherwise relates solely to the assets or business

discontinues being a Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, the confidentiality obligations of this Section&nbsp;14 shall continue to apply to such Person for the remainder of the Term and three years
thereafter. If Buyer or Seller (or a previous Buyer or Seller) breaches the provisions of this Section&nbsp;14, the party aggrieved thereby shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive
or other equitable relief as a remedy for such breach and the breaching party (or its predecessor(s)) waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.
Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for a breach of this Section&nbsp;14, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the limitations and provisions hereafter provided and those provided in the Supply Agreement, Seller shall pay Buyer a rebate with respect to Paid Purchases of
Products (reduced by the amount of Paid Purchases of Products whether during or prior to the applicable period, to the extent of the Products which are or have been sold in such a manner as to
constitute an Excluded Sale(s)) purchased under the Supply Agreement to which this is attached (the "Supply Agreement") and Delivered by Seller pursuant to the Supply Agreement
************************************************** ***************************************************************************************************
*************************************************************************************************** ***************************************************************************************************
*************************************************************************************************** *********************************************. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if
including the purchase of any particular Product in the computation of a rebate hereunder would reduce the aggregate rebate that would be payable but for the inclusion of the purchase of such Product,
the purchase of such Product shall be excluded from the computation of the rebate (although such purchase shall be included for purposes of Section&nbsp;2 below). The defined terms in the Supply
Agreement shall have the meanings in this Annex that such terms have in the Supply Agreement and this Annex shall in all respects be deemed to be a part of the Supply Agreement. Buyer will promptly
report to Seller any and all Excluded Sales and, in the event Seller pays or has paid any amounts as rebates with respect to Excluded Sales, the Buyer will promptly repay such amounts to Seller on
demand from Seller. ******************************************** **************************************************************************************************

plus (D)&nbsp;any royalties paid by Seller to any Person that is not an Affiliate of Seller that are applicable to such Product, and (ii)&nbsp;the factory overhead cost allocable to each Product
shall be equal to the direct labor cost allocable to such Product multiplied by the factory overhead rate ("FOR") allocable to such Product, as determined by Seller in accordance with

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Overhead

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The

<P><FONT SIZE=2>In
July&nbsp;2003, the Buyer and Seller will review the FACs determined as described above and, if the actual or projected costs (determined by Seller in accordance with Section&nbsp;3(c) below)
vary by more than 10% from the amounts used through June&nbsp;30, 2003, the FACs will be adjusted up or down effective July&nbsp;1, 2003, for Products sold during the remainder of 2003; otherwise,
the FAC for Products shall remain unchanged for the balance of 2003. For all Product sales during each calendar year beginning in 2004, the FAC for each Product will be determined or estimated by
Seller (in accordance with Section&nbsp;3(c) below) not later than November&nbsp;30 of the preceding year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;All
determinations by Seller of the FAC for each Product shall be made in good faith and, except as provided otherwise in Section&nbsp;3(b) above, shall be based
Seller's books and records maintained in accordance with generally accepted and consistently applied accounting principles, as normally applied by Seller. Seller's determination of the FOR allocable
to each Product will, except as provided otherwise in Section&nbsp;3(b) above, be based on Seller's estimate of indirect costs that are properly allocable to the manufacture of such Product. Seller
shall determine or estimate the FOR for the Products in a fair and reasonable manner, consistent with its determination thereof for Division Products. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, if there is ever an extraordinary change in the costs incurred or which will be incurred by Seller from those used in establishing any FAC, Seller shall, except as hereafter otherwise
provided, after Seller learns of such change and its impact on this provision, adjust the FAC on a prospective basis (until the next change is to take place and be effective) so that Seller is neither
positively or negatively impacted by such change (taking into account the timing of the change(s) in costs incurred and/or to be incurred); provided, however, (i)&nbsp;a change shall be deemed to be
extraordinary if and only if the impact is to cause the FAC for any such Product expected to be produced prior to the time the next change is to take place and be effective to be more than 10% higher
or lower than the amount then being used and (ii)&nbsp;a change shall not take effect until the date reasonably established by Seller in a notice to Buyer which shall be at least ninety
(90)&nbsp;days after the date of such notice by Seller to Buyer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Seller
will deliver to Buyer a notice setting forth the FACs and the FORs determined by it pursuant hereto on each occasion that FACs and FORs are determined under
Section&nbsp;3(c) hereof. Such notice shall be accompanied by reasonably detailed calculations and estimates showing how the FACs and FORs were calculated. </FONT></P>

will, upon reasonable notice to Seller, have the right to have audited Seller's determination of its FACs and FORs for the Products (and nothing else, except that
the audit may include such review of the FACs and FORs for Division Products as may be necessary to confirm Seller has complied with its obligations under this Annex) once with respect to each
calendar year in the manner provided below. Buyer's audit right for each calendar year will expire unless Buyer delivers to Seller by March&nbsp;31
of the year following the year to be audited notice of Buyer's intent to conduct an audit. With respect to each such audit: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buyer
shall select a reputable, independent firm of certified public accountants which shall be reasonably acceptable to Seller (the "Buyer Auditor") to conduct the
audit. Upon receipt of reasonable prior notice, Seller shall cooperate fully and completely in responding to reasonable questions and requests for information (including, if requested and reasonable,
permitting the Buyer Auditor to have full access to all books and records of Seller related to the determination of the FACs or FORs being audited and any relevant accountants' work papers prepared in
determining such FACs or FORs) submitted by the Buyer Auditor. However, the analysis by the Buyer Auditor will be limited to the Products only and confirming whether Seller complied with the
provisions of Sections 3(a), (b)&nbsp;and (c)&nbsp;above in the determination of the FACs and the FORs. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;If,
following an audit, the Buyer Auditor determines that any of the FACs or FORs applied by Seller were not correct, based on the methodology and analysis to be
applied pursuant to this Section&nbsp;3, Buyer shall deliver written notice thereof to Seller, together with a statement setting forth the Buyer Auditor's calculations of the correct FACs or FORs.
Within 15&nbsp;days of the receipt of any such notice, Seller shall advise Buyer in writing that it either accepts or does not accept the calculations submitted by the Buyer Auditor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
Seller and Buyer cannot agree on any FAC or FOR calculation within 10&nbsp;days of the date the Buyer Auditor delivers its calculations to Seller, Seller and
Buyer will select an independent auditor who is a certified public accountant to finally determine as quickly as possible the FAC and FOR calculations. If Buyer and Seller cannot agree on the
independent auditor the independent auditor will be determined as the "Accountants" are determined under the Asset Purchase Agreement. Seller and Buyer shall share the costs of the independent auditor
equally and the decision of the independent auditor shall be binding. </FONT></P>

are or have been sold in such a manner as to constitute an Excluded Sale(s)), Buyer is not entitled to such rebates because its Paid Purchase of Products (reduced by the amount of Paid Purchases of
Products whether during or prior to the applicable period, to the extent of the Products which are or have been sold in such a manner as to constitute an Excluded Sale(s)) do not satisfy the required
minimum applicable to such year or for any other reason, then Buyer shall promptly repay to Seller any such rebate paid with respect to such year. Not later than 60&nbsp;days after the close of each
calendar quarter during the Term, Seller will deliver to Buyer a document reflecting the calculations (in reasonable detail) used by Seller in determining the rebate, if any, which is owed pursuant to
this Supply Agreement. Such calculations shall be shown in such report in sufficient detail to enable Buyer to reasonably determine the accuracy thereof. </FONT></P>
