                            ASSIGNMENT AND ACCEPTANCE

         Reference is made to the $50,000,000 Term Credit Agreement, dated as of

"Borrower"), Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Inc. as guarantor (the "Guarantor"),
the Lenders and Arranger named therein, and Australia and New Zealand Banking
Group Limited as administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the

meaning. This Assignment and Acceptance, among the Agent, the Assignor, the
Assignee, the Borrower, and the Guarantor (each as identified on Schedule 1
hereto) is dated as of the Effective Date (as specified on Schedule 1 hereto,
the "Effective Date").

         The Assignor hereby irrevocably sells and assigns to the Assignee
without recourse to the Assignor, and the Assignee hereby irrevocably purchases
and assumes from the Assignor without recourse to the Assignor, as of the
Effective Date, the interest described on Schedule 1 (the "Assigned Interest").

         The Assignor: (1) makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations
made in or in connection with the Credit Agreement or the execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of the Credit
Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto, other
than that it has not created any adverse claim upon the interest being assigned
by it hereunder and that such interest is free and clear of any adverse claim;
(2) makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to the financial condition of any of the Borrower or the Guarantor or
the performance or observance by any of the Borrower or the Guarantor of any of
its respective obligations under the Credit Agreement or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; and (3) attaches the Note(s) held
by it evidencing the Assigned Interest and requests that the Agent exchange such
Note(s) for a new Note or Notes in the form of Notes payable to the Assignor (if
the Assignor has retained any interest in the Assigned Interest) and a new Note
or Notes in the form of Notes payable to the Assignee in the respective amounts
which reflect the assignment being made hereby (and after giving effect to any
other assignments which have become effective on the Effective Date).

         The Assignee: (1) represents and warrants that it is legally authorized
to enter into this Assignment and Acceptance; (2) confirms that it has received
a copy of the Credit Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements
delivered pursuant to Section 4.01(e) thereof and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Assignment and Acceptance; (3) agrees that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Assignor, the Agent or any other
person which has become a Lender and based on such documents and information as
it

shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under the Credit Agreement or any of the Notes; (4)
appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and
to exercise such powers under the Credit Agreement as are delegated to the Agent
by the terms thereof, together with such powers as are incidental thereto; (5)
agrees that it will be bound by the provisions of the Credit Agreement and will
perform in accordance with its terms all the obligations which by the terms of
the Credit Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender; and (6)
represents and warrants that the Borrower is not an "affiliate" of the Assignee
for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C.
Sections 371c and 371c-1).

         Following the execution of this Assignment and Acceptance, it will be
delivered to the Agent for acceptance by it and recording by the Agent,
effective as of the Effective Date (which shall not, unless otherwise agreed to
by the Agent, be earlier than five Business Days after the date of acceptance
and recording by the Agent of the executed Assignment and Acceptance).

         Upon such acceptance and recording, from and after the Effective Date,
the Agent shall make all payments in respect of the Assigned Interest (including
payments of principal, interest, fees and other amounts) to the Assignee,
whether such amounts have accrued prior to the Effective Date or accrue
subsequent to the Effective Date. The Assignor and the Assignee shall make all
appropriate adjustments in payments by the Agent for periods prior to the
Effective Date or with respect to the making of this Assignment directly between
themselves. From and after the Effective Date: (1) the Assignee shall be a party
to the Credit Agreement and, to the extent provided in this Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender thereunder and under the
Notes and shall be bound by the provisions thereof, and (2) the Assignor shall,
to the extent provided in this Agreement and Acceptance, relinquish its rights
and be released from its obligations under the Credit Agreement.

         The parties hereto: (1) acknowledge that the parent company of Assignee
holds an interest in the stock of the Borrower; and (2) agree that for the
purposes of this Assignment and Acceptance, the Assignee shall be an "Eligible
Assignee" notwithstanding the proviso contained in the last sentence of the
definition of "Eligible Assignee" in Section 1.01 of the Credit Agreement.

         This Assignment and Acceptance shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

In Witness Whereof, the parties hereto have caused this Assignment and
Acceptance to be executed on Schedule 1 hereto by their respective duly
authorized officers.
