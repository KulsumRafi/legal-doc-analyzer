of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then such dispute shall be submitted and finally settled by arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.

a waiver of any other breach of such terms or conditions or any other term or condition, nor shall any failure to enforce any provision hereof operate as a waiver of such provision or of any other
provision hereof; provided, however, that no such written wavier, unless it, by its own terms, explicitly provides to the contrary, shall be construed to effect a continuing waiver of the provision
being waived and no such waiver in any instance shall constitute a waiver in any other instance or for
any other purpose or impair the right of the party against whom such waiver is claimed in all other instances or for all other purposes to require full compliance with such provision. Each of the
parties hereto agrees to execute all such further instruments and documents and to take all such further action as the other party may reasonably require in order to effectuate the terms and purposes
of this Agreement. </FONT></P>

invalid, inoperative or unenforceable as applied to any particular case in any jurisdiction or jurisdictions, or in all jurisdictions or in all cases, because of the conflict of any provision with any
constitution or statute or rule of public policy or for any other reason, such circumstance shall not have the effect of rendering the provision or provisions in question invalid, inoperative or
unenforceable in any other jurisdiction or in any other case or circumstance or of rendering any other provision or provisions herein contained invalid, inoperative or unenforceable to the extent that
such other provisions are not themselves actually in conflict with such constitution, statute or rule of public policy, but this Agreement shall be reformed and construed in any such jurisdiction or
case as if such invalid, inoperative or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein and such provision reformed so that it would be valid, operative and enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted in such jurisdiction or in such case. </FONT></P>
