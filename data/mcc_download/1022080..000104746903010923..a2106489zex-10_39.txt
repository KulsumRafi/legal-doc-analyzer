Year under this Bonus Plan is January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003.

3.   CALCULATION OF BONUS AMOUNTS

Bonuses will be calculated under this Bonus Plan for Eligible Employees based on
a combination of the financial performance of Midway and Management's evaluation
of the degree to which an Eligible Employee meets his or her individual
performance goals. The calculation of bonuses will be in accordance with the
following formula:

   Base Salary X Employee Target Bonus Percentage X Individual
     Performance Percentage X Company Performance Percentage = Bonus Paid

     EMPLOYEE TARGET BONUS PERCENTAGE: Management, in its sole discretion, will
assign each Eligible Employee an Employee Target Bonus Percentage based, among
other things, on such employee's standing within the Company.

     COMPANY PERFORMANCE PERCENTAGE: After Midway's fiscal year end results have
been determined by the Company in its sole discretion, Management will calculate
the Company Performance Percentage. This determination will be based on a
comparison of Midway's Actual Net Income versus Midway's Target Net Income for
the Year.

     If Actual Net Income equals Target Net Income, the Company Performance
Percentage will be 100%.

     The Company Performance Percentage will be increased to the extent Actual
Net Income exceeds Target Net Income, at the rate of 2% for each 1% of excess,
up to a maximum Company Performance Percentage of 200%.

     The Company Performance Percentage will be decreased to the extent Actual
Net Income is less than Target Net Income, at the rate of 2% for each 1% of
shortfall, provided, however, if Actual Net Income is below 50% of Target Net
Income, the Company Performance Percentage will be zero.

     Examples of the calculation of the Company Performance Percentage follow:

          150% or more of Target                         200%
              140% of Target                             180%
              130% of Target                             160%
              120% of Target                             140%
              110% of Target                             120%
              100% of Target                             100%
              95% of Target                               90%
              85% of Target                               70%
              75% of Target                               50%
              65% of Target                               30%
              55% of Target                               10%
         Less than 50% of Target                         Zero
</Table>

     INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE PERCENTAGE: Each Eligible Employee will be assigned
individual performance goals they are expected to achieve during the Year. These
goals will be assigned by Management based on the overall goals of the Company
and the individual employee's responsibilities as they relate to the Company's
goals. As soon as practical after the end of the Year, each Eligible Employee
will receive an annual review of his

                                       -2-
<Page>

or her performance, measured against the individual performance goals that were
established for the Year. Management, in its sole discretion, will assign each
Eligible Employee an Individual Performance Percentage based on such review that
reflects the percentage of the goals that were achieved.

     ADJUSTMENTS TO PERCENTAGES: Any Eligible Employee who changes job
responsibilities during the Year, or otherwise becomes eligible to participate
in the Bonus Plan during the Year may receive an adjusted or prorated Employee
Target Bonus Percentage and Individual Performance Goals, at the sole discretion
of Management.

4.   SAMPLE BONUS CALCULATIONS

     Once all percentages have been determined, bonuses will be calculated as
set forth in the following examples:

                  Employee Target Bonus Percentage = 10%
                  Company Performance Percentage = 100%
                  Individual Performance Percentage = 100%
                       Bonus = 10% of Base Salary (10% X 100% X 100%)


                  Employee Target Bonus Percentage = 10%
                  Company Performance Percentage = 140%
                  Individual Performance Percentage = 90%
                       Bonus = 12.6% of Base Salary (10% X 140% X 90%)

                  Employee Target Bonus Percentage = 10%
                  Company Performance Percentage = 80%
                  Individual Performance Percentage = 90%
                       Bonus = 7.2% of Base Salary (10% X 80% X 90%)

5.   DISTRIBUTION OF BONUSES

     As soon as practicable after Management has completed its calculations
under this Bonus Plan, approximately April 1st, the Bonuses shall be distributed
to Eligible Employees. The amount of Bonus for any such employee is to be
determined by Management in its sole discretion. All Bonuses paid shall be
subject to applicable withholding taxes. Bonuses paid to officers of Midway may
be subject to prior approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of Midway.

6.   ENTIRE AGREEMENT

     This Bonus Plan replaces and supercedes all programs of the Company under
which the Eligible Employees receive bonuses. In addition, this Bonus Plan
supersedes and replaces any and all prior and contemporaneous agreements with
respect to bonuses, whether written or oral, between the Company and any other
party, including, without limitation, any Eligible Employee.

7.   RESERVATION OF RIGHTS

     This Bonus Plan is not a contract. The continuation of the Bonus Plan is at
the sole discretion of the Company, and the Company reserves the right to
revise, modify, amend, rescind or cancel this Bonus Plan at any time and for any
reason, with or without notice. All determinations by the Company regarding the
Bonus to be received by each Eligible Employee are at the discretion of
Management and shall be deemed final upon distribution to such Eligible
Employee. Any decision by the Company to not exercise one or more of its rights
under this Bonus Plan shall not be deemed a waiver of its right to exercise such
rights in the future.
