         Re:   EXCLUSIVE *** SUPPLY AGREEMENT

Ladies and Gentlemen:

               Tag-It Pacific,  Inc.  ("TPI") and Levi Strauss & Co.  ("LS&CO.")
are parties to an Exclusive *** Supply Agreement (the  "Agreement")  under which
TPI is to supply to LS&CO.  components and equipment for the manufacture of ***.
Capitalized terms used in this letter agreement (the "Amendment Letter") and not
otherwise defined have the meanings given them in the Agreement.

BACKGROUND

               The supply and production  calendar TPI and LS&CO.  envisioned at
the time of entry into the Agreement has moved back two months with the start of
garment  production  using the Products  now set for  November 1, 2002.  TPI and
LS&CO. wish to make various amendments to the Agreement to reflect the change in
schedule and to document several additional  agreements.  That is the purpose of
this Amendment Letter.

SCHEDULE CHANGES

               The  Agreement  describes  a number of  obligations  that must be
completed by a specified date and a number of rights whose effectiveness ends on
a specific  date.  TPI and LS&CO.  have agreed to amend the Agreement and extend
those dates in multiple  appropriate  cases to reflect the change in  production
schedule.  For example,  the initial  Contract  Term will now end on November 1,
2004 and the first quarter of the initial  Contract Term will end on January 31,
2003. A complete list of the new dates is set out on EXHIBIT A.

PRODUCT SOURCING

               ***

DEVELOPMENT CENTER

               TPI  will use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts  in order to
ensure that no later than  November 30, 2002,  TPI at its expense  shall have in
place  and be  operating,  at  its  headquarters  facility  in  Woodland  Hills,
California  or other  location  in  California,  a design  center  dedicated  to
research, development and commercialization of the ***. Design center resources,
capabilities and functions shall,

to the extent commercially  reasonable,  include:  (i) evaluation of new fabrics
prior to adoption as a means of "qualifying"  fabrics for application of the ***
and inclusion in LS&CO.'s product lines;  (ii) an ability to  compressively  ***
and recommend appropriate production procedures; (iii) testing and evaluation of
***;  (iv)  maintenance  of a library of  production  ready *** (and  associated
production  specifications) for use by LS&CO. designers;  and (v) maintenance of
staffing  sufficient to cover  seasonal  sample and  production  rollout  demand
including at least one full time developer and possibly a technician to maintain
the machinery and basic sewing equipment  needed to assemble *** components.  To
the extent commercially reasonable,  TPI shall maintain design center operations
for so long as LS&CO.  is purchasing  Products and Additional  Program  Products
from TPI.

EFFECT OF AMENDMENT LETTER

               It is expressly understood that the paragraphs entitled "***" and
Development  Center"  above  create  obligations  on the part of TPI only to use
commercially  reasonable  efforts  to achieve  the  results  described  in those
paragraphs.  A  failure  by TPI to  achieve  the  results  shall  not by  itself
constitute a breach of this  Amendment  Letter or the Agreement It is understood
that,  except as specifically  provided in this Amendment  Letter and subject to
the foregoing  sentences,  nothing in this Amendment Letter amends,  modifies or
limits in any way any provision of the  Agreement.  This  Amendment  Letter is a
writing signed by both LS&CO.  and TPI amending the Agreement as contemplated by
Section 19 (e) of the Agreement.
