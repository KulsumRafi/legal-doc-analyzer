to as the "RECEIVABLES PROPERTY").

                 (b)  On each applicable Effective Date and on the date of
creation of each newly created Receivable (but only so long as no Early
Termination with respect to USFS shall have occurred and be continuing), all of
USFS's right, title and interest in, to and under (i) in the case of each such
Effective Date, all then existing Receivables and all Receivables Property in
respect of such Receivables and (ii) in the case of each such date of creation,
all such newly created Receivables and all Receivables Property in respect of
such Receivables shall be immediately and automatically sold, assigned,
transferred and conveyed to the Company pursuant to paragraph (a) above without
any further action by USFS or any other Person. If USFS shall not have received
payment from the Company of the Purchase Price for any newly created Receivable
and the related Receivables Property on the Payment Date therefor in accordance
with the terms of Section 2.3(b), such newly created Receivable and the
Receivables Property with respect thereto shall, upon receipt of notice from
USFS of such failure to receive payment, immediately and automatically be sold,
assigned, transferred and reconveyed by the Company to USFS without any further
action by the Company or any other Person.

                 (c)  The parties to this Agreement intend that the transactions
contemplated by Sections 2.1(a) and (b) hereby shall be, and shall be treated
as, a purchase by the Company and a sale by USFS of the Purchased Receivables
and the Receivables Property in respect thereof and not a loan secured by such
Purchased Receivables and Receivables Property. All sales of Receivables and
Receivables Property by USFS hereunder shall be without recourse to, or
representation or warranty of any kind (express or implied) by, USFS, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein. The foregoing sale, assignment, transfer
and conveyance does not constitute and is not intended to result in a creation
or assumption by the Company of any obligation of USFS or any other Person in
connection with the Receivables, the Receivables Property or any agreement or
instrument relating thereto, including any obligation to any Obligor. If this
Agreement does not constitute a valid sale, assignment, transfer and conveyance
of all right, title and interest of USFS in, to and under the Purchased
Receivables and the

                                        8
<Page>

Receivables Property in respect thereof despite the intent of the parties
hereto, the parties agree that this Agreement shall constitute a security
agreement under the UCC and applicable law. For this purpose and without being
in derogation of the parties' intent as expressed in this Section 2.1(c), USFS
hereby grants a "security interest" (as defined in the UCC) in the Purchased
Receivables, the Receivables Property in respect thereof and all proceeds
thereof to the Company to secure the prompt and complete payment of a loan
deemed to have been made in an amount equal to the aggregate Purchase Price of
the Purchased Receivables together with all other obligations of USFS hereunder.
The Company and its assigns shall have, in addition to the rights and remedies
which they may have under this Agreement, all other rights and remedies provided
to a secured creditor under the UCC and other applicable law, which rights and
remedies shall be cumulative.

                 (d)  In connection with the foregoing conveyances, USFS agrees
to record and file, at its own expense, financing statements (and continuation
statements with respect to such financing statements when applicable) with
respect to the Receivables and Receivables Property now existing and hereafter
acquired by the Company from USFS meeting the requirements of applicable state
law in such manner and in such jurisdictions as are necessary to perfect the
Company's ownership or security interest in the Receivables and Receivables
Property and to deliver evidence of the execution and delivery of such financing
statements to the Company on or prior to the related Effective Date.

                 (e)  In connection with the foregoing conveyances, USFS agrees
at its own expense, as agent of the Company, to indicate, or cause to be
indicated, on the computer files containing a master database of Receivables
that all Receivables included in such files and all Receivables Property, have
been sold to the Company in accordance with this Agreement.

          Section 2.2    PURCHASE PRICE. The amount payable by the Company to
USFS (the "Purchase Price") for Receivables and Receivables Property on any
Payment Date under this Agreement shall be equal to the product of (a) the
aggregate outstanding Principal Amount of such Receivables as set forth in the
applicable Required Report and (b) the Discounted Percentage.

          Section 2.3    PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE. (a) Upon the fulfillment of
the conditions set forth in Article III, the Purchase Price for Receivables and
the Receivables Property shall be paid or provided for by the Company in the
manner provided below on each day for which a Required Report is delivered
pursuant to Section 4.1 of the Servicing Agreement (each such day, a "Payment
Date") in respect of a Reported Period (which Required Report shall specify the
Principal Amount of Receivables being sold on such Payment Date, the aggregate
Purchase Price for such Receivables and the components of payment as provided in
paragraph (b) below). USFS hereby appoints the Servicer as its agent to receive
payments of the Purchase Price of the Receivables and the Receivables Property
sold to the Company and hereby authorizes the Company to make all such payments
due to USFS directly to an account of, or as otherwise directed by, the
Servicer. The Servicer hereby accepts and agrees to such

                                        9
<Page>

appointment. All payments under this Agreement shall be made not later than
11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the date specified therefor in Dollars in same day
funds or by check, as the Servicer shall elect, and to the bank account
designated in writing by the Servicer to the Company.

                 (b)  The Purchase Price for Receivables and Receivables
Property shall be paid by the Company on each Payment Date as follows:

                             (i)  by netting the amount of any Seller Adjustment
          Payments or Seller Repurchase Payments pursuant to Section 2.5 or 2.6,
          respectively, against such Purchase Price;

                            (ii)  to the extent available for such purpose, in
          cash from the net proceeds of transfers of interests in Purchased
          Receivables by the Company to other Persons including, without
          limitation, the Trustee pursuant to the Pooling Agreement;

                           (iii)  at the option of the Company, by means of an
          addition to the principal amount of the Subordinated Note in an
          aggregate amount equal to the remaining portion of the Purchase Price;
          provided, however, that with respect to any Seller, the outstanding
          principal amount of such Seller's interest in the Subordinated Note
          shall not at any time exceed 25% of the Outstanding Sale Price Amount
          with respect to such Seller (giving effect to such addition); provided
          further that the Company may pay the Purchase Price by means of
          additions to the principal amount of the Subordinated Note only if, at
          the time of such payment and after giving effect thereto, the fair
          market value of the Company's assets, including, without limitation,
          any beneficial interests held by the Company in the Trust and the
          Trust Assets is greater than the amount of its liabilities including,
          without limitation, its liabilities on the Subordinated Note and any
          amount due and payable by the Company under the Pooling Agreement and
          the other Transaction Documents. Any such addition to the principal
          amount of the USFS Subordinated Note shall be allocated among the
          Sellers (PRO RATA according to the Principal Amount of Receivables
          sold by each Seller) by the Servicer in accordance with the provisions
          of this Section 2.3(b)(iii) and Section 8.1. The Servicer may evidence
          such additional principal amounts by recording the date and amount
          thereof on the grid attached to such Subordinated Note, provided that
          the failure to make any such recordation or any error in such grid
          shall not adversely affect USFS's rights; and

                            (iv)  in cash from the proceeds of capital
          contributed by USFS to the Company, if any, in respect of its equity
          interest in the Company.

                 (c)  The Servicer shall be responsible, in its sole discretion
but in accordance with the preceding Section 2.3(b), for allocating among the
Sellers the

                                       10
<Page>

payment of the Purchase Price for Receivables and any amounts netted therefrom
pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(i), which allocation shall be, subject to the first
proviso contained in Section 2.3(b)(iii), either in the form of cash received
from the Company or as an addition to the principal amount of a Seller's
interest in the Subordinated Note.

                 (d)  Whenever any payment to be made under this Agreement shall
be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day. Amounts not paid when due in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall bear interest at a rate equal
at all times to the ABR PLUS 2%, payable on demand.

          Section 2.4    NO REPURCHASE. Except to the extent expressly set forth
herein, USFS shall have no right or obligation under this Agreement, by
implication or otherwise, to repurchase from the Company any Purchased
Receivables or Receivables Property or to rescind or otherwise retroactively
affect any purchase of any Purchased Receivables or Receivables Property after
the Payment Date relating thereto.

          Section 2.5    REBATES, ADJUSTMENTS, RETURNS AND REDUCTIONS;
MODIFICATIONS. From time to time, a Seller under the USSC Receivables Sale
Agreement may make Dilution Adjustments to Receivables in accordance with this
Section 2.5 and Section 5.3(c). USFS agrees to pay to the Company in cash, on
the first Business Day immediately succeeding the date of the grant of any
Dilution Adjustment (regardless of which Seller shall have granted such Dilution
Adjustment), the amount of any such Dilution Adjustment (a "SELLER ADJUSTMENT
PAYMENT"); PROVIDED that, prior to the occurrence of any Early Termination with
respect to all Sellers, any such Seller Adjustment Payment due to the Company on
any Payment Date shall, on such Payment Date, be netted against the Purchase
Price of newly created Receivables in accordance with Section 2.3(b)(i) to the
extent of such Purchase Price and the remaining amount of such Seller Adjustment
Payment due to the Company after such netting, if any, shall be paid to the
Company on such date in cash. The amount of any Dilution Adjustment made with
respect to any Reported Period shall be set forth on the Required Report
prepared with respect to such Reported Period.

          Section 2.6    LIMITED REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS. With respect to
Receivables conveyed to the Company on or after the date hereof, in the event
that (i) any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.2 in respect of
any Receivable transferred to the Company is not true and correct in any
material respect on the applicable Payment Date, or (ii) there is a breach of
any covenant contained in Section 5.1(d), (g) or (h) or Section 5.3 with respect
to any Receivable and such breach has a material adverse effect on the Company's
interest in such Receivable or (iii) the Company's interest in any such
Receivable is not a first priority perfected ownership or security interest at
any time as a result of any action taken by, or any failure to take action by,
USFS, then USFS agrees to pay to the Company in cash an amount equal to the
Purchase Price of such Receivable (whether the Company paid such Purchase Price
in cash or otherwise) less Collections received by the Company in respect of
such Receivable pursuant to the Pooling Agreement, such payment to occur no
later than the next occurring Payment Date; provided that, prior to any Early
Termination with respect

                                       11
<Page>

to all Sellers, any such payment due and owing to the Company on such Payment
Date shall be netted against the Purchase Price of newly created Receivables in
accordance with Section 2.3(b)(i) to the extent of such Purchase Price and the
remaining amount of such payment due to the Company after such netting, if any,
shall be paid to the Company in cash to the extent still unpaid on such Payment
Date. Any payment by any Seller pursuant to this Section 2.6 is referred to as a
"SELLER REPURCHASE PAYMENT." Simultaneously with any Seller Repurchase Payment
with respect to any Receivable, such Receivable and the Receivables Property
with respect thereto shall immediately and automatically be sold, assigned,
transferred and conveyed by the Company to USFS without any further action by
the Company or any other Person.

          Section 2.7    OBLIGATIONS UNAFFECTED. The obligations of USFS to the
Company under this Agreement shall not be affected by reason of any invalidity,
illegality or irregularity of any Receivable or any sale of a Receivable.

          Section 2.8    CERTAIN CHARGES. USFS and the Company agree that late
charge revenue, reversals of discounts, other fees and charges and other similar
items, whenever created, accrued in respect of Purchased Receivables shall be
the property of the Company notwithstanding the occurrence of an Early
Termination and all Collections with respect thereto shall continue to be
allocated and treated as Collections in respect of Purchased Receivables.

          Section 2.9    INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

          Section 2.10   FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time to time at the request of
USFS, the Company shall deliver to USFS such documents, assignments, releases
and instruments of termination as USFS may reasonably request to evidence the
reconveyance by the Company to USFS of a Receivable pursuant to the terms of
Section 2.1(b) or Section 2.6, PROVIDED that the Company shall have been paid
all amounts due thereunder; and the Company and the Servicer shall take such
action as USFS may reasonably request, at the expense of USFS, to assure that
any such Receivable, the Related Property and Collections with respect thereto
do not remain commingled with other Collections hereunder.

          Section 2.11   ADDITIONAL REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS. With respect to
Receivables conveyed to the Company on or after the Closing Date, in the event
of any breach by USFS of any of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.2(a), (b), (c), (e), (f) or (g), as of the date made, which breach has
a material adverse effect on the interests of the Company in such Receivables or
the related Receivables Property, then the Company, by notice then given in
writing to USFS, may direct USFS to purchase all Receivables and Receivables
Property sold by USFS to the Company and USFS shall be obligated to make such
purchase on the next Distribution Date occurring at least five Business Days
after receipt of such notice on the terms and conditions set forth in Section
2.11(b) below; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such purchase shall be required to be
made if, by such Distribution Date, the representations and warranties contained
in Sections 4.2(a), (b), (c), (e), (f) or (g) shall be true and correct in all
material respects, and any material adverse effect on the Company caused thereby
has been cured.

                 (a)  USFS shall, as the purchase price for the Receivables and
Receivables Property to be purchased pursuant to Section 2.11(a) above, pay to
the Company, on the Business Day preceding such Distribution Date, an amount
equal to the Purchase Price of the relevant Purchased Receivables, less
Collections received by the Company pursuant to the Pooling Agreement in respect
of such Purchased Receivables as of such Distribution Date. Upon payment of such
amount, in immediately available funds, to the Company, the Company's rights
with respect to such Purchased Receivables shall terminate and such interest
therein will be transferred to USFS and the Company shall have no further rights
with respect thereto. If the Company gives notice directing USFS to purchase the
Purchased Receivables as provided above, the obligation of USFS to purchase the
Purchased Receivables pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall upon satisfaction
thereof constitute the sole remedy with respect to an event of the type
specified in the first sentence of each of Section 2.11(a)(i) and 2.11(a)(ii)
available to the Company.

OF RECEIVABLES. The obligation of the Company to pay for any Receivable and the
Receivables Property with respect thereto on each Payment Date (including the
Effective Date) shall be subject to the further conditions precedent that, on
and as of such Payment Date:

                 (a)  the following statements shall be true (and the acceptance
by USFS of the Purchase Price for such Receivable on such Payment Date shall
constitute a representation and warranty by USFS that on such Payment Date such
statements are true):

                             (i)  the representations and warranties of USFS
          contained in Section 4.2 shall be true and correct in all material
          respects on and as of such Payment Date as though made on and as of
          such date except to the extent any such representation or warranty is
          expressly made only as of another date (in which case it shall be true
          and correct in all material respects on and as of such other date);

                            (ii)  after giving effect to such purchase, no (A)
          Early Termination or (B) Purchase Termination Event (after giving
          effect to any applicable grace period) shall have occurred and be
          continuing; and

                           (iii)  there has been no material adverse change
          since the date of this Agreement in the collectibility of the
          Receivables taken as a whole;

                 (b)  the Company and the Trustee shall be satisfied that USFS's

                                       17
<Page>

                 (c)  the Company shall have received payment in full of all
amounts for which payment is due from USFS pursuant to Sections 2.5, 2.6 or 7.1;

                 (d)  the Company shall have received such other approvals,
opinions or documents as the Company may reasonably request; and

                 (e)  USFS shall have complied with all of its covenants in all
material respects and satisfied all of its obligations in all material respects
under this Agreement required to be complied with or satisfied as of such date;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure of USFS to satisfy any of the foregoing
conditions shall not prevent USFS from subsequently selling Receivables upon
satisfaction of all such conditions or exercising its rights under Section
2.1(b); PROVIDED, FURTHER, that notwithstanding the foregoing conditions
precedent, upon payment of the Purchase Price for any Receivable (whether by
payment of cash, through an increase in the amounts outstanding under the
Subordinated Note, by offset of amounts owed to Buyer and/or by capital
contributions), title to such Receivable and the Receivables Property with
respect thereto shall vest in the Company, whether or not the conditions
precedent to the Company's obligation to pay for such Receivable were in fact
satisfied. The failure of USFS to satisfy any of the foregoing conditions
precedent, however, shall give rise to a right of USFS to rescind the related
purchase and direct USFS to pay to the Company an amount equal to the Purchase
Price that shall have been made with respect to any Receivables related thereto.

          Section 3.4    CONDITION PRECEDENT TO USFS'S OBLIGATIONS. The
obligation of USFS on each Payment Date (including on the Effective Date) shall
be subject to the condition precedent that, on such date, the following
statement shall be true (and the payment by the Company of the Purchase Price
for such Receivable on such date shall constitute a representation and warranty
by the Company that on such Payment Date such statement is true): (i) no Early
Amortization Event or Potential Early Amortization Event of a type, with respect
to the Company, set forth in Section 7.1(a) of the Pooling Agreement shall have
occurred and be continuing and (ii) no Early Termination, as set forth in
Section 6 of the USSC Receivables Sale Agreement, shall have occurred.

          applicable law, enforceable against creditors of, and purchasers from,
          USFS;

                                       20
<Page>

Material Adverse Effect) under, (A) the articles of organization and limited

over USFS or any of its properties.

                 (g)  NO PROCEEDINGS. There are no actions, suits, proceedings
or investigations at law or in equity (including, without limitation,
injunctions, writs or restraining orders) pending or, to the knowledge of USFS,

asserting the invalidity of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document,
(ii) seeking to prevent the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, or (iii) seeking any
determination or ruling that, individually or in the aggregate, materially and
adversely affect (A) the performance by USFS of its obligations under this

of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; (C) the collectibility of
USFS's Receivables taken as a whole or in any material portion thereof or (D)

                 (h)  BULK SALES ACT. No transaction contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document with respect to USFS requires
compliance with, or will be subject to avoidance under, any "bulk sales" act or
similar law.

                 (i)  APPROVALS. No authorization or approval or other action
by, and no notice to or filing with or any other act by or in respect of, any
governmental authority or regulatory body in the United States of America or any

                                       21
<Page>

                             (i)  USFS has no knowledge of any fact which would
          lead it to expect that such Receivable will not be paid in full when
          due. Each Receivable sold by it hereunder and designated on a Required
          Report to be an Eligible Receivable was or will be, as the case may
          be, at its respective Payment Date, an Eligible Receivable. The
          aggregate outstanding Principal Amount of Receivables so sold by it on
          any Payment Date and so designated as Eligible Receivables was or will
          be, as the case may be, correctly set forth on the Required Report
          with respect to such Payment Date. Each Receivable classified as an
          "Eligible Receivable" by USFS in any document or report delivered
          hereunder satisfies the requirements of eligibility contained in the
          definition of Eligible Receivable.

                            (ii)  Each Receivable, together with any Contract
          with respect thereto, is the legal, valid and binding obligation of
          the related Obligor thereon, enforceable against such Obligor to pay
          the full Principal Amount thereof (and any accrued interest thereon)
          in accordance with its terms.

                           (iii)  Each Receivable, together with any contract,
          instrument and/or agreement related thereto, does not contravene any
          applicable law, rule or regulation (including, without limitation,
          laws, rules or regulations relating to truth in lending, fair credit
          billing, fair credit reporting, equal credit opportunity, fair debt
          collection practices or privacy), which in any way renders such
          Receivable (or any contract, instrument and/or agreement related
          thereto) unenforceable or would otherwise impair in any material
          respect the collectibility of such Receivable.

                            (iv)  USFS has complied in all material respects
          with the applicable Policies with regard to each Receivable and the
          related contracts, instruments and/or agreements, and has not made any
          material change to the Policies, except in accordance with Section
          5.3(d).

                 (k)  OFFICE, LOCATION OF RECORDS. The principal place of
business and the chief executive office of USFS are as indicated on Schedule II
hereto. The offices where USFS keeps its records concerning the Receivables and
related Contracts and all purchase orders and other agreements related to the
Receivables are as indicated on Schedule II hereto (or at such other locations,
notified to the Company in accordance with Section 5.1(i), in jurisdictions
where all action required by Sections 5.1(f)(i) has been taken and completed).
Schedule II hereto accurately and correctly sets forth the following information
with respect to USFS (i) its jurisdiction of organization and organizational
structure, (ii) the place where it is "located" for the purposes of Section
9-307 of the UCC, (iii) its organizational identification number assigned to it
by its jurisdiction of organization, (iv) its Federal Employer Identification
Number, (v) its legal name and (vi) each filing office in which a filing by USFS
of a financing statement on Form UCC-l is required to be made in connection with
the transactions contemplated by

                                       22
<Page>

this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. USFS has not, within the
period of twelve months prior to its Effective Date, (i) changed the location of
its principal place of business and chief executive office, its legal name or
its organizational structure, (ii) changed its "location" (within the meaning of
Section 9-307 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) or (iii) become a "new
debtor" (as defined in Section 9-102(a)(56) of the UCC of all applicable
jurisdictions) with respect to a currently effective security agreement
previously entered into by any other Person. USFS and has not changed its
jurisdiction of organization or organizational structure.

                 (l)  MARGIN REGULATIONS. No use of any funds obtained by USFS
under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents will conflict with or
contravene any of Regulations T, U and X promulgated by the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System from time to time.

                 (m)  QUALITY OF TITLE. USFS is the legal and beneficial owner
of each Receivable and all Receivables Property which is to be transferred to
the Company by USFS, and such Receivables and Receivables Property shall be
transferred by USFS free and clear of any Lien (other than any Lien arising
under any other Transaction Document, arising solely as the result of any action
taken by the Company hereunder); prior to such transfer USFS shall have made all
filings under applicable law in each relevant jurisdiction in order to protect
and perfect the Company's ownership or security interest in all Receivables and
Receivables Property against all creditors of, and purchasers from, USFS; and
the Company shall have acquired and shall continue to have maintained a valid
and perfected first priority ownership or security interest in each Receivable
and the Receivables Property free and clear of any Lien (other than any Lien
arising solely as the result of any action taken by the Company hereunder or by
the Trustee); and no effective financing statement or other instrument similar
in effect covering any Receivable, any interest therein or any Receivables
Property with respect thereto is on file in any recording office except such as
may be filed in favor of (i) the applicable Seller in accordance with the
Contracts, (ii) USFS in accordance with the USSC Receivables Sale Agreement and
(iii) the Company pursuant to this Agreement and (iv) the Trustee pursuant to
the Pooling Agreement.

                 (n)  ACCURACY OF INFORMATION. All factual written information
furnished on or after January 1, 2003 by USFS or its Affiliates (other than the
Company) to the Company for purposes of or in connection with any Transaction
Document or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby is, and all other
such factual, written information hereafter furnished (if prepared by USFS or
any Affiliate or, if not prepared by USFS or any Affiliate, to the extent that
information contained therein was supplied by USFS or any Affiliate) by USFS or
any Affiliate (other than the Company) to the Company pursuant to or in
connection with any Transaction Document shall be, true and accurate in every
material respect on the date such information is stated or certified (unless
such information relates to another date), and such information does not and
will not contain any material misstatement of fact and is not, and shall not be
(as the case may be) incomplete by omitting to state a material fact or any fact
necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading as of such
date.

                                       23
<Page>

                 (o)  PROCEEDS BANKS, PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS. The conditions and
requirements set forth in Section 5.1(c) of this Agreement and Section 2.3 of
the Servicing Agreement have at all times been satisfied and duly performed in
all material respects. The names and addresses of all Lockbox Processors,
together with the account numbers of all Lockbox Accounts at each Lockbox
Processor and the post office box number of each Lockbox are listed on Schedule
III to the USSC Receivables Sale Agreement. The Sellers under the USSC
Receivables Sale Agreement have transferred all of their right, title and
interest in each Lockbox Account to USFS, which will in turn transfer such
interest to the Company. No Seller has granted any Person, other than USFS as
contemplated by this Agreement, dominion and control or "control" (within the
meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) of any
Lockbox or Lockbox Account, or the right to take dominion and control or
"control" (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC of all applicable
jurisdictions) of any such Lockbox or Lockbox Account at a future time or upon
the occurrence of a future event. Each Lockbox and each Lockbox Account is
subject to a Lockbox Agreement that is in full force and effect and each Lockbox
Account is free and clear of any Lien (other than any right of set-off expressly
provided for in the applicable Lockbox Agreement). Each Lockbox Processor has
executed and delivered to the Company a Lockbox Agreement. Each Seller, or the
Servicer on its behalf, has instructed all Obligors to make all payments in
respect of the Receivables and Related Property in accordance with Section
2.3(a) of the Servicing Agreement and Section 5.1(c) of this Agreement.

                 (p)  VALID TRANSFERS. No transfer of any Receivables or any
Receivables Property to the Company by USFS constitutes a fraudulent transfer or
fraudulent conveyance or is otherwise void or voidable under similar laws or
principles, the doctrine of equitable subordination or for any other reason
(including, without limitation, under the Bankruptcy Code). The transfers of
Receivables and Receivables Property by USFS to the Company pursuant to this
Agreement, and all other transactions between USFS and the Company, have been
and will be made in good faith and without intent to hinder, delay or defraud
creditors of USFS, and USFS acknowledges that it has received and will receive
fair consideration and reasonably equivalent value for the purchases by the
Company of Receivables and Receivables Property hereunder and such transfer was
not made for or on account of an antecedent debt. The purchase of Receivables
and Receivables Property by the Company from USFS constitutes a true sale of
such Receivables and Receivables Property under applicable state law.

                 (q)  TRADE NAMES. USFS uses no trade names, fictitious names,
assumed names or "doing business as" names in the furnishing of its products or
services which generate Receivables other than its actual corporate name and the
trade names set forth in Schedule VI and in the case of trade names, only in the
jurisdictions indicated on Schedule VI. During the five years preceding the date
hereof, except as set forth in Schedule VI and in the case of trade names, only
in the jurisdictions indicated on Schedule VI, USFS (i) has not been known by
any legal name or trade name other than its corporate name, and (ii) has not
been the subject of any merger or other corporate reorganization.

                                       24
<Page>

                 (r)  COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. USFS is in material
compliance with the requirements of all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and
orders of all governmental authorities (federal, state, local or foreign, and
including, without limitation, environmental laws), a breach of any of which,
individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely either (i) to have
a material adverse effect on (A) the business, operations, business prospects or
condition (financial or other) of USFS or (B) the ability of USFS to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, or (ii) to
impair the collectibility of any Receivables or any Receivables Property or the
enforceability or validity of any Contract.

                 (s)  TAXES. USFS has filed all federal and all material state
and local tax returns required by law to be filed and has paid or made adequate
provision for the payment of all taxes, assessments and other governmental
charges due from USFS or is contesting any such tax, assessment or other
governmental charge in good faith through appropriate proceedings, except where
such failure would not reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse
Effect. No tax Lien has been filed, and, to the knowledge of USFS, no material
claim is being asserted, with respect to any such taxes. USFS knows of no basis
for any material additional tax assessment for any fiscal year for which
adequate reserves have not been established. For purposes of this paragraph,
"taxes" shall mean any present or future tax, levy, impost, duty, charge,
assessment or fee of any nature (including interest, penalties and additions
thereto) that is impose by any Governmental Authority.

                 (t) ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. USFS will not prepare any financial
statements that account for the transactions contemplated hereby in a manner
which is, nor will it in any other respect (except for tax purposes) account for
the transactions contemplated hereby in a manner which is, inconsistent with the
Company's ownership interest in the Receivables and Receivables Property.

                 (u)  ERISA MATTERS.

                             (i) Except as specifically disclosed in Schedule
          VIII hereto, USFS and each of its ERISA Affiliates are in compliance
          in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and
          the regulations and published interpretations thereunder with respect
          to each Plan of USFS or any of its ERISA Affiliates, except for such
          noncompliance which could not reasonably be expected to result in a
          Material Adverse Effect with respect to USFS.

                            (ii) No Reportable Event has occurred as to which
          USFS or any of its ERISA Affiliates was required to file a report with
          the PBGC, other than reports for which the 30-day notice requirement
          is waived, reports that have been filed and reports the failure of
          which to file would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
          Adverse Effect with respect to USFS.

                                       25

                           (iii)  Except as specifically disclosed in Schedule
          VIII hereto, as of the Effective Date, the present value of all
          benefit liabilities under each Plan of USFS or any of its ERISA
          Affiliates (on an ongoing basis and based on those assumptions used to
          fund such Plan) did not, as of the last valuation report applicable
          thereto, exceed the value of the assets of such Plan, except to the
          extent that such excess would not have a Material Adverse Effect with
          respect to USFS.

                            (iv)  Neither USFS nor any of its ERISA Affiliates
          has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that could reasonably be
          expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to USFS.

                             (v)  Neither USFS nor any of its ERISA Affiliates
          has received any notification that any Multiemployer Plan is in
          reorganization or has been terminated within the meaning of Title IV
          of ERISA, or that a reorganization or termination has resulted or
          could reasonably be expected to result, through increases in the
          contributions required to be made to such Plan or otherwise, in a
          Material Adverse Effect with respect to such USFS.

                             (v)  CREDIT AND COLLECTION POLICIES. Schedule IV
          accurately describes such USFS's Policies relating to Contracts and
          Receivables in effect on the Closing Date.

                 (w)  SOLVENCY. Both prior to and after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, (i) the assets of USFS,
at fair valuation, will exceed its debts and liabilities (including contingent
liabilities), (ii) the capital of USFS will not be unreasonably small to conduct
its business, (iii) USFS will not have incurred debts, and does not intend to
incur debts, beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature, taking into
account the timing of and amounts of cash to be received by it and the timing of
and amounts of cash to be payable in respect of its Indebtedness and (iv) the
present fair salable value of the property of USFS will be greater than the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of USFS on its
debts and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such
debts and liabilities become absolute and matured. For all purposes of clauses
(i) through (iv) above, the amount of contingent liabilities at any time shall
be computed as the amount that, in the light of all the facts and circumstances
existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to
become an actual or matured liability.

                 (x)  INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. Neither USFS nor any of USFS's
Subsidiaries is (i) an "investment company" registered under, nor after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated hereby will be required to be registered
under, the 1940 Act, or (ii) a "holding company", or a "subsidiary company" of a
"holding company" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, as amended.

                 (y)  OWNERSHIP. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock
of USFS is owned, directly or indirectly, by United Stationers Inc, free and
clear of any

                                       26
<Page>

Lien, other than any Lien in favor of the administrative agent under the Credit
Agreement.

                 (z)  MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT. Since the date of September 30,
2002, no event has occurred that has had, or would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on (A) the financial condition or operations of
USFS and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole except as disclosed in USI's current
report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 31, 2003 or otherwise disclosed
in writing to the Trustee prior to the Closing Date, (B) the ability of USFS, to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents,
or (C) the collectibility of the Receivables generally or any material portion
of the Receivables.

                 (aa) ECEIVABLES DOCUMENTS. Upon the delivery, if any, by USFS
to the Company of licenses, rights, computer programs, related materials,
computer tapes, disks, cassettes and data relating to the administration of the
Purchased Receivables pursuant to Section 5.1(r), the Company shall have been
furnished with all materials and data reasonably necessary to permit timely
collection of the Purchased Receivables without the participation of USFS in
such collection.

          The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 4.2 shall
survive the transfer and assignment of the respective Receivables to the Company
pursuant to this Agreement. USFS hereby represents and warrants to the Company,
as of the Effective Date and each Payment Date, that the representations and
warranties of USFS set forth in Section 4.2 are true and correct in all material
respects as of such date, except for any representation and warranty
specifically made as of an earlier date (including those made by the Sellers in
the USSC Receivables Sale Agreement), in which case such representation and
warranty shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier
date. Upon discovery by a Responsible Officer of USFS or a Responsible Officer
of the Company, respectively, of any material breach of any of the foregoing
representations and warranties, the party discovering such breach shall give
prompt written notice to the other.

                                    ARTICLE V

                                GENERAL COVENANTS

          Section 5.1    AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS OF USFS. USFS covenants that,
until the Purchase Termination Date shall have occurred and there are no amounts
outstanding with respect to the Purchased Receivables (other than Charged-off
Receivables):

                 (a)  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Furnish to the Company (i) as soon
as available, but in any event within 60 days after the close of the first three
(3) quarterly periods of each of USFS's fiscal years, and within 125 days after
the close of the fourth quarterly period of each of USFS's fiscal years, balance
sheets of USFS and its

                                       27
<Page>

consolidated subsidiaries, each as at the close of each such period, and
statements of income and retained earnings and a statement of cash flows for
USFS and its consolidated Subsidiaries, each for such quarter, all certified by
an appropriate Responsible Officer as fairly presenting the financial position
and the results of operations of USFS and its consolidated Subsidiaries;

                 (b)  PRESERVATION OF CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND NAME. USFS will
preserve and maintain in all respects its existence, rights, franchises and
privileges in the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, as the case
may be, and qualify and remain qualified in good standing as a foreign entity in
each jurisdiction where the failure to so qualify and be in good standing would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                 (c)  MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTY. USFS will keep all material
tangible property useful and necessary in its business in good working order and
condition (normal wear and tear excepted), except to the extent that the failure
to do any of the foregoing with respect to any such property would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

                 (d)  COLLECTIONS. USFS will cause (1) all proceeds from all
Lockboxes to be directly deposited by a Lockbox Processor into a Lockbox Account
and (2) each Lockbox and Lockbox Account to be subject at all times to a Lockbox
Agreement that is in full force and effect. USFS will instruct, or cause the
Servicer to instruct, all Obligors to pay all Collections directly to a Lockbox
or Lockbox Account. In the event any payments relating to Receivables are
remitted directly to USFS or any Affiliate of USFS, USFS will remit all such
payments (or will cause all such payments to be remitted) directly to the
applicable Lockbox Processor and deposited into the applicable Lockbox Account
within one Business Day following receipt thereof, and, at all times prior to
such remittance, USFS or such Affiliate will itself hold or, if applicable, will
cause such payments to be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of the Company
and its assigns (including the Trustee and the Holders). USFS shall not grant or
purport to grant the right to take dominion and control or establish or purport
to establish "control" (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC of all
applicable jurisdictions) of any Lockbox or Lockbox Account at a future time or
upon the occurrence of a future event to any Person, except to the Trustee as
contemplated by this Agreement, the USSC Receivables Sale Agreement and the
Pooling Agreement. With respect to each Lockbox and Lockbox Account, USFS shall
take all steps necessary to ensure that the Trustee has "control" (within the
meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) over each
such Lockbox and Lockbox Account.

                 (e)  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, ETC. USFS shall comply in all
respects with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders applicable to
USFS and the Receivables and the Receivables Property, including, without
limitation, rules and regulations relating to truth in lending, fair credit
billing, fair credit reporting, equal credit opportunity, fair debt collection
practices and privacy, where failure to so comply would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                 (f)  VISITATION RIGHTS. At any reasonable time during normal
business hours and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice, USFS shall
permit (i)

                                       28
<Page>

the Company, or any of its assignees, agents or representatives, (A) to examine
and make copies of and abstracts from the records, books of account and
documents (including, without limitation, computer tapes and disks) of USFS
relating to Receivables and Receivables Property owned or to be purchased by the
Company hereunder, including, without limitation, the related Contracts and
purchase orders and other agreements and (B) following the termination of the
appointment of USFS as Servicer, to be present at the offices and properties of
USFS to administer and control the collection of amounts owing on the Purchased
Receivables and (ii) the Company, or any of its assignees, agents or
representatives, or the Trustee (upon the giving of appropriate notice to the
Company) to visit the properties of USFS for the purpose of examining such
records, books of account and documents, and to discuss the affairs, finances
and accounts of USFS relating to the Receivables or USFS's performance hereunder
or under any other Transaction Document with any of its officers, employees or
directors and with its independent certified public accountants; provided, that
the Company or its assignees, agents or representatives, as the case may be,
shall notify USFS prior to any contract with such accountants and shall give
USFS the opportunity to participate in such discussions.

                 (g)  KEEPING OF RECORDS AND BOOKS OF ACCOUNT. USFS will
maintain and implement administrative and operating procedures (including,
without limitation, an ability to recreate records evidencing Receivables and
the Receivables Property in the event of the destruction of the originals
thereof), and keep and maintain proper books of records and account in which
full, true and correct entries in conformity in all material respects with GAAP
and all Requirements of Law shall be made of all dealings and transactions in
relation to its business and activities, including without limitation, all
documents, books, records and other information which, in each case, in the
reasonable discretion of the Company or its assignees, are necessary or
advisable for the collection of all Receivables and the Receivables Property
(including, without limitation, records adequate to permit the identification of
each new Receivable and all Collections of and adjustments to each existing
Receivable).

                 (h) PERFORMANCE AND COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES, RECEIVABLES AND
CONTRACTS. USFS will (i) perform its obligations in accordance with and comply
in all material respects with the Policies, as amended from time to time in
accordance with the Transaction Documents and (ii) at its expense timely and
fully perform and comply with all material provisions, covenants and other
promises required to be observed by it under the Receivables and the Contracts
related to the Receivables and Receivables Property and all purchase orders and
other agreements related to such Receivables and Receivables Property.

                 (i) OBLIGATIONS. In addition to its obligations under Section
5.1(p), USFS shall pay, discharge or otherwise satisfy at or before maturity or
before they become delinquent, as the case may be, all taxes, assessments,
levies and other governmental charges at any time owing by it and all of its
other material obligations of whatever nature, except where (a) the amount or
validity thereof is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and reserves in conformity with GAAP with respect thereto have been
provided on its books, or (b) the failure to so pay, discharge or satisfy all
such obligations would not, individually or in the

                                       29
<Page>

aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect and would not
subject any of its properties to any Lien prohibited by Section 5.3(b).

                 (j)  LOCATION OF RECORDS. USFS will keep its principal place of
business and chief executive office, and the offices where it keeps its records
concerning the Receivables, all Receivables Property, all Contracts and purchase
orders and other agreements related to such Receivables (and all original
documents relating thereto), at the address referred to in Schedule II or, upon
30 days' prior written notice to the Company, at such other locations in
jurisdictions where all action required by Section 5.1(r) shall have been taken
and completed; provided, however, that the Rating Agency Condition shall have
been satisfied with respect to any changes in location of USFS's principal place
of business or chief executive office and such location is not in a state which
is within the Tenth Circuit unless it delivers an opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Rating Agencies to the effect that OCTAGON GAS SYSTEMS, INC.
V. RIMMER, 995 F.2d 948 (10th Cir. 1993), is no longer controlling precedent in
the Tenth Circuit.

                 (k)  FURNISHING COPIES, ETC. USFS shall furnish to the Company,
promptly after obtaining knowledge that a Receivable was, at the time of USFS's
purchase thereof, not an Eligible Receivable, notice thereof.

                 (l)  OBLIGATION TO RECORD AND REPORT. USFS shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by GAAP and by applicable law, record each purchase of
the Purchased Receivables as a sale on its books and records, reflect each
purchase of Purchased Receivables in its financial statements and tax returns as
a sale and recognize gain or loss, as the case may be, on each purchase of
Purchased Receivables, except to the extent that such purchases are not
reportable for federal tax purposes due to the filing of tax forms of United
Stationers Inc. on a consolidated federal basis with those of the Sellers, USFS
and the Company.

                 (m)  CONTINUING COMPLIANCE WITH THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE.
USFS shall, without limiting the requirements of Section 5.1(r), at its expense,
preserve, continue, and maintain or cause to be preserved, continued, and
maintained the Company's valid and properly perfected title to each Receivable
and the Receivables Property purchased hereunder, including, without limitation,
authorizing, filing or recording UCC financing statements in each relevant
jurisdiction.

                 (n)  PROCEEDS OF RECEIVABLES. USFS shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause all payments made by Obligors in respect of Purchased
Receivables and Related Property to be made in accordance with Section 2.3(a) of
the Servicing Agreement.

                 (o)  TAXES. USFS will file all federal and all material state
and local tax returns and reports required by law to be filed by it and will pay
all taxes and governmental charges thereby shown to be owing, except any such
taxes or charges which are being diligently contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP
have been set aside on its books or

                                       30
<Page>

except where the failure to file such returns and reports and pay such taxes and
governmental charges would not reasonably be expected to cause a Material
Adverse Effect.

                 (p)  SEPARATE CORPORATE EXISTENCE OF THE COMPANY. USFS hereby
acknowledges that the Trustee and the Holders are entering into the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents in reliance upon the Company's
identity as a legal entity separate from the Sellers, USFS and all other
Affiliates thereof (such Seller, together with each such Affiliate, a "USS
Affiliate") and that the Trustee and the Holders would be prejudiced by any
substantive consolidation of the Company with any Seller or USFS. Therefore,
from and after the date hereof, USFS will take (or refrain from taking, as the
case may be) such actions, and will cause each other USS Affiliate it controls
to take (or refrain from taking, as the case may be) such actions, as shall be
required in order that:

                             (i)  Except as specifically provided in Sections
          7.1 and 9.5, no USS Affiliate will pay the Company's operating
          expenses and liabilities, recognizing, however, that certain
          organizational expenses of the Company and expenses relating to
          creation and implementation of the securitization program contemplated
          by the Transaction Documents have been or shall be paid by USFS or
          USSC.

                            (ii)  Each USS Affiliate will conduct its business
          at offices segregated from the Company's offices. If office space is
          leased from any USS Affiliate, a separate written lease on
          arm's-length terms will be in effect at a market rental rate.

                           (iii)  Each USS Affiliate will maintain corporate
          records and books of account separate from those of the Company and
          telephone numbers, mailing addresses, stationery and other business
          forms that are separate and distinct from those of the Company.

                            (iv)  Any financial statements of any USS Affiliate
          that are consolidated to include the Company will contain a detailed
          note substantially in the form, and to the effect, of the note set
          forth on Annex 1.

                             (v)  The Company's assets will be maintained in a
          manner that facilitates their identification and segregation from
          those of the Sellers, USFS and the other USS Affiliates.

                            (vi)  Each USS Affiliate will strictly observe
          corporate formalities in its dealings with the Company, and funds or
          other assets of the Company will not be commingled or pooled with
          those of any affiliated Person other than funds constituting (i)
          Excluded Receivables Payments or (ii) Collections remitted to a
          Collector pursuant to Section 2.3(a) of the Servicing Agreement;
          provided that , in each case,

                                       31
<Page>

          such funds shall not be commingled for more than one (1) Business Day.
          No USS Affiliate will maintain joint bank accounts with the Company or
          other depository accounts with the Company to which any USS Affiliate
          has independent access.

                           (vii)  Any transaction between the Company and any
          USS Affiliate will be fair and equitable to the Company, will be the
          type of transaction which would be entered into by a prudent Person in
          the position of the Company with a USS Affiliate, and will be on terms
          which are at least as favorable to the Company as may be obtained from
          a Person which is not a USS Affiliate, it being understood and agreed
          that the transactions contemplated in the Transaction Documents meet
          the requirements of this clause (vii).

                          (viii)  No USS Affiliate will hold itself out, or
          permit itself to be held out, as having agreed to pay or be liable for
          the debts of the Company.

                            (ix)  Except for the authority delegated to the
          Servicer pursuant to the Servicing Agreement, the duly elected Board
          of Directors of the Company and the Company's duly appointed officers
          shall at all times have sole authority to control decisions and
          actions with respect to the daily business affairs of the Company.

                             (x)  USFS shall comply with those procedures
          described in the Specified Bankruptcy Opinion Provisions which are
          applicable to USFS, except, in each case above, for such failure to
          take actions or refrain from taking actions that are, in the
          aggregate, not material.

                 (q) DEPOSITS IN PROGRAM ACCOUNTS. USFS shall not permit the
deposit of any funds other than Collections (except funds consisting of Excluded
Receivables Payments) which shall be transferred out of any such Lockbox Account
within 2 Business Days of deposit therein) in any of the Lockbox Accounts and
the Collection Account.

                 (r)  OWNERSHIP; FURTHER ACTION EVIDENCING PURCHASES.

                             (i)  USFS shall take all necessary action to
          establish and maintain, irrevocably in the Company, (A) legal and
          equitable title to the Receivables and the Collections and (B) all of
          USFS's right, title and interest in the Receivables Property
          associated with the Receivables, in each case, free and clear of any
          Liens other than Liens in favor of the Company (and its assigns)
          (including, without limitation, the filing of all financing statements
          or other similar instruments or documents necessary under the UCC (or
          any comparable law) of all appropriate jurisdictions to perfect USFS's
          interest in such Receivables,

                                       32
<Page>

          Receivables Property and Collections and such other action to perfect,
          protect or more fully evidence the interest of USFS as USFS (or its
          assigns) may reasonably request).

                            (ii)  In furtherance of clause (i) above, USFS will
          on or prior to the date hereof, indicate on its books and records
          (including, without limitation, master data processing records) that
          the Receivables, Receivables Property and Receivables Property have
          been sold and assigned to the Company, and, in turn, the Company has
          conveyed its interest therein to the Trustee for the benefit of the
          Holders, and will provide to Company, upon request, copies of any such
          records. USFS agrees that from time to time, at its expense, it will
          promptly execute, authorize and deliver all further instruments and
          documents, and take all further action, that may be necessary or
          desirable or that the Company or its assignees may reasonably request,
          to protect or more fully evidence the Company's ownership, right,
          title and interest in the Receivables and Receivables Property sold by
          USFS and its rights under the Contracts with respect thereto, or to
          enable the Company or its assignees to exercise or enforce any of its
          rights hereunder or under any other Transaction Document. Without
          limiting the generality of the foregoing, USFS will upon the request
          of the Company or its assignees (A) execute and/or authorize and file,
          in accordance with the provisions of the UCC of the applicable
          jurisdiction, continuation statements with respect to all financing
          statements filed in connection with the transactions contemplated
          hereby, as well as such financing or continuation statements, or
          amendments thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may be
          necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, desirable, (B)
          contact customers to confirm and verify Receivables and (C) obtain the
          agreement of any Person having a Lien on any Receivables owned by USFS
          (other than any Lien created or imposed hereunder, under the Pooling
          Agreement or under any other Transaction Document to release such Lien
          upon the purchase of any such Receivables by the Company.

                           (iii)  USFS hereby irrevocably authorizes the Company
          and the Trustee to file one or more financing or continuation
          statements, and amendments thereto, relative to all or any part of the
          Receivables and Receivables Property sold or to be sold by USFS,
          without the signature of USFS where permitted by law.

                            (iv)  If USFS fails to perform any of its agreements
          or obligations under this Agreement, the Company or its assignees may
          (but shall not be required to) perform, or cause performance of, such
          agreements or obligations, and the expenses of the Company incurred in
          connection therewith shall be payable by USFS as provided in Section
          9.5.

                             (v)  USFS agrees that, whether or not a Purchase
          Termination Event has occurred:

                               (1)  the Company (and its assignees) shall have
          the right at any time to notify, or require that USFS at its own
          expense notify, the respective Obligors of the Company's ownership of
          the Purchased Receivables and Receivables Property and may direct that
          payment of all amounts due or to become due under the Purchased
          Receivables be made directly to the Company or its designee;

                               (2)  USFS shall, upon the Company's or the
          Trustee's written request and at USFS's expense, (I) assemble all of
          USFS's documents, instruments and other records (including credit
          files and computer tapes or disks) that (A) evidence or will evidence
          or record Receivables sold by USFS and (B) are otherwise necessary or
          desirable to effect Collections of such Purchased Receivables
          (collectively, the "DOCUMENTS") and (II) deliver the Documents to the
          Company, the Trustee or any designee thereof at a place designated by
          such Person. In recognition of USFS's need to have access to any
          Documents which may be transferred to any applicable Person hereunder,
          whether as a result of its continuing business relationship with any
          Obligor for Receivables purchased hereunder, the Company hereby grants
          to USFS an irrevocable license to access the Documents transferred by
          USFS to the Company and to access any such transferred computer
          software in connection with any activity arising in the ordinary
          course of USFS's business; PROVIDED that USFS shall not disrupt or
          otherwise interfere with the Company's or any applicable Person's use
          of and access to the Documents and its computer software during such
          license period;

                               (3)  USFS hereby grants to the Company and the
          Trustee (as the Company's assignee) an irrevocable power of attorney
          (coupled with an interest) to take any and all steps in USFS's name
          necessary or desirable, in the reasonable opinion of the Company or
          Trustee, to collect all amounts due under the Purchased Receivables,
          including, without limitation, endorsing USFS's name on checks and
          other instruments representing Collections, enforcing the Purchased
          Receivables and exercising all rights and remedies in respect thereof,
          and

                               (4)  upon written request of the Company or the
          Trustee, will (i) deliver to the Company, the Trustee or a party
          designated by the Company or the Trustee all licenses, rights,
          computer programs, related material, computer tapes, disks, cassettes
          and data necessary to the immediate collection of the Purchased
          Receivables by the Company or the Trustee, with or without the
          participation of USFS (excluding software licenses which by their
          terms are not permitted to be so delivered, PROVIDED that USFS shall
          use reasonable efforts to obtain consent of the relevant licensor to
          such delivery) and (ii) make such

                                       34

          Receivables as may be reasonably required by the Company or the
          Trustee.

                 (s)  LEGEND REQUIREMENT FOR CHATTEL PAPER. USFS agrees (i) at
all times, with respect to chattel paper, to comply with the procedures set
forth in Schedule 3 to the Pooling Agreement and (ii) that any Receivable that
constitutes or is evidenced by "chattel paper" as defined in Article 9 of the
UCC as in effect in the Relevant UCC State shall bear a legend stating that such
Receivable has been sold to the Company and conveyed, in turn, to the Trust.

                 (t)  COMPUTER FILES. USFS shall, at its own cost and expense,
retain the ledger used by USFS as a master record of the Obligors and retain
copies of all documents relating to each Obligor as custodian and agent for the
Company and other Persons with interests in the Purchased Receivables.

                 (u)  LOCKBOXES. USFS shall ensure that each Lockbox Account

stay, judgment, warrant of attachment or execution or similar process.

                 (v)  INSURANCE. USFS will maintain in effect, or cause to be
maintained in effect, at its own expense, for itself and its Subsidiaries such
casualty and liability insurance as USFS shall deem appropriate in its good
faith business judgment. Copies of each policy shall be furnished to the Company
or its assigns in certificated form upon request. The foregoing requirements
shall not be construed to negate, reduce or modify, and are in addition to,
USFS's obligations hereunder.

Company and its assignees in, to and under the Receivables or Receivables
Property, whether now existing or hereafter created, against all claims of third
parties claiming through or under such Seller. Such Seller will duly fulfill all
material obligations on its part to be fulfilled under or in connection with
each Receivable or Receivables Property and will do nothing to impair the rights
of USFS or its assigns in such Receivable or Receivables Property. Such Seller
shall pay when due any taxes (including, without limitation, property, excise,
transfer or similar taxes) arising with respect to, or payable in connection
with, the Receivables or Receivables Property or on account of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

USFS to the Company:

                 (a)  RECEIVABLES TO BE ACCOUNTS, GENERAL INTANGIBLES OR CHATTEL
PAPER. USFS will take no action to cause any Receivable then outstanding to be
evidenced by any "instrument" other than, provided that the procedures set forth

thereto, an instrument which alone or together with a security agreement
constitutes "chattel paper" (each as defined in the UCC as in effect in the
Relevant UCC State). USFS will take no action to cause any Receivable then
outstanding to be anything other than an "account", "general intangible" or
"chattel paper" (each as defined in the UCC as in effect in the Relevant UCC
State).

created, or any interest therein; USFS will immediately notify the Company and
its assignees of the existence of any other Lien on any Receivable or
Receivables Property; and USFS shall defend the right, title and interest of the
Company and its assignees in, to and under the Receivables or Receivables
Property, whether now existing or hereafter created, against all claims of third

                 (c)  EXTENSION OR AMENDMENT OF RECEIVABLES; INELIGIBLE

cancel, make any Dilution Adjustment to, amend or otherwise modify, or attempt
or purport to extend, rescind, cancel, make any Dilution Adjustment to, amend or
otherwise modify, the terms of any Purchased Receivables, or otherwise take any
action to cause, or which would permit, a Receivable that was designated as an
Eligible Receivable on the Payment Date relating to such Receivable to cease to
be an Eligible Receivable, except in any such case (a) in accordance with the
terms of the Policies, (b) as required by any Requirement of Law or (c) in the
case of Dilution Adjustments (whether or not permitted by any other clause of
this sentence), upon making a Seller Adjustment Payment pursuant to Section 2.5.

                 (d)  CHANGE IN CREDIT AND COLLECTION POLICIES. USFS will not
make or permit to be made any change in its Policies other than any such change

place of business or chief executive office from the location listed on Schedule
II or change the location of its records relating to the Receivables and
Receivables Property from those specified on Schedule II, unless in any such
event USFS shall have given the Company at least thirty (30) days' prior written
notice thereof fully in accordance with the terms and provisions of Section
5.1(i) and shall have taken all action necessary or reasonably requested by the
Company or the Trustee to amend its existing financing statements and
continuation statements so that they are not misleading and to file additional
financing statements in all applicable jurisdictions, if necessary, to continue
the first priority perfected ownership or security interests of the Company (and
its assigns) in all of the Receivables and Receivables Property.

                 (f)  CHANGE IN NAME, JURISDICTION OF ORGANIZATION, STRUCTURE,
LOCATION ETC. USFS will not change its name, jurisdiction of organization,
identity or corporate or other organizational structure (within the meaning of
Sections 9-503 and/or 9-507 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions), become
a "new debtor" (as defined in Section 9-102(a)(56) of the UCC of all applicable
jurisdictions) with respect to a currently effective security agreement
previously entered into by any other Person, or change its "location" (within
the meaning of Section 9-307 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) without
(i) giving 30 days' prior written notice to the Company, USFS, the Servicer and
the Trustee and (ii) taking all actions reasonably requested by the USFS (or its
assigns) (including but not limited to all filings and other acts necessary or
advisable under the UCC or similar statute of each relevant jurisdiction) in
order to continue USFS's (and its assigns') first priority perfected ownership
or security interest in all Receivables now owned or hereafter created and all
Receivables Property, including taking all action required by Section 5.1(a) or

Account or Lockbox listed in Schedule III. Furthermore, USFS will not add or
terminate any depositary institution, processing company or bank as a Lockbox
Processor, or make any change in the instructions to Obligors regarding payments
to be made to any Lockbox or Lockbox Account unless USFS and the Trustee shall
have received, at least ten (10) days before the proposed effective date
therefor, (i) written notice of such addition, termination or change and (ii)
with respect to the addition of a Lockbox Processor or a Lockbox Account or
Lockbox, an executed Lockbox Agreement with respect to the new Lockbox Account
or Lockbox; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that USFS may make changes in instructions to
Obligors regarding payments if such new instructions require such Obligor to
make payments to another existing Lockbox Account.

                 (h)  ACCOUNTING CHANGES. USFS shall not make any material
change (i) in accounting treatment and reporting practices except as permitted

operate the business currently conducted by USFS and business activities
reasonably incidental or related thereto in substantially the manner in which it
is presently conducted and operated if such failure would change in any material
respect the character of its business and such change would be adverse to the
interest of the Company or its assignees (including the Trustee for the benefit
of the Holders), except (x) if such change is necessary under any Requirement of
Law, (y) if such change would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or (z) the Rating Agency Condition is satisfied with respect
thereto

                 (j)  ACCOUNTING OF TRANSFERS. Prepare any financial statements
which shall account for the transactions contemplated hereby in any manner other

Company or in any other respect account for or treat the transactions under this
Agreement (including for financial accounting purposes, except as required by
law, in any case, as disclosed in the notes to the financial statements
delivered pursuant to Section 5.1) in any manner other than as sale of
Receivables and Receivables Property by USFS to the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that this subsection shall not apply for any tax or tax accounting purposes.

terminate its obligation to purchase Receivables from USFS by written notice to
USFS (any termination with respect to USFS pursuant to clause (x), (y) or (z) of
this Section 6.1 is herein called an "EARLY TERMINATION" with respect to USFS);
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event of an involuntary petition or proceeding as
described in paragraphs (g)(ii) and (g)(iii) above, the Company shall not
purchase Receivables from USFS until such time, if any, as such involuntary
petition or proceeding has been dismissed.

          Section 6.2    ADDITIONAL REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence of any
Purchase Termination Event, the Company shall have, in addition to all other
rights and remedies under this Agreement or otherwise, all other rights and
remedies provided under the UCC of each applicable jurisdiction and other
applicable laws, which rights shall be cumulative. Without limiting the
foregoing, the occurrence of a Purchase Termination Event shall not deny to the
Company any remedy (in addition to termination of the Company's obligation to
purchase Receivables from USFS) to which the Company may be otherwise
appropriately entitled, whether by statute or other applicable law, at law or in
equity.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

          Section 7.1    INDEMNITIES BY USFS. Without limiting any other rights
that USFS may have hereunder or under applicable law, USFS hereby agrees to
indemnify (and pay upon demand to) the Company and its assigns, officers,
directors, agents and employees (each an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against
any and all damages, losses, claims, taxes, liabilities, costs, expenses and for
all other amounts payable, including reasonable attorneys' fees (which attorneys
may be employees of the Company or any such assign, provided that such fees of
attorneys that are employees of

                                       42
<Page>

any Indemnified Party shall not be for services that are duplicative of the
services of any third-party attorneys retained by such Indemnified Party) and
disbursements (all of the foregoing being collectively referred to as
"INDEMNIFIED AMOUNTS") awarded against or incurred by any of them arising out of
or as a result of this Agreement or the acquisition, either directly or
indirectly, by the Company of an interest in the Receivables, excluding,
however:

                             (i)  Indemnified Amounts to the extent a final
          judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction holds that such
          Indemnified Amounts resulted from gross negligence or willful
          misconduct on the part of the Indemnified Party seeking
          indemnification;

                            (ii)  Indemnified Amounts to the extent the same
          includes losses in respect of Receivables that are uncollectible on
          account of the insolvency, bankruptcy or lack of creditworthiness of
          the related Obligor; or

                           (iii)  Excluded Taxes to the extent that the
          computation of such taxes is consistent with the characterization for
          income tax purposes of the acquisition by the Holders of the
          Certificates under the Pooling Agreement as a loan or loans by the
          Holders to the Company secured by, among other things, the Receivables
          and the Receivables Property;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained in this sentence shall limit the
liability of any Seller or limit the recourse of the Company to any Seller for
amounts otherwise specifically provided to be paid by USFS under the terms of
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
indemnification, USFS shall indemnify the Company for Indemnified Amounts
(including, without limitation, losses in respect of uncollectible receivables,
regardless of whether reimbursement therefor would constitute recourse to USFS)
relating to or resulting from:

                            (iv)  any representation or warranty made by USFS
          (or any officers of USFS) under or in connection with this Agreement,
          any other Transaction Document or any other information or report
          delivered by USFS pursuant hereto or thereto that shall have been
          false or incorrect when made or deemed made;

                             (v)  the failure by USFS, to comply with any
          applicable law, rule or regulation with respect to any Receivable or
          Contract related thereto, or the nonconformity of any Receivable or
          Contract included therein with any such applicable law, rule or
          regulation or any failure of USFS to keep or perform any of its
          obligations, express or implied, with respect to any Contract;

                                       43
<Page>

                            (vi)  any failure of USFS to perform its duties,
          covenants or other obligations in accordance with the provisions of
          this Agreement or any other Transaction Document;

                           (vii)  any products liability, personal injury or
          damage, suit or other similar claim arising out of or in connection
          with merchandise, insurance or services that are the subject of any
          Contract or any Receivable;

                          (viii)  any dispute, claim, offset or defense (other
          than discharge in bankruptcy of the Obligor) of the Obligor to the
          payment of any Receivable (including, without limitation, a defense
          based on such Receivable or the related Contract not being a legal,
          valid and binding obligation of such Obligor enforceable against it in
          accordance with its terms), or any other claim resulting from the sale
          of the merchandise or service related to such Receivable or the
          furnishing or failure to furnish such merchandise or services;

                            (ix)  the commingling of Collections of Receivables
          at any time with other funds;

                             (x)  any investigation, litigation or proceeding
          related to or arising from this Agreement or any other Transaction
          Document, the transactions contemplated hereby, the use of the
          proceeds of any Purchase Price payment, the ownership of the
          Receivables or any other investigation, litigation or proceeding
          relating to USFS in which any Indemnified Party becomes involved as a
          result of any of the transactions contemplated hereby;

                            (xi)  any inability to litigate any claim against
          any Obligor in respect of any Receivable as a result of such Obligor
          being immune from civil and commercial law and suit on the grounds of
          sovereignty or otherwise from any legal action, suit or proceeding;

                           (xii)  any Purchase Termination Event described in
          Section 6.1(g);

                          (xiii)  any failure to vest and maintain vested in the
          Company, or to transfer to the Company, legal and equitable title to,
          and ownership of, the Receivables and the Collections, and all of USFS
          's right, title and interest in the Receivables Property associated
          with the Receivables, in each case, free and clear of any Lien;

                           (xiv)  the failure to have filed, or any delay in
          filing, financing statements or other similar instruments or documents
          under the UCC of any applicable jurisdiction or other applicable laws
          with respect to any Receivable, the Receivables Property and
          Collections with respect thereto, and the proceeds of any thereof;

                                       44
<Page>

                            (xv)  any action or omission by USFS which reduces
          or impairs the rights of the Company with respect to any Receivable or
          the value of any such Receivable;

                           (xvi)  any attempt by any Person to void any sale
          hereunder under statutory provisions or common law or equitable
          action;

                          (xvii)  the failure of any Receivable included in the
          calculation of the Aggregate Receivables Amount as an Eligible
          Receivable to be an Eligible Receivable at the time so included; and

                         (xviii)  any failure of USFS to acquire and maintain
          legal and equitable title to, and ownership of any Receivable and the
          Receivables Property and Collections with respect thereto from the
          applicable Seller under the USSC Receivables Sale Agreement, free and
          clear of any Liens (other than as created hereunder); or any failure
          of USFS to give reasonably equivalent value to any such Seller under
          the USSC Receivables Sale Agreement Agreement in consideration of the
          transfer by such Seller of any Receivable, or any attempt by any
          Person to void such transfer under statutory provisions or common law
          or equitable action.

          Section 7.2    INDEMNITIES BY THE COMPANY. Without limiting any other
rights that USFS may have hereunder or under applicable law, the Company hereby
agrees to indemnify USFS from and against any and all claims, losses and
liabilities (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or resulting
from USFS's reliance on any representation or warranty made by the Company in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto that, in either
case, shall have been false or incorrect in any material respect when made or
deemed made.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                SUBORDINATED NOTE

          Section 8.1    SUBORDINATED NOTE. (a) On the initial Effective Date,
contemporaneously with the sale of Receivables and Receivables Property by USFS,
the Company shall issue to USFS a subordinated note substantially in the form of
Exhibit A hereto (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to
time, the "SUBORDINATED NOTE").

                 (b)  The initial aggregate principal amount of the Subordinated
Note (the "INITIAL SUBORDINATED NOTE AMOUNT") shall be equal to $0.

                 (c)  Following the initial Effective Date, the aggregate
principal amount of the Subordinated Note at any time shall be equal to the
difference between (i) the sum of the Initial Subordinated Note Amount and each
addition to the principal amount of the Subordinated Note with respect to USFS
pursuant to Section 2.3 as of such time and (ii) the aggregate amount of all
payments made in respect of the principal of the

                                       45
<Page>

Subordinated Note as of such time. All payments made in respect of the
Subordinated Note shall be allocated by the Servicer and shall be allocated to
pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and second, to pay the outstanding
principal amount thereof.

                 (d)  Each Seller's interest in the USFS Subordinated Note shall
be equal to the aggregate of each addition to the USFS Subordinated Note
allocated to such Seller pursuant to Section 2.3(c), less the sum of each
repayment thereof allocated to such Seller by the Servicer in accordance with
Section 8.1(c). Interest on the outstanding principal amount of the Subordinated
Note shall accrue on the last day of each Settlement Period at a rate per annum
equal to the ABR plus 2% from and including the initial Effective Date to but
excluding the last day of each Settlement Period and shall be paid, subject to
the subordination provisions of the USFS Note, (x) on each Distribution Date
with respect to the principal amount of the Subordinated Note outstanding from
time to time during the Settlement Period immediately preceding such
Distribution Date and/or (y) on the maturity date thereof. Subject to the
subordination provisions of the Subordinated Note, principal thereunder not paid
or prepaid pursuant to the terms thereof shall be payable on the maturity date
of the Subordinated Note. Default in the payment of principal or interest under
the Subordinated Note shall not constitute a Purchase Termination Event under
this Agreement, a Servicer Default under any Servicing Agreement or an Early
Amortization Event under the Pooling Agreement or any Supplement thereto.

          Section 8.2    RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF CONTRIBUTED NOTE AND
SUBORDINATED NOTE.

                 (a)  [Intentionally Omitted].

                 (b)  Subsequent to the date hereof, neither (i) the
Subordinated Note, or any right of USFS to receive payments thereunder, nor (ii)
the Contributed Note, or any right thereunder of USSC or its assignee, shall be
assigned, transferred, exchanged, pledged, hypothecated, participated or
otherwise conveyed (each, a "TRANSFER") to any Person (any Person, a
"SUBORDINATED NOTE TRANSFEREE") unless (X) notice of such Transfer has been
given to the Company, USSC, the Trustee, and each Agent, (Y) such Subordinated
Note Transferee has delivered an instrument, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company, the Trustee and each Agent, pursuant to which such
Subordinated Note Transferee agrees to abide by the terms of the Subordinated
Note and this Article VIII and (Z) each of the Company, the Trustee, and each
Agent have given their consent to such Transfer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

                                   ARTICLE IX

partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein

          Section 9.12   NO PETITION IN BANKRUPTCY. USFS covenants and agrees
that prior to the date which is one year and one day after the date of

<Page>

Agreement pursuant to Section 9.13, it will not institute against or join any

          Section 9.13         ADDITION OF SELLERS. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, from time to time one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries of
United Stationers Inc. may become additional Sellers parties hereto, the
receivables originated by which may constitute Eligible Receivables of such
Seller. If any such Subsidiary wishes to become an additional Seller, it shall
submit a request to such effect in writing to USFS and forward a copy of such
request to the Company and the Trustee. USFS, at the direction of the Company,
may, subject to the terms and provisions of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreements, agree to (subject to the approval of the Trustee) or deny any such
request; PROVIDED that, if USFS shall have failed to respond to any such request
within 30 days after receipt thereof, such request shall be deemed to have been
denied. If USFS shall have agreed to any such request pursuant to this Section
9.13, then in the case of a wholly-owned Subsidiary of United Stationers Inc.,
such wholly-owned Subsidiary shall become an additional Seller party hereto on
the related Seller Addition Date upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Section 3.2 and the conditions, if any, set forth in the Pooling and
Servicing Agreements.

          Section 9.14   TREATMENT OF SELLERS OTHER THAN USSC; TERMINATION
THEREOF.

                 (a)  USSC hereby covenants and agrees with USFS and USSC shall
not permit any Seller or USFS at any time to cease to be a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of United Stationers Inc., except as provided in the following
subsection (b).

                 (b)  If United Stationers Inc. wishes to permit any Seller to
cease to be a wholly-owned Subsidiary of United Stationers Inc., then USSC shall
submit a request (a "SELLER TERMINATION REQUEST") to such effect in writing to
USFS, with a copy thereof to the Company and the Trustee, which request shall be
accompanied by a certificate prepared by a Responsible Officer of the Servicer
indicating the Purchased Receivables Percentage applicable to such Seller as of
the date of submission of such request (the "SELLER TERMINATION REQUEST DATE").
USFS, at the direction of the Company and subject to the terms and provisions of
the Pooling and Servicing Agreements, shall consent (subject to the approval of
the Trustee) to or deny any such Seller Termination Request, PROVIDED that, if
USFS shall have failed to respond to any such Seller Termination Request within
30 days after receipt thereof, such Seller Termination Request shall be deemed
to have been denied. If USFS shall have consented to any such Seller Termination
Request, and such consent shall not be in violation of any applicable provision
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreements, then the relevant Seller shall be
terminated as a Seller hereunder on the date of the consummation of the
transaction in connection with which such Seller ceases to be a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of United Stationers Inc. or, if USSC requests in writing that the
termination date be a date prior to the consummation of such transaction, such
earlier requested date (but in no event more than 30 days prior to the
consummation of such transaction); PROVIDED that if

                                       49
<Page>

an earlier date is so requested, USSC or any Subsidiary of United Stationers
Inc. shall have entered into a valid and legally, binding agreement to effect
such transaction on or before a date certain; PROVIDED FURTHER that, if the
Purchased Receivables Percentage applicable to such Seller as of the relevant
Seller Termination Request Date is less than 10%, then USFS shall consent to
such Seller Termination Request unless such consent would violate the terms and
provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreements. From and after the date any
such Seller is terminated as a Seller pursuant to this subsection, USFS shall
cease buying Receivables and Receivables Property from such Seller. Each such
Seller shall be released as a Seller party hereto for all other purposes and
shall cease to be a party hereto on such termination date.

                 (c)  A terminated Seller shall have no further obligation under
any Transaction Document, other than to repurchase Receivables previously sold
by it to USFS or the Company, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.6 and
indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.

          Section 9.15   TERMINATION. This Agreement will terminate at such time
as (a) either (i) March 28, 2006 shall have occurred or (a) an Early Termination
shall have occurred hereunder and (b) all Receivables purchased hereunder have
been collected, and the proceeds thereof turned over to the Company and all
other amounts owing to the Company hereunder shall have been paid in full or, if
Receivables sold hereunder have not been collected, such Receivables have become
Defaulted Receivables and the Company shall have completed its collection
efforts with respect thereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the indemnities of USFS to
the Company set forth in this Agreement shall survive such termination and
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the Company shall remain entitled to receive any
collections on Receivables sold hereunder which have become Defaulted
Receivables.

          Section 9.16   WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; OTHER
WAIVERS.

          EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT,
ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR ANY AMENDMENT, INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR
AGREEMENT DELIVERED OR WHICH MAY IN THE FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR THEREWITH OR ARISING FROM ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING,
STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN), ACTIONS OF ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR
ANY OTHER RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE
TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY.

                 (a)  Each of the Company and USFS hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally:

                                       50
<Page>

                             (i)  submits itself and its property in any legal
          action or proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other
          Transaction Documents to which it is a party, or for recognition and
          enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive
          jurisdiction of any United States Federal or Illinois State court
          sitting in Chicago, Illinois;

                           (iii)  agrees that service of process in any such
          action or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by

Des Plaines, Illinois                                             March 28, 2003

          FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, USS RECEIVABLES COMPANY, LTD., a
Cayman Islands limited liability company ("USSR"), does hereby promise to pay to
the order of UNITED STATIONERS FINANCIAL SERVICES LLC, an Illinois limited
liability company ("USSC"), and its successors and permitted assigns, the
principal amount of this Subordinated Promissory Note (this "SUBORDINATED
NOTE"), determined as described below, together with interest thereon which
shall accrue on the last day of each Settlement Period at a rate per annum equal
to the ABR in effect from time to time plus two percent (2%) from and including
the initial Effective Date to but excluding the last day of each Settlement
Period and shall, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, be paid (x) on
each Distribution Date with respect to this Subordinated Note outstanding from
time to time during the Settlement Period immediately preceding such
Distribution Date and/or (y) on the Maturity Date (as hereinafter defined).
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined are used herein as
defined in the Amended and Restated USFS Receivables Sale Agreement, dated as of
March 28, 2003, among the Sellers, USFS, and USFS, as Servicer (such agreement,
as it may from time to time be further amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified in accordance with its terms, the "USFS RECEIVABLES SALE AGREEMENT")
and the Second Amended and Restated Pooling Agreement, dated as of March 28,
2003, among USSR, United Stationers Financial Services LLC, as Servicer, and
Bank One, NA (Main Office Chicago), as Trustee (such agreement, as it may from
time to time further be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in
accordance with its terms, the "Pooling Agreement"). This Subordinated Note is
the Subordinated Note referred to in the USFS Receivables Sale Agreement.

          The Initial Subordinated Note Amount shall be equal to ____________
($___________). Following the Effective Date, the aggregate principal amount of
this USFS Subordinated Note at any time shall be equal to the difference between
(i) the sum of the Initial Subordinated Note Amount and each addition to the
principal amount of the Subordinated Note with respect to each Seller pursuant
to Section 2.03 of the USFS Receivables Sale Agreement as of such time and (ii)
the aggregate amount of all payments made in respect of the principal of this
Subordinated Note as of such time. All payment made in respect of this
Subordinated Note shall be allocated among the Sellers by the Servicer in
accordance with the USFS Receivables Sale Agreement and shall be allocated
FIRST, to pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and SECOND, to pay the
outstanding principal amount thereof. Principal hereunder not paid or prepaid
pursuant to

<Page>

the terms hereof shall be payable on the date (the "MATURITY DATE") on which all
of the Investor Certificateholders with respect to each Outstanding Series shall
have been paid in full all amounts owing to them under any Pooling Agreement or
Servicing Agreement. Payments of interest on and principal under this
Subordinated Note shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to such account of each Seller as such Seller may designate in writing from time
to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payment of interest or principal (any
of the foregoing, a "payment") may be made under this Subordinated Note at any
time unless (i) at the date such payment is to be made, USSR shall have made all
payments in respect of its repurchase obligations pursuant to the USFS
Receivables Sale Agreement at such date and (ii) such payment is effected in
accordance with all corporate and legal formalities applicable to USSR;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (A) no payment shall be made on, and no Seller shall
make any claim for any payment on, any date if (x) a Potential Early
Amortization Event of a type referred to in clause (a)(ii) or (iii) of Section
7.1 of the Pooling Agreement or (y) an Early Amortization Event has occurred and
is continuing (or would occur as a result of such payment) on such date and (B)
all payments made on any date shall be payable by USSR solely from funds
available to USSR which are not otherwise needed or required on such date to be
applied to the payment of any amounts by USSR pursuant to the USFS Receivables
Sale Agreement and the Sellers shall make no claim for payment in contravention
of this clause (B). Default in the payment of interest on and principal under
this Subordinated Note shall not constitute a Purchase Termination Event under
the USFS Receivables Sale Agreement, a Servicer Default under the Servicing
Agreement, or an Early Amortization Event under the Pooling Agreement or any
Supplement thereto.

          Each holder of this Subordinated Note agrees that it shall have no
right to be paid, and shall have no claim to payment, except in accordance with,
and subject to the terms and conditions of, this Subordinated Note.

          Neither this Subordinated Note, nor any right of any Seller to receive
payments hereunder, shall be assigned, transferred, exchanged, pledged,
hypothecated, participated or otherwise conveyed, except as set forth in Section
8.2 of the USFS Receivables Sale Agreement.

          USSR hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand, protest and notice
of any kind whatsoever. The failure of any holder to exercise any of its rights
hereunder in any particular instance shall not constitute a waiver thereof in
that or any subsequent instance.

          If any payment or distribution of any kind be collected or received by
any Seller in respect of amounts owing to such Seller under this Subordinated
Note when pursuant hereto such payment should not have been made to or received
by such Seller, such Seller forthwith shall deliver the same to the Trustee for
the benefit of the Holders. Until so delivered, such payment or distribution
shall be held in trust by such Seller as the property of the Holders, segregated
from other funds and property held by such Seller.

          Each Seller covenants and agrees that, prior to the date which is one
(1) year and one (1) day after the date of termination of the USFS Receivables
Sale

<Page>

Agreement pursuant to Section 9.15 thereof, it will not institute against, or
join any other Person in instituting against, USSR any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings, or other
proceedings under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law.

          THIS SUBORDINATED NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
