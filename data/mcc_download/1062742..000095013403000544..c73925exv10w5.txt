                           failure substantially to perform his duties under the
                           Agreement (other than as a result of total or partial
                           incapacity due to physical or mental illness);

                                    (B) An act or acts on Executive's part
                           constituting a felony under the laws of the United

                           jurisdiction in which the Company conducts business;

                                    (C) Executive's being under the influence of

                           hereunder;

                                    (D) Any other act or omission which is

                           Section 10.

                  For purposes of this definition, no act or failure to act
         shall be deemed "willful" unless effected by Executive not in good
         faith and without a reasonable belief that such action or failure to

Employment Term prior to the Expiration Date by the Company or by Executive
shall be communicated by written notice of termination to the other party

this Section 8 or Section 9 below or in connection with any dispute arising
under or in connection with this Agreement or relating to Executive's employment
with the Company (including payments pursuant to arbitration as provided for in
Section 12(k) hereof) will be contingent upon the execution by Executive of a
release of any claims Executive may have against the Company, its affiliates or
any successor to the Company, such release to be in a form satisfactory to the
Company in its sole discretion.

         9. CHANGE OF TITLE, JOB RESPONSIBILITIES, WORK LOCATION, BASE SALARY

Section 3 of this Agreement, or if Executive's Base Salary is reduced or if
Executive's opportunity to earn an annual bonus up to 120% of Base Salary as set

                  (a) Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly
competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and its affiliates and

Severance Period or twenty-four (24) months following the date of termination of
employment:

                           (i) Executive will not directly or indirectly engage
         in any business which is in competition with any line of business
         conducted by the Company or its affiliates (including without
         limitation by performing or soliciting the performance of services for
         any person who is a customer or client of the Company or any of its
         affiliates) whether such engagement is as an officer, director,
         proprietor, employee, partner, investor (other than as holder of less
         than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of a publicly traded
         corporation), consultant, advisor, agent, sales representative or other
         participant, in any geographic area in which the Company or any of its
         affiliates conducted any such competing line of business.

                           (ii) Executive will not directly or indirectly assist
         others in engaging in any of the activities in which Executive is

employee of the Company or any of its affiliates to engage in any activity in
which Executive is prohibited to engage by paragraph (a) above or to terminate
his employment with the Company or any of its affiliates, and will not directly
or indirectly employ or offer employment to any person who was employed by the
Company or any of its affiliates unless such person shall have ceased to be
employed by the Company or any of its affiliates for a period of at least 12
months.

<PAGE>

                  (c) Executive will not at any time (whether during or after
his employment with the Company) disclose or use for his own benefit or purposes
or the benefit or purposes of any other person, firm, partnership, joint
venture, association, corporation or other business organization, entity or
enterprise other than the Company and any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, any
trade secrets, information, data, or other confidential information relating to
customers, development programs, costs, marketing, trading, investment, sales
activities, promotion, credit and financial data, manufacturing processes,
financing methods, plans, or the business and affairs of the Company generally
or of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, provided that the foregoing
shall not apply to information which is not unique to the Company or which is
generally known to the industry or the public other than as a result of
Executive's breach of this covenant. Executive agrees that upon termination of
his employment with the Company for any reason, he will return to the Company
immediately all memoranda, books, papers, plans, information, letters and other
data, and all copies thereof or therefrom, in any way relating to the business
of the Company and its affiliates, except that he may retain personal notes,
notebooks and diaries. Executive further agrees that he will not retain or use
for his account at any time any trade names, trademark or other proprietary
business designation used or owned in connection with the business of the
Company or its affiliates.

         11. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AND OTHER REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and
agrees that the Company has no adequate remedy at law for a breach or threatened
breach of any of the provisions of Section 10 and, in recognition of this fact,
Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in
addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond and
without notice to Executive, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the
form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or
permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from
pursuing any other remedies at law or in equity that it may have or any other
rights that it may have under any other agreement.

         12. MISCELLANEOUS.

                  (a) GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri without reference
to principles of conflict of laws.

                  (b) ENTIRE AGREEMENT/AMENDMENTS. This Agreement contains the
entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes any prior agreements between the Company and Executive. There are
no restrictions, agreements, promises, warranties, covenants or undertakings
between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein other than those
expressly set forth herein and therein. No provision in this Agreement may be
amended unless such amendment is agreed to in writing.

                  (c) NO WAIVER. The failure of a party to insist upon strict
adherence to any term of this Agreement on any occasion shall not be considered
a waiver of such party's rights or deprive such party of the right thereafter to
insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement.
No waiver by either party of any breach by the other party of any condition or
provision contained in this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall
be deemed a waiver of a similar or dissimilar condition or provision at the same
or any prior or



                                       6
<PAGE>

subsequent time. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by Executive or the
Company, as the case may be.

                  (d) SEVERABILITY. It is expressly understood and agreed that
although Executive and the Company consider the restrictions contained in
Section 10 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a
court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory restriction in
Section 10 or any other restriction contained in Section 10 is an unenforceable
restriction against Executive, such provision shall not be rendered void but
shall be deemed amended to apply to such maximum time and territory, if
applicable, or otherwise to such maximum extent as such court may judicially
determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of
competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in Section 10 is
unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it
enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the
other restrictions contained herein. In the event that any one or more of the
other provisions of this Agreement shall be or become invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.

                  (e) ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall not be assignable by
either party without the consent of the other party.

                  (f) SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the personal or legal representatives, executors,
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of the
parties hereto. Executive shall be entitled to select (and change, to the extent
permitted under any applicable law) a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive
any compensation or benefit payable hereunder following Executive's death by
giving the Company written notice thereof. In the event of Executive's death or
a judicial determination of his incompetence, reference in this Agreement to
Executive shall be deemed, where appropriate, to refer to his beneficiary,
estate or other legal representative.

                  (g) COMMUNICATIONS. For the purpose of this Agreement, notices
and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be deemed to have been duly given when faxed or delivered or two
business days after being mailed by United States registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed (i) to Executive at his
address then appearing in the personnel records of the Company and; (ii) to the

Floor, New York, NY 10020, Attention: Christopher Behrens; or (iii) to such
other address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing in
accordance herewith, with such notice of change of address being effective only
upon receipt.

                  (h) WITHHOLDING TAXES. The Company may withhold from any and
all amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state, local and any
other applicable taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any
applicable law or regulation.

                  (i) SURVIVORSHIP. The respective rights and obligations of the
parties hereunder shall survive any termination of Executive's employment to the
extent necessary to assure the agreed preservation of such rights and
obligations.

                  (j) REPRESENTATIONS. Each party represents and warrants to the
other that he or it is fully authorized and empowered to enter into this
Agreement and that the performance of his or its obligations under this
Agreement will not violate any agreement between him or it and any other person
or entity.

                  (k) ARBITRATION. The parties agree that all disputes arising
under or in connection with this Agreement, and any and all claims by Executive
relating to his employment with the Company, including any claims of
discrimination arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as
amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with
Disabilities Act or any similar federal, state or local law will be submitted to
arbitration in the County of St. Louis of the State of Missouri to the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules then prevailing for the type of
claim in issue. The parties each hereby specifically submit to the personal
jurisdiction of any federal or state court located in the County of St. Louis
and the State of Missouri for any such action and further agree that service of
process may be made within or without the State of Missouri by giving notice in
the manner provided herein.

                  In any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement, the
parties agree that no damages other than compensatory damages shall be sought or
claimed by either party and each party waives any claim, right or entitlement to
punitive, exemplary, statutory or consequential damages, or any other damages,
and each relevant arbitration panel is specifically divested of any power to
award any damages in the nature of punitive, exemplary, statutory or
consequential damages, or any other damages of any kind or nature in excess of
compensatory damages.

                  (l) FEES AND EXPENSES. In the event of a dispute by the
Company or Executive as to the validity or enforceability of, or liability
under, any provision of this Agreement and with respect to any claims arising in
connection with Executive's employment with the Company, each party shall pay
its own legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such dispute or
claim; provided, however, and notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a
breach of this Agreement by the Company at any time after a Change of Control,
whether or not litigation is commenced, then the Company shall pay to Executive,
in addition to any damages incurred by Executive, the costs and expenses
incurred by Executive in connection with any such breach (including, without
limitation, all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs).

                  (m) COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be signed in
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

                  (n) HEADINGS. The headings of the sections contained in this
Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be deemed to control or affect
the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement. Any reference to
Executive in the masculine gender herein is for convenience and is not intended
to express any preference by the Company for executives of any gender.

previously paid to Executive; (iii) continued coverage under the Company's
welfare benefit arrangements as in effect from time to time through the earlier

                                    (A) Executive's willful and continued
                           failure substantially to perform his duties under the
                           Agreement (other than as a result of total or partial
                           incapacity due to physical or mental illness);

                                    (B) An act or acts on Executive's part
                           constituting a felony under the laws of the United
                           States or any other state thereof or any other
                           jurisdiction in which the Company conducts business;

                                    (C) Executive's being under the influence of
                           illegal drugs or alcohol while performing his duties
                           hereunder;

                                    (D) Any other act or omission which is
                           materially injurious to the financial condition or
                           business reputation of the Company or any of its

                           Section 10.

                  For purposes of this definition, no act or failure to act
         shall be deemed "willful" unless effected by Executive not in good
         faith and without a reasonable belief that such action or failure to

                  (f) NOTICE OF TERMINATION. Any purported termination of the
Employment Term prior to the Expiration Date by the Company or by Executive
shall be communicated by written notice of termination to the other party

this Section 8 or Section 9 below or in connection with any dispute arising
under or in connection with this Agreement or relating to Executive's employment
with the Company (including payments pursuant to arbitration as provided for in
Section 12(k) hereof) will be contingent upon the execution by Executive of a
release of any claims Executive may have against the Company, its affiliates or
any successor to the Company, such release to be in a form satisfactory to the
Company in its sole discretion.

         9. CHANGE OF TITLE, JOB RESPONSIBILITIES, WORK LOCATION, BASE SALARY

Section 3 of this Agreement, or if Executive's Base Salary is reduced or if
Executive's opportunity to earn an annual bonus up to 120% of Base Salary as set

with the covenants set forth in Section 10, to receive (i) the amounts described
under Section 8(a); (ii) continued payment of Base Salary through the last day
of the 24th month following the date of termination (the "Change Severance
Period"); (iii) continued coverage under the Company's welfare benefit
arrangements as in effect from time to time through the earlier of (A) the end

                  (a) Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly
competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and its affiliates and

Severance Period or twenty-four (24) months following the date of termination of
employment:

                           (i) Executive will not directly or indirectly engage
         in any business which is in competition with any line of business
         conducted by the Company or its affiliates (including without
         limitation by performing or soliciting the performance of services for
         any person who is a customer or client of the Company or any of its
         affiliates) whether such engagement is as an officer, director,
         proprietor, employee, partner, investor (other than as holder of less
         than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of a publicly traded
         corporation), consultant, advisor, agent, sales representative or other
         participant, in any geographic area in which the Company or any of its
         affiliates conducted any such competing line of business.

                           (ii) Executive will not directly or indirectly assist
         others in engaging in any of the activities in which Executive is

employee of the Company or any of its affiliates to engage in any activity in
which Executive is prohibited to engage by paragraph (a) above or to terminate
his employment with the Company or any of its affiliates, and will not directly
or indirectly employ or offer employment to any person who was employed by the
Company or any of its affiliates unless such person shall have ceased to be
employed by the Company or any of its affiliates for a period of at least 12
months.

<PAGE>

                  (c) Executive will not at any time (whether during or after
his employment with the Company) disclose or use for his own benefit or purposes
or the benefit or purposes of any other person, firm, partnership, joint
venture, association, corporation or other business organization, entity or
enterprise other than the Company and any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, any
trade secrets, information, data, or other confidential information relating to
customers, development programs, costs, marketing, trading, investment, sales
activities, promotion, credit and financial data, manufacturing processes,
financing methods, plans, or the business and affairs of the Company generally
or of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, provided that the foregoing
shall not apply to information which is not unique to the Company or which is
generally known to the industry or the public other than as a result of
Executive's breach of this covenant. Executive agrees that upon termination of
his employment with the Company for any reason, he will return to the Company
immediately all memoranda, books, papers, plans, information, letters and other
data, and all copies thereof or therefrom, in any way relating to the business
of the Company and its affiliates, except that he may retain personal notes,
notebooks and diaries. Executive further agrees that he will not retain or use
for his account at any time any trade names, trademark or other proprietary
business designation used or owned in connection with the business of the
Company or its affiliates.

         11. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AND OTHER REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and
agrees that the Company has no adequate remedy at law for a breach or threatened
breach of any of the provisions of Section 10 and, in recognition of this fact,
Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in
addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond and
without notice to Executive, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the
form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or
permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from
pursuing any other remedies at law or in equity that it may have or any other
rights that it may have under any other agreement.

         12. MISCELLANEOUS.

                  (a) GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri without reference
to principles of conflict of laws.

                  (b) ENTIRE AGREEMENT/AMENDMENTS. This Agreement contains the
entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes any prior agreements between the Company and Executive. There are
no restrictions, agreements, promises, warranties, covenants or undertakings
between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein other than those
expressly set forth herein and therein. No provision in this Agreement may be
amended unless such amendment is agreed to in writing.

                  (c) NO WAIVER. The failure of a party to insist upon strict
adherence to any term of this Agreement on any occasion shall not be considered
a waiver of such party's rights or deprive such party of the right thereafter to
insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement.
No waiver by either party of any breach by the other party of any condition or
provision contained in this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall
be deemed a waiver of a similar or dissimilar condition or provision at the same
or any prior or



                                       6
<PAGE>

subsequent time. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by Executive or the
Company, as the case may be.

                  (d) SEVERABILITY. It is expressly understood and agreed that
although Executive and the Company consider the restrictions contained in
Section 10 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a
court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory restriction in
Section 10 or any other restriction contained in Section 10 is an unenforceable
restriction against Executive, such provision shall not be rendered void but
shall be deemed amended to apply to such maximum time and territory, if
applicable, or otherwise to such maximum extent as such court may judicially
determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of
competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in Section 10 is
unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it
enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the
other restrictions contained herein. In the event that any one or more of the
other provisions of this Agreement shall be or become invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.

                  (e) ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall not be assignable by
either party without the consent of the other party.

                  (f) SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the personal or legal representatives, executors,
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of the
parties hereto. Executive shall be entitled to select (and change, to the extent
permitted under any applicable law) a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive
any compensation or benefit payable hereunder following Executive's death by
giving the Company written notice thereof. In the event of Executive's death or
a judicial determination of his incompetence, reference in this Agreement to
Executive shall be deemed, where appropriate, to refer to his beneficiary,
estate or other legal representative.

                  (g) COMMUNICATIONS. For the purpose of this Agreement, notices
and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be deemed to have been duly given when faxed or delivered or two
business days after being mailed by United States registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed (i) to Executive at his
address then appearing in the personnel records of the Company and; (ii) to the

Floor, New York, NY 10020, Attention: Christopher Behrens; or (iii) to such
other address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing in
accordance herewith, with such notice of change of address being effective only
upon receipt.

                  (h) WITHHOLDING TAXES. The Company may withhold from any and
all amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state, local and any
other applicable taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any
applicable law or regulation.

                  (i) SURVIVORSHIP. The respective rights and obligations of the
parties hereunder shall survive any termination of Executive's employment to the
extent necessary to assure the agreed preservation of such rights and
obligations.

                  (j) REPRESENTATIONS. Each party represents and warrants to the
other that he or it is fully authorized and empowered to enter into this
Agreement and that the performance of his or its obligations under this
Agreement will not violate any agreement between him or it and any other person
or entity.

                  (k) ARBITRATION. The parties agree that all disputes arising
under or in connection with this Agreement, and any and all claims by Executive
relating to his employment with the Company, including any claims of
discrimination arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as
amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with
Disabilities Act or any similar federal, state or local law will be submitted to
arbitration in the County of St. Louis of the State of Missouri to the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules then prevailing for the type of
claim in issue. The parties each hereby specifically submit to the personal
jurisdiction of any federal or state court located in the County of St. Louis
and the State of Missouri for any such action and further agree that service of
process may be made within or without the State of Missouri by giving notice in
the manner provided herein.

                  In any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement, the
parties agree that no damages other than compensatory damages shall be sought or
claimed by either party and each party waives any claim, right or entitlement to
punitive, exemplary, statutory or consequential damages, or any other damages,
and each relevant arbitration panel is specifically divested of any power to
award any damages in the nature of punitive, exemplary, statutory or
consequential damages, or any other damages of any kind or nature in excess of
compensatory damages.

                  (l) FEES AND EXPENSES. In the event of a dispute by the
Company or Executive as to the validity or enforceability of, or liability
under, any provision of this Agreement and with respect to any claims arising in
connection with Executive's employment with the Company, each party shall pay
its own legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such dispute or
claim; provided, however, and notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a
breach of this Agreement by the Company at any time after a Change of Control,
whether or not litigation is commenced, then the Company shall pay to Executive,
in addition to any damages incurred by Executive, the costs and expenses
incurred by Executive in connection with any such breach (including, without
limitation, all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs).

                  (m) COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be signed in
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

                  (n) HEADINGS. The headings of the sections contained in this
Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be deemed to control or affect
the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement. Any reference to
Executive in the masculine gender herein is for convenience and is not intended
to express any preference by the Company for executives of any gender.

covenants set forth in Section 10, Executive shall receive (i) the amounts
described under Section 8(a); (ii) continued payment of Base Salary through the
last day of the 24th month following the date of termination (the "Severance

accelerated and paid to Executive in a lump-sum payment, to the extent not
previously paid to Executive; (iii) continued coverage under the Company's
welfare benefit arrangements as in effect from time to time through the earlier

                                    (A) Executive's willful and continued
                           failure substantially to perform his duties under the
                           Agreement (other than as a result of total or partial
                           incapacity due to physical or mental illness);

                                    (B) An act or acts on Executive's part
                           constituting a felony under the laws of the United
                           States or any other state thereof or any other
                           jurisdiction in which the Company conducts business;

                                    (C) Executive's being under the influence of
                           illegal drugs or alcohol while performing his duties
                           hereunder;

                                    (D) Any other act or omission which is
                           materially injurious to the financial condition or
                           business reputation of the Company or any of its

                                    (E) Executive's breach of the provisions of
                           Section 10.

                  For purposes of this definition, no act or failure to act
         shall be deemed "willful" unless effected by Executive not in good
         faith and without a reasonable belief that such action or failure to

         conclusive for all purposes of the Agreement.

                  (f) NOTICE OF TERMINATION. Any purported termination of the
Employment Term prior to the Expiration Date by the Company or by Executive
shall be communicated by written notice of termination to the other party

circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination under the provision so

this Section 8 or Section 9 below or in connection with any dispute arising
under or in connection with this Agreement or relating to Executive's employment
with the Company (including payments pursuant to arbitration as provided for in
Section 12(k) hereof) will be contingent upon the execution by Executive of a
release of any claims Executive may have against the Company, its affiliates or
any successor to the Company, such release to be in a form satisfactory to the
Company in its sole discretion.

         9. CHANGE OF TITLE, JOB RESPONSIBILITIES, WORK LOCATION, BASE SALARY

responsibilities, and/or work location are changed from those described in
Section 3 of this Agreement, or if Executive's Base Salary is reduced or if
Executive's opportunity to earn an annual bonus up to 120% of Base Salary as set

equal to the earlier of (i) 24 months after the date of the Change in Control,

employment with the Company and, subject to Executive's continued compliance
with the covenants set forth in Section 10, to receive (i) the amounts described
under Section 8(a); (ii) continued payment of Base Salary through the last day
of the 24th month following the date of termination (the "Change Severance
Period"); (iii) continued coverage under the Company's welfare benefit
arrangements as in effect from time to time through the earlier of (A) the end
of the Change Severance Period, and (B) such time as Executive is eligible to

sale into the public markets) occurring at any time after the Effective Date.

         10. NON-COMPETITION/CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

                  (a) Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly
competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and its affiliates and
accordingly agrees that during the Employment Term and through the later of the
Severance Period or twenty-four (24) months following the date of termination of
employment:

                           (i) Executive will not directly or indirectly engage
         in any business which is in competition with any line of business
         conducted by the Company or its affiliates (including without
         limitation by performing or soliciting the performance of services for
         any person who is a customer or client of the Company or any of its
         affiliates) whether such engagement is as an officer, director,
         proprietor, employee, partner, investor (other than as holder of less
         than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of a publicly traded
         corporation), consultant, advisor, agent, sales representative or other
         participant, in any geographic area in which the Company or any of its
         affiliates conducted any such competing line of business.

                           (ii) Executive will not directly or indirectly assist
         others in engaging in any of the activities in which Executive is
         prohibited from engaging in by clause (i) above.

                  (b) Executive will not directly or indirectly induce any
employee of the Company or any of its affiliates to engage in any activity in
which Executive is prohibited to engage by paragraph (a) above or to terminate
his employment with the Company or any of its affiliates, and will not directly
or indirectly employ or offer employment to any person who was employed by the
Company or any of its affiliates unless such person shall have ceased to be
employed by the Company or any of its affiliates for a period of at least 12
months.



                                       5
<PAGE>

                  (c) Executive will not at any time (whether during or after
his employment with the Company) disclose or use for his own benefit or purposes
or the benefit or purposes of any other person, firm, partnership, joint
venture, association, corporation or other business organization, entity or
enterprise other than the Company and any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, any
trade secrets, information, data, or other confidential information relating to
customers, development programs, costs, marketing, trading, investment, sales
activities, promotion, credit and financial data, manufacturing processes,
financing methods, plans, or the business and affairs of the Company generally
or of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, provided that the foregoing
shall not apply to information which is not unique to the Company or which is
generally known to the industry or the public other than as a result of
Executive's breach of this covenant. Executive agrees that upon termination of
his employment with the Company for any reason, he will return to the Company
immediately all memoranda, books, papers, plans, information, letters and other
data, and all copies thereof or therefrom, in any way relating to the business
of the Company and its affiliates, except that he may retain personal notes,
notebooks and diaries. Executive further agrees that he will not retain or use
for his account at any time any trade names, trademark or other proprietary
business designation used or owned in connection with the business of the
Company or its affiliates.

         11. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AND OTHER REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and
agrees that the Company has no adequate remedy at law for a breach or threatened
breach of any of the provisions of Section 10 and, in recognition of this fact,
Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in
addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond and
without notice to Executive, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the
form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or
permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from
pursuing any other remedies at law or in equity that it may have or any other
rights that it may have under any other agreement.

         12. MISCELLANEOUS.

                  (a) GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri without reference
to principles of conflict of laws.

                  (b) ENTIRE AGREEMENT/AMENDMENTS. This Agreement contains the
entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes any prior agreements between the Company and Executive. There are
no restrictions, agreements, promises, warranties, covenants or undertakings
between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein other than those
expressly set forth herein and therein. No provision in this Agreement may be
amended unless such amendment is agreed to in writing.

                  (c) NO WAIVER. The failure of a party to insist upon strict
adherence to any term of this Agreement on any occasion shall not be considered
a waiver of such party's rights or deprive such party of the right thereafter to
insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement.
No waiver by either party of any breach by the other party of any condition or
provision contained in this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall
be deemed a waiver of a similar or dissimilar condition or provision at the same
or any prior or



                                       6
<PAGE>

subsequent time. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by Executive or the
Company, as the case may be.

                  (d) SEVERABILITY. It is expressly understood and agreed that
although Executive and the Company consider the restrictions contained in
Section 10 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a
court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory restriction in
Section 10 or any other restriction contained in Section 10 is an unenforceable
restriction against Executive, such provision shall not be rendered void but
shall be deemed amended to apply to such maximum time and territory, if
applicable, or otherwise to such maximum extent as such court may judicially
determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of
competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in Section 10 is
unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it
enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the
other restrictions contained herein. In the event that any one or more of the
other provisions of this Agreement shall be or become invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.

                  (e) ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall not be assignable by
either party without the consent of the other party.

                  (f) SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the personal or legal representatives, executors,
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of the
parties hereto. Executive shall be entitled to select (and change, to the extent
permitted under any applicable law) a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive
any compensation or benefit payable hereunder following Executive's death by
giving the Company written notice thereof. In the event of Executive's death or
a judicial determination of his incompetence, reference in this Agreement to
Executive shall be deemed, where appropriate, to refer to his beneficiary,
estate or other legal representative.

                  (g) COMMUNICATIONS. For the purpose of this Agreement, notices
and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be deemed to have been duly given when faxed or delivered or two
business days after being mailed by United States registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed (i) to Executive at his
address then appearing in the personnel records of the Company and; (ii) to the
Company at the Company's then current headquarters, with a copy to Brand

Floor, New York, NY 10020, Attention: Christopher Behrens; or (iii) to such
other address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing in
accordance herewith, with such notice of change of address being effective only
upon receipt.

                  (h) WITHHOLDING TAXES. The Company may withhold from any and
all amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state, local and any
other applicable taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any
applicable law or regulation.

                  (i) SURVIVORSHIP. The respective rights and obligations of the
parties hereunder shall survive any termination of Executive's employment to the
extent necessary to assure the agreed preservation of such rights and
obligations.

                  (j) REPRESENTATIONS. Each party represents and warrants to the
other that he or it is fully authorized and empowered to enter into this
Agreement and that the performance of his or its obligations under this
Agreement will not violate any agreement between him or it and any other person
or entity.

                  (k) ARBITRATION. The parties agree that all disputes arising
under or in connection with this Agreement, and any and all claims by Executive
relating to his employment with the Company, including any claims of
discrimination arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as
amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with
Disabilities Act or any similar federal, state or local law will be submitted to
arbitration in the County of St. Louis of the State of Missouri to the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules then prevailing for the type of
claim in issue. The parties each hereby specifically submit to the personal
jurisdiction of any federal or state court located in the County of St. Louis
and the State of Missouri for any such action and further agree that service of
process may be made within or without the State of Missouri by giving notice in
the manner provided herein.

                  In any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement, the
parties agree that no damages other than compensatory damages shall be sought or
claimed by either party and each party waives any claim, right or entitlement to
punitive, exemplary, statutory or consequential damages, or any other damages,
and each relevant arbitration panel is specifically divested of any power to
award any damages in the nature of punitive, exemplary, statutory or
consequential damages, or any other damages of any kind or nature in excess of
compensatory damages.

                  (l) FEES AND EXPENSES. In the event of a dispute by the
Company or Executive as to the validity or enforceability of, or liability
under, any provision of this Agreement and with respect to any claims arising in
connection with Executive's employment with the Company, each party shall pay
its own legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such dispute or
claim; provided, however, and notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a
breach of this Agreement by the Company at any time after a Change of Control,
whether or not litigation is commenced, then the Company shall pay to Executive,

previously paid to Executive; (iii) continued coverage under the Company's
welfare benefit arrangements as in effect from time to time through the earlier

                                    (A) Executive's willful and continued
                           failure substantially to perform his duties under the
                           Agreement (other than as a result of total or partial
                           incapacity due to physical or mental illness);

                                    (B) An act or acts on Executive's part
                           constituting a felony under the laws of the United
                           States or any other state thereof or any other
                           jurisdiction in which the Company conducts business;

                                    (C) Executive's being under the influence of
                           illegal drugs or alcohol while performing his duties
                           hereunder;

                                    (D) Any other act or omission which is
                           materially injurious to the financial condition or
                           business reputation of the Company or any of its

                           Section 10.

                  For purposes of this definition, no act or failure to act
         shall be deemed "willful" unless effected by Executive not in good
         faith and without a reasonable belief that such action or failure to

                  (f) NOTICE OF TERMINATION. Any purported termination of the
Employment Term prior to the Expiration Date by the Company or by Executive
shall be communicated by written notice of termination to the other party

this Section 8 or Section 9 below or in connection with any dispute arising
under or in connection with this Agreement or relating to Executive's employment
with the Company (including payments pursuant to arbitration as provided for in
Section 12(k) hereof) will be contingent upon the execution by Executive of a
release of any claims Executive may have against the Company, its affiliates or
any successor to the Company, such release to be in a form satisfactory to the
Company in its sole discretion.

         9. CHANGE OF TITLE, JOB RESPONSIBILITIES, WORK LOCATION, BASE SALARY

Section 3 of this Agreement, or if Executive's Base Salary is reduced or if

with the covenants set forth in Section 10, to receive (i) the amounts described
under Section 8(a); (ii) continued payment of Base Salary through the last day
of the 24th month following the date of termination (the "Change Severance
Period"); (iii) continued coverage under the Company's welfare benefit
arrangements as in effect from time to time through the earlier of (A) the end
of the Change Severance Period, and (B) such time as Executive is eligible to

         10. NON-COMPETITION/CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

                  (a) Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly
competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and its affiliates and
accordingly agrees that during the Employment Term and through the later of the
Severance Period or twenty-four (24) months following the date of termination of
employment:

                           (i) Executive will not directly or indirectly engage
         in any business which is in competition with any line of business
         conducted by the Company or its affiliates (including without
         limitation by performing or soliciting the performance of services for
         any person who is a customer or client of the Company or any of its
         affiliates) whether such engagement is as an officer, director,
         proprietor, employee, partner, investor (other than as holder of less
         than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of a publicly traded
         corporation), consultant, advisor, agent, sales representative or other
         participant, in any geographic area in which the Company or any of its
         affiliates conducted any such competing line of business.

                           (ii) Executive will not directly or indirectly assist
         others in engaging in any of the activities in which Executive is

employee of the Company or any of its affiliates to engage in any activity in
which Executive is prohibited to engage by paragraph (a) above or to terminate
his employment with the Company or any of its affiliates, and will not directly
or indirectly employ or offer employment to any person who was employed by the
Company or any of its affiliates unless such person shall have ceased to be
employed by the Company or any of its affiliates for a period of at least 12
months.

<PAGE>

                  (c) Executive will not at any time (whether during or after
his employment with the Company) disclose or use for his own benefit or purposes
or the benefit or purposes of any other person, firm, partnership, joint
venture, association, corporation or other business organization, entity or
enterprise other than the Company and any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, any
trade secrets, information, data, or other confidential information relating to
customers, development programs, costs, marketing, trading, investment, sales
activities, promotion, credit and financial data, manufacturing processes,
financing methods, plans, or the business and affairs of the Company generally
or of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, provided that the foregoing
shall not apply to information which is not unique to the Company or which is
generally known to the industry or the public other than as a result of
Executive's breach of this covenant. Executive agrees that upon termination of
his employment with the Company for any reason, he will return to the Company
immediately all memoranda, books, papers, plans, information, letters and other
data, and all copies thereof or therefrom, in any way relating to the business
of the Company and its affiliates, except that he may retain personal notes,
notebooks and diaries. Executive further agrees that he will not retain or use
for his account at any time any trade names, trademark or other proprietary
business designation used or owned in connection with the business of the
Company or its affiliates.

         11. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AND OTHER REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and
agrees that the Company has no adequate remedy at law for a breach or threatened
breach of any of the provisions of Section 10 and, in recognition of this fact,
Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in
addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond and
without notice to Executive, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the
form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or
permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from
pursuing any other remedies at law or in equity that it may have or any other
rights that it may have under any other agreement.

         12. MISCELLANEOUS.

                  (a) GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri without reference
to principles of conflict of laws.

                  (b) ENTIRE AGREEMENT/AMENDMENTS. This Agreement contains the
entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes any prior agreements between the Company and Executive. There are
no restrictions, agreements, promises, warranties, covenants or undertakings
between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein other than those
expressly set forth herein and therein. No provision in this Agreement may be
amended unless such amendment is agreed to in writing.

                  (c) NO WAIVER. The failure of a party to insist upon strict
adherence to any term of this Agreement on any occasion shall not be considered
a waiver of such party's rights or deprive such party of the right thereafter to
insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement.
No waiver by either party of any breach by the other party of any condition or
provision contained in this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall
be deemed a waiver of a similar or dissimilar condition or provision at the same
or any prior or



                                       6
<PAGE>

subsequent time. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by Executive or the
Company, as the case may be.

                  (d) SEVERABILITY. It is expressly understood and agreed that
although Executive and the Company consider the restrictions contained in
Section 10 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a
court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory restriction in
Section 10 or any other restriction contained in Section 10 is an unenforceable
restriction against Executive, such provision shall not be rendered void but
shall be deemed amended to apply to such maximum time and territory, if
applicable, or otherwise to such maximum extent as such court may judicially
determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of
competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in Section 10 is
unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it
enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the
other restrictions contained herein. In the event that any one or more of the
other provisions of this Agreement shall be or become invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.

                  (e) ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall not be assignable by
either party without the consent of the other party.

                  (f) SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the personal or legal representatives, executors,
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of the
parties hereto. Executive shall be entitled to select (and change, to the extent
permitted under any applicable law) a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive
any compensation or benefit payable hereunder following Executive's death by
giving the Company written notice thereof. In the event of Executive's death or
a judicial determination of his incompetence, reference in this Agreement to
Executive shall be deemed, where appropriate, to refer to his beneficiary,
estate or other legal representative.

                  (g) COMMUNICATIONS. For the purpose of this Agreement, notices
and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be deemed to have been duly given when faxed or delivered or two
business days after being mailed by United States registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed (i) to Executive at his
address then appearing in the personnel records of the Company and; (ii) to the

Floor, New York, NY 10020, Attention: Christopher Behrens; or (iii) to such
other address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing in
accordance herewith, with such notice of change of address being effective only
upon receipt.

                  (h) WITHHOLDING TAXES. The Company may withhold from any and
all amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state, local and any
other applicable taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any
applicable law or regulation.

                  (i) SURVIVORSHIP. The respective rights and obligations of the
parties hereunder shall survive any termination of Executive's employment to the
extent necessary to assure the agreed preservation of such rights and
obligations.

                  (j) REPRESENTATIONS. Each party represents and warrants to the
other that he or it is fully authorized and empowered to enter into this
Agreement and that the performance of his or its obligations under this
Agreement will not violate any agreement between him or it and any other person
or entity.

                  (k) ARBITRATION. The parties agree that all disputes arising
under or in connection with this Agreement, and any and all claims by Executive
relating to his employment with the Company, including any claims of
discrimination arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as
amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with
Disabilities Act or any similar federal, state or local law will be submitted to
arbitration in the County of St. Louis of the State of Missouri to the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules then prevailing for the type of
claim in issue. The parties each hereby specifically submit to the personal
jurisdiction of any federal or state court located in the County of St. Louis
and the State of Missouri for any such action and further agree that service of
process may be made within or without the State of Missouri by giving notice in
the manner provided herein.

                  In any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement, the

claimed by either party and each party waives any claim, right or entitlement to

claim; provided, however, and notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a
breach of this Agreement by the Company at any time after a Change of Control,
whether or not litigation is commenced, then the Company shall pay to Executive,
in addition to any damages incurred by Executive, the costs and expenses
incurred by Executive in connection with any such breach (including, without
limitation, all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs).

                                    (A) Executive's willful and continued
                           failure substantially to perform his duties under the
                           Agreement (other than as a result of total or partial
                           incapacity due to physical or mental illness);

                                    (B) An act or acts on Executive's part
                           constituting a felony under the laws of the United
                           States or any other state thereof or any other
                           jurisdiction in which the Company conducts business;

                                    (C) Executive's being under the influence of

                           hereunder;

                                    (D) Any other act or omission which is
                           materially injurious to the financial condition or
                           business reputation of the Company or any of its

                           Section 10.

                  For purposes of this definition, no act or failure to act
         shall be deemed "willful" unless effected by Executive not in good
         faith and without a reasonable belief that such action or failure to

                  (f) NOTICE OF TERMINATION. Any purported termination of the
Employment Term prior to the Expiration Date by the Company or by Executive
shall be communicated by written notice of termination to the other party

this Section 8 or Section 9 below or in connection with any dispute arising
under or in connection with this Agreement or relating to Executive's employment
with the Company (including payments pursuant to arbitration as provided for in
Section 12(k) hereof) will be contingent upon the execution by Executive of a
release of any claims Executive may have against the Company, its affiliates or
any successor to the Company, such release to be in a form satisfactory to the
Company in its sole discretion.

         9. CHANGE OF TITLE, JOB RESPONSIBILITIES, WORK LOCATION, BASE SALARY

of the 24th month following the date of termination (the "Change Severance
Period"); (iii) continued coverage under the Company's welfare benefit
arrangements as in effect from time to time through the earlier of (A) the end

                  (a) Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly
competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and its affiliates and

Severance Period or twenty-four (24) months following the date of termination of
employment:

                           (i) Executive will not directly or indirectly engage
         in any business which is in competition with any line of business
         conducted by the Company or its affiliates (including without
         limitation by performing or soliciting the performance of services for
         any person who is a customer or client of the Company or any of its
         affiliates) whether such engagement is as an officer, director,
         proprietor, employee, partner, investor (other than as holder of less
         than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of a publicly traded
         corporation), consultant, advisor, agent, sales representative or other
         participant, in any geographic area in which the Company or any of its
         affiliates conducted any such competing line of business.

                           (ii) Executive will not directly or indirectly assist
         others in engaging in any of the activities in which Executive is

Company or any of its affiliates unless such person shall have ceased to be
employed by the Company or any of its affiliates for a period of at least 12
months.

<PAGE>

                  (c) Executive will not at any time (whether during or after
his employment with the Company) disclose or use for his own benefit or purposes
or the benefit or purposes of any other person, firm, partnership, joint
venture, association, corporation or other business organization, entity or
enterprise other than the Company and any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, any
trade secrets, information, data, or other confidential information relating to
customers, development programs, costs, marketing, trading, investment, sales
activities, promotion, credit and financial data, manufacturing processes,
financing methods, plans, or the business and affairs of the Company generally
or of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, provided that the foregoing
shall not apply to information which is not unique to the Company or which is
generally known to the industry or the public other than as a result of
Executive's breach of this covenant. Executive agrees that upon termination of
his employment with the Company for any reason, he will return to the Company
immediately all memoranda, books, papers, plans, information, letters and other
data, and all copies thereof or therefrom, in any way relating to the business
of the Company and its affiliates, except that he may retain personal notes,
notebooks and diaries. Executive further agrees that he will not retain or use
for his account at any time any trade names, trademark or other proprietary
business designation used or owned in connection with the business of the
Company or its affiliates.

         11. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AND OTHER REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and
agrees that the Company has no adequate remedy at law for a breach or threatened
breach of any of the provisions of Section 10 and, in recognition of this fact,
Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in
addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond and
without notice to Executive, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the
form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or
permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from
pursuing any other remedies at law or in equity that it may have or any other
rights that it may have under any other agreement.

         12. MISCELLANEOUS.

                  (a) GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri without reference
to principles of conflict of laws.

                  (b) ENTIRE AGREEMENT/AMENDMENTS. This Agreement contains the
entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes any prior agreements between the Company and Executive. There are
no restrictions, agreements, promises, warranties, covenants or undertakings
between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein other than those
expressly set forth herein and therein. No provision in this Agreement may be
amended unless such amendment is agreed to in writing.

                  (c) NO WAIVER. The failure of a party to insist upon strict
adherence to any term of this Agreement on any occasion shall not be considered
a waiver of such party's rights or deprive such party of the right thereafter to
insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement.
No waiver by either party of any breach by the other party of any condition or
provision contained in this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall
be deemed a waiver of a similar or dissimilar condition or provision at the same
or any prior or



                                       6
<PAGE>

subsequent time. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by Executive or the
Company, as the case may be.

                  (d) SEVERABILITY. It is expressly understood and agreed that
although Executive and the Company consider the restrictions contained in
Section 10 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a
court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory restriction in
Section 10 or any other restriction contained in Section 10 is an unenforceable
restriction against Executive, such provision shall not be rendered void but
shall be deemed amended to apply to such maximum time and territory, if
applicable, or otherwise to such maximum extent as such court may judicially
determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of
competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in Section 10 is
unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it
enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the
other restrictions contained herein. In the event that any one or more of the
other provisions of this Agreement shall be or become invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.

                  (e) ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall not be assignable by
either party without the consent of the other party.

                  (f) SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the personal or legal representatives, executors,
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of the
parties hereto. Executive shall be entitled to select (and change, to the extent
permitted under any applicable law) a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive
any compensation or benefit payable hereunder following Executive's death by
giving the Company written notice thereof. In the event of Executive's death or
a judicial determination of his incompetence, reference in this Agreement to
Executive shall be deemed, where appropriate, to refer to his beneficiary,
estate or other legal representative.

                  (g) COMMUNICATIONS. For the purpose of this Agreement, notices
and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be deemed to have been duly given when faxed or delivered or two
business days after being mailed by United States registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed (i) to Executive at his
address then appearing in the personnel records of the Company and; (ii) to the

Floor, New York, NY 10020, Attention: Christopher Behrens; or (iii) to such
other address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing in
accordance herewith, with such notice of change of address being effective only
upon receipt.

                  (h) WITHHOLDING TAXES. The Company may withhold from any and
all amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state, local and any
other applicable taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any
applicable law or regulation.

                  (i) SURVIVORSHIP. The respective rights and obligations of the
parties hereunder shall survive any termination of Executive's employment to the
extent necessary to assure the agreed preservation of such rights and
obligations.

other that he or it is fully authorized and empowered to enter into this
Agreement and that the performance of his or its obligations under this
Agreement will not violate any agreement between him or it and any other person

previously paid to Executive; (iii) continued coverage under the Company's
welfare benefit arrangements as in effect from time to time through the earlier

                                    (A) Executive's willful and continued
                           failure substantially to perform his duties under the
                           Agreement (other than as a result of total or partial
                           incapacity due to physical or mental illness);

                                    (B) An act or acts on Executive's part
                           constituting a felony under the laws of the United
                           States or any other state thereof or any other
                           jurisdiction in which the Company conducts business;

                                    (C) Executive's being under the influence of

                           hereunder;

                                    (D) Any other act or omission which is
                           materially injurious to the financial condition or

                           Section 10.

                  For purposes of this definition, no act or failure to act
         shall be deemed "willful" unless effected by Executive not in good
         faith and without a reasonable belief that such action or failure to

                  (f) NOTICE OF TERMINATION. Any purported termination of the
Employment Term prior to the Expiration Date by the Company or by Executive
shall be communicated by written notice of termination to the other party

this Section 8 or Section 9 below or in connection with any dispute arising
under or in connection with this Agreement or relating to Executive's employment
with the Company (including payments pursuant to arbitration as provided for in
Section 12(k) hereof) will be contingent upon the execution by Executive of a
release of any claims Executive may have against the Company, its affiliates or
any successor to the Company, such release to be in a form satisfactory to the
Company in its sole discretion.

         9. CHANGE OF TITLE, JOB RESPONSIBILITIES, WORK LOCATION, BASE SALARY

of the 24th month following the date of termination (the "Change Severance
Period"); (iii) continued coverage under the Company's welfare benefit
arrangements as in effect from time to time through the earlier of (A) the end

                  (a) Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly
competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and its affiliates and

Severance Period or twenty-four (24) months following the date of termination of
employment:

                           (i) Executive will not directly or indirectly engage
         in any business which is in competition with any line of business
         conducted by the Company or its affiliates (including without
         limitation by performing or soliciting the performance of services for
         any person who is a customer or client of the Company or any of its
         affiliates) whether such engagement is as an officer, director,
         proprietor, employee, partner, investor (other than as holder of less
         than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of a publicly traded
         corporation), consultant, advisor, agent, sales representative or other
         participant, in any geographic area in which the Company or any of its
         affiliates conducted any such competing line of business.

                           (ii) Executive will not directly or indirectly assist
         others in engaging in any of the activities in which Executive is

Company or any of its affiliates unless such person shall have ceased to be
employed by the Company or any of its affiliates for a period of at least 12
months.



                                       5
<PAGE>

                  (c) Executive will not at any time (whether during or after
his employment with the Company) disclose or use for his own benefit or purposes
or the benefit or purposes of any other person, firm, partnership, joint
venture, association, corporation or other business organization, entity or
enterprise other than the Company and any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, any
trade secrets, information, data, or other confidential information relating to
customers, development programs, costs, marketing, trading, investment, sales
activities, promotion, credit and financial data, manufacturing processes,
financing methods, plans, or the business and affairs of the Company generally
or of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, provided that the foregoing
shall not apply to information which is not unique to the Company or which is
generally known to the industry or the public other than as a result of
Executive's breach of this covenant. Executive agrees that upon termination of
his employment with the Company for any reason, he will return to the Company
immediately all memoranda, books, papers, plans, information, letters and other
data, and all copies thereof or therefrom, in any way relating to the business
of the Company and its affiliates, except that he may retain personal notes,
notebooks and diaries. Executive further agrees that he will not retain or use
for his account at any time any trade names, trademark or other proprietary
business designation used or owned in connection with the business of the
Company or its affiliates.

         11. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AND OTHER REMEDIES. Executive acknowledges and
agrees that the Company has no adequate remedy at law for a breach or threatened
breach of any of the provisions of Section 10 and, in recognition of this fact,
Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in
addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond and
without notice to Executive, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the
form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or
permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting the Company from
pursuing any other remedies at law or in equity that it may have or any other
rights that it may have under any other agreement.

         12. MISCELLANEOUS.

                  (a) GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri without reference
to principles of conflict of laws.

                  (b) ENTIRE AGREEMENT/AMENDMENTS. This Agreement contains the
entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes any prior agreements between the Company and Executive. There are
no restrictions, agreements, promises, warranties, covenants or undertakings
between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein other than those
expressly set forth herein and therein. No provision in this Agreement may be
amended unless such amendment is agreed to in writing.

                  (c) NO WAIVER. The failure of a party to insist upon strict
adherence to any term of this Agreement on any occasion shall not be considered
a waiver of such party's rights or deprive such party of the right thereafter to
insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement.
No waiver by either party of any breach by the other party of any condition or
provision contained in this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall
be deemed a waiver of a similar or dissimilar condition or provision at the same
or any prior or



                                       6
<PAGE>

subsequent time. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by Executive or the
Company, as the case may be.

                  (d) SEVERABILITY. It is expressly understood and agreed that
although Executive and the Company consider the restrictions contained in
Section 10 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a
court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory restriction in
Section 10 or any other restriction contained in Section 10 is an unenforceable
restriction against Executive, such provision shall not be rendered void but
shall be deemed amended to apply to such maximum time and territory, if
applicable, or otherwise to such maximum extent as such court may judicially
determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of
competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in Section 10 is
unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it
enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the
other restrictions contained herein. In the event that any one or more of the
other provisions of this Agreement shall be or become invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.

                  (e) ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall not be assignable by
either party without the consent of the other party.

                  (f) SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the personal or legal representatives, executors,
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of the
parties hereto. Executive shall be entitled to select (and change, to the extent
permitted under any applicable law) a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive
any compensation or benefit payable hereunder following Executive's death by
giving the Company written notice thereof. In the event of Executive's death or
a judicial determination of his incompetence, reference in this Agreement to
Executive shall be deemed, where appropriate, to refer to his beneficiary,
estate or other legal representative.

                  (g) COMMUNICATIONS. For the purpose of this Agreement, notices
and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be deemed to have been duly given when faxed or delivered or two
business days after being mailed by United States registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed (i) to Executive at his
address then appearing in the personnel records of the Company and; (ii) to the
Company at the Company's then current headquarters, with a copy to Brand

Floor, New York, NY 10020, Attention: Christopher Behrens; or (iii) to such
other address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing in
accordance herewith, with such notice of change of address being effective only
upon receipt.

                  (j) REPRESENTATIONS. Each party represents and warrants to the
other that he or it is fully authorized and empowered to enter into this
Agreement and that the performance of his or its obligations under this
Agreement will not violate any agreement between him or it and any other person

                  (k) ARBITRATION. The parties agree that all disputes arising

Disabilities Act or any similar federal, state or local law will be submitted to

under, any provision of this Agreement and with respect to any claims arising in
connection with Executive's employment with the Company, each party shall pay
its own legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such dispute or
claim; provided, however, and notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a
breach of this Agreement by the Company at any time after a Change of Control,
whether or not litigation is commenced, then the Company shall pay to Executive,
in addition to any damages incurred by Executive, the costs and expenses
incurred by Executive in connection with any such breach (including, without
limitation, all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs).

                  (m) COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be signed in
