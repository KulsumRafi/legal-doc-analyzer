<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>2002 IDACORP<br>
EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE PLAN<br><br></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u>PURPOSE<br><br></u></b></p>

<p>The purpose of the
IDACORP Executive Incentive Plan (the &quot;Plan&quot;) is to reinforce the
goals for IDACORP (the &quot;Company&quot;) for profitable growth and
continuation of a sound overall financial condition by providing incentive
compensation opportunities to selected key employees.&nbsp; The Plan is intended to:<br><br></p>

<p>Attract,
retain, and motivate key employees.<br><br></p>

<p>Relate
compensation to performance and financial results.<br><br></p>

<p>Shift
a portion of compensation from fixed to a variable form.<br><br></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u>ADMINISTRATION<br><br></u></b></p>

<p>The Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) of IDACORP has authority to:<br><br></p>

<p>Recommend
Plan Participants<br><br></p>

<p>Recommend
target amounts for Plan Participants<br><br></p>

<p>Recommend
the Company and Subsidiary annual goals which will be the basis of Plan awards.<br><br></p>

<p>The Board of
Directors Compensation Committee (the &quot;Committee&quot;) will review the
recommendations of the CEO, make any alterations deemed appropriate, and then
make its recommendations to the full Board.<br><br></p>

<p>The IDACORP Board of
directors (the &quot;Board&quot;) will determine and approve annual awards for
the CEO and Officers, and will be informed of and approve targets and awards
for the other Plan Participants.<br><br></p>

<p>All actions,
determinations, and decisions made by the Board will be final, conclusive, and
binding upon all parties concerned.&nbsp; The
Board has full authority to interpret, change, amend, or discontinue the Plan
in part or as a whole at any time and without prior notice.&nbsp; No member of the Board shall incur any
liability by reason of any action or determination made with respect to the
Plan.<br><br></p>

<p>PARTICIPATION<br><br></p>

<p>Annually the CEO of
the Company, in conjunction with executive officers will review with the
Committee, after which the Committee will submit to the Board the list of
executives for participation in the Plan for that Plan year.&nbsp; Employees recommended should be in a
position to directly and materially affect revenues, profits or losses, or
operating efficiencies of the Company.&nbsp;
Employees will be notified of their participation in the Plan and will
be provided a copy of the performance measures and other criteria for award
determination.<br><br></p>

<p>Employees may become
eligible to participate in the Plan by virtue of promotion or new hire
following the initial eligibility designation.&nbsp;
In such case, award determination will be made on a pro-rata basis as
recommended by the CEO.<br><br></p>

<p>An employee who
retires, dies, or becomes disabled after he becomes a participant shall be
eligible to receive an incentive award.&nbsp;
An employee who terminates employment for reasons other than retirement,
death, or disability after he becomes a participant shall not be eligible to
receive an incentive award.<br><br></p>

<p><b><u>DETERMINATION
OF INCENTIVE AWARDS<br><br></u></b></p>

<p>Incentive awards will
be based upon corporate and/or subsidiary performance measures as described in
the attachment(s).<br><br></p>

<p>The amount of
incentive to be awarded each participant will be calculated by multiplying an
incentive percentage by the salary of each participant.&nbsp; For participants who are active employees on
December 31 of the year for which the incentives are awarded, the salary shall
be the annual rate of base salary in effect on December 1 exclusive of any
amounts earned under any incentive, bonus or benefit plans.&nbsp; For participants to retire, die, become
disabled, commence an approved leave of absence, or receive a base pay increase
during the year, the salary shall be the total base salary paid during the year
exclusive of any amounts earned under any incentive, bonus, or benefit plans.<br><br></p>

<p>Performance between
Threshold and Maximum is measured in steps, or tiers, and no prorating of
incentive will occur between separate tiers.<br><br></p>

<p>Furthermore, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; payout under any goals other than
Corporate will occur only if payout occurs for Corporate performance.&nbsp; On recommendation of the CEO and Committee,
the Board has the discretion to authorize an Individual performance payout for
extraordinary results on the part of a participant.<br><br></p>

<p><b><u>PAYMENT OF
AWARD<br><br></u></b></p>

<p>Incentive awards
under the Plan shall be made in cash by the Company to a participant who is an
active employee (other than those who retire, die or become disabled during the
plan year) as of December 31 of the year for which the award relates.<br><br></p>

<p>Awards under this
Plan will be subject to the same withholding taxes as regular pay, and will be
considered in the calculation of benefits under the Idaho Power Company
Retirement Plan, and the Idaho Power Company Employee Savings Plan.<br><br></p>

<p><b><u>PLAN IS NOT A
CONTRACT<br><br></u></b></p>

<p>No portion of the
Plan is to be construed as a contract for compensation purposes nor for
continued employment with IDACORP or any of its subsidiaries.<br><br></p>

<p><b><u>CHANGE IN
CONTROL<br><br></u></b></p>

<p>In the event of a
change in control, as defined in the plan document for the Idaho Power Company
Senior Management Security Plan, the Committee with approval of the Board&nbsp; will have the prerogative to trigger
payments at any time during the change of control period.&nbsp; The value of such awards, if any, shall be
determined based upon results as of the trigger date.<br><br></p>

<p><b><u>EFFECTIVE DATE<br><br></u></b></p>

<p>The Plan shall become
effective January 1, 2002, and if not terminated by action of the Board of
Directors, shall expire December 31, 2002.<br><br></p>
