sole authority (except as specified otherwise herein) to determine all questions of interpretation and application of the Plan, or of the terms and conditions pursuant to which Awards are granted,
exercised or forfeited under the Plan provisions, and, in general, to make all determinations advisable for the administration of the Plan to achieve its stated purpose. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Plan Administrator may modify, amend, extend or renew outstanding Awards, or accept the surrender of outstanding Awards and substitute new Awards (provided, however,
that, except as provided in Section&nbsp;15H of the Plan, any modification that would materially adversely affect any outstanding Award shall not be made without the consent of the Participant, and
provided, further, that no modification, amendment or substitution that results in repricing a Stock Option to a lower exercise price, other than to reflect an adjustment made pursuant to
Section&nbsp;15H, shall be made without prior stockholder approval). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan Administrator's determinations under the Plan (including without limitation, determinations of the persons to receive Awards, the form, amount and timing of such Awards, the
terms and provisions of such Awards and any agreements evidencing such Awards) need not be uniform and may be made by the Administrator selectively among persons who receive, or are eligible to
receive, Awards under the Plan, whether or not such persons are similarly situated. Such determinations shall be final and not subject to further appeal. </FONT></P>

respect to one or more Awards. No employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall have any right to be granted an Award under this Plan. The Plan Administrator may also grant Awards to individuals
in connection with hiring (as an officer, senior management level or key employee), retention or otherwise, prior to the date the individual first performs services for the Company or a Subsidiary;

granted under the Plan is exercised by tendering shares of Stock to the Company as full or partial payment for such exercise under the Plan, only the number of shares issued net of the shares tendered
shall be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of shares available for delivery under the Plan. </FONT></P>
