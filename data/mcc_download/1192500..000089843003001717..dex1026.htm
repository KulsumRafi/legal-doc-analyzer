covering certain building and rooftop space located at 1980 Post Oak, Houston, Texas (the &#147;<B>Building</B>&#148;). The current landlord under the lease is believed to be Crescent Real Estate Funding X, L.P. (&#147;<B>Landlord</B>&#148;). The
Post Oak Lease expired on September 30, 2002 (the &#147;<B>Expiration Date</B>&#148;) and therefore Buyer is not assuming any obligations of Seller (including EDC Sub) with respect thereto. However, it is acknowledged that certain of the Purchased
Assets to be acquired by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and the AM Asset Purchase Agreement are currently located and operating upon the roof of the Building or related to such rooftop equipment (the &#147;<B>1980 Post Oak Equipment</B>&#148;).
Buyer shall not assume or otherwise be obligated with respect to any obligations of EDC Sub under the Post Oak Lease, it being agreed that Buyer&#146;s sole obligation with respect to the Post Oak Lease shall be to remove the Post Oak Equipment from
the Building pursuant to Section 7.11.2 below. In no event shall Buyer be deemed or construed to have undertaken the obligations of EDC Sub under the Post Oak Lease. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

agreement to be entered into by Landlord and Buyer, on terms acceptable to both parties. If for any reason such separate written agreement is not entered into, EDC Sub confirms that it will assist Buyer in making the necessary arrangements for the
continued operation of the 1980 Post Oak Equipment, as requested by Buyer and as reasonably necessary to assist Buyer to obtain the necessary consents and approvals from Landlord on commercially reasonable terms. </FONT></P><P
