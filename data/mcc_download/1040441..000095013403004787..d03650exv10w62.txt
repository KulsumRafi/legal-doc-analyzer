                                RESOURCE CAPACITY


1.       DEFINITIONS.

         1.1.     Resource Fees.

                  Client shall pay fees according to their defined resource
                  levels as defined herein. Any increase in Client defined
                  resources shall result in an increase in fees paid.

         1.2.     Client Specific Fees.

                  In each case where the Client specific business requirements
                  dictate the use of resources that are not shared with other
                  ALLTEL Client's, such dedicated resources shall be referred to
                  as "client specific." In this Agreement the client specific
                  resources are; network circuits, network equipment, and
                  Client's nonstandard third party software.

2.       RESOURCE CAPACITY.

         2.1.     DASD Capacity.

                  The amount of DASD in use as of the effective date of this
                  Agreement will be the initial resource level.

         2.2.     Network Capacity.

                  The level of network capacity is determined during the annual
                  planning cycle with review of trend reports on usage over the
                  past twelve (12) months and planned changes in their business
                  or workload by the Client, and with agreement of the ALLTEL
                  Account Relationship Executive. The level of network capacity
                  is derived from the following two main components: (1) Number
                  of FEP ports needed for connectivity between ALLTEL and the
                  Client and, (2) Number of LAN ports needed for connectivity
                  between the ALLTEL and Client's LAN. The inventory of FEP and
                  LAN ports will be reported to Client on a monthly basis.
                  Client may request an adjustment to the level of network
                  capacity as described in Section 3, "Capacity Adjustments".

3.       CAPACITY ADJUSTMENTS.

                  The following information pertains to resource increases or
                  decreases that are planned as part of the normal business
                  planning cycle for Client.

         3.1.     Planning Cycle

                  The Mutual Planning Committee will provide at minimum on an
                  annual basis information on Client's business plans and its
                  impact on ALLTEL resource requirements.



                                                                initials /s/ HJF
                                                                             ---
                                                                         /s/ JPF

<PAGE>

         3.2.     Resource Increases

                  Planned increases to any unit of resource will be allowed four
                  (4) times a year with notice in writing to the ALLTEL Account
                  Relationship Executive. All resource increases requested are
                  subject to a minimum timeframe to execute as described in the
                  ALLTEL's Service Delivery Schedule and/or Capacity Adjustments
                  Schedule set forth in Section 3.4 of Exhibit E-2. If resources
                  are available and do not require ALLTEL to upgrade or replace
                  any equipment, then the request by Client will be handled
                  within a minimum of thirty (30) days from time of the request.

         3.3.     Resource Decreases

                  Decreases will be allowed four (4) times a year with notice in
                  writing to the ALLTEL Account Relationship Executive. ALLTEL
                  will make reasonable effort to re-deploy the resources earlier
                  than the minimum timeframe defined in the table in Section
                  3.4, and if ALLTEL is able to, will do so.

4.       UNPLANNED RESOURCE INCREASES.

         4.1.     Occurrence Cycle

                  The Fees set forth in this Exhibit E include certain Network
                  and Systems personnel as defined in Exhibit F as "Base Staff".
                  These are specifically dedicated to or functioning on behalf
                  of Client. The Base Staff will perform the Systems Support and
                  Network Support Services as outlined in Exhibit F as Base
                  Staff (Network Systems) and Base Staff (Systems Support).
                  Should the volume of Client Systems & Network Services
                  requests exceed that which can reasonably be performed by the
                  Base Staff Client shall increase the level of Base Staff in
                  accordance with the provisions of Section 3 (Increases in Base
                  Staff) of the Base Staff provisions of Exhibit F. The ALLTEL
                  Account Relationship Executive will notify Client of requests
                  that are outside the scope of the Monthly Fee and that will
                  result in additional, incremental charges to Client. ALLTEL
                  shall utilize commercially reasonable efforts to manage the
                  dedicated resources in such a manner as to minimize such
                  incremental additional fees. Client acknowledges that it can
                  also help minimize such additional charges through advanced
                  scheduling and notification to ALLTEL of such work requests
                  and through

5.       CLIENT'S CURRENT NETWORK (Effective 05/01/01)

                (1) DS1 Circuit for VSAT connection from Hughes'
                   facility in Minneapolis, Minnesota to LRTC

                 (1) DS1 Circuit for Beverly Corp. headquarters
                                location to LRTC

                  (1) SDLC FEP Port on shared 3745 for BCBS of
                                   California

                      Raised floor space for Beverly owned
                                   equipment.

               (4) Dial-out FEP Port on shared 3745 for subsidiary

                                     support

6.       DEFINITION OF BACKBONE.

         The circuit(s) between the Technology Center's telephone carrier and
         the remote Client, called the "backbone" circuit(s), while considered
         Client specific in terms of charges, is engineered and provisioned by
         the Technology Center to provide maximum availability on behalf of
         Client. The portion of the circuit between the Technology Center and
         the local telephone company in Little Rock rides on dedicated fiber
         circuits that are survivable, meaning that if any failure occurs in the
         ring in one direction, the data are routed automatically in the reverse
         direction with no loss of data.

7.       SERVICES FOR BASE NETWORK

         Services for Base Network shall Include the ALLTEL Technology Center
         host attachments, the communications equipment, cables and multiplexing
         required to bring a communication line to the ALLTEL Technology Center
         from the telephone carrier as well as the circuits between the ALLTEL
         Technology Center and the local telephone company in Little Rock. Also
         included are the remote cabling and communications equipment required
         to terminate the port. Maintenance contracts cover the components and
         those costs are included in the network fee. Disaster recovery fees
         shall be in addition to the network fees.

8.       ANALOG NETWORK SERVICES

         Analog network equipment located at ALLTEL used for file transmissions
         and other production-related activities (detailed in Exhibit D) will be
         owned (ownership transferred at no cost to ALLTEL at Client's request
         under the Agreement), monitored, operated and managed by ALLTEL
         However, this equipment is expected to be displaced during the term of
         the Agreement, and, by Client's request, is not currently or will be
         placed under

         necessary repairs, replacement or problem resolution will be initiated
         by ALLTEL and all associated costs (i.e. Labor and Materials) of such
         repair/replacement will be billed to Client as Pass-Through Expense.
         ALLTEL will make every reasonable effort to minimize such expense and
         will notify Client in advance of any such expenditures to the extent
         practical.

ALLTEL will calculate CPU seconds in the following manner:

         (1)      ALLTEL will extract the total number of CPU-seconds by "user"
                  workloads for each calendar month as captured by Tivoli
                  Decision Support for OS/390 from the Beverly OS/390 RMF
                  records. As of the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, the
                  following OS/390 workload manager workloads are considered to
                  be SYSTEM workloads: SYSTEM, SYSSTC, SYSOTHER, and STCHIGH.
                  All other workloads are considered to be "user" workloads.

         (2)      ALLTEL will Normalize the CPU-seconds using an IBM 9672-R56
                  engine speed of 109 mips as the standard. As of the Fifth
                  Amendment Effective Date, Client is

                  normalization factor due to a change of engine speed will be
                  effective as of the change date.

ALLTEL will calculate production jobs in the following manner:

         (1)      ALLTEL will extract the total number of Production Job records
                  for the calendar month, as captured by Tivoli Decision Support
                  for OS/390, from the Beverly OS/390 SMF records by selecting
                  all records that contain in column 26 of the Job Card a "P"
                  for production or if RACFUSER is (SYMBOL) CBEVP000, ZEKE,
                  SARVTAM, PANAPT, RMOSTC, and MAILBOX.

                             CREDITS AND INCENTIVES

Within ninety (90) days after the Fifth Amendment Effective Date, ALLTEL and
Client shall negotiate in good faith to reach mutually agreeable performance
incentives and credits related to batch processing windows. Client agrees to
provide the necessary assistance to ALLTEL during such ninety (90) day period to
determine reasonable performance standards and the associated incentives and
credits.

Services Levels - The following categories will be used to determine the
priority of each service level outage that is to be measured monthly:

         o        Priority 1. Total major service outage to online user(s) or
                  component(s) failure.

         o        Priority 2. Limited user(s) or component(s) failed or
                  degraded.

         o        Priority 3. Minor impact to non-critical user(s) or component
                  fails or degraded.

The purpose of the categorization is to keep Client and ALLTEL focused on the
most critical service components. In the event of a failure to meet the service
level as defined in Exhibit A-2, and if ALLTEL fails to correct the service
level problem as defined in Exhibit A-2, then Client can request payment of the
credit as outlined below.

         o        In the event of failures in Priority 1 or 2 which ALLTEL fails
                  to correct within ____, Client may assess to ALLTEL a credit
