(As amended and restated December 2, 1992, December&nbsp;7, 1994, February 24, 1995, November 1, 1996, as of December 4, 1996, February 27, 1998, December 1, 1999, February 25, 2000, October 3, 2001 , December 5, 2001, May 22, 2002 and December&nbsp;4, 2002)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1.&#9;<U>Purpose</P>
</U><P>&#9;The purpose of the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan ("the Plan") is to attract, retain and motivate strong management employees by providing additional incentive to key employees of Peoples Energy Corporation (the "Company") and its Subsidiaries (as defined by paragraph 13) to acquire a proprietary interest in the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and by encouraging the interest of such persons in the financial success and growth of the Company. The Plan contemplates the granting of non-qualified stock options (i.e. options which are not "statutory" within the meaning of Section 1.421-7(b) of the regulations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) ("Options"), Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs") or restricted stock awards, or combinations thereof. A key employee may be granted and may hold one or more Options, SARs, restricted stock awards or any combination thereof under this Plan.</P>
<P>2.&#9;<U>Administration</P>
</U><P>&#9;(a)&#9;<U>Generally</P>
</U><P>&#9;Except to the extent that this Plan applies to the Chief Executive Officer, this Plan shall be administered solely by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee"). The Committee shall be composed of not less than three persons who shall be appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") from the membership of the Board. No person who is an officer or employee of the Company or a Subsidiary shall be a member of the Committee nor shall any person be a member of the Committee whose membership would disqualify any transactions made under the Plan from complying with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") or any successor rule thereunder. Except to the extent that this Plan applies to the Chief Executive Officer, the Committee is solely authorized to prescribe the form and content of Options, SARs and restricted stock awards to be granted under the Plan, to interpret the Plan, to prescribe, amend or rescind rules and regulations relating to it, and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for its administration.</P>
<P>&#9;(b)&#9;<U>Chief Executive Officer</P>
</U><P>&#9;With respect to the Chief Executive Officer, this Plan shall be administered by the Committee subject to the approval of the majority of all members of the Board (including members of the Committee) who are not officers or employees of the Company or a Subsidiary and who are Non-Employee Directors as defined under Rule 16b-3 under the 1934 Act (the "Outside Directors"). The Outside Directors shall not include any person whose inclusion would disqualify any transactions made under the Plan from complying with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 under the 1934 Act or any successor rule thereunder. With respect to the Chief Executive Officer, the Committee is authorized to prescribe the form and content of Options, SARs and restricted stock awards to be granted under the Plan to interpret the Plan, to prescribe, amend, or rescind rules and regulations relating to it, and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for its administration, subject to the approval of the majority of the Outside Directors. All references to the "Committee" contained in any provision of paragraphs 3 through 13 of this Plan shall, to the extent that such provision applies to the Chief Executive Officer, be deemed and construed to mean the Committee, the decisions of which shall be subject to the approval of the majority of the Outside Directors.</P>
<P>3.&#9;<U>Incentive Awards</P>
</U><P>&#9;Under the Plan participants may be granted any one or more of the following:</P><DIR>

<OL TYPE="a">
<LI><P><U>Options</U>: non-qualified stock options to purchase stock of the Company at a purchase price of 100 percent of the fair market value of such Common Stock on the date that the Option is granted. The stock under Options granted under the Plan shall be shares of the Company's common stock, without par value ("Common Stock").</P>
<LI><P><U>SARs</U>: a right to receive, for each SAR granted, cash in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of one share of the Common Stock of the Company on the date the SAR is exercised over the fair market value of such Common Stock on the date the SAR is granted.</P>
<LI><P><U>Restricted Stock Awards</U>: shares of Common Stock which are restricted as provided in paragraph 8.</P>
</OL></DIR>

<P>&#9;Up to 4,300,000 shares of Common Stock (500,000 originally authorized under the Plan plus an additional 500,000 authorized for grant by the stockholders on February 28, 1986 plus an additional 400,000 authorized for grant by the stockholders on February 23, 1990 plus an additional 400,000 authorized for grant by the stockholders on February 24, 1995 plus an additional 2,500,000 authorized for grant by the stockholders on February 25, 2000) may be sold under Options granted pursuant to the Plan or awarded pursuant to restricted stock awards granted under the Plan, provided that the number of shares available for sale or award hereunder shall be subject to adjustment as provided in paragraph 9 and provided further that the total number of shares of Common Stock that may be used for restricted stock awards granted under the Plan during the period commencing February 25, 2000 and ending May 1, 2010 is limited to a maximum of 500,000 shares (subject to adjustment as provided in paragraph 9). Up to 4,300,000 SARs (1,000,000 originally authorized under the Plan plus an additional 400,000 authorized for grant by the shareholders on February 23, 1990 plus an additional 400,000 authorized for grant by the stockholders on February 24, 1995 plus an additional 2,500,000 authorized for grant by the stockholders on February 25, 2000) may be granted pursuant to the Plan, provided that the number of SARs available for granting hereunder shall be subject to adjustment as provided in paragraph 9.</P>
<P>&#9;If an Option or SAR ceases to be exercisable in whole or in part by reason of the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR, the termination of the employment of the recipient or the waiver by a recipient of the right to exercise an Option or SAR, the shares or SAR which were subject to such exercise but as to which the recipient has not exercised, shall again become available for further grants under the Plan. If a restricted stock award is forfeited in whole or in part by reason of the termination of the employment of the recipient before such award has become fully vested, the shares which were subject to such restricted stock award but which were not vested shall again become available for further grants under the Plan.</P>
<P>&#9;The Common Stock to be delivered under the Plan may be made available from authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, treasury stock or shares of Common Stock purchased on the open market. Shares of Common Stock purchased on the open market shall be purchased by an agent designated by the Company in compliance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act to the extent compliance shall be required by law.</P>
<P>4.&#9;<U>Designation of Recipients and Allotment of Shares and SARs</P>
</U><P>&#9;The Committee shall determine and designate from time to time those key employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including officers and directors employed in capacities other than as directors only) to whom Options, SARs and restricted stock awards, or any combination thereof, shall be granted and who shall thereby become recipients. The Committee shall also determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be optioned, the number of SARs to be granted and the number of shares of restricted stock to be granted from time to time to each recipient.</P>
<P>&#9;In selecting the key employees to whom Options, SARs or restricted stock awards, or any combination thereof, shall be granted, as well as in determining the number of SARs, shares under Option, or shares of restricted stock to be granted to key employees, the Committee shall weigh the positions and responsibilities of the individuals being considered, the nature of their services to the Company, their past, present and potential contributions to the success of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and such other factors as the Committee shall deem relevant to accomplish the purposes of the Plan; provided, however, that a restricted stock award shall be granted only in recognition of and as consideration for the performance of services by the recipient or other consideration received by the Company prior to the time of grant. Directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries who are not officers or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall not be eligible to become recipients under the Plan. No Option, SAR or restricted stock award shall be granted to any individual possessing more than 5 percent of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries. In no event may any individual be granted in excess of 60,000 Options or in excess of 60,000 SARs during any one fiscal year of the Company, provided that such maximum number of Options and SARs that may be granted to any individual in one fiscal year shall be subject to adjustment as provided in paragraph 9. Each recipient shall agree to continue such recipient's employee status for such period (not less than one year) as shall be provided in the Option, SAR or restricted stock award, subject to the right of the recipient's employer to terminate the recipient's employment at any time. Options, SARs and restricted stock awards shall contain such conditions and restrictions as to exercise, the purchase and delivery of shares, and the forfeiture of shares, and such provisions as to the rights of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as may be deemed advisable by the Committee.</P>
<P>&#9;The Committee may grant Options, SARs or restricted stock awards to any key employee at any time or from time to time during the period of such employee's employment under the Plan, in accordance with such determinations as the Committee shall make from time to time. Options, SARs and restricted stock awards need not contain similar provisions.</P>
<P>5.&#9;<U>Term of Plan</P>
</U><P>&#9;No Option, SAR or restricted stock award may be granted under this Plan after May 1, 2010.</P>
<P>6.&#9;<U>Option and SAR Price</P>
</U><P>&#9;Shares of the Common Stock of the Company shall be optioned and SARs shall be granted from time to time at 100 percent of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date the Option or SAR is granted (rounded, in the case of a fraction of a cent, to the nearest full cent above). The day on which the Committee approves the granting of an Option or SAR shall be considered the date on which such Option or SAR is granted. The fair market value of the Common Stock on the date the Option or SAR is granted shall be the mean between the highest and lowest quoted selling price in the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions on such date or, if such stock was not traded on such date, on the last preceding date on which such stock was traded.</P>
<P>7.&#9;<U>Terms of Options and SARs</P>
</U><P>&#9;Each Option or SAR granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a written agreement which shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:</P><DIR>

<OL TYPE="a">
<LI><P>Full payment for shares purchased shall be made in cash and/or Common Stock of the Company at the time or times the Option is exercised in whole or in part. Subject to the Committee's sole discretion and to such rules and regulations as the Committee shall from time to time establish, payment may be made at the recipient's election (i) by means of a Broker-Assisted Transaction, (ii) by the Company's deducting from the number of shares otherwise deliverable upon the exercise of the Option such number of shares of Common Stock as shall have a value equal to the amount of the Option exercise price (or portion thereof not paid for in cash), or (iii) by the recipient's delivery of such number of shares of Common Stock as shall have a value equal to the amount of the Option exercise price (or portion thereof not paid for in cash), provided such Common Stock has been issued and outstanding for at least six (6) months. Any such Common Stock submitted in payment for an Option exercise pursuant to clause (ii) or clause (iii) of the preceding sentence shall be valued at the mean between the highest and lowest quoted selling price of such Common Stock of the Company in the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions on the date of exercise or, if such stock was not traded on such date, on the last preceding date on which such stock was traded. Any Common Stock used in connection with payment for an Option exercise pursuant to a Broker-Assisted Transaction shall be valued at the actual price per share at which the sale transaction is executed by the broker. No shares shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option until full payment thereof has been made and no person shall have any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to Options held, except to the extent such Options have been exercised and the shares issued to such person.</P>
<LI><P>A recipient's rights to exercise an Option or SAR shall terminate when the recipient is no longer an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries unless such recipient's employment is terminated by reason of such recipient's death, disability or retirement.</P>
<LI><P>If a recipient dies prior to termination of such recipient's Option or SAR without having fully exercised such Option or SAR, the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by such recipient pursuant to paragraph 7(f) hereof, or, if no such beneficiary or beneficiaries have been designated by such recipient or if no such beneficiary or beneficiaries have survived the recipient, then the recipient's surviving spouse, or, if the recipient has no surviving spouse, then the estate of the recipient or any person who acquires the right to exercise such Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of the recipient, shall have the right to exercise the Option or SAR during its term within the three year period after the recipient's death Such Option or SAR shall become immediately exercisable upon the recipient's death.</P>
<LI><P>If a recipient's employment is terminated by reason of such recipient's disability (as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee) prior to termination of such recipient's Option or SAR without the recipient's having fully exercised such Option or SAR, such recipient shall have the right to exercise the Option or SAR during its term within such period as may be provided at the time of the grant, not to exceed three years after termination of employment; provided that no such Option or SAR may be exercised prior to the date which is one year after the date of the grant of such Option or SAR.</P>
<LI><P>(i) If a recipient retires prior to termination of such recipient's Option or SAR without having fully exercised such Option or SAR, such recipient shall have the right to exercise the Option or SAR during its term within such period as may be provided at the time of the grant, not to exceed three years after retirement, but only to the extent such Option or SAR was exercisable by the recipient immediately prior to such recipient's retirement, except as set forth in subparagraph 7(e)(ii) below.</P>
<DIR><P>(ii) Subject to paragraph 7(g) below, if a recipient retires on or after attaining age 65 (or such earlier date as determined by the Committee), such recipient shall have the right to exercise his or her Option or SAR granted within one year of retirement within the term of such Option or SAR as may be provided at the time of the grant, not to exceed three years after retirement.</P></DIR>
<LI><P>Except as otherwise expressly provided in this paragraph 7(f), Options and SARs shall not be transferable other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and during a recipient's lifetime shall be exercisable only by the recipient or the recipient's guardian or legal representative. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a recipient may, by giving notice to the Company during the recipient's lifetime, designate (i) a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom Options or SARs shall be transferred in the event of the recipient's death, and (ii) the specific number or proportions of the recipient's Options or SARs to be transferred to each such designated beneficiary if more than one beneficiary is properly designated. Any such designation may be revoked or changed by the recipient at any time and from time to time by similar notice. If there is no such designated beneficiary living upon the death of the recipient or if all such designated beneficiaries die prior to exercise of all of the recipient's Options and SARs under this Plan, any remaining Options and SARs shall be transferred to the recipient's surviving spouse or, if none, then the remaining Options and SARs will be transferred to the estate or personal representative of the recipient. If the Company, after reasonable inquiry, is unable to determine within twelve months after the recipient's death whether any designated beneficiary of such recipient did in fact survive the recipient, such beneficiary shall be conclusively presumed to have died prior to the recipient's death. Any designated beneficiary, surviving spouse or other person acquiring any Options or SARs pursuant to this paragraph 7(f) shall have the right to exercise such Options and SARs as set forth in paragraph 7(c), above.</P>
<LI><P>Subject to paragraphs 7(d), 7(e)(ii) and 7(j), no Option or SAR granted under this Plan shall be exercisable before the expiration of one year from the date of grant of such Option or SAR; provided, however, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the exercisability of any or all Options or SARs granted under the Plan.</P>
<LI><P>Options and SARs granted under this Plan shall contain such provisions as may be deemed advisable by the Committee.</P>
<LI><P>In no event shall any Option or SAR granted under the Plan be exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the date such Option or SAR is granted.</P>
<LI><P>All outstanding Options and SARs granted under the Plan shall immediately become exercisable in accordance with Section&nbsp;7(c) hereof or upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined by paragraph 13).</P>

<LI><P>Shares of Common Stock covered by a restricted stock award will be held by the Company until such shares have become vested pursuant to paragraph 8(d) or 8(f), and will thereupon, subject to the satisfaction of the withholding obligations described in paragraph 11, be delivered to the recipient.</P>
<LI><P>Shares of Common Stock covered by a restricted stock award granted to a recipient shall vest in accordance with the terms of the grant; provided, however, that shares of Common Stock covered by a restricted stock award granted to a recipient shall vest with respect to 100% of the shares covered by the restricted stock award upon the termination of the recipient's employment by reason of death, disability (as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee) or retirement after attaining age 65 (or such earlier date as determined by the Committee). In addition, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the vesting of any or all restricted stock awards granted under the Plan. A recipient may, by giving notice to the Company during the recipient's lifetime, designate (i) a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom shares of restricted stock covered by a restricted stock award shall be transferred in the event of the recipient's death, and (ii) the specific number or proportions of such shares of Common Stock to be transferred to each such designated beneficiary if more than one beneficiary is properly designated. Any such designation may be revoked or changed by the recipient at any time and from time to time by similar notice. If there is no such designated beneficiary living upon the death of the recipient or if all such designated beneficiaries die prior to vesting of all shares of Common Stock covered by a restricted stock award of the recipient, any remaining shares of Common Stock vesting upon the recipient's death shall be transferred to the recipient's surviving spouse or, if none, then the remaining shares so vesting will be transferred to the estate or personal representative of the recipient.

<LI><P>In the event of the termination of employment of the recipient of a restricted stock award other than by reason of death, disability (as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee) or retirement after attaining age 65 (or such earlier date as determined by the Committee) the recipient will forfeit the shares of Common Stock covered by the restricted stock award which are not vested.</P>
