                 -----------------------------------------------------

     (a) Whenever an Enhancement Increase Condition exists and the Excess
Collateral Amount Allocation Percentage is less than the Required Excess
Collateral Amount Percentage, the Seller shall increase the Excess Collateral
Amount by the applicable Enhancement Increase Amount. Such increase shall be
effected by reducing the Seller Amount, if any, by the lesser of such
Enhancement Increase Amount and the amount, if any, by which the Seller Amount
exceeds the Minimum Seller Amount immediately prior to such increase and by
reallocating such amount to the Excess Collateral Amount. If, after giving
effect to the preceding sentence, the Excess Collateral Amount Allocation
Percentage is less than the Required Excess Collateral Amount Percentage, the
Seller shall immediately make a deposit in the Excess Funding Account in
immediately

                                       23

available funds in the amount necessary to cure such deficiency. Concurrently
with the decrease in the Seller Amount and any required deposit to the Excess
Funding Account, the Excess Collateral Amount shall be increased by the
aggregate amount of such decrease and of such deposit. If the Seller makes a
deposit to the Excess Funding Account as described above, and the balance on
deposit in the Excess Funding Account as a result of such deposit exceeds 20% of
the Portfolio Sub-Limit and is not reduced below that level for a period of 60
consecutive days, then the Seller shall give notice commencing a Limited
Amortization Period with a Limited Amortization Amount of not less than the
balance on deposit on the Excess Funding Account at the time such notice is
given.

     (b) Unless the Pay-Out Commencement Date shall have occurred, on any
Distribution Date when the Excess Collateral Amount Allocation Percentage
exceeds the Required Excess Collateral Amount Percentage (giving effect to any
permitted reduction thereof) (including when a Terms Change Enhancement Increase
Condition is no longer continuing), the Servicer shall allocate to the Excess
Collateral Amount Holders from the Principal Collections Subaccount an amount
equal to the lesser of (i) the excess of the amount of Collections of Principal
Receivables allocated to the Principal Collections Subaccount pursuant to
Section 4.3(b)(ii) over the amount of Excess Collateral Amount Reallocated
------------------
Amounts with respect to such Distribution Date and (ii) the amount that when
subtracted from the Excess Collateral Amount (after giving effect to amounts
previously allocated from the Principal Collections Subaccount pursuant to this
Section 4.8(b)) will cause the Excess Collateral Amount Allocation Percentage to
--------------
equal the Required Excess Collateral Amount Percentage (taking into account any
other Enhancement Increase Condition that is still continuing); provided,
                                                                --------

Servicer pursuant hereto without instruction from the Servicer or Seller. The
Indenture Trustee shall be required to make any such payment, deposit or
withdrawal hereunder only to the extent that the Indenture Trustee has
sufficient information to allow it to determine the amount thereof. The Servicer
shall, upon request of the Indenture Trustee, promptly provide the Indenture
Trustee with all information necessary to allow the Indenture Trustee to make

Indenture Trustee to allocate, Reallocated Principal Reserves in the amount of
such excess, first, if any other Principal Sharing Series is outstanding and in
its accumulation period to amortization period, to be retained in the Collection
Account for application, to the extent necessary, as Shared Principal
Collections to other Principal Sharing Series on the related Distribution Date,

     Section 7.1 Terms Change Condition. FCNB will not make any change in the
                 ----------------------
basic terms of the Charge Account Agreements in respect of the Accounts that
would cause the minimum monthly payment specified therein (i) to be less

                                       31

<PAGE>

than $12.50 (or the remaining balance, if less) unless the Required Conduit
Managing Agents shall have given their prior written consent with respect
thereto or (ii) to be less than $15 (or the remaining balance, if less) unless
either the Required Conduit Managing Agents shall have given their prior written
consent with respect thereto or the Terms Change Enhancement Increase Condition
is satisfied with respect thereto (the "Terms Change Condition"). For purposes
                                        ----------------------
of this Section 7.1, credit based promotions, including deferred billing
        -----------
arrangements, skip payment programs and payment holidays shall not be deemed to
be a change in the basic terms of the Charge Account Agreements so long as (i)
the terms on which FCNB provides such promotions to the relevant merchant are at
least as favorable to FCNB (as determined in good faith by FCNB) as FCNB would
obtain in a comparable arm's length transaction with a merchant that is not an
Affiliate of FCNB and (ii) the allocable share of any related merchant subsidy
payments for any Monthly Period are paid by FCNB to the Trust on an "as earned"
basis. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the share of such subsidy
payments allocable to the Trust during any Monthly Period shall be based upon
FCNB's good faith estimate (which shall be final and binding for all purposes of
the Indenture) of the portion thereof allocable to the Accounts for such period.
Any such payment shall be made by FCNB on the Determination Date following the
Monthly Period in which such payments are earned and shall be treated for all
purposes of the Indenture (including for purposes of calculating Portfolio
Yield) as Finance Charge Collections for such Monthly Period.

ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS

     Section 7.11 Certain Calculations. In accordance with Section 1.3 of the
                  --------------------                     -----------
Indenture, the Servicer has adopted the following method of determining the
amount of Finance Charge Receivables:

          (i) At the close of business on each Cycle Billing Date for any Cycle
     of which any Accounts are included in the Trust, the amount of Finance
     Charge Receivables of all Accounts in such Cycle shall be equal to the
     result of (A) the amount of Finance Charges charged to all Accounts in such
     Cycle on such date minus (B) the amount of Finance Charge Receivables on
     all Accounts in such Cycle that have been charged off since the close of
     business on the preceding Cycle Billing Date. As of the end of each Monthly
     Period, the amount of Finance Charge Receivables for all Accounts shall
     equal (X) the sum of the amounts calculated pursuant to the preceding
     sentence for each Cycle of which Accounts are included in the Trust during
     that Monthly Period plus (Y) the Carry-Over Finance Charge Amount.

          (ii) For each Business Day in each Monthly Period, the amount of
     Collections allocated to Finance Charge Receivables for all Accounts shall
     be all Collections available for allocation on that Business Day up to an
     amount equal to the quotient of the result determined pursuant to clause
     (i) above as of the end of the immediately preceding Monthly Period divided
     by the number of Business Days in such present Monthly Period; provided,
                                                                    --------

     however, that (A) the amount of Collections allocated to Finance Charge
     -------
     Receivables for all Accounts on the first Business Day of each Monthly
     Period shall equal the product of two times such quotient, (B) the amount
     of Collections allocated to Finance Charge Receivables for all Accounts on
     the last Business Day of each Monthly Period shall equal zero and (C) to
     the extent that the total Collections available for allocation on any
     Business Day (other than the last Business Day of a Monthly Period) is less
     than the amount that is to be allocated to Collections of Finance Charge
     Receivables on that Business Day, then the deficit shall be added to the
     amount of Collections that will be allocated to Finance Charge Receivables
     on the next Business Day.

          (iii) If, at the close of business on the last Business Day of any
     Monthly Period, the amount of Collections allocated to Finance Charge
     Receivables for all Accounts during such Monthly Period is less than the
     amount of Finance Charge Receivables for all Accounts calculated pursuant
     to clause (i) as of the end of the next preceding Monthly Period, then such
     deficit shall be the "Carry-Over Finance Charge Amount" and shall be added
                           --------------------------------
     to the amount of Finance Charges Receivables as of the end of the then
     current Monthly Period pursuant to clause (i).

     Notwithstanding the terms of Section 1.3 of the Indenture, the Servicer
                                  -----------
shall not adopt a method of determining the amount of Finance Charge

                                       34

<PAGE>

Receivables different from the method described above without the consent of
each Conduit Managing Agent.

     Section 7.12 Repurchase Requests. On any Business Day, Seller may make a
                  -------------------
written offer (a "Repurchase Offer") to each Conduit Managing Agent to redeem
                  ----------------
all or a portion of the principal balance of the Class A Notes. Each Conduit
Managing Agent may accept or reject such offer. If all of the Conduit Managing
Agents accept the offer, then on the day that the repurchase is consummated the
purchase price agreed upon between Seller and the Conduit Managing Agents shall
be deposited in the Collection Account and shall be distributed to the Conduit
Managing Agents on the date of the repurchase. Upon such payment, the Class A
Collateral Amount shall decrease by an amount equal to the principal amount of
the interest conveyed, and the Excess Collateral Amount shall automatically
decrease to an amount so that the Excess Collateral Amount (after such decrease)
shall equal the Required Excess Collateral Amount Percentage of the Collateral
Amount (after such decrease). To the extent agreed upon between Seller and the
Conduit Managing Agents, a portion of the purchase price paid shall decrease the
amount of Class Note Interest and Program Commitment Fee payable on the next
Distribution Date.

     Section 7.13 Perfection Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The
                  ----------------------------------------------------
parties hereto agree that the representations, warranties and covenants set
forth in Schedule I shall be a part of this Indenture Supplement for all
         ----------
purposes.

     Section 7.14 Rights of the Indenture Trustee. The Indenture Trustee shall
                  -------------------------------
be entitled to the same rights, protections, immunities and indemnities set
forth in the Master Indenture as if specifically set forth herein.

     Section 7.15 Limitation of Liability. Notwithstanding any other provision
                  -----------------------
herein or elsewhere, this Indenture Supplement has been executed and delivered
by Bankers Trust Company, not in its individual capacity, but solely in its
capacity as Owner Trustee of the Trust, in no event shall Bankers Trust Company
in its individual capacity have any liability in respect of the representations,

                                   SCHEDULE 1
                     TO SERIES 2001-VFN INDENTURE SUPPLEMENT

                     PERFECTION REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES
                                  AND COVENANTS

     (a) In addition to the representations, warranties and covenants contained
in the Indenture, the Issuer hereby represents, warrants and covenants to the
Indenture Trustee as follows as of October   , 2001:
                                           --

     (1) The Indenture creates a valid and continuing security interest (as
defined in the applicable Uniform Commercial Code) in the Collateral Certificate
in favor of the Indenture Trustee, which security interest is prior to all other
Liens, and is enforceable as such against creditors of and purchasers from
Issuer.

     (2) The Collateral Certificate constitutes an "instrument," a "general
intangible" or a "certificated security" within the meaning of the applicable
Uniform Commercial Code.

     (3) Issuer owns and has good and marketable title to the Collateral
Certificate free and clear of any Lien, claim or encumbrance of any Person;
provided that nothing in this paragraph (a) (3) shall prevent or be deemed to
--------                      -----------------
prohibit Issuer from suffering to exist upon any of the Receivables any Liens
for any taxes if such taxes shall not at the time be due and payable or if FCNB,
Seller or Issuer, as applicable, shall currently be contesting the validity
thereof in good faith by appropriate proceedings and shall have set aside on its
books adequate reserves with respect thereto.

     (4) There are no consents or approvals required by the terms of the
Collateral Certificate for the pledge of the Collateral Certificate to the
Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture.

     (5) Issuer (or the Administrator on behalf of the Issuer) has caused the
filing of all appropriate financing statements in the proper filing office in
the appropriate jurisdictions under applicable law in order to perfect the
security interest granted to the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture in the
Collateral Certificate.

     (6) There is only one executed copy of the Collateral Certificate and such
copy has been delivered to the Indenture Trustee. The Collateral Certificate is
registered in the name of the Indenture Trustee, upon original issue or
registration of transfer by the Issuer.

     (7) Other than the pledge of the Collateral Certificate to Indenture
Trustee pursuant to the Indenture, Issuer has not pledged, assigned, sold,
granted a security interest in, or otherwise conveyed the Collateral
Certificate. Issuer has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of any
financing statements against Issuer that include a description of collateral
covering the Collateral Certificate, except for the financing statement filed
pursuant to the Indenture.

<PAGE>

     (8) The Issuer is not aware of any judgment, ERISA or tax lien filings
against the Issuer.

     (9) The Collateral Certificate does not have any marks or notations
indicating that it has been pledged, assigned or otherwise conveyed to any
Person other than the Indenture Trustee.

     (10) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the
representations and warranties set forth in this Schedule 1 shall be continuing,
                                                 ----------
and remain in full force and effect, until such time as the Collateral
Certificate is retired.

     (b) Indenture Trustee covenants that it shall not, without satisfying the
Rating Agency Condition, waive a breach of any representation or warranty set
forth in this Schedule 1.
              ----------

     (c) The Servicer covenants that, in order to evidence the interests of
Issuer and Indenture Trustee under the Indenture, Servicer shall take such
action, or execute and deliver such instruments (other than effecting a Filing
(as defined below), unless such Filing is effected in accordance with this
paragraph (c)) as may be necessary or advisable (including, without limitation,
-------------
such actions as are requested by Indenture Trustee) to maintain and perfect, as
a first priority interest, Indenture Trustee's security interest in the
Collateral Certificate. Servicer shall, from time to time and within the time
limits established by law, prepare and present to Indenture Trustee for
Indenture Trustee to authorize (based in reliance on the Opinion of Counsel
hereinafter provided for) the Servicer to file, all financing statements,
amendments, continuations, initial financing statements in lieu of a
continuation statement, terminations, partial terminations, releases or partial
releases, or any other filings necessary or advisable to continue, maintain and
perfect the Indenture Trustee's security interest in the Collateral Certificate
as a first-priority interest (each a "Filing"). Servicer shall present each such
                                      ------
Filing to the Indenture Trustee together with (x) an Opinion of Counsel to the
effect that such Filing is (i) consistent with grant of the security interest to
the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Granting Clause of the Indenture, (ii)
satisfies all requirements and conditions to such Filing in the Indenture and
(iii) satisfies the requirements for a Filing of such type under the Uniform
Commercial Code in the applicable jurisdiction (or if the Uniform Commercial
Code does not apply, the applicable statute governing the perfection of security
interests), and (y) a form of authorization for Indenture Trustee's signature.
Upon receipt of such Opinion of Counsel and form of authorization, Indenture
Trustee shall promptly authorize in writing Servicer to, and Servicer shall,
effect such Filing under the Uniform Commercial Code without the signature of
Issuer or Indenture Trustee where allowed by applicable law. Notwithstanding
anything else in the Indenture to the contrary, the Servicer shall not have any
authority to effect a Filing without obtaining written authorization from the
Trustee in accordance with this paragraph (c).
                                -------------
