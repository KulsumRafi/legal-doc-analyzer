          Subject to the provisions of Section 5(f), all determinations required to be
          made under this Section 5, including whether an Excise Tax is payable by the
          Executive and the amount of such Excise Tax and whether a Gross-Up Payment is
          required to be paid by the Company to the Executive and the amount of such
          Gross-Up Payment, if any, will be made by a nationally recognized accounting
          firm (the &#147;Accounting Firm&#148;) selected by the Executive in his sole
          discretion. The Executive will direct the Accounting Firm to submit its
          determination and detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and the
          Executive within 30 calendar days after the Termination Date, if applicable, and
          any such other time or times as may be requested by the Company or the
          Executive. If the Accounting Firm determines that any Excise Tax is payable by
          the Executive, the Company will pay the required Gross-Up Payment to the
          Executive within five business days after receipt of such determination and
          calculations with respect to any Payment to the Executive. If the Accounting
          Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it will, at the
          same time as it makes such determination, furnish the Company and the Executive
          an opinion that the Executive has substantial authority not to report any Excise
          Tax on his federal, state or local income or other tax return. As a result of
          the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor
          provision thereto) and the possibility of similar uncertainty regarding
          applicable state or local tax law at the time of any determination by the
          Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not
          have been made by the Company should have been made (an
          &#147;Underpayment&#148;), consistent with the calculations required to be made
          hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts or fails to pursue its
          remedies pursuant to Section 5(f) and the Executive thereafter is required to
          make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Executive will direct the Accounting Firm
          to determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and to submit its
          determination and detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and the
          Executive as promptly as possible. Any such Underpayment will be promptly paid
          by the Company to, or for the benefit of, the Executive within five business
          days after receipt of such determination and calculations. </FONT></P>

          Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the Accounting Firm in connection with the

          will be prepared and filed on a consistent basis with the determination of the
          Accounting Firm with respect to the Excise Tax payable by the Executive. The

          any amendments) of his federal income tax return as filed with the Internal
          Revenue Service and corresponding state and local tax returns, if relevant, as
          filed with the applicable taxing authority, and such other documents reasonably

          Executive&#146;s federal income tax return, or corresponding state or local tax
          return, if relevant, the Accounting Firm determines that the amount of the
          Gross-Up Payment should be reduced, the Executive will, within five business

will bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including interest and penalties)
incurred in connection with such contest and will indemnify and hold harmless the
Executive, on an after-tax basis, for and against any Excise Tax or income tax, including
interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed as a result of such representation
and payment of costs and expenses. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this
Section 5(f), the Company will control all proceedings taken in connection with the
contest of any claim contemplated by this Section 5(f) and, at its sole option, may pursue
or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with
the taxing authority in respect of such claim (provided, however, that the Executive may
participate therein at his own cost and expense) and may, at its option, either direct the
Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any
permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination
before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more
appellate courts, as the Company determines; provided, however, that if the Company
directs the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund, the Company will
advance the amount of such payment to the Executive on an interest-free basis and will
indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or
income or other tax, including interest or penalties with respect thereto, imposed with
respect to such advance; and provided further, however, that any extension of the statute
of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with
respect to which the contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such
contested amount. Furthermore, the Company&#146;s control of any such contested claim will
be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder
and the Executive will be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other
issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. </FONT></P>

          If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company
          pursuant to Section 5(f), the Executive receives any refund with respect to such
          claim, the Executive will (subject to the Company&#146;s complying with the
          requirements of Section 5(f)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such
          refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after any taxes
          applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount
          advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 5(f), a determination is made that
          the Executive will not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and
          the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest
          such denial or refund prior to the expiration of 30 calendar days after such
          determination, then such advance will be forgiven and will not be required to be
          repaid and the amount of any such advance will offset, to the extent thereof,
          the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid by the Company to the
          Executive pursuant to this Section 5. </FONT></P>

          No Mitigation Obligation. The Company hereby acknowledges that it will be
          difficult and may be impossible for the Executive to find reasonably comparable
          employment following the Termination Date and that the non-competition covenant
          contained in Section 8 will further limit the employment opportunities for the
          Executive. Accordingly, the payment of the severance compensation by the Company
          to the Executive in accordance with the terms of this Agreement is hereby
          acknowledged by the Company to be reasonable, and the Executive will not be
          required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by
          seeking other employment or otherwise, nor will any profits, income, earnings or
          other benefits from any source whatsoever create any mitigation, offset,
          reduction or any other obligation on the part of the Executive hereunder or
          otherwise, except as expressly provided in the penultimate sentence of Paragraph
          2 set forth on Annex&nbsp;A. </FONT></P>

          Legal Fees and Expenses. It is the intent of the Company that the Executive not
          be required to incur legal fees and the related expenses associated with the
          interpretation, enforcement or defense of Executive&#146;s rights under this
          Agreement by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense thereof would
          substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Executive
          hereunder. Accordingly, if it should appear to the Executive that the Company
          has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in the
          event that the Company or any other person takes or threatens to take any action
          to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or
          other action or proceeding designed to deny, or to recover from, the Executive
          the benefits provided or intended to be provided to the Executive hereunder, the
          Company irrevocably authorizes the Executive from time to time to retain counsel
          of Executive&#146;s choice, at the expense of the Company as hereafter provided,
          to advise and represent the Executive in connection with any such
          interpretation, enforcement or defense, including without limitation the
          initiation or defense of any litigation or other legal action, whether by or
          against the Company or any Director, officer, stockholder or other person
          affiliated with the Company, in any jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any existing
          or prior attorney-client relationship between the Company and such counsel, the
          Company irrevocably consents to the Executive&#146;s entering into an
          attorney-client relationship with such counsel and, in that connection, the
          Company and the Executive agree that a confidential relationship will exist
          between the Executive and such counsel. Without respect to whether the Executive
          prevails, in whole or in part, in connection with any of the foregoing, the
          Company will pay and be solely financially responsible for any and all
          attorneys&#146; and related fees and expenses incurred by the Executive in
          connection with any of the foregoing, regardless of amount. </FONT></P>

          Competitive Activity. During a period ending one year following the Termination
          Date, if the Executive has received or is receiving benefits under Section 4,
          the Executive will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, which
          consent will not be unreasonably withheld, engage in any Competitive Activity. </FONT></P>

          Employment Rights. Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement will create
          any right or duty on the part of the Company or the Executive to have the
          Executive remain in the employment of the Company or any Subsidiary prior to or
          following any Change in Control. Any termination of employment of the Executive
          or the removal of the Executive from the office or position in the Company or
          any Subsidiary following the commencement of any discussion with a third person
          that ultimately results in a Change in Control will be deemed to be a
          termination or removal of the Executive after a Change in Control for purposes
          of this Agreement. </FONT></P>

          Successors and Binding Agreement. (a)&nbsp;The Company will require any

          assets of the Company, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the

          manner and to the same extent the Company would be required to perform if no
          such succession had taken place. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure
          to the benefit of the Company and any successor to the Company, including
          without limitation any persons acquiring directly or indirectly all or
          substantially all of the business or assets of the Company whether by purchase,
          merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise (and such successor will
          thereafter be deemed the &#147;Company&#148; for the purposes of this

          For a period of 36 months following the Termination Date (the &#147;Continuation
          Period&#148;), the Company will arrange to provide the Executive with Employee
          Benefits that are welfare benefits (but not stock option, performance share,
          performance unit, stock purchase, stock appreciation, restricted stock or
          similar compensatory benefits) substantially similar to those that the Executive
          was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to the Termination Date
          (or, if greater, immediately prior to the reduction, termination, or denial
          described in Section 3(b)(ii)). If and to the extent that any benefit described
          in this Paragraph 2 is not or cannot be paid or provided under any policy, plan,
          program or arrangement of the Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be,
          then the Company will itself pay or provide for the payment to the Executive,
          his dependents and beneficiaries, of such Employee Benefits along with, in the
          case of any benefit described in this Paragraph&nbsp;2 which is subject to tax
          because it is not or cannot be paid or provided under any such policy, plan,
          program or arrangement of the Company or any Subsidiary, an additional amount
          such that after payment by the Executive, or his dependents or beneficiaries, as
          the case may be, of all taxes so imposed, the recipient retains an amount equal
          to such taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other provision of the
          Agreement, for purposes of determining the period of continuation coverage to
          which the Executive or any of his dependents is entitled pursuant to
          Section&nbsp;4980B of the Code under the Company&#146;s medical, dental and

          and the Executive will be considered to have remained actively employed on a

          effect of Section 6, Employee Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive
          pursuant to this Paragraph&nbsp;2 will be reduced to the extent comparable
          welfare benefits are actually received by the Executive from another employer
          during the Continuation Period following the Executive&#146;s Termination Date,
          and any such benefits actually received by the Executive will be reported by the

          In addition to the retirement, supplemental executive retirement, and other
          benefits, if any, to which the Executive is entitled under the Company&#146;s
          Retirement Plans, a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the excess of (x) the

          all purposes under the Retirement Plans, through the Continuation Period, and to
          have received during such Continuation Period the Executive&#146;s Base Pay (as

          Company&#146;s Salaried Employees&#146; Pension Plan and Excess Retirement
          Benefit Plan, the amount of such cash bonus shall be included in determining
          compensation for purposes of such plans in the calculations under this
          subparagraph (x), and (ii) the calculations under this subparagraph (x) shall be
          made as if the Executive were fully vested in such benefits, over (y) the

          the Executive is entitled to receive (either immediately or on a deferred basis)
          under the Retirement Plans. For purposes of this subsection, &#147;actuarial

          this Agreement would be an &#147;Excess Parachute Payment,&#148; within the

          &#147;Code&#148;), or any successor provision thereto, but for the application
          of this sentence, then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided under
          this Agreement will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event
          to less than zero) so that no portion of any such payment or benefit, as so
          reduced, constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment; provided, however, that the
          foregoing reduction will be made only if and to the extent that such reduction
          would result in an increase in the aggregate payment and benefits to be
          provided, determined on an after-tax basis (taking into account the excise tax
          imposed pursuant to Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code, or any successor provision
          thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law, and any
          applicable federal, state and local income and employment taxes). Whether

          reduction in such payments or benefits to be provided under this Agreement or
          otherwise is required pursuant to the preceding sentence will be made at the

          of the limitations contained in this Section&nbsp;5 will not of itself limit or
          otherwise affect any other rights of the Executive other than pursuant to this

          Section&nbsp;5, the Executive will be entitled to designate the payments and/or

          the Executive to permit the Executive to make such designation. In the event
          that the Executive fails to make such designation within 10 business days of the

          appropriate. </FONT></P>

          interpretation, enforcement or defense of Executive&#146;s rights under this
          Agreement by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense thereof would
          substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Executive

          event that the Company or any other person takes or threatens to take any action
          to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or

          the benefits provided or intended to be provided to the Executive hereunder, the

          attorney-client relationship with such counsel and, in that connection, the

          between the Executive and such counsel. Without respect to whether the Executive
          prevails, in whole or in part, in connection with any of the foregoing, the
          Company will pay and be solely financially responsible for any and all
          attorneys&#146; and related fees and expenses incurred by the Executive in

          A lump sum payment in an amount equal to one and one half (1.5) times the sum of
          (A)&nbsp;Base Pay (at the rate in effect immediately prior to the Change in
          Control or, if greater, the average Base Pay over the three years prior to the

          For a period of 12 months following the Termination Date (the &#147;Continuation
          Period&#148;), the Company will arrange to provide the Executive with Employee
          Benefits that are welfare benefits (but not stock option, performance share,
          performance unit, stock purchase, stock appreciation, restricted stock or
          similar compensatory benefits) substantially similar to those that the Executive
          was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to the Termination Date
          (or, if greater, immediately prior to the reduction, termination, or denial
          described in Section 3(b)(ii)). If and to the extent that any benefit described
          in this Paragraph 2 is not or cannot be paid or provided under any policy, plan,
          program or arrangement of the Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be,
          then the Company will itself pay or provide for the payment to the Executive,
          his dependents and beneficiaries, of such Employee Benefits along with, in the
          case of any benefit described in this Paragraph&nbsp;2 which is subject to tax
          because it is not or cannot be paid or provided under any such policy, plan,
          program or arrangement of the Company or any Subsidiary, an additional amount
          such that after payment by the Executive, or his dependents or beneficiaries, as
          the case may be, of all taxes so imposed, the recipient retains an amount equal
          to such taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other provision of the
          Agreement, for purposes of determining the period of continuation coverage to
          which the Executive or any of his dependents is entitled pursuant to
          Section&nbsp;4980B of the Code under the Company&#146;s medical, dental and
          other group health plans, or successor plans, the Executive&#146;s
          &#147;qualifying event&#148; will be the termination of the Continuation Period
          and the Executive will be considered to have remained actively employed on a
          full-time basis through that date. Without otherwise limiting the purposes or
          effect of Section 6, Employee Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive
          pursuant to this Paragraph&nbsp;2 will be reduced to the extent comparable
          welfare benefits are actually received by the Executive from another employer
          during the Continuation Period following the Executive&#146;s Termination Date,
          and any such benefits actually received by the Executive will be reported by the
          Executive to the Company. </FONT></P>

          In addition to the retirement, supplemental executive retirement, and other
          benefits, if any, to which the Executive is entitled under the Company&#146;s
          Retirement Plans, a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the excess of (x) the
          actuarial present value of the retirement, medical, life and other benefits to
          which the Executive would have been entitled under the Retirement Plans, without
          regard to any amendment to the Retirement Plans made subsequent to a Change in
          Control which affects in any way the computation of retirement or welfare
          benefits thereunder in a manner adverse to the Executive, if the Executive had
          continued to be employed, and had been credited with age and service credits for
          all purposes under the Retirement Plans, through the Continuation Period, and to
          have received during such Continuation Period the Executive&#146;s Base Pay (as
          determined in Paragraph 1 of this Annex A) and Incentive Pay (as determined in
          Paragraph 1 of this Annex A); and provided that (i) to the extent that a cash
          bonus earned under the 1988 Restricted Stock and Cash Bonus Plan (as amended and
          restated on May 9, 1997) and payable upon a Change in Control is not otherwise
          included in determining the Executive&#146;s compensation for purposes of
          calculating the amount of the Executive&#146;s aggregate benefits under the
          Company&#146;s Salaried Employees&#146; Pension Plan and Excess Retirement
          Benefit Plan, the amount of such cash bonus shall be included in determining
          compensation for purposes of such plans in the calculations under this
          subparagraph (x), and (ii) the calculations under this subparagraph (x) shall be
          made as if the Executive were fully vested in such benefits, over (y) the
          actuarial present value of the retirement, medical, life and other benefits that
          the Executive is entitled to receive (either immediately or on a deferred basis)
          under the Retirement Plans. For purposes of this subsection, &#147;actuarial
          present value&#148; will be determined by applying a discount factor equal to
          the annual rate of interest provided by 30-year Treasury securities, determined
          for the second calendar month preceding the first day of the Plan Year which
          includes the date on which the distribution is paid, and by using the mortality
          table as prescribed in Revenue Ruling 2001-62. </FONT></P>
