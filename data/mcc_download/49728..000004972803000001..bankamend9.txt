otherwise  improving  the  financial  condition  or  business  of Debtor and its
Affiliates, and (b) requests such Investment Bankers to provide such information

copy of any contact or other  reports  prepared by such  Investment  Bankers for
Debtor when such reports are delivered to Debtor.

     4. The  following  new  negative  covenants  are added to Article 10 of the
Agreement:

     "10.17.  MEXICO  ASSET  SALE.  Debtor will cause  substantially  all of the
assets of IEC and IEC-Mexico located in IEC-Mexico's facility in Reynosa, Mexico
to be sold pursuant to that certain Asset  Purchase  Agreement  dated as of June
18, 2002 between IEC and  Electronic  Product  Integration  Corporation  ("Asset
Purchase  Agreement")  providing for a cash sale price (the "Cash Price") as set
forth in paragraph  3.2 of the Asset  Purchase  Agreement  payable in accordance
with  paragraph  3.5  thereof.  The  balance of the sale price may be payable to
Debtor  over time based on various  factors  including  a  percentage  of future
orders  received by the  purchaser  from certain  former  customers of Debtor or
IEC-Mexico ("Earn-out Amount") and additional compensation may be paid to Debtor
under  paragraph 8.4 of the Asset Purchase  Agreement in the form of commissions
based on future sales volume from certain customers ("Commission Payments",  and
together with the Earn-out  Amount,  the "Earnout  Proceeds").  Immediately upon
receipt of that portion of the Cash Price described at section 3.5(a)(ii) of the
Asset  Purchase  Agreement,  Debtor will pay an amount not less than $125,000 to
Agent to be applied as follows:  $75,000 to unpaid  Advances under the Revolving
Credit and $50,000 to  installments  of  principal  of the Term Notes in inverse
order of maturity,  and in conjunction  therewith a new Reserve in the amount of
$75,000 will be established  under the Revolving  Credit with respect to certain
potential  litigation expenses of Debtor heretofore disclosed to Agent with such
Reserve to remain in place at the  discretion  of Agent until such time as Agent
is paid  $200,000 in total  hereunder or Debtor  reaches a settlement in full of
certain litigation heretofore disclosed to Agent or such Reserve is used to fund
all or part of the  balance of the  $200,000  due Agent  under the terms of this
Section 10.17;  and  immediately  upon receipt of that portion of the Cash Price
described at section  3.5(a)(iii) of the Asset Purchase  Agreement,  Debtor will
pay to Agent to be applied to  installments  of  principal  of the Term Notes in
inverse  order of  maturity  an amount  equal to the  greater  of $75,000 or the
amount necessary to bring the total of the payments  hereunder to Agent from the
Cash Price to $200,000 in the aggregate.

     10.18. ASSIGNMENT OF EARNOUT PROCEEDS. Promptly upon execution of the Asset
Purchase Agreement, Debtor will execute and deliver to Agent, for the benefit of
the Agent and the Lenders,  a first lien assignment of the Earnout  Proceeds (as
defined in Section  10.17  hereof),  such  assignment  to be in form and content
satisfactory to Agent. Immediately upon receipt of any Earnout Proceeds,  Debtor
will pay the amount thereof to Agent to be applied to  installments of principal
of the Term Notes in inverse order of maturity.

     10.19. SALE OF DEBTOR'S  BUSINESS OR STOCK.  Debtor will obtain and deliver
to Agent and the Lenders by July 26,  2002 an  executed  letter of intent from a
satisfactory  purchaser to purchase  substantially all of the assets or business
or stock of Debtor  ("Sale");  Debtor  will  cause  such Sale to be closed on or
before  August 30, 2002;  and Debtor will  immediately  upon such closing pay to
Agent, for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders,  a sufficient amount of the
net proceeds from such Sale to repay in full all of the Indebtedness."

5. Debtor  acknowledges  that Debtor  intends to refinance  the Advances and the
Term Loans under the Agreement with one or more  different  lenders on or before
the expiration of the Initial Term as amended herein, and agrees that, upon such
payment of the Advances under the Agreement,  the Term Notes of the Debtor dated
December  28, 1999 in favor of the  Lenders  become due and payable by the terms
thereof since such financing would not come from  internally  generated funds in
the ordinary course of business.

     D. Reaffirmations and Release.

     1. The Agreement,  except as specifically  modified hereby, shall remain in
full force and effect and Debtor hereby reaffirms the Agreement,  as modified by
this Amendment, and all collateral and other documents executed and delivered to
Agent and the Lenders in connection with the Agreement.

     2. IEC-Mexico and IEC-FSC,  by their execution  hereof,  consent hereto and
hereby reaffirm the execution and delivery of their respective  Guaranties dated
December 28, 1999 and each agrees that its respective guaranty shall continue in
full force and effect and shall be applicable to all  indebtedness,  obligations
and  liabilities  of  Debtor  to  Agent  and  the  Lenders,   including  without
limitation,  all  indebtedness  evidenced by or arising under the Agreement,  as
modified by this Amendment.

representatives, successors or assigns hereafter can, shall or may claim to have
for or by reason of any  cause,  matter or thing  whatsoever,  arising  from the
beginning of time to and through and including the date hereof.

     E. Other Provisions.

     1.  Debtor  agrees  to pay on demand  by Agent  all  expenses  of Agent and
Lenders  including  without  limitation,  fees and  disbursements of counsel for
Agent and the Lenders, in connection with the transactions  contemplated by this
Amendment,  the negotiations for and preparation of this Amendment and any other
documents  related  hereto,  and the  enforcement of the rights of Agent and the
Lenders under the Agreement as amended by this Amendment.

Re:  Loan and Security Agreement

reserves established under the LSA.

     As Agent, we agree that Amendment No. 9 is hereby modified as follows:

     1. The  existing  Section  A.6 is  hereby  deleted  and  replaced  with the
following new Section A.6:

     "6. Debtor's  agreement to diligently  pursue the sale of Debtor's property

either:  (i) an  executed  written  bona fide  purchase  offer from a  qualified

     2. Section  10.19 is hereby  deleted and replaced  with the  following  new
Section 10.19:

        "10.19    SALE OF DEBTOR'S BUSINESS OR STOCK.
        Debtor will obtain and deliver to Agent and the Lenders by September 20,

Re:  Acterna Settlement

Gentlemen:

     In conjunction with your proposed  settlement of the action IEC Electronics
Corp.  ("IEC") commenced  against Acterna  Corporation in New York State Supreme
Court,  Wayne County under Index No. 50447  ("Action"),  you have requested that
the Secured  Parties  under the Loan and  Security  Agreement  among IEC and the
Secured  Parties  dated as of December 28,  1999,  as amended  ("LSA")  agree to
certain modifications under the LSA.

     The Secured Parties are willing to make the  modifications set forth herein
on the following conditions:

     1. The Agent  receives  funds in the amount of not less than  $1,940,063.09
from the proceeds paid by Acterna  Corporation  in settlement of the Action with
such funds to be applied to prepay  principal  installments of the Term Loans in
inverse order of maturity.

     2. As additional  collateral security for the indebtedness of IEC under the
LSA,  IEC  pledges to the Agent,  for the  benefit of the Agent and the  Secured
Parties,  the Promissory Note of Acterna Corporation payable to the order of IEC
dated August 23, 2002 in the face principal amount of $1,113,996, such pledge to
be evidenced by a pledge  security  agreement in form and content  acceptable to
the Agent,  and such  original note to be endorsed in blank by IEC and delivered
to Agent.

     3. The Agent receives a complete copy of the executed settlement  agreement
with respect to the Action and also  receives  four  executed  originals of this
letter signed by IEC and the Guarantors.

     Provided the above  conditions  are  satisfied,  the Secured  Parties agree
that:

     A. (i) A $500,000  portion of the $1,000,000  Term Loan Reserve against the
Revolving  Credit  will be  cancelled  upon the  Agent's  receipt  and review of
satisfactory  evidence  confirming  that IEC has: (a) adopted the proposed trade
creditor  settlement  program in the form  shared with the Agent and the Secured
Parties on the date hereof ("Vendor Program"); and (b) sent notice of the Vendor
Program to all vendors classified as Group 1 or 2 under the Vendor Program; and

     (ii) the  remaining  $500,000  portion  of the Term  Loan  Reserve  will be
cancelled  upon  the  Agent's  receipt  and  review  of  satisfactory   evidence
confirming that IEC has received  acceptances of the Vendor Program from vendors
holding not less than fifty percent (50%) of the  aggregate  outstanding  dollar
amount of balances due all Group 1 and Group 2 vendors under the Vendor Program.

                                 Page 83 of 104
<PAGE>
     B. (i) upon the cancellation of the first $500,000 portion of the Term Loan
Reserve  as  set  forth  in  "A(i)"  above,  and  provided  IEC  has  sufficient
availability  under  the  Borrowing  Capacity  at  the  applicable  time  and is
otherwise in  compliance  with the terms of the LSA,  then up to $500,000 can be
borrowed by IEC under the Revolving  Credit to fund working capital needs and to
fund the cash payments  provided for in the Vendor  Program to vendors owed less
than $5,000 other than cash payments to any Director for Director fees;

     (ii) upon  cancellation  of the  second  $500,000  portion of the Term Loan
Reserve  as set  forth  in "A  (ii)"  above  and  provided  IEC  has  sufficient
availability  under  the  Borrowing  Capacity  at  the  applicable  time  and is
otherwise in compliance with the LSA, then up to $500,000 can be borrowed by IEC
under the Revolving Credit to fund the cash payments  provided for in the Vendor
Program to vendors  owed  $5,000 or more but no one vendor may be paid more than
ten percent (10%) of the outstanding  dollar amount of the balance owed any such
vendor as reflected in the Vendor Program unless  consented to in writing by the
Agent.

     Nothing  herein  shall  limit or impair  the  ability  of the Agent and the
Secured Parties to require such reserves as they deem  appropriate  from time to
time in accordance with the terms of the LSA.

     In order to signify your  agreement to, and  acceptance of, the above terms
and LSA  modifications,  please  sign and  return to us the  enclosed  duplicate
original of this letter  whereupon this letter shall become  effective as of the
date hereof.

Re:  Loan and Security Agreement Modifications

Gentlemen:

     Pursuant to our  discussions  with you, we are willing to modify certain of
the provisions set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement dated as of December
28, 1999 with the present parties thereto being you, HSBC Bank USA as Agent, and
HSBC Bank USA and  General  Electric  Capital  Corporation  as the  Lenders  (as
amended and  modified  prior to the date  hereof,  the  "LSA"),  and we are also
willing to  temporarily  modify one of the reserves  established  under the LSA.
Capitalized  terms used in this letter and not  otherwise  defined are used with
the defined meanings set forth in the LSA.

     As a condition to the  modifications  made herein,  you and we agree to the
revocation of the provisions  regarding the Vendor Payment  Program and the Term
Loan  Reserve as set forth in Parts  A(ii) and B(ii) of the  Acterna  Settlement
letter dated August 22, 2002 between the Agent and you.

     As Agent, we agree that the LSA is hereby modified as follows:

     1. Part (A) of Item 1 of the Schedule regarding the Maximum Limit of the
Borrowing Capacity is hereby deleted and replaced with the following new Part
(A):

        "(A) The applicable Maximum Limit of $2,000,000;"

     2.  Section  A.6 of  Amendment  9 is hereby  deleted  and two new  Negative
Covenants are hereby added to the LSA as Sections 10.20 and 10.21 as follows:

        "10.20 Sale of Alabama Property. Debtor shall not fail to sell the
        Debtor's property in Arab, Alabama by September 30, 2002 for a purchase
        price of approximately $600,000 and wire the net proceeds of
        approximately $550,000 to the Agent by September 30, 2002 as a
        prepayment on the Term Loans to be applied to installments thereof in
        inverse order of maturity."

        "10.21 Sale of Texas Property. Debtor shall not fail to diligently
        pursue the sale of Debtor's property in Edinburgh, Texas and obtain and
        deliver to Agent by October 18, 2002 a copy of either (i) an executed
        bona fide purchase offer from a qualified purchaser, such offer and
        purchaser to be acceptable to Debtor, Agent and the Lenders, or (ii) an
        executed written auction agreement with a qualified auctioneer to
        conduct a commercially reasonable auction of such property by December
        31, 2002, such auction agreement and auctioneer to be acceptable to the
        Debtor, Agent and the Lenders."

     We also hereby  temporarily  modify the existing $500,000 Term Loan Reserve
under the LSA by reducing the amount thereof to $300,000 for the period from the
date hereof through  September 23, 2002.  Assuming delivery by the Debtor to the
Agent and the Lenders on or before  September 23, 2002 of a satisfactory  letter
of intent or  complete  refinancing  with a new lender for the sale of  Debtor's
business  and the absence of any Event of Default  under the LSA,  Agent and the
Lenders  will  further  reduce the Term Loan Reserve to $100,000 as of September
24, 2002,  and provided the Renewal Term of the LSA is extended  past  September
30,  2002,  the Term Loan Reserve will be increased to $300,000 as of October 7,
2002, and restored to $500,000 as of October 14, 2002.

     Nothing  herein  shall  limit or impair  the  ability  of the Agent and the
Secured  Parties  to  require  such  reserves  in  such  amounts  as  they  deem
appropriate, in their sole discretion, from time to time.

Re:  Amendment 9 Further Modification

Gentlemen:

     Pursuant to your request, we are willing to modify certain of the deadlines
set forth in Amendment No. 9 dated June 20, 2002 ( as modified prior to the date
hereof,  "Amendment  No.  9") to the Loan  and  Security  Agreement  dated as of
December 28, 1999 with the present  parties  thereto being you, HSBC Bank USA as
Agent, and HSBC Bank USA and General Electric Capital Corporation as the Lenders
(as amended prior to the date hereof, the "LSA").

     As a condition to the modification made herein, we require your affirmation
evidenced by your signature hereon that the approximately  $21,000 on deposit in
your account with the Texas State Bank will be used by you only to pay severance
due Robert Norris in connection  with the closing of the IEC-Mexico  facility in
Reynosa, Mexico.

     As Agent, we agree that Amendment No. 9 is hereby modified as follows:

     1. Section  10.19 is hereby  deleted and replaced  with the  following  new
Section 10.19:

        "10.19    SALE OF DEBTOR'S BUSINESS OR STOCK.
        Unless the Indebtedness is sooner repaid in its entirety through a
        refinancing with third party lenders or otherwise, Debtor will obtain
        and deliver to Agent and the Lenders by October 7, 2002 a satisfactory
        executed letter of intent from a satisfactory purchaser to purchase
        substantially all of the assets or business or stock of Debtor ("Sale"),
        and providing for such Sale to be closed on or before November 29, 2002;
        and will immediately upon such closing pay to Agent, for the benefit of
        the Agent and the Lenders, a sufficient amount of the net proceeds from
        such Sale to repay in full all of the Indebtedness, if any, which
        remains unpaid."

     If you  deliver to the Agent and the Lenders by October 7, 2002 a letter of
intent that satisfies the  requirements of Section 10.19, the Lenders would then
be willing to amend Item 32 of the  Schedule to extend the  Initial  Term of the
LSA from September 30, 2002 until October 31, 2002.

     In order to  signify  your  agreement  to,  and  acceptance  of,  the above
modification, please sign and return to us today the enclosed duplicate original
of this letter  whereupon  this letter  shall  become  effective  as of the date
hereof.
