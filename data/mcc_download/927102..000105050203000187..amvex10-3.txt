                                      -15-

<PAGE>


payments so received shall be applied first to the principal of Prime Rate Loans
and then to the principal of LIBOR Loans. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, the Borrower may make a full or partial prepayment of a
LIBOR Loan on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period relating
thereto, if all optional prepayments (in whole or in part) on such Loans shall
be accompanied by, and the Borrower hereby promises to pay, a prepayment fee in
an amount determined by the Agent in the following manner:

              (a) LIBOR Prepayment Fee. Borrower acknowledges that prepayment or
acceleration of a LIBOR Loan during an Interest Period shall result in the
Lenders incurring additional costs, expenses and/or liabilities and that it is
extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain the extent of such costs,
expenses and/or liabilities. (For all purposes of this Section, any Loan not
being made as a LIBOR Loan in accordance with the Conversion Request therefor,
as a result of Borrower's cancellation thereof, shall be treated as if such
LIBOR Loan had been prepaid.) Therefore, on the date a LIBOR Loan is prepaid or
the date all sums payable hereunder become due and payable, by acceleration or
otherwise ("Prepayment Date"), Borrower will pay to Agent, for the account of
each Lender, (in addition to all other sums then owing), an amount ("LIBOR
Prepayment Fee") determined by the Agent as follows: The current rate for United
States Treasury securities (bills on a discounted basis shall be converted to a
bond equivalent) with a maturity date closest to the end of the Interest Period
as to which prepayment is made, shall be subtracted from the interest rate
applicable to the LIBOR Loan being prepaid. If the result is zero or a negative
number, there shall be no LIBOR Prepayment Fee. If the result is a positive
number, then the resulting percentage shall be multiplied by the amount of the
prepayment of the LIBOR Loan. The resulting amount shall be divided by 360 and
multiplied by the number of days remaining in the Interest Period as to which
the prepayment is being made. The resulting amount shall be the LIBOR Prepayment
Fee.

              (b) Upon the written notice to Borrower from Agent, Borrower shall
immediately pay to Agent, for the account of the Lenders, the LIBOR Prepayment
Fee. Such written notice (which shall include calculations in reasonable detail)
shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the
parties hereto.

              (c) Borrower understands, agrees and acknowledges the following:
(i) no Lender has any obligation to purchase, sell and/or match funds in
connection with the use of the LIBOR Rate as a basis for calculating the rate of
interest on a LIBOR Loan; (ii) the LIBOR Rate is used merely as a reference in
determining such rate; and (iii) Borrower has accepted the LIBOR Rate as a
reasonable and fair basis for calculating such rate and a LIBOR Prepayment Fee.
Borrower further agrees to pay the LIBOR Prepayment Fee, if any, whether or not
a Lender elects to purchase, sell and/or match funds.

ss.4. CERTAIN GENERAL PROVISIONS.

      ss.4.1. Fees. On the Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay to FNB the fees
with respect to the Loan in the amounts specified in the Term Sheet provided by
FNB to the Borrower dated January 29, 2003.

                                      -16-

<PAGE>


      ss.4.2. Reserved.

      ss.4.3. Funds for Payments.

              (a) All payments of principal, interest, closing fees, commitment
fees and any other amounts due hereunder (other than as provided in ss.4.1,
ss.4.5 and ss.4.6) or under any of the other Loan Documents, and all
prepayments, shall be made to the Agent, for the respective accounts of the
Lenders, at the Agent's Head Office, in each case in Dollars in immediately
available funds.

              (b) All payments by the Borrower hereunder and under any of the
other Loan Documents shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and free and
clear of and without deduction for any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges,
fees, deductions, withholdings, compulsory liens, restrictions or conditions of
any nature now or hereafter imposed or levied by any jurisdiction or any
political subdivision thereof or taxing or other authority therein unless the
Borrower is compelled by law to make such deduction or withholding. If any such
obligation is imposed upon the Borrower with respect to any amount payable by it
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, the Borrower shall pay to
the Agent, for the account of the Lenders or (as the case may be) the Agent, on
the date on which such amount is due and payable hereunder or under such other
Loan Document, such additional amount in Dollars as shall be necessary to enable
the Lenders or the Agent to receive the same net amount which the Lenders or the
Agent would have received on such due date had no such obligation been imposed
upon the Borrower. The Borrower will deliver promptly to the Agent certificates
or other valid vouchers for all taxes or other charges deducted from or paid
with respect to payments made by the Borrower hereunder or under such other Loan
Document.

      ss.4.4. Computations. All computations of interest on the Loans and of
other fees to the extent applicable shall be made on the basis of 360-day year
and the actual number of days elapsed. Except as otherwise provided in the
definition of the term "Interest Period" with respect to LIBOR Loans, whenever a
payment hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents becomes due on a day
that is not a Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be extended to
the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall be included
in computing interest and fees in connection with such payment. The outstanding
amount of the Loans as reflected on the Records from time to time shall (absent
manifest error) be considered correct and binding on the Borrower unless within
thirty (30) Business Days after receipt by the Agent or any of the Lenders from
Borrower of any notice by the Borrower of such outstanding amount, the Agent or
such Lender shall notify the Borrower to the contrary.

      ss.4.5. Additional Costs, Etc. If any present or future applicable law
(which expression, as used herein, includes statutes, rules and regulations
thereunder and interpretations thereof by any competent court or by any
governmental or other regulatory body or official charged with the
administration or the interpretation thereof and requests, directives,
instructions and notices at any time or from time to time hereafter made upon or
otherwise issued to any Lender or the Agent by any central bank or other fiscal,
monetary or other authority, whether or not having the force of law), shall:

                                      -17-

<PAGE>


              (a) subject any Lender or the Agent to any tax, levy, impost,
duty, charge, fee, deduction or withholding of any nature with respect to this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, such Lender's Commitment or the Loans
(other than taxes based upon or measured by the income or profits of such Lender
or the Agent), or

              (b) materially change the basis of taxation (except for changes in
taxes on income or profits) of payments to any Lender of the principal of or the
interest on any Loans or any other amounts payable to any Lender under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or

              (c) impose or increase or render applicable (other than to the
extent specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement) any special
deposit, reserve, assessment, liquidity, capital adequacy or other similar
requirements (whether or not having the force of law) against assets held by, or
deposits in or for the account of, or Loans by, or commitments of an office of
any Lender, or

              (d) impose on any Lender any other conditions or requirements with
respect to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Loans, the Commitment,
or any class of Loans or commitments of which any of the Loans or the Commitment
forms a part;

and the result of any of the foregoing is

              (i) to increase the cost to such Lender of making, funding,
issuing, renewing, extending or maintaining any of the Loans or such Lender's
Commitment, or

              (ii) to reduce the amount of principal, interest or other amount
payable to such Lender or the Agent hereunder on account of the Commitments or
any of the Loans, or

              (iii) to require such Lender or the Agent to make any payment or
to forego any interest or other sum payable hereunder, the amount of which
payment or foregone interest or other sum is calculated by reference to the
gross amount of any sum receivable or deemed received by such Lender or the
Agent from the Borrower hereunder,

then, and in each such case, the Borrower will, upon demand made by such Lender
or (as the case may be) the Agent at any time and from time to time and as often
as the occasion therefor may arise, pay to such Lender or the Agent, to the
extent permitted by law, such additional amounts as will be sufficient to
compensate such Lender or the Agent for such additional cost, reduction, payment
or foregone interest or other sum.

      ss.4.6. Capital Adequacy. If any present or future law, governmental rule,
regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) or the interpretation thereof by a court or governmental authority with
appropriate jurisdiction affects the amount of capital required or expected to
be maintained by banks or bank holding companies and any Lender or the Agent
determines that the amount of capital required to be maintained by it is
increased by or based upon the existence of the Loans made or deemed to be made
pursuant hereto, then such Lender or the Agent may notify the Borrower of such
fact, and the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or the Agent from time to time
on demand, as an additional fee payable hereunder, such amount as such Lender or

                                      -18-

<PAGE>


the Agent shall determine in good faith and certify in a notice to the Borrower
to be an amount that will adequately compensate such Lender or the Agent in
light of these circumstances for its increased costs of maintaining such
capital. Each Lender and the Agent shall allocate such cost increases among its
customers in good faith and on an equitable basis.

      ss.4.7. Certificate. A certificate setting forth any additional amounts
payable pursuant to ss.ss.4.5 or 4.6 and a brief explanation of such amounts
which are due, submitted by any Lender or the Agent to the Borrower, shall be
prima facie evidence that such amounts are due and owing.

      ss.4.8. Indemnity. In addition to the other provisions of this Agreement
regarding any such matters, the Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to
hold each Lender harmless from and against any loss, cost or reasonable expense
(including loss of anticipated profits) that such Lender may sustain or incur as
a consequence of (a) a default by the Borrower in payment of the principal
amount of or any interest on any LIBOR Loans as and when due and payable,
including any such loss or expense caused by Borrower's breach or other default
and arising from interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds
obtained by it in order to maintain its LIBOR Loans, (b) a default by the
Borrower in making a borrowing or conversion after the Borrower has given (or is
deemed to have given) a Conversion Request, (c) the making of any payment of a
LIBOR Loan or the making of any conversion of a LIBOR Loan to a Prime Rate Loan
on a day that is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period with respect
thereto, including interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds
obtained by it in order to maintain any such LIBOR Loan and (d) any failure by
the Borrower to prepay a LIBOR Loan on the date specified in a prepayment notice
given by the Borrower.

      ss.4.9. Default Interest and Late Charges. During any period when an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, or after the Maturity Date or after
judgment has been rendered on any Note, Borrower's right to select LIBOR Loans
shall cease and the unpaid principal of all Loans shall, at the option of each
Lender bear interest at a rate which is four (4) percentage points per annum
greater than that which would otherwise be applicable to Prime Rate Loans. If
the entire amount of any required principal and/or interest is not paid in full
within ten (10) days after the same is due, Borrower shall pay to the Agent a
late fee equal to five percent (5%) of the required payment.

      ss.4.10. Inability to Determine LIBOR Rate. In the event, prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period relating to any LIBOR Loan, the Agent shall
reasonably determine that adequate and reasonable methods do not exist for
ascertaining the LIBOR Rate that would otherwise determine the rate of interest
to be applicable to any LIBOR Loan during any Interest Period, the Agent shall
forthwith give notice of such determination (which shall be conclusive and
binding on the Borrower) to the Borrower. In such event (a) any Conversion
Request with respect to LIBOR Loans shall be automatically withdrawn and shall
be deemed a request for Prime Rate Loans, (b) each LIBOR Loan will
automatically, on the last day of the then current Interest Period thereof,
become a Prime Rate Loan, and (c) the obligations of the Lenders to make LIBOR
Loans shall be suspended until the Agent reasonably determines that the
circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, whereupon the
Agent shall so notify the Borrower.

                                      -19-

<PAGE>


      ss.4.11. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, if any
present or future law, regulation, treaty or directive or in the interpretation
or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain
LIBOR Loans, such Lender shall forthwith give notice of such circumstances to
the Borrower and thereupon (a) the Commitment of such Lender to make LIBOR Loans
or convert Loans of another Type to LIBOR Loans shall forthwith be suspended and
(b) the LIBOR Loans then outstanding shall be converted automatically to Prime
Rate Loans on the last day of each Interest Period applicable to such LIBOR
Loans or within such earlier period as may be required by law. The Borrower
hereby agrees promptly to pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, upon
demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for any costs
incurred by such Lender in making any conversion in accordance with this
ss.4.11, including any interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of
funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its LIBOR Loans hereunder. If,
at any time, the rate of interest, together with all amounts which constitute
interest and which are reserved, charged or taken by the Lenders as compensation
for fees, services or expenses incidental to the making, negotiating or
collection of the Loans or the other Obligations, shall he deemed by any
competent court of law, governmental agency or tribunal to exceed the maximum
rate of interest permitted to be charged by any Lender to Borrower under
applicable law, then, during such time as such rate of interest would be deemed
excessive, that portion of each sum paid attributable to that portion of such
interest rate that exceeds the maximum rate of interest so permitted shall be
deemed a voluntary prepayment of principal without penalty (including, without
limitation, prepayment fees required pursuant to Section 3.3(a) hereof). As used
herein, the term "applicable law" shall mean the law in effect as of the date
hereof, provided, however, that in the event there is a change in the law which
results in a higher permissible rate of interest, then this Agreement and the
Notes shall be governed by such new law as of its effective date.


ss.5. COLLATERAL SECURITY; NO LIMITATION ON RECOURSE.

      ss.5.1. Collateral Security. The Obligations shall be secured by a
perfected first priority pledge and security interest to be held by the Agent in
the Pledged Interests and the proceeds thereof pursuant to the terms of the
Security Documents.

      ss.5.2. No Limitation on Recourse. Notwithstanding the foregoing
Collateral, the Obligations are full recourse obligations of the Borrower and
all of its Real Estate Assets and other properties shall be available for the
indefeasible payment in full in cash and performance of the Obligations.

      ss.5.3. Approval of Transactions Affecting Collateral Value . Without the
prior approval of the Agent and all Lenders the Borrower will not, and the
Borrower will not permit any Mortgagor to, enter into any transaction which
would reduce the value of the Pledged Interests including, without limitation,
any refinancing or increase in the principal amount of any Mortgage Debt, any
sale of any interest in a Mortgaged Property by a Mortgagor, or any sale,
transfer or issuance of any stock or other ownership interests in a Mortgagor.

                                      -20-

<PAGE>


      ss.5.4. Additional Pledged Interests. Following the Closing Date Borrower
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to create additional Pledged Interests
with respect to Borrower's stock in each of the Related Companies listed on
Schedule 1.3 as soon as is reasonably possible. It shall review the loan
documents related to all Indebtedness of each Related Company and to the extent
that such loan documents do not prohibit the pledging of the stock of the
Related Company the Borrower shall, upon request from the Agent, execute and
deliver a Pledge Agreement with respect thereto. To the extent requested by the
Agent Borrower shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain consents or
waivers from the holders of any loan documents that prohibit such pledges or
that require the lender's consent thereto, and to the extent successful in doing
so, shall execute and deliver a Pledge Agreement with respect to the applicable
stock. If despite such commercially reasonable efforts, Borrower is unable to
obtain such necessary consents or waivers, such circumstance shall not
constitute an Event of Default hereunder. Each additional Pledge Agreement
executed pursuant to this ss.5.4 shall be accompanied by the original stock
certificates, stock powers and such supporting certificates or documents as the
Agent may reasonably request, including, without limitation, those items
described in ss.10 relating to the Mortgagors, the Mortgaged Properties or the
Mortgage Debt Documents. Upon the creation of each additional Pledged Interest
the applicable Schedules hereof shall be updated to reflect the same.

delivery by all other parties thereto, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Borrower is or is to become

hereto, there are no actions, suits, proceedings or investigations of any kind
pending or, to Borrower's knowledge, threatened against the Borrower or any of

board that, if adversely determined, might, either in any case or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or materially impair the right of the
Borrower or any of the Related Companies to carry on business substantially as
now conducted by it, or result in any material liability not adequately covered
by insurance, or for which adequate reserves are not maintained on the balance
sheet of the Borrower.

      ss.6.8. No Materially Adverse Contracts, Etc. The Borrower is not subject
to any charter, trust or other legal restriction, or any judgment, decree,

material term, covenant or agreement contained in any agreement by which it is
bound, evidencing or securing Indebtedness for such period of time as would
permit (assuming the giving of appropriate notice if required) the holder or
holders thereof or of any obligations issued thereunder to accelerate the
maturity thereof, and in any event, such failure shall continue for thirty (30)
days, unless the aggregate amount of all such defaulted Indebtedness plus the
amount of any unsatisfied judgments described in paragraph (i) of this ss.12.1
is less than $5,000,000.00;

                (g) any of the Borrower, any of the Related Companies or any
Controlled Unconsolidated Entity shall make an assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or admit in writing its inability to pay or generally fail to pay its
debts as they mature or become due, or shall petition or apply for the
appointment of a trustee or other custodian, liquidator or receiver of any
substantial part of its properties or shall commence any case or other
proceeding under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency,
readjustment of debt, dissolution or liquidation or similar law of any
jurisdiction, now or hereafter in effect, or shall take any action to authorize
or in furtherance of any of the foregoing, or if any such petition or
application shall be filed or any such case or other proceeding shall be
commenced against any such Person and such Person shall indicate its approval
thereof, consent thereto or acquiescence therein;

                (h) a decree or order is entered appointing any such trustee,
custodian, liquidator or receiver or adjudicating the Borrower, any of the
Related Companies or any Controlled Unconsolidated Entity bankrupt or insolvent,

judgments, undischarged, against the Borrower plus the amount of any defaulted
Indebtedness under paragraph (f) of this ss.12.1, exceeds in the aggregate
$5,000,000.00;

                (j) if any of the Loan Documents or any material provision of
any Loan Documents shall be unenforceable, cancelled, terminated, revoked or
rescinded otherwise than in accordance with the terms thereof or with the
express prior written agreement, consent or approval of the Agent, or any action
at law, suit or in equity or other legal proceeding to make unenforceable,
cancel, revoke or rescind any of the Loan Documents shall be commenced by or on
behalf of the Borrower, or any court or any other governmental or regulatory
authority or agency of competent jurisdiction shall make a determination that,
or issue a judgment, order, decree or ruling to the effect that, any one or more
of the Loan Documents is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with
the terms thereof;

                (k) the Borrower, any of the Related Companies or any Controlled
Unconsolidated Entity shall be indicted for a federal crime, a punishment for
which could include the forfeiture of any assets of the Borrower;

                (l) the Borrower shall fail to pay, observe or perform any term,
covenant, condition or agreement contained in any agreement, document or
instrument evidencing, securing or otherwise relating to any Indebtedness of the
Borrower to any Lender (other than the Obligations) and/or relating to any
Permitted Lien (other than the Obligations) within any applicable period of
grace provided for in such agreement, document or instrument;

                                      -44-

<PAGE>


                (m) if a Major Lease shall be cancelled or terminated otherwise
than with the express prior written agreement, consent or approval of the Agent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;

                (n) any "Event of Default", as defined in any of the other Loan
Documents, shall occur; or

                (o) Any two or more of William Atkins, Charles Knight and John
Greenman shall cease to be a senior executive officer of the Borrower and the
Board of Directors of the Borrower shall not, within six months thereafter, hire

Lender having the right to approve or disapprove any proposed successor in its
sole reasonable discretion;

                (p) a Change of Control shall occur without the prior written
consent of all Lenders;

                (q) any "Event of Default" as defined in the Revolving Credit

may, and upon the request of the Majority Lenders shall, by notice in writing to
the Borrower declare all amounts owing with respect to this Agreement, the Notes
and the other Loan Documents to be, and they shall thereupon forthwith become,
immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice
of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower; provided
that in the event of any Event of Default specified in ss.ss.12.1(g) or 12.1(h),
all such amounts shall become immediately due and payable automatically and
without any requirement of notice from the Agent or action by the Majority
Lenders.


      ss.12.2. Remedies. In case any one or more of the Events of Default shall
have occurred, and whether or not the Lenders shall have accelerated the
maturity of the Loans pursuant to ss.12.1, each Lender, if owed any amount with
respect to the Loans, may, with the consent of the Majority Lenders, direct the
Agent to proceed to protect and enforce the rights and remedies of the Agent and
the Lenders under this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents
by suit in equity, action at law or other appropriate proceeding, whether for
the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any instrument pursuant to which the
obligations are evidenced, including to the full extent permitted by applicable
law the obtaining of the ex parte appointment of a receiver and, if any amount
shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, to proceed to enforce the
payment thereof or any other legal or equitable right of such Lender. No remedy
herein conferred upon any Lender or the Agent or the holder of any Note is
intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every remedy shall be
cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now
or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or any other provision
of law.

      ss.12.3. Distribution of Collateral Proceeds. In the event that, during
the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, the Agent or any Lender as
the case may be, receives any monies in connection with the enforcement of any

                                      -45-

<PAGE>


of the Security Documents, or otherwise with respect to the realization upon any
of the Collateral, such monies shall be distributed for application as follows:

               (a) First, to the payment of, or (as the case may be) the
reimbursement of the Agent for or in respect of all reasonable costs, expenses,
disbursements and losses which shall have been incurred or sustained by the
Agent in connection with the collection of such monies by the Agent, for the
exercise, protection or enforcement by the Agent of all or any of the rights,
remedies, powers and privileges of the Agent or the Lenders under this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents or in respect of the Collateral or in support
of any provision of adequate indemnity to the Agent against any taxes or liens
which by law shall have, or may have, priority over the rights of the Agent to
such monies;

               (b) Second, to all other Obligations in such order or preference
as the Majority Lenders may determine; provided, however, that distribution in
respect of such Obligations shall be made among the Lenders pro rata in
accordance with each Lender's respective Facility Percentage; and provided,
further, that the Agent may in its discretion make proper allowance to take into
account any Obligations not then due and payable;

               (c) Third, upon payment and satisfaction in full or other
provisions for payment in full satisfactory to the Lenders and the Agent of all
of the obligations, and to the payment of any obligations required to be paid
pursuant to applicable laws applicable to such enforcement; and

               (d) Fourth, the excess, if any, shall be returned to the Borrower
or to such other Persons as are legally entitled thereto.


ss.13. SETOFF. Borrower hereby grants to each Lender, a continuing lien,
security interest and right of setoff as security for all liabilities and
obligations to such Lender hereunder, whether now existing or hereafter arising,
upon and against all deposits, credits, collateral and property, now or
hereafter in the possession, custody, safekeeping or control of such Lender or
in transit to it. At any time, without demand or notice (any such notice being
expressly waived by Borrower), any Lender may, WITH THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE
AGENT, setoff the same or any part thereof and apply the same to any liability
or obligation of Borrower hereunder even though unmatured and regardless of the
adequacy of any other collateral securing the Obligations. ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO
REQUIRE ANY LENDER TO EXERCISE ITS RIGHTS OR REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER
COLLATERAL WHICH SECURES THE OBLIGATIONS, PRIOR TO EXERCISING ITS RIGHT OF
SETOFF WITH RESPECT TO SUCH DEPOSITS, CREDITS OR OTHER PROPERTY OF BORROWER, ARE
HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVED. Each of the Lenders agrees
with each other Lender that (a) if an amount to be set off is to be applied to
Indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender, other than Indebtedness evidenced
by the Notes held by such Lender, such amount shall be applied ratably to such
other Indebtedness and to the Indebtedness evidenced by all such Notes held by
such Lender, and (b) if such Lender shall receive from the Borrower, whether by
voluntary payment, exercise of the right of setoff, counterclaim, cross action,
enforcement of the claim evidenced by the Notes held by such Lender by

                                      -46-

<PAGE>


proceedings against the Borrower at law or in equity or by proof thereof in
bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, receivership or similar proceedings, or
otherwise, and shall retain and apply to the payment of the Note or Notes held
by such Lender any amount in excess of its ratable portion of the payments
received by all of the Lenders with respect to the Notes held by all of the
Lenders, such Lender will make such disposition and arrangements with the other
Lenders with respect to such excess, either by way of distribution, pro tanto
assignment of claims, subrogation or otherwise as shall result in each Lender
receiving in respect of the Notes held by it its proportionate payment as
contemplated by this Agreement; provided that if all or any part of such excess
payment is thereafter recovered from such Lender, such disposition and
arrangements shall be rescinded and the amount restored to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall
exercise a right of setoff if such exercise would limit or prevent the exercise
of any other remedy, right to Collateral or other recourse against the Borrower.

ss.14. THE AGENT.

       ss.14.1. Authorization. The Agent is authorized to take such action on
behalf of each of the Lenders and to exercise all such powers as are hereunder
and under any of the other Loan Documents and any related documents delegated to
the Agent, together with such powers as are reasonably incident thereto,
provided that no duties or responsibilities not expressly assumed herein or
therein shall be implied to have been assumed by the Agent. The relationship
between the Agent and the Lenders is and shall be that of agent and principal
only, and nothing contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
shall be construed to constitute the Agent as a trustee for any Lender.

       ss.14.2. Employees and Agents. The Agent may exercise its powers and
execute its duties by or through employees or agents and shall be entitled to
take, and to rely on, advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to its
rights and duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Agent
may utilize the services of such Persons as the Agent in its sole discretion may
reasonably determine, and all reasonable fees and expenses of any such Persons
shall be paid by the Borrower.

       ss.14.3. No Liability. Neither the Agent nor any of its shareholders,
directors, officers or employees nor any other Person assisting them in their
duties nor any agent or employee thereof, shall be liable for any waiver,
consent or approval given or any action taken, or omitted to be taken, in good
faith by it or them hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, or in
connection herewith or therewith, or be responsible for the consequences of any
oversight or error of judgment whatsoever, except that the Agent or such other
Person, as the case may be, may be liable for losses due to its willful
misconduct or gross negligence.

       ss.14.4. No Representations. The Agent shall not be responsible for the
execution or validity or enforceability by or against Borrower of this
Agreement, the Notes, any of the other Loan Documents or any instrument at any
time constituting, or intended to constitute, collateral security for the Notes,
or for the value of any such collateral security or for the validity,
enforceability or collectability of any such amounts owing with respect to the
Notes, or for any recitals or statements, warranties or representations made
herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or in any certificate or instrument
hereafter furnished to it by or on behalf of the Borrower, or be bound to

                                      -47-

<PAGE>


ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms,
conditions, covenants or agreements herein or in any instrument at any time
constituting, or intended to constitute, collateral security for the Notes. The
Agent shall not be bound to ascertain whether any notice, consent, waiver or
request delivered to it by the Borrower or any holder of any of the Notes shall
have been duly authorized or is true, accurate and complete. The Agent has not
made nor does it now make any representations or warranties, express or implied,
nor does it assume any liability to the Lenders, with respect to the credit
worthiness or financial condition of the Borrower. Each Lender acknowledges that
it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender,
and based upon such information and documents as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Agent's
counsel has only represented Agent and FNB in connection with the Loan Documents
and the only attorney-client relationship or duty of care is between Agent's
counsel and Agent or FNB. Each Lender has been independently represented by
separate counsel on all matters regarding the Loan Documents and the granting
and perfecting of liens in the Collateral.

      ss.14.5. Payments.

               (a) A payment by the Borrower to the Agent hereunder or any of
the other Loan Documents for the account of any Lender shall constitute a
payment to such Lender subject to the pro rata rights to repayment based upon
the Facility Percentage of each Lender. The Agent agrees promptly to distribute
to each Lender such Lender's pro rata share of payments received by the Agent
for the account of the Lenders except as otherwise expressly provided herein or
in any of the other Loan Documents.

               (b) If in the opinion of the Agent the distribution of any amount
received by it in such capacity hereunder, under the Notes or under any of the
other Loan Documents might involve it in liability, it may refrain from making
distribution until its right to make distribution shall have been adjudicated by
a court of competent jurisdiction. If a court of competent jurisdiction shall
adjudge that any amount received and distributed by the Agent is to be repaid,
each Person to whom any such distribution shall have been made shall either
repay to the Agent its proportionate share of the amount so adjudged to be
repaid or shall pay over the same in such manner and to such Persons as shall be
determined by such court.

               (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, any Lender that fails (i) to make
available to the Agent its pro rata share of any Loan or (ii) to comply with the
provisions of ss.12 and ss.13 with respect to making dispositions and
arrangements with the other Lenders, where such Lender's share of any payment
received, whether by setoff or otherwise, is in excess of its pro rata share of
such payments due and payable to all of the Lenders, in each case as, when and
to the full extent required by the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
delinquent (a "Delinquent Lender") and shall be deemed a Delinquent Lender until
such time as such delinquency is satisfied. A Delinquent Lender shall be deemed
to have assigned any and all payments due to it from the Borrower, whether on
account of outstanding Loans, interest, fees or otherwise, to the remaining
nondelinquent Lenders for application to, and reduction of, their respective pro
rata shares of all outstanding Loans. The Delinquent Lender hereby authorizes
the Agent to distribute such payments to the nondelinquent Lenders in proportion
to their respective pro rata shares of all outstanding Loans. A Delinquent

                                      -48-

<PAGE>


Lender shall be deemed to have satisfied in full a delinquency when and if, as a
result of application of the assigned payments to all outstanding Loans of the
nondelinquent Lenders, the Lenders respective pro rata shares of all outstanding
Loans have returned to those in effect immediately prior to such delinquency and
without giving effect to the nonpayment causing such delinquency.

      ss.14.6. Holders of Notes. The Agent may deem and treat the payee of any
Note as the absolute owner or purchaser thereof for all purposes hereof until it
shall have been furnished in writing with a different name by such payee or by a
subsequent holder assignee or transferee.

      ss.14.7. Indemnity. The Lenders ratably agree hereby to indemnify and hold
harmless the Agent from and against any and all claims, actions and suits
(whether groundless or otherwise), losses, damages, costs, expenses (including
any expenses for which the Agent has not been reimbursed by the Borrower as
required by ss.15), and liabilities of every nature and character arising out of
or related to this Agreement, the Notes, or any of the other Loan Documents or
the transactions contemplated or evidenced hereby or thereby, or the Agent's
actions taken hereunder or thereunder, except to the extent that any of the same
shall be directly caused by the Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence.

      ss.14.8. Agent as Lender. In its individual capacity, FNB shall have the
same obligations and the same rights, powers and privileges in respect to its
Commitment and the Loans made by it, and as the holder of any of the Notes as it
would have were it not also the Agent.

      ss.14.9. Resignation and Removal. The Agent may resign at any time by
giving sixty (60) days, prior written notice thereof to the Lenders and the
Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Majority Lenders shall have the right
to appoint a successor Agent. Unless a Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, appointment of such successor Agent shall be subject
to the reasonable approval of the Borrower. If no successor Agent shall have
been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within thirty (30) days after the giving of notice of resignation or
removal of the Borrower has disapproved or failed to approve a successor agent
within such period, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders,
appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a financial institution having a
rating of not less than A2/P2 or its equivalent by Standard & Poor's
Corporation. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a
successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent,
and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. After any retiring Agent's resignation, the provisions of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall continue in effect for its benefit
in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting
as Agent.

      ss.14.10. Notification of Defaults and Events of Default. Each Lender
hereby agrees that, upon learning of the existence of a Default or an Event of
Default, it shall promptly notify the Agent thereof. The Agent hereby agrees
that upon receipt of any notice under this ss.14.10 it shall promptly notify the
other Lenders of the existence of such Default or Event of Default.

                                      -49-

<PAGE>


      ss.14.11. Duties in the Case of Enforcement. In case one of more Events of
Default have occurred and shall be continuing, and whether or not acceleration
of the obligations shall have occurred, the Agent shall, if (a) so requested by
the Majority Lenders and (b) the Lenders have provided to the Agent such
additional indemnities and assurances against expenses and liabilities as the
Agent may reasonably request, proceed to enforce the provisions of the Security
Documents authorizing the sale or other disposition of all or any part of the
Collateral and exercise all or any such other legal and equitable and other
rights or remedies as it may have in respect of such Collateral. The Majority
Lenders may direct the Agent in writing as to the method and the extent of any
such sale or other disposition, the Lenders hereby agreeing to indemnify and
hold the Agent harmless from all liabilities incurred in respect of all actions
taken or omitted in accordance with such directions, provided that the Agent
need not comply with any such direction to the extent that the Agent reasonably
believes the Agent's compliance with such direction to be unlawful or
commercially unreasonable in any applicable jurisdiction. The Agent may take
such steps as it reasonably determines for the taking of possession or title to
any Collateral, including the formation of trusts, limited liability companies
or corporations with each Lender having a beneficial interest equal to its pro
rata percentage of the outstanding Loans.

ss.15. EXPENSES. The Borrower agrees to pay (a) any taxes (including any
interest and penalties in respect thereto) payable by the Agent or any of the
Lenders (other than taxes based upon the Agent's or any Lender's net income),
including any recording, mortgage, documentary or intangibles taxes in
connection with the Security Documents and other Loan Documents, or other taxes
payable on or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any taxes payable by the Agent or any of the Lenders after the Closing
Date (the Borrower hereby agreeing to indemnify the Lenders with respect
thereto), (b) all recording costs and the reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of the Agent's counsel or any local counsel to the Agent incurred
in connection with the preparation, administration or interpretation of the Loan
Documents and other instruments mentioned herein, each closing hereunder, and
amendments, modifications, approvals, consents or waivers hereto or hereunder,
(c) the reasonable fees, costs, expenses and disbursements of the Agent incurred
in connection with the preparation, administration or interpretation of the Loan
Documents and other instruments mentioned herein including without limitation,
the costs incurred by the Agent in connection with its inspection of the
Mortgaged Properties, (d) the fees, costs, expenses and disbursements of the
Agent incurred in connection with the syndication and/or participation of the
Loans, (e) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs, which attorneys may be employees of any Lender or the
Agent and the fees and costs of appraisers, engineers, investment bankers,
surveyors or other experts retained by the Agent or any Lender in connection
with any such enforcement proceedings) incurred by any Lender or the Agent in
connection with (i) the enforcement of or preservation of rights under any of
the Loan Documents against the Borrower or the administration thereof after the
occurrence of a Default or Event of Default (including, without limitation,
expenses incurred in any restructuring and/or "workout" of the Loans), and (ii)
any litigation, proceeding or dispute whether arising hereunder or otherwise, in
any way related to the Agent's or the Lender's relationship with the Borrower,
any Controlled Unconsolidated Entity or any of the Related Companies, (f) all
reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of the Agent incurred in connection
with UCC searches, UCC filings or mortgage recordings, (g) all reasonable costs
incurred by the Agent in the future in connection with its inspection of the

                                      -50-

<PAGE>


Mortgaged Properties, and (h) the reasonable fees, costs, expenses and
disbursements of the Agent incurred in connection with the granting of
additional Collateral by the Borrower pursuant to ss.5.3 or ss.12.5 hereof,
including, without limitation, the costs incurred by the Agent in connection
with its inspection of such additional Collateral, and the fees and
disbursements of the Agent's counsel. The covenants of this ss.15 shall survive
payment or satisfaction of payment of amounts owing with respect to the Notes.

ss.16. INDEMNIFICATION. The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Agent and the Lenders and the shareholders, directors, agents, officers,
subsidiaries, and affiliates of the Agent and the Lenders from and against any
and all claims, actions or causes of action and suits whether groundless or
otherwise, and from and against any and all Liabilities, losses, settlement
payments, obligations, damages and expenses of every nature and character
arising out of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or which otherwise arise in connection with the
financing including, without limitation except to the extent caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of a Lender or the Agent (but such limitation
on indemnification shall only apply to the Agent or Lender that is being grossly
negligent or committing willful misconduct), (a) any actual or proposed use by
the Borrower of the proceeds of any of the Loans, (b) any actual or alleged
infringement of any patent, copyright, trademark, service mark or similar right
of the Borrower comprised in the Collateral, (c) the Borrower entering into or
performing this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or (d) with respect
to the Borrower and its respective properties, the violation of any
Environmental Law, the Release or threatened Release of any Hazardous Substances
or any action, suit, proceeding or investigation brought or threatened with
respect to any Hazardous Substances (including, but not limited to claims with
respect to wrongful death, personal injury or damage to property), (e) any cost,
claim liability, damage or expense in connection with any harm the Borrower may
be found to have caused in the role of a broker, in each case including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs
of internal counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation,
litigation or other proceeding. In litigation, or the preparation therefor, the
Lenders and the Agent shall each be entitled to select their own separate
counsel and, in addition to the foregoing indemnity, the Borrower agrees to pay
promptly the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. If, and to the extent
that the obligations of the Borrower under this ss.16 are unenforceable for any
reason, the Borrower hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the
payment in satisfaction of such obligations which is permissible under
applicable law. The provisions of this ss.16 shall survive the repayment of the
Loans and the termination of the obligations of the Lenders hereunder and shall
continue in full force and effect as to the Lenders so long as the possibility
of any such claim, action, cause of action or suit exists under applicable law,
rule or regulation.

ss.17. SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS, ETC. All covenants, agreements, representations
and warranties made herein, in the Notes, in any of the other Loan Documents or
in any documents or other papers delivered by or on behalf of the Borrower
pursuant hereto shall be deemed to have been relied upon by the Lenders and the
Agent, notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or hereafter made by it, and
shall survive the making by the Lenders of the Loans, as herein contemplated,
and shall continue in full force and effect so long as any amount due under this
Agreement or the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents remains outstanding or
the Lenders have any obligation to make any Loans. The indemnification

                                      -51-

<PAGE>


obligations of the Borrower provided herein and the other Loan Documents shall
survive the full repayment of amounts due and the termination of the obligations
of the Lenders hereunder and thereunder to the extent provided herein and
therein. All statements contained in any certificate delivered to the Agent or
any Lender at any time executed on behalf of the Borrower or a Mortgagor
pursuant hereto or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall
constitute representations and warranties by the Borrower hereunder.

ss.18. ASSIGNMENT; PARTICIPATIONS; ETC.

       ss.18.1. Conditions to Assignment by Lenders. Except as provided herein,
each Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its
interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Facility Percentage and the same portion of the Loans at the time
owing to it, and the Notes held by it); provided that (a) the Agent shall have
given its prior written consent to such assignment except that such consent
shall not be needed with respect to an assignment from a Lender to one of its
Affiliated Lenders, (b) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a
varying, percentage of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, (c) each assignment shall be in an amount of not less than
$1,000,000 that is a whole multiple of $1,000,000, (d) each Lender shall either
assign its entire Commitment or shall retain, free of any such assignment, an
amount of its Commitment of not less $1,000,000 and (e) the parties to such
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for recording in the Register
(as hereinafter defined), an Assignment and Acceptance, substantially in the
form of Exhibit D hereto (an "Assignment and Acceptance") , together with any
Notes subject to such assignment. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and
recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
Acceptance, which effective date shall be at least five (5) Business Days after
the execution thereof, (i) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and,
to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and
obligations of a Lender hereunder, and (ii) the assigning Lender shall, to the
extent provided in such assignment and upon payment to the Agent of the
registration fee referred to in ss.18.3, be released from its obligations under
this Agreement.

       ss.18.2. Certain Representations and Warranties; Limitations; Covenants.
By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the parties to the
assignment thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties
hereto as follows: (a) other than the representation and warranty that it is the

of any adverse claim, the assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty

Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial statements referred
to in ss.6.4 and ss.7.4 and such other documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into
such Assignment and Acceptance; (d) such assignee will, independently and

taking action under this Agreement, (e) such assignee represents and warrants
that it is an Eligible Assignee; (f) such assignee appoints and authorizes the

under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to the Agent
by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto; (g) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance
with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are
required to be performed by it as a Lender; and (h) such assignee represents and
warrants that it is legally authorized to enter into such Assignment and

       ss.18.3. Register. The Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and
Acceptance delivered to it and a register or similar list (the "Register") for
the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Facility
Percentages of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to the Lenders from time
to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of
manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Borrower and the Lenders at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice. Upon each such recordation, the assigning Lender agrees
to pay to the Agent a registration fee in the sum of $3,000.00. The Agent may
amend Schedules 1 and 1.2 hereof to reflect the recording of any such
assignments.

       ss.18.4. New Notes. Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance
executed by the parties to such assignment, together with each Note subject to
such assignment, the Agent shall (a) record the information contained therein in
the Register, and (b) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders
(other than the assigning Lender). Within five (5) Business Days after receipt
of such notice, the Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to
the Agent, in exchange for each surrendered Note, a new Note to the order of
such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the amount assumed by such Eligible
Assignee pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender
has retained some portion of its Loans hereunder, a new Note to the order of the
assigning Lender in an amount equal to the amount retained by it hereunder. Such
new Notes shall provide that they are replacements for the surrendered Notes and
that they do not constitute a novation, shall be in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the surrendered Notes, shall
be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall
otherwise be in substantially the form of the assigned Notes. Within five (5)
days of issuance of any new Notes pursuant to this ss.18.4, the Borrower shall
deliver an opinion of counsel, addressed to the Lenders and the Agent, relating
to the due authorization, execution and delivery of such new Notes and the
legality, validity and binding non-preferential effect thereof, and that the
Obligations evidenced by the new Notes are secured by the Collateral with the
same validity, enforceability and priority as if given on the Closing Date, in
form and substance satisfactory to the Lenders. The surrendered Notes shall be
cancelled and returned to the Borrower.

consent, (b) each such participation shall be in an amount of not less than
$1,000,000 that is a whole multiple of $1,000,000, (c) any such sale or
participation shall not affect the rights and duties of the selling Lender
hereunder to the Borrower and the Lender shall continue to exercise all
approvals, disapprovals and other functions of a Lender, (d) the only rights
granted to the participant pursuant to such participation arrangements with
respect to waivers, amendments or modifications of the Loan Documents shall be

modifications that would reduce the principal of or the interest rate on any
Loans, extend the term or increase the amount of the Commitment of such Lender
as it relates to such participant, reduce the amount of any fees to which such
participant is entitled or extend any regularly scheduled payment date for
principal or interest, provided that all approvals affecting a Loan or this
Agreement under this clause (d) shall be by a fifty-one percent (51%) vote of
such Lender's Facility Percentage, and (e) no participant shall have the right
to grant further participations or assign its rights, obligations or interests
under such participation to other Persons without the prior written consent of

                                    ---------

                          Compliance Certificate under
                Term Loan Agreement dated as of February 6, 2003

     The undersigned, a Responsible Officer of AMERIVEST PROPERTIES INC. (the
"Borrower"), hereby certifies on behalf of the Borrower as of the date hereof
the following:

     1. No Defaults. I have read a copy of the Term Loan Agreement dated as of
February 6, 2003 (the "Term Loan Agreement") among the Borrower, Fleet National
Bank, the other lending institutions party thereto, and Fleet National Bank, as
Agent. Terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings set forth in ss.1.1 of the Term Loan Agreement. No Event of Default is
continuing in the performance or observance of any of the covenants, terms or
provisions of the Term Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Borrower has not taken any actions which are
prohibited by the negative covenants set forth in ss.8 of the Term Loan
Agreement. Attached hereto as Appendix I are all relevant calculations needed to
determine whether the Borrower is in compliance with ss.9.1 through ss.9.6,
inclusive, and ss.8.3(d) of the Term Loan Agreement as of the end of the most
recently completed fiscal quarter (except that in the case of Compliance
Certificates delivered pursuant to ss.8.1(f), ss.8.4(c), or ss.11.1, the
calculations determining compliance with ss.9.3 have been computed on a pro
forma basis after giving effect to the proposed transaction) and is in
compliance with ss.8.7 of the Term Loan Agreement for the most recently
completed fiscal year.

     2. No Material Changes, Etc. Except as disclosed on Appendix II hereto,
since the [date of most recent financial statements furnished to the Agent and
the Lenders], there have occurred no materially adverse changes in the financial
condition or business of the Borrower as shown on or reflected in the balance
sheet of the Borrower as at such date other than (a) changes in the ordinary
course of business that have not had any materially adverse effect either
individually or in the aggregate on the business or financial condition of the
Borrower and (b) changes resulting from the making of the Loans and the
transactions contemplated by the Term Loan Agreement.

     3. No Materially Adverse Contracts, Etc. The Borrower is not subject to any
charter, corporate, or other legal restriction, or any judgment, decree, order,
rule or regulation that has or is expected, in the reasonable judgment of the
Borrower 's officers, in the future to have a materially adverse effect on the
Borrower or the Collateral. The Borrower is not a party to any contract or
agreement that has or is expected, in the reasonable judgment of the Borrower 's
officers, to have a materially adverse effect on the Borrower or the Collateral.

Date:
