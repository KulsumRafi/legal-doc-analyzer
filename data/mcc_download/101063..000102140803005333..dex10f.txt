                                    Preamble

BAW is Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Atlanta AG, Breitenweg 29-33,
D-28195 Bremen (hereinafter referred to as "Atlanta"). BAW holds a limited
partnership interest of 1.021 Mio. (euro) in Scipio & Co. KG, Breitenweg 29-33,

general manager of Benedict & Co. GmbH, Breitenweg 29-33, 28195 Bremen
(hereinafter referred to as "Benedict"), which is the general partner of Scipio.
Scipio is the sole shareholder of Atlanta. ...

Chiquita intends to acquire the general partnership interest and all limited
partnership interests of Scipio and thereby control of the Scipio/Atlanta Group,
on a date most likely before the end of March 2003 ("Closing date"). ...

                                      (S) 1
                                     Scipio

1.   On the closing date BAW shall sell and assign his limited partnership
     interest in Scipio in the amount of 1.021 Mio. (euro) to Chiquita or an
     entity designated by Chiquita which accepts such sale and assignment. The
     purchase price shall be the nominal amount of the partnership interest. The
     purchase price shall be set off against a loan owed by Benedict to Atlanta
     in the capital amount of 765.750,00 (euro), so that the net amount to be
     paid to BAW shall be 1.021 Mio (euro) minus 765.750,00 (euro) and
     applicable interest.

2.   At the request of Chiquita BAW shall cause Benedict to sell and assign
