2.1       CLASS VPN LOANS BY THE LENDER

          Subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth, the
Lender hereby agrees to establish a facility (the "Facility") in the aggregate
maximum principal amount of $200

<PAGE>

                                      - 8 -

million (the "Maximum Principal Amount"). Subject to Article 3, the Facility may
be drawn down in up to 3 tranches commencing with the initial Class VPN Loan on
the Closing Date and subsequent Class VPN Loans on each Additional Drawdown
Date. No Class VPN Loan shall exceed, (a) in the case of the Initial Class VPN
Loan, $65 million, and (b) in the case of any other Class VPN Loan, the excess,
if any, of (i) the Outstanding Amount of the Class of Class A Notes having its
Targeted Final Payment Date immediately following the applicable Additional
Drawdown Date over (ii) the Total Noteholders' Principal Payment Amount for that
Targeted Final Payment Date calculated before giving effect to the Class VPN
Loan Proceeds to be received by the Borrower from the Lender pursuant to this
Agreement on the applicable Additional Drawdown Date. In addition, the aggregate
of all Class VPN Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed the Maximum
Principal Amount. The Borrower may only use the proceeds of a Class VPN Loan (x)
if advanced on the Closing Date, to partially fund the purchase of the Initial
Receivables and to provide amounts to be deposited to the Pre-Funding Account
and the Capitalized Interest Account, and (y) if advanced on any Additional
Drawdown Date, to repay principal on the Class A Notes due and payable on the
immediately following Targeted Final Payment Date.

2.2       DRAWDOWNS OF CLASS VPN LOANS

     (a)  The Initial Class VPN Loan in the principal amount of $65 million
          shall be drawn down in full on the Closing Date subject to the
          delivery by the Borrower to the Lender of a Loan Request on the
          Closing Date and the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set out
          in Article 3.

     (b)  If the Borrower is permitted to request or obtain additional Class VPN
          Loans pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.8 of the Sale and
          Servicing Agreement, the Borrower shall request that an additional
          Class VPN Loan be advanced on each Additional Drawdown Date by
          delivering a Loan Request to the Lender not less than 35 days or more
          than 45 days prior to such Additional Drawdown Date. The amount of the
          additional Class VPN Loan requested in a Loan Request shall be the
          amount the Borrower anticipates will be the amount required to make
          the Total Noteholders' Principal Payment Amount for the Targeted Final
          Payment Date following the relevant Additional Drawdown Date
          sufficient to repay the Outstanding Amount of the Class A Notes to be
          repaid on that Targeted Final Payment Date.

     (c)  If the Lender receives a Loan Request for additional Class VPN Loans,
          the Lender may, in its sole discretion, within 2 Business Days of such
          receipt, propose an Applicable Margin in respect of such additional
          Class VPN Loan by delivering written notice to the Borrower. The
          Borrower may, within 2 Business Days of receipt of such proposal,
          either accept such proposed Applicable Margin or counter-propose an
          alternative Applicable Margin in respect of such additional Class VPN
          Loan by delivering written notice to the Lender. If the Borrower
          elects to accept such proposed Applicable Margin or fails to respond
          to the Lender's proposal within 2 Business Days, then, subject to the
          satisfaction of the conditions precedent specified in Article 3, the
          Lender shall be obligated to make such Class VPN Loan on the relevant
          Additional Drawdown Date and the

<PAGE>

                                      - 9 -

          Applicable Margin shall be such proposed Applicable Margin. If the
          Borrower elects to counter-propose an alternative Applicable Margin,
          the Lender may, within 2 Business Days of receipt of such
          counter-proposal, accept or reject such counter-proposal by delivering
          written notice to the Borrower. In the event the counter-proposed
          alternative Applicable Margin is accepted by the Lender as specified
          above, then, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
          specified in Article 3, the Lender shall be obligated to make such
          Class VPN Loan on the relevant Additional Drawdown Date and the
          Applicable Margin shall be such counter-proposed alternative
          Applicable Margin. In the event that the Lender fails to deliver a
          proposal within 2 Business Days of receipt of a Loan Request or the
          Lender rejects or fails to accept a counter-proposal from the Borrower
          within 2 Business Days of the receipt thereof as contemplated above,
          the Lender shall be under no obligation to advance the relevant
          additional Class VPN Loan.

     (d)  If and only if the Lender (i) rejects or fails to accept any
          counter-proposal delivered by the Borrower or (ii) fails to deliver a
          proposal following receipt of a Loan Request, in each case in
          accordance with Section 2.2(c), the Borrower may enter into an
          agreement with any other Person for the provision of loans to the
          Borrower for the purpose of refinancing Class A Notes provided,
          however, that in the case of clause (i) only, the terms of any such
          loan in respect of pricing shall be no more favourable to any such
          Person than the terms proposed in the relevant Loan Request and this
          Agreement on the basis of an Applicable Margin as set out in the
          Borrower's counter-proposal.

     (e)  Each of the Lender and the Borrower shall use it's respective best
          efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent set out in Section 3.2 in
          respect of a Class VPN Loan over which it has control.

     (f)  The Borrower shall notify the Lender in writing on the Determination
          Date prior to each Additional Drawdown Date of the actual amount of
          the Class VPN Loan to be advanced.

2.3       INTEREST

          Interest shall accrue on each Class VPN Loan at the Loan Rate from day
to day during each Interest Period on the basis of a year of 365 days, and shall
be payable on each Monthly Payment Date in accordance with Section 2.5. Interest
shall continue to be payable to the Lender before and after default and
judgment, and interest shall accrue on overdue payments of interest or any other
amounts from day to day at the same rate and shall be immediately due and
payable. All interest shall be paid by the Borrower free and clear of, and
without deduction for, any Taxes of any kind whatsoever.

2.4       REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL

          and that Monthly Payment Date, (ii) the Noteholders' Principal
          Distributable Amount for the Class VPN Loans and that Monthly Payment
          Date, and (iii) the Additional Class VPN Loan Amounts for the Class

     (c)  On each Monthly Payment Date for the Class VPN Loans except during a
          Non-Sequential Amortization Period, the Lender shall, to the extent
          available, apply monies received from the Borrower in respect of each
          Class VPN Loan as follows:

the Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and AmeriCredit a certificate setting
forth its computation of such increased costs, amounts not received or
receivable, reduction in rate of return or required payment made or to be made,
which computation may utilize such averaging and attribution methods that the
Lender, acting reasonably, believes to be applicable. Upon receipt of such
certificate, AmeriCredit and the Borrower shall jointly and severally forthwith
pay to the Lender the amount of such increased costs, amounts not received or
receivable, or reduction in rate of return or required payment made or to be
made.

5.5       INDEMNITY

          The Borrower and AmeriCredit, on a joint and several basis, shall
indemnify the Lender for all losses (including lost profits), costs, expenses,
damages and liabilities (including, any loss, cost, expense, damage or liability
sustained by the Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-employment in
whole or in part of deposits or funds borrowed or acquired by it to make any
Class VPN Loan), which the Lender may sustain or incur: (i) if for any reason a
utilization does not occur on a date specified therefor in any Loan Request due
to any action or failure to act of the Borrower or AmeriCredit, or (ii) if the
Borrower or AmeriCredit fails to give any notice required to be given by it
hereunder, in the manner and at the time specified herein. A certificate of the
Lender setting forth the amounts necessary to indemnify the Lender in respect of
such losses, costs, expenses, damages or liabilities shall be prima facie
evidence of the amounts owing under this Section 5.5.

5.6       NO SET-OFF

          All payments to be made by or on behalf of the Borrower or AmeriCredit
hereunder shall be made without deduction, withholding, set-off or counterclaim.

5.7       PROSPECTUS RIGHTS

          AmeriCredit hereby grants to the Lender rights of action for any
"misrepresentation" (as such term is defined in the Securities Act (Ontario))
contained in the Prospectus as against the promoter, as if the Lender were a
purchaser of Offered Notes thereunder, and the Lender shall be deemed to have
relied upon such misrepresentation if it was a misrepresentation on the Closing
Date. The rights granted above shall be equivalent in all respects to the rights
of action provided in Section 130 of the Securities Act (Ontario) and described
in the Prospectus under the heading "Statutory Rights of Withdrawal and
Rescission", including with respect to defences available to any defendant and
remedies available to the plaintiff, provided that there shall be no limitation
on the amount of damages recoverable by the Lender pursuant to the exercise of
such rights except to the extent of amounts owing to the Lender hereunder. Each
of the Borrower and AmeriCredit acknowledges and agrees that the rights granted
herein shall be in addition to and without derogation from any other right or
remedy that the Lender may have against the Borrower or AmeriCredit at law or in
equity.

5.8       SURVIVAL

          The rights of the Lender under this Article 5 shall survive for a
period of 3 years following the earlier of (a) the Final Scheduled Payment Date,
and (b) the full and final repayment of all Class VPN Loans made hereunder.

          The trustee of the Lender, The Trust Company of Bank of Montreal (the
"Lender Trustee"), and the Securitization Agent and each of their respective
directors, officers, agents or employees, will not be subject to any liability
whatsoever, in tort, in contract or otherwise, in connection with the Lender's
property or activities, to the Lender's beneficiary or to any other person, for
any action taken or permitted by it to be taken, or its failure to take any
action including, the failure to compel in any way any former or acting trustee
of the Lender to redress any breach of trust in respect of the execution of the

                                     - 22 -

action or failure to act arising from or in connection with wilful misconduct or

conclusively deemed to be, acting as trustee of Lender and not in any other
capacity. Except as to the extent provided in this Section 7.9, the Lender

liability to, and does not act as agent in any capacity for, the Borrower or
AmeriCredit.

connection with the Borrower's property or activities, to the Borrower's
beneficiary or to any other person, for any action taken or permitted by it to
be taken, or its failure to take any action including, the failure to compel in
any way any former or acting trustee of the Borrower to redress any breach of
trust in respect of the execution of the duties of its office or in respect of
the Borrower's property or activities, provided that the foregoing limitation
will not apply in respect of action or failure to act arising from or in
connection with dishonesty, bad faith, wilful misconduct, gross negligence or
reckless disregard of a duty by the Borrower Trustee. The Borrower Trustee, in
doing anything or permitting anything to be done in respect of the execution of
the duties of its office or in respect of the Borrower's property or activities
is, and will be conclusively deemed to be, acting as trustee of Borrower and not
in any other capacity. Except to the extent provided in this Section 7.10, the
Borrower Trustee will not be subject to any liability for any debts,
liabilities, obligations, claims, demands, judgments, costs, charges or expenses
against or with respect to the Borrower, arising out of anything done or
permitted by it to be done or its failure to take any action in respect of the
execution of the duties of its office or for or in respect of the Borrower's
property or activities and resort will be had solely to the Borrower's property
for the payment or performance thereof. No property or assets of the Borrower
Trustee owned in its personal capacity or otherwise will be subject to levy,
execution or other enforcement procedure with regard to any obligation under
this Agreement.
